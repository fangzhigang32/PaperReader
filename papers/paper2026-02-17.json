    "abstract": "Large language models and LLM-based agents are increasingly used for cybersecurity tasks that are inherently dual-use. Existing approaches to refusal, spanning academic policy frameworks and commercially deployed systems, often rely on broad topic-based bans or offensive-focused taxonomies. As a result, they can yield inconsistent decisions, over-restrict legitimate defenders, and behave brittlely under obfuscation or request segmentation. We argue that effective refusal requires explicitly modeling the trade-off between offensive risk and defensive benefit, rather than relying solely on intent or offensive classification. In this paper, we introduce a content-based framework for designing and auditing cyber refusal policies that makes offense-defense tradeoffs explicit. The framework characterizes requests along five dimensions: Offensive Action Contribution, Offensive Risk, Technical Complexity, Defensive Benefit, and Expected Frequency for Legitimate Users, grounded in the technical substance of the request rather than stated intent. We demonstrate that this content-grounded approach resolves inconsistencies in current frontier model behavior and allows organizations to construct tunable, risk-aware refusal policies."

    "abstract": "A charged black hole can emit charged particles via two independent mechanisms: the Hawking radiation and the Schwinger effect, which are intertwined in the radiation spectrum. In this paper, we will show that the two effects can be distinguished by analyzing the entanglement entropy carried by the produced particle pairs. Explicitly, we apply the island formula to the near extremal Reissner-Nordstr{ö}m (RN) black hole to calculate the total entanglement entropy of the radiation. Meanwhile we use the heat kernel method to calculate the entanglement entropy of charged particle pairs produced solely from the Schwinger effect. By comparing with the total entanglement entropy, we obtain the entanglement entropy produced purely from the Hawking radiation. Consequently, the two effects are distinguishable in near extremal RN black holes after the Page time. Furthermore, we also employ the brick wall model and the Pauli-Villars regularization to derive the entanglement entropy from the Schwinger effect, which gives a slightly different result with that obtained from the heat kernel method."

However, existing systems have only been tested in-lab or in-home, leaving in-the-wild social dining contexts (e.g., restaurants) largely unexplored. Designing a robot for such contexts presents unique challenges, such as dynamic and unsupervised dining environments that a robot needs to account for and respond to. Through speculative participatory design with people with disabilities, supported by semi-structured interviews and a custom AI-based visual storyboarding tool, we uncovered ideal scenarios for in-the-wild social dining. Our key insight suggests that such systems should: embody the principles of a white glove service where the robot (1) supports multimodal inputs and unobtrusive outputs; (2) has contextually sensitive social behavior and prioritizes the user; (3) has expanded roles beyond feeding; (4) adapts to other relationships at the dining table. Our work has implications for in-the-wild and group contexts of robot-assisted feeding."

    "abstract": "Language models now routinely produce text that is difficult to distinguish from human writing, raising the need for robust tools to verify content provenance. Watermarking has emerged as a promising countermeasure, with existing work largely focused on model quality preservation and robust detection. However, current schemes provide limited protection against false attribution. We strengthen the notion of soundness by introducing two novel guarantees: unforgeability and recoverability. Unforgeability prevents adversaries from crafting false positives, texts that are far from any output from the watermarked model but are nonetheless flagged as watermarked. Recoverability provides an additional layer of protection: whenever a watermark is detected, the detector identifies the source text from which the flagged content was derived. Together, these properties strengthen content ownership by linking content exclusively to its generating model, enabling secure attribution and fine-grained traceability. We construct the first undetectable watermarking scheme that is robust, unforgeable, and recoverable with respect to substitutions (i.e., perturbations in Hamming metric). The key technical ingredient is a new cryptographic primitive called robust (or recoverable) digital signatures, which allow verification of messages that are close to signed ones, while preventing forgery of messages that are far from all previously signed messages. We show that any standard digital signature scheme can be boosted to a robust one using property-preserving hash functions (Boyle, LaVigne, and Vaikuntanathan, ITCS 2019)."

    "abstract": "We initiate an investigation of node differential privacy for graphs in the local model of private data analysis. In our model, dubbed LNDP, each node sees its own edge list and releases the output of a local randomizer on this input. These outputs are aggregated by an untrusted server to obtain a final output. We develop a novel algorithmic framework for this setting that allows us to accurately answer arbitrary linear queries on a blurry approximation of the input graph's degree distribution. For some natural problems, the resulting algorithms match the accuracy achievable with node privacy in the central model, where data are held and processed by a trusted server. We also prove lower bounds on the error required by LNDP that imply the optimality of our algorithms for several fundamental graph statistics. We then lift these lower bounds to the interactive LNDP setting, demonstrating the optimality of our algorithms even when constantly many rounds of interaction are permitted. Obtaining our lower bounds requires new approaches, since those developed for the usual local model do not apply to the inherently overlapping inputs that arise from graphs. Finally, we prove structural results that reveal qualitative differences between local node privacy and the standard local model for tabular data."

    "abstract": "In this paper, we formulate the new multi-objective coverage (MOC) problem where our goal is to identify a small set of representative samples whose predicted outcomes broadly cover the feasible multi-objective space. This problem is of great importance in many critical real-world applications, e.g., drug discovery and materials design, as this representative set can be evaluated much faster than the whole feasible set, thus significantly accelerating the scientific discovery process. Existing works cannot be directly applied as they either focus on sample space coverage or multi-objective optimization that targets the Pareto front. However, chemically diverse samples often yield identical objective profiles, and safety constraints are usually defined on the objectives. To solve this MOC problem, we propose a novel search algorithm, MOC-CAS, which employs an upper confidence bound-based acquisition function to select optimistic samples guided by Gaussian process posterior predictions. For enabling efficient optimization, we develop a smoothed relaxation of the hard feasibility test and derive an approximate optimizer. Compared to the competitive baselines, we show that our MOC-CAS empirically achieves superior performances across large-scale protein-target datasets for SARS-CoV-2 and cancer, each assessed on five objectives derived from SMILES-based features."

MDC detected 96 dust particle impacts when the spacecraft was in Earth orbit and later in interplanetary space, before its operation ended in April 2002 due to a technical failure on board. We compare the Nozomi dust measurements with the dust measurements obtained with the dust detector on board the Ulysses spacecraft. Impact speeds and masses of dust particles measured by Nozomi MDC are overall consistent with the measurements obtained by Ulysses in the same region of interplanetary space. Based on the impact speeds measured while Nozomi was in Earth orbit, MDC detected neither dust particles of natural origin that were bound to the Earth nor space debris. The dust impact rate measured in interplanetary space varied by approximately a factor of 2, consistent with theoretical predictions by the Interplanetary Meteoroid Engineering Model. The particle impact direction was concentrated towards the ecliptic plane, in agreement with an interplanetary origin of the majority of the measured dust particles. No impacts of cometary trail particles could positively be identified during known cometary trail crossings of Nozomi. The Nozomi dust data may become a valuable reference for the dust measurements to be obtained in the same region of interplanetary space with future space missions like, for example, MMX and DESTINY$^+$."

Existing training-free methods, including contrastive decoding and auxiliary expert models, which incur several times more computational overhead and may introduce potential interference, as well as static internal signal enhancement, are often vulnerable to the attention sink phenomenon. We find that internal Positive Attention Dynamics (PAD) in LVLMs naturally reveal semantically core visual regions under the distortions of attention sinks. Based on this, we propose Positive Attention Dynamics Enhancement (PADE), a training-free attention intervention that constructs a PAD map to identify semantically core visual regions, applies per-head Median Absolute Deviation Scaling to adaptively control the intervention strength, and leverages System-Token Compensation to maintain attention to complex user instructions and support long-term output consistency. Experiments on multiple LVLMs and benchmarks show that PADE improves visual grounding and reduces hallucinations, validating the effectiveness of leveraging internal attention dynamics for reliable multimodal reasoning."

Conventionally, background learning is performed after transforming measurements into the range-Doppler domain, a step that is computationally expensive and can obscure phase-coherent structure useful for monitoring and tracking. This paper proposes a framework for learning and tracking the multipath background directly in the raw measurement domain. Starting from a wideband Doppler linearization of the impulse response of a time-varying multipath channel, a state-space model with a heteroscedastic measurement equation is derived. This model enables channel tracking using an extended Kalman filter (EKF), and unknown model parameters are learned from the marginalized likelihood. The statistical adequacy of the proposed models is assessed via a p-value significance test. Finally, this paper integrates the learned channel model into a sequential likelihood-ratio test for target detection. BELLHOP-based simulations show that the proposed model better captures channel dynamics induced by sea-surface fluctuations and transmitter and receiver drift, yielding more reliable detection in time-varying shallow-water environments"

We present a homogeneous spectral energy distribution analysis of the Gaia DR3 Golden Sample of carbon stars in the Milky Way and Magellanic Clouds. Our dataset includes 14,747 sources with multi-band photometry from Gaia, 2MASS, and WISE, combined with recent distance and extinction estimates. For a subsample of 2,494 Mira variables, we model multi-band light curves to derive accurate mean magnitudes. Stellar and circumstellar parameters are obtained by fitting observations with a large grid of synthetic spectra computed with the DUSTY radiative transfer code using COMARCS atmospheres. We derive effective temperature, optical depth, and gas mass-loss rate for each source. The distributions peak around Teff = 3150 K, with mass-loss rates spanning 1e-11 to 1e-4 Msun/yr and inner dust temperatures near 1000 K. We find a correlation between variability amplitude and mass-loss rate. This framework provides a statistically robust view of carbon stars across environments with different metallicities. Apparent environmental dependencies are influenced by luminosity distributions and selection effects rather than purely intrinsic metallicity differences. The combined Gaia and WISE selection limits the detection of both highly obscured and faint Magellanic Cloud sources, but the observed trends remain significant within the sampled populations."

Then, we present the Conditional Entropy-Penalized Autoencoder (CEPAE), a novel autoencoder-based approach for counterfactual inference, which employs an entropy penalization loss over the latent space to encourage disentangled data representations.

However, most existing approaches fuse LoRA weights using static statistical heuristics that deviate from LoRA's original purpose of learning adaptive feature adjustments and ignore the randomness of sampled inputs. To address this, we propose a dynamic training-free fusion framework that operates throughout the generation process. During the forward pass, at each LoRA-applied layer, we dynamically compute the KL divergence between the base model's original features and those produced by subject and style LoRAs, respectively, and adaptively select the most appropriate weights for fusion. In the reverse denoising stage, we further refine the generation trajectory by dynamically applying gradient-based corrections derived from objective metrics such as CLIP and DINO scores, providing continuous semantic and stylistic guidance. By integrating these two complementary mechanisms-feature-level selection and metric-guided latent adjustment-across the entire diffusion timeline, our method dynamically achieves coherent subject-style synthesis without any retraining. Extensive experiments across diverse subject-style combinations demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art LoRA fusion methods both qualitatively and quantitatively."

Atomistic simulations have proven essential in revealing molecular-level features of MOF nucleation, but they still exhibit limitations in the simulation setups due to size constraints (inability of reaching realistic concentrations or exploring non-stoichiometric metal:ligand ratios). In this contribution, we develop a methodology to derive reactive coarse grained force fields based on multiscale coarse graining methods. We apply our novel methodology to the case of the archetypal zeolitic-imidazolate framework ZIF-8. Our coarse grained force field, which we call nb-CG-ZIF-FF, does not contain any explicit connectivity information, but learns the tetrahedral Zn-connectivity from many body correlations within an atomistic benchmark. nb-CG-ZIF-FF quantitatively reproduces the features of bulk, crystalline ZIF-8 as well as the structural evolution of pre-nucleation species in terms of Zn n-fold coordination populations from the atomistic benchmark. While the range of rings that are formed along the synthesis process are well captured by nb-CG-ZIF-FF, the model cannot exactly reproduce ring populations. Our reactive CG force field fitting approach can be applied to any MOF, opening new research avenues in modeling MOF formation, decomposition, defect dynamics and phase transition processes."

Choosing a sech-squared profile for $H(u)$, we first study (numerically) geodesic separation and geodesic deviation in a flat background. Thereafter, similar investigations are carried out in the presence of the black hole, but in regions far away from the vicinity of the horizon. Our results suggest the presence of a distinct displacement memory effect, which depends on the value of the regularisation parameter $g$ as well as the pulse height. Between different types of regular black holes, one notices parameter-dependent changes in the net displacement memory. Further, a clear difference in the magnitude of displacement memory (at large $u$) in regular and singular black holes is also visible in our numerical results."

However, training high-quality MoEs from scratch is prohibitively expensive. A promising alternative is to convert pretrained dense models into sparse MoEs. Existing dense-to-MoE methods fall into two categories: \\textbf{dynamic structural pruning} that converts dense models into MoE architectures with moderate sparsity to balance performance and inference efficiency, and \\textbf{downcycling} approaches that use pretrained dense models to initialize highly sparse MoE architectures. However, existing methods break the intrinsic activation patterns within dense models, leading to suboptimal expert construction. In this work, we argue that the Gated Linear Unit (GLU) mechanism provides a natural blueprint for dense-to-MoE conversion. We show that the fine-grained neural-wise activation patterns of GLU reveal a coarse-grained structure, uncovering an inherent MoE architecture composed of consistently activated universal neurons and dynamically activated specialized neurons. Leveraging this discovery, we introduce ExpertWeaver, a training-free framework that partitions neurons according to their activation patterns and constructs shared experts and specialized routed experts with layer-adaptive configurations. Our experiments demonstrate that ExpertWeaver significantly outperforms existing methods, both as a training-free dynamic structural pruning technique and as a downcycling strategy for superior MoE initialization."

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) enables distributed training across multiple clients without centralized data sharing, while Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) model relational data through message passing. In federated GNN settings, client graphs often exhibit heterogeneous structural and propagation characteristics. When standard aggregation mechanisms are applied to such heterogeneous updates, the global model may converge numerically while exhibiting degraded relational behavior.Our work identifies a geometric failure mode of global aggregation in Cross- Domain Federated GNNs. Although GNN parameters are numerically represented as vectors, they encode relational transformations that govern the direction, strength, and sensitivity of information flow across graph neighborhoods. Aggregating updates originating from incompatible propagation regimes can therefore introduce destructive interference in this transformation space.This leads to loss of coherence in global message passing. Importantly, this degradation is not necessarily reflected in conventional metrics such as loss or accuracy.To address this issue, we propose GGRS (Global Geometric Reference Structure), a server-side framework that regulates client updates prior to aggregation based on geometric admissibility criteria. GGRS preserves directional consistency of relational transformations as well as maintains diversity of admissible propagation subspaces. It also stabilizes sensitivity to neighborhood interactions, without accessing client data or graph topology. Experiments on heterogeneous GNN-native, Amazon Co-purchase datasets demonstrate that GGRS preserves global message-passing coherence across training rounds by highlighting the necessity of geometry-aware regulation in federated graph learning."

    "abstract": "We introduce LuxMT, a machine translation system based on Gemma 3 27B and fine-tuned for translation from Luxembourgish (LB) into French (FR) and English (EN). To assess translation performance, we construct a novel benchmark covering LB-FR, LB-EN, and LB-FR using human-translated data from Luci, a tourist magazine about Luxembourg. Training data stems from LuxAlign, a parallel corpus of multilingual Luxembourgish news articles, and LB parliamentary transcripts augmented with Google Translate. We filter the data using LuxEmbedder, LB sentence embeddings, to remove low-equivalence segment-pairs. Overall, LuxMT's results suggest strong improvements over the Gemma 3 baseline, even for translating LB to German (DE), despite the training data not containing any DE. We also explore LuxEmbedder's potential to be used as a quality estimation metric and find strong correlations with other reference-based metrics. However, we call for further research to fully assess the metric's utility and advise using it with caution."

    "abstract": "A hybrid three-form model of dark energy is developed in order to identify scaling solutions, a long-sought feature in three-form cosmology. Exploiting Hodge dualities, the theory is formulated in terms of two scalar functions that are associated with the conjugate momentum, and the three-form dual vector in an isotropic background. The resulting Lagrangian yields a stable scaling attractor where the three-form energy density tracks the dominant background fluid. A dynamical mechanism is also identified that naturally drives the system out of this regime toward a late-time accelerated phase distinguishable from a cosmological constant. This constitutes the first realization of scaling behavior within a three-form dark energy framework."

We consider the group isomorphism problem for some extensions of abelian groups by $ k $-generated groups for bounded $ k $. In particular, we prove that one can decide isomorphism of abelian-by-cyclic extensions in polynomial time, generalizing a 2009 result of Le Gall for coprime extensions. As another application, we give a polynomial-time isomorphism test for abelian-by-simple group extensions, generalizing a 2017 result of Grochow and Qiao for central extensions. The main novelty of the proof is a polynomial-time algorithm for computing the unit group of a finite ring, which might be of independent interest."

To ground our discussion, we draw motivation from phenomenological models in statistical theories of turbulence, where geometric Brownian motion serves as a classical example. To address situations where the standard invariant measure fails to exist, we heuristically explore the concept of infinite ergodicity, a notion recently introduced in the context of statistical physics for drift-diffusion stochastic processes."

In many real-world applications, queries involve constraints on multiple numeric attributes, giving rise to range-filtering approximate nearest neighbor search (RFANNS). While there exist RFANNS indexes for single-attribute range predicates, extending them to the multi-attribute setting is nontrivial and often ineffective. In this paper, we propose KHI, an index for multi-attribute RFANNS that combines an attribute-space partitioning tree with HNSW graphs attached to tree nodes. A skew-aware splitting rule bounds the tree height by $O(\\log n)$, and queries are answered by routing through the tree and running greedy search on the HNSW graphs. Experiments on four real-world datasets show that KHI consistently achieves high query throughput while maintaining high recall. Compared with the state-of-the-art RFANNS baseline, KHI improves QPS by $2.46\\times$ on average and up to $16.22\\times$ on the hard dataset, with larger gains for smaller selectivity, larger $k$, and higher predicate cardinality."

This study leverages the feedback loop between these forces to develop a method for detecting and quantifying information voids, i.e., periods in which little or no reliable information is available on a given topic. Using a case study on COVID-19 vaccines rollout in six European countries, and drawing on data from multiple platforms including Facebook, Google, Twitter, Wikipedia, and online news outlets, we examine how information voids emerge, persist and correlate with a decline in the proportion of high-quality information circulating online. By conceptualising information voids as a specific regime of information spreading, we also quantify their counterpart, information overabundance, which constitute a central component of the current definition of infodemic. We show that information voids are associated with a higher prevalence of misinformation, thus representing problematic hotspots in which individuals are more likely to be misled by low-quality online content. Overall, our findings provide empirical support for the inclusion of information voids in mechanistic explanations of misinformation emergence."

Recent modelling work leads us to expect that such heating mechanisms would be seen in the excess broadening (non-thermal velocity) of coronal spectral emission lines and that larger magnitudes of photospheric magnetic flux would generate more heating, but a direct connection between magnetic flux and spectral line broadening has been difficult to establish. We combine measurements of the photospheric magnetic field from SDO/HMI and non-thermal velocity in log T~6.2 coronal plasma from Hinode/EIS for 28 active regions and find a moderate correlation between the two exists in quiescent active regions, consistent with the photospheric field injecting upward Poynting flux into the solar corona and causing coronal heating. We find that no strong correlation with coronal composition makes it difficult to distinguish between MHD wave heating and magnetic field braiding heating using these diagnostics with current instrumentation."

We give an existence result under assumptions on the curvatures which are somewhat natural, in view of some obstructions inherent to the problem. Our strategy is variational and relies on the study of certain families of approximated problems. By performing a refined blow-up analysis for solutions with bounded Morse index, we conclude compactness."

We report two consecutive electric-field-driven TPTs at half filling (nu = 1) in angle-aligned MoTe2/WSe2 moire heterobilayers. With increasing out-of-plane displacement field, a geometrically frustrated Mott insulator evolves into a ferromagnetic quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) Mott insulator, i.e., a spin-polarized topological Mott insulator without an observable charge-gap closure, and subsequently into an antiferromagnetic, valley-coherent Mott insulator (VC-AFM) accompanied by a continuous charge-gap collapse and the emergence of a critical metallic state. Layer-resolved magnetic circular dichroism (MCD), magneto-transport, and compressibility measurements jointly determine the phase diagram. The high-field evolution of the antiferromagnetic state reveals a metamagnetic-like transition at a critical field B*, above which a Chern insulating transport response reappears. Our results establish the MoTe2/WSe2 moire platform as a tunable realization of an extended Kane-Mele-Hubbard model hosting sequential correlation-topology-intertwined transitions."

Here we introduce a cryogenic dual-gated diamond-anvil platform using helium as a pressure medium, enabling reversible hydrostatic tuning together with magneto-optical spectroscopy in twisted bilayer WSe2. Pressure enhances the moiré potential, redshifts excitons, and stabilizes Stoner ferromagnetism otherwise absent at a 3.1-degree twist. Simultaneously, the half-filled C = 1 Chern insulating state strengthens, exhibiting a reduced saturation field. Moreover, we observe a topological phase transition from a Chern insulator to a Mott insulator at around 2 GPa. First-principles calculations reveal that a Gamma-to-K valence-band-maximum switching drives this transition by converting an Ising-like topological K-valley miniband into a spin-degenerate trivial Gamma miniband. Our findings demonstrate hydrostatic pressure as a powerful, continuous control axis for correlated magnetism and topological band engineering in moiré materials."

We rely on measurement campaigns to deliver parametrized propagation models, and on the 3GPP standards process to optimize model-based performance, but as wireless networks become more complex this model-based approach is losing ground. Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) are counting on Artificial Intelligence (AI) to transform wireless by increasing spectral efficiency, reducing signaling overhead, and enabling continuous network innovation through software upgrades. They may also be interested in new use cases like integrated sensing and communications (ISAC). All we need is an AI-native physical layer, so why not simply tailor the offline AI algorithms that have revolutionized image and natural language processing to the wireless domain? We argue that these algorithms rely on off-line training that is precluded by the sub-millisecond speeds at which the wireless interference environment changes. We present an alternative architecture, a universal neural receiver based on convolution, which governs transmit and receive signal processing of any signal in any part of the wireless spectrum. Our neural receiver is designed to invert convolution, and we separate the question of which convolution to invert from the actual deconvolution. The neural network that performs deconvolution is very simple, and we configure this network by setting weights based on domain knowledge. By telling our neural network what we know, we avoid extensive offline training. By developing a universal receiver, we hope to simplify discussions about the proper choice of waveform for different use cases in the international standards. Since the receiver architecture is largely independent of technologies introduced at the base station, we hope to increase the rate of innovation in wireless."

These agents filter, prioritize, and synthesize information retrieved from the platforms' back-end databases or via web search. In these scenarios, LLM agents govern the information users receive, by drawing users' attention to particular instances of retrieved information at the expense of others. While much prior work has focused on biases in the information LLMs themselves generate, less attention has been paid to the factors that influence what information LLMs select and present to users. We hypothesize that when information is attributed to specific sources (e.g., particular publishers, journals, or platforms), current LLMs exhibit systematic latent source preferences- that is, they prioritize information from some sources over others. Through controlled experiments on twelve LLMs from six model providers, spanning both synthetic and real-world tasks, we find that several models consistently exhibit strong and predictable source preferences. These preferences are sensitive to contextual framing, can outweigh the influence of content itself, and persist despite explicit prompting to avoid them. They also help explain phenomena such as the observed left-leaning skew in news recommendations in prior work. Our findings advocate for deeper investigation into the origins of these preferences, as well as for mechanisms that provide users with transparency and control over the biases guiding LLM-powered agents."

A benchmark with the wave packet continuum-discretization is performed. This framework benefits from the fact that the renormalization-group invariance chiral forces involves only a limited number of two-body partial waves at leading order. We use it to calculate nucleon-deuteron elastic scattering differential cross sections and analyzing powers up to next-to-leading order."

The compounds generated via the quantum-annealing generative models exhibited higher quality in both validity and drug-likeness than those generated via the fully-classical models, and was further indicated to exceed even the training data in terms of drug-likeness features, without any restraints and conditions to deliberately induce such an optimization. These results indicated an advantage of quantum annealing to aim at a stochastic generator integrated with our novel neural network architectures, for the extended performance of feature space sampling and extraction of characteristic features in drug design."

After a month-long recovery effort, a 13.8 kg iron meteorite was discovered near Ådalen, representing the first instrumentally recorded and recovered fall of its type and the first iron meteorite with a derivable heliocentric orbit; the event also exhibited the lowest terminal height measured for a well-documented fireball. We combine optical, infrasound, and seismic data to reconstruct the luminous trajectory and employ a Monte Carlo model to simulate the dark flight phase and predicted strewn field, while also investigating the plausibility of a ricochet prior to final deposition.

Prior work extracted more than 350K mentions of leisure time activities and organizational memberships from these interviews, yielding 71K unique activity and organization names -- far too many to analyze directly. We develop a categorization framework that captures key aspects of participation (the kind of activity/organization, how social it typically is, how regularly it happens, and how physically demanding it is). We annotate a gold-standard set to allow for a reliable evaluation, and then test whether large language models can apply the same schema at scale.

    "abstract": "Direct numerical simulations of electrospinning and electrospraying are computationally demanding due to large-scale separation between the needle and the tip-to-collector distance. The cone-jet mode that occurs in the vicinity of the needle arises from a delicate balance between surface tension, viscous stresses, inertia, and electric stresses. This mode has a central role in determining the subsequent instabilities of the jet and the eventual outcomes on the collector. Truncated-domain simulations offer a viable alternative but depend critically on the accuracy of far-field electrostatic boundary conditions. Existing truncated-domain approaches based on analytical expressions for the electric potential systematically underestimate the electric field near the needle tip and require empirical tuning informed by prior experiments or full-domain simulations, thereby limiting their predictive capability. Here, we present a general truncated-domain framework for electrohydrodynamic (EHD) simulations of the cone-jet mode that avoids these limitations. Our approach exploits inexpensive full-domain electrostatic simulations to obtain the exact electric field and potential distributions near the needle, which are then imposed as boundary conditions in an EHD simulation carried out on a truncated domain. Comparisons with full-domain EHD simulations and experimental data demonstrate that the proposed approach accurately reproduces cone-jet shapes as well as key physical quantities, including electric currents, charge distributions, velocity fields, and Maxwell stresses, while converging at substantially smaller domain sizes. The formulation eliminates tunable parameters, does not require prior knowledge of the cone-jet configuration, and significantly reduces computational cost, providing a reliable and predictive framework for studying electrohydrodynamic cone-jet flows."

To better understand the underlying dynamics of codebase evolution, we introduce a novel approach that integrates semantic code embeddings with opinion dynamics theory, offering a quantitative framework to analyze collaborative development processes. Our approach begins by encoding code snippets into high-dimensional vector representations using state-of-the-art code embedding models, preserving both syntactic and semantic features. These embeddings are then processed using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction, with data normalized to ensure comparability. We model temporal evolution using the Expressed-Private Opinion (EPO) model to derive trust matrices and track opinion trajectories across development cycles. These opinion trajectories reflect the underlying dynamics of consensus formation, influence propagation, and evolving alignment (or divergence) within developer communities -- revealing implicit collaboration patterns and knowledge-sharing mechanisms that are otherwise difficult to observe. By bridging software engineering and computational social science, our method provides a principled way to quantify software evolution, offering new insights into developer influence, consensus formation, and project sustainability. We evaluate our approach on data from three prominent open-source GitHub repositories, demonstrating its ability to reveal interpretable behavioral trends and variations in developer interactions. The results highlight the utility of our framework in improving open-source project maintenance through data-driven analysis of collaboration dynamics."

    "abstract": "We identify the dynamical origin of the non-monotonic magnetic field dependence of the charged pion mass observed in lattice QCD. Using a near-pole effective action derived from the SU(2) Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model, we show that the lowest Landau level charged pion mixes with the longitudinally polarized charged rho meson, which shares the same quantum numbers in a magnetic background. This mixing, generated by quark-loop polarization and a gauge-invariant tree-level operator matched to the vacuum decay $ρ^\\pm\\rightarrowπ^\\pmγ$, induces strong level repulsion. Crucially, this effect is dynamically amplified by a rapid suppression of the rho-meson wave function renormalization near the pole. As a result, the lower eigenmode exhibits a turnover as the magnetic field increases. The mechanism is analogous to singlet-triplet mixing in positronium and provides a natural explanation for the lattice results. Such effects are expected to be generic for charged mesons in magnetic fields when symmetry allowed mixing and near-pole residue suppression are present."

    "abstract": "Robust classification in noisy environments remains a fundamental challenge in machine learning. Standard approaches typically treat signal enhancement and classification as separate, sequential stages: first enhancing the signal and then applying a classifier. This approach fails to leverage the semantic information in the classifier's output during denoising. In this work, we propose a general, domain-agnostic framework that integrates two interacting diffusion models: one operating on the input signal and the other on the classifier's output logits, without requiring any retraining or fine-tuning of the classifier. This coupled formulation enables mutual guidance, where the enhancing signal refines the class estimation and, conversely, the evolving class logits guide the signal reconstruction towards discriminative regions of the manifold. We introduce three strategies to effectively model the joint distribution of the input and the logit. We evaluated our joint enhancement method for image classification and automatic speech recognition. The proposed framework surpasses traditional sequential enhancement baselines, delivering robust and flexible improvements in classification accuracy under diverse noise conditions."

    "abstract": "A navigable agent needs to understand both high-level semantic instructions and precise spatial perceptions. Building navigation agents centered on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrates a promising solution due to their powerful generalization ability. However, the current tightly coupled design dramatically limits system performance. In this work, we propose a decoupled design that separates low-level spatial state estimation from high-level semantic planning. Unlike previous methods that rely on predefined, oversimplified textual maps, we introduce an interactive metric world representation that maintains rich and consistent information, allowing MLLMs to interact with and reason on it for decision-making. Furthermore, counterfactual reasoning is introduced to further elicit MLLMs' capacity, while the metric world representation ensures the physical validity of the produced actions. We conduct comprehensive experiments in both simulated and real-world environments. Our method establishes a new zero-shot state-of-the-art, achieving 48.8\\% Success Rate (SR) in R2R-CE and 42.2\\% in RxR-CE benchmarks. Furthermore, to validate the versatility of our metric representation, we demonstrate zero-shot sim-to-real transfer across diverse embodiments, including a wheeled TurtleBot 4 and a custom-built aerial drone. These real-world deployments verify that our decoupled framework serves as a robust, domain-invariant interface for embodied Vision-and-Language navigation."

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) deployed in production environments face a fundamental safety-utility trade-off either a strict filtering mechanisms prevent harmful outputs but often block benign queries or a relaxed controls risk unsafe content generation. Conventional guardrails based on static rules or fixed confidence thresholds are typically context-insensitive and computationally expensive, resulting in high latency and degraded user experience. To address these limitations, we introduce an adaptive abstention system that dynamically adjusts safety thresholds based on real-time contextual signals such as domain and user history. The proposed framework integrates a multi-dimensional detection architecture composed of five parallel detectors, combined through a hierarchical cascade mechanism to optimize both speed and precision. The cascade design reduces unnecessary computation by progressively filtering queries, achieving substantial latency improvements compared to non-cascaded models and external guardrail systems. Extensive evaluation on mixed and domain-specific workloads demonstrates significant reductions in false positives, particularly in sensitive domains such as medical advice and creative writing. The system maintains high safety precision and near-perfect recall under strict operating modes. Overall, our context-aware abstention framework effectively balances safety and utility while preserving performance, offering a scalable solution for reliable LLM deployment."

Our contribution is threefold: (1) We provide a unified exposition of hierarchical Bayesian models driven by Dirichlet processes for genetic interactions, clarifying their conceptual advantages over traditional regression approaches; (2) We shed light on new computational strategies that combine transformation-based MCMC with parallel processing for scalable inference; and (3) We present enhanced hypothesis testing procedures for identifying disease-predisposing loci.Through applications to myocardial infarction data, we demonstrate how these methods offer biological insights not readily obtainable from standard approaches. Our synthesis highlights the advantages of Bayesian nonparametric thinking in genetic epidemiology while providing practical guidance for implementation."

    "abstract": "Automatically extracting engaging and high-quality humorous scenes from cinematic titles is pivotal for creating captivating video previews and snackable content, boosting user engagement on streaming platforms. Long-form cinematic titles, with their extended duration and complex narratives, challenge scene localization, while humor's reliance on diverse modalities and its nuanced style add further complexity. This paper introduces an end-to-end system for automatically identifying and ranking humorous scenes from long-form cinematic titles, featuring shot detection, multimodal scene localization, and humor tagging optimized for cinematic content. Key innovations include a novel scene segmentation approach combining visual and textual cues, improved shot representations via guided triplet mining, and a multimodal humor tagging framework leveraging both audio and text. Our system achieves an 18.3% AP improvement over state-of-the-art scene detection on the OVSD dataset and an F1 score of 0.834 for detecting humor in long text. Extensive evaluations across five cinematic titles demonstrate 87% of clips extracted by our pipeline are intended to be funny, while 98% of scenes are accurately localized. With successful generalization to trailers, these results showcase the pipeline's potential to enhance content creation workflows, improve user engagement, and streamline snackable content generation for diverse cinematic media formats."

Here we introduce a method for constructing self-dual qLDPC codes by stacking non-self-dual qLDPC codes. Leveraging this methodology, we develop double-chain bicycle codes, double-layer bivariate bicycle (BB) codes, double-layer twisted BB codes, and double-layer reflection codes, many of which exhibit favorable code parameters. Additionally, we conduct numerical calculations to assess the performance of these codes as quantum memory under the circuit-level noise model, revealing that the logical failure rate can be significantly reduced with high pseudo-thresholds."

    "abstract": "Over the last 35 years, the sharing of medical data and models for research has evolved from sneakernet to the internet - from mailing magnetic tapes and compact discs of a handful of well-curated recordings, to the high-speed download of relatively comprehensive hospital databases. More recently, the fervor around the potential for modern machine learning and 'AI' to catapult us into the next industrial revolution has led to a seemingly insatiable desire to pump almost any source of data into large models. Although this has great potential, it also presents a whole set of new challenges. In this article I examine these trends over the last 30 years, drawing on examples from cardiology, one of the oldest data-intensive fields that is undergoing a renaissance via machine learning. From the early days of computerized cardiology, the Research Resource for Complex Physiologic Signals (PhysioNet) has been at the cutting edge of this field. This article, therefore, includes much of the Resource's history and the contributions drawn from 25 years of firsthand experience of co-developing elements of the Resource with its founders. I identify the most promising future directions for the PhysioNet Resource, and more generally, the growing issues and opportunities around dissemination and use of massive physiological databases, associated open access code, and public competitions, along with potential solutions to the key issues facing our field. Topics range from how we should approach foundation models in the context of the rapidly growing AI carbon footprint, to the potential of Tiny-ML and edge computing. I also cover issues around prizes and incentives, funding models, and scientific repeatability, as well as how we might address these issues by leveraging the PhysioNet Challenges, consistent with the philosophy of open-access from the early days of the PhysioNet Resource."

In this paper, we introduce MarkSweep, a novel watermark removal attack that effectively erases the embedded watermarks from AI-generated images without degrading visual quality. MarkSweep first amplifies watermark noise in high-frequency regions via edge-aware Gaussian perturbations and injects it into clean images for training a denoising network. This network then integrates two modules, the learnable frequency decomposition module and the frequency-aware fusion module, to suppress amplified noise and eliminate watermark traces. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments demonstrate that invisible watermarks are highly vulnerable to MarkSweep, which effectively removes embedded watermarks, reducing the bit accuracy of HiDDeN and Stable Signature watermarking schemes to below 67%, while preserving perceptual quality of AI-generated images."

While these architectures offer scalability, they introduce significant challenges in debugging and observability. When failures occur, they often manifest as opaque error messages to the end-user such as Something went wrong. This masks the underlying root cause which may reside in browser side exceptions, API contract violations, or server side logic failures. Existing monitoring tools capture these events in isolation but fail to correlate them effectively or provide intelligible explanations to non technical users. This paper proposes a novel system for Automated Multi Source Debugging and Natural Language Error Explanation. The proposed framework automatically collects and correlates error data from disparate sources such as browser, API, server logs and validates API contracts in real time, and utilizes Large Language Models to generate natural language explanations. This approach significantly reduces Mean Time to Resolution for support engineers and improves the user experience by transforming cryptic error codes into actionable insights."

However, accurately interpreting dog emotions is challenging due to the subjective nature of emotional assessments and the absence of standardized ground truth methods. We present the CREMD (Crowd-sourced Emotional Multimodal Dogs Dataset), a comprehensive dataset exploring how different presentation modes (e.g., context, audio, video) and annotator characteristics (e.g., dog ownership, gender, professional experience) influence the perception and labeling of dog emotions. The dataset consists of 923 video clips presented in three distinct modes: without context or audio, with context but no audio, and with both context and audio. We analyze annotations from diverse participants, including dog owners, professionals, and individuals with varying demographic backgrounds and experience levels, to identify factors that influence reliable dog emotion recognition. Our findings reveal several key insights: (1) while adding visual context significantly improved annotation agreement, our findings regarding audio cues are inconclusive due to design limitations (specifically, the absence of a no-context-with-audio condition and limited clean audio availability); (2) contrary to expectations, non-owners and male annotators showed higher agreement levels than dog owners and female annotators, respectively, while professionals showed higher agreement levels, aligned with our initial hypothesis; and (3) the presence of audio substantially increased annotators' confidence in identifying specific emotions, particularly anger and fear."

    "abstract": "Electronic structure calculations remain a major bottleneck in atomistic simulations and, not surprisingly, have attracted significant attention in machine learning (ML). Most existing approaches learn a direct map from molecular geometries, typically represented as graphs or encoded local environments, to molecular properties or use ML as a surrogate for electronic structure theory by targeting quantities such as Fock or density matrices expressed in an atomic orbital (AO) basis. Inspired by the Hohenberg-Kohn theorem, in this work, we propose an operator-centered framework in which the external (nuclear) potential, expressed in an AO basis, serves as the model input. From this operator, we construct hierarchical, body-ordered representations of atomic configurations that closely mirror the principles underlying several popular atom-centered descriptors. At the same time, the matrix-valued nature of the external potential provides a natural connection to equivariant message-passing neural networks. In particular, we show that successive products of the external potential provide a scalable route to equivariant message passing and enable an efficient description of long-range effects. We demonstrate that this approach can be used to model molecular properties, such as energies and dipole moments, from the external potential, or learn effective operator-to-operator maps, including mappings to the Fock matrix and the reduced density matrix from which multiple molecular observables can be simultaneously derived."

Using large scale observational evaluations with 5k observational and 2k newly sampled data on model performance, we estimate capability boundaries, high conditional quantiles of benchmark scores as a function of log pre training FLOPs, via smoothed quantile regression with a monotone, saturating sigmoid parameterization. We validate the temporal reliability by fitting on earlier model generations and evaluating on later releases. Across various tasks, the estimated boundaries are mostly stable, with the exception of math reasoning that exhibits a consistently advancing boundary over time. We then extend our approach to analyze task dependent saturation and to probe contamination related shifts on math reasoning tasks. Finally, we introduce an efficient algorithm that recovers near full data frontiers using roughly 20% of evaluation budget. Together, our work releases the Proteus 2k, the latest model performance evaluation dataset, and introduces a practical methodology for translating compute budgets into reliable performance expectations and for monitoring when capability boundaries shift across time."

The explicit form of the double elementary braiding matrices (DEBMs) in these models are derived from the F-matrices and R-symbols obtained via the q-deformed representation theory of SU(2). Using these EBMs, standard single-qubit gates are synthesized up to a global phase by a Genetic Algorithm-enhanced Solovay-Kitaev Algorithm (GA-enhanced SKA), achieving the accuracy required for fault-tolerant quantum computation with only 2-level decomposition. For two-qubit entangling gates, Genetic Algorithm (GA) yields braidwords of 30 braiding operations that approximate the local equivalence class [CNOT]. Theoretically, we demonstrate that performing double-braiding in a three-anyon (six-anyon) encoding of single-qubit (two-qubit) is topologically equivalent to a protocol requiring the physical manipulation of only one (three) anyons to execute arbitrary braids. Our numerical results provide strong evidence that double-braiding in SU(2)k anyons models is capable of universal quantum computation. Moreover, the proposed protocol offers a potential new strategy for significantly reducing the number of non-Abelian anyons that need to be physically manipulated in future braiding-based topological quantum computations (TQC)."

    "abstract": "We propose a Bayesian copula-based framework to quantify clinically interpretable joint tail risks from paired continuous biomarkers. After converting each biomarker margin to rank-based pseudo-observations, we model dependence using one-parameter Archimedean copulas and focus on three probability-scale summaries at tail level $α$: the lower-tail joint risk $R_L(θ)=C_θ(α,α)$, the upper-tail joint risk $R_U(θ)=2α-1+C_θ(1-α,1-α)$, and the conditional lower-tail risk $R_C(θ)=R_L(θ)/α$. Uncertainty is quantified via a restricted Jeffreys prior on the copula parameter and grid-based posterior approximation, which induces an exact posterior for each tail-risk functional. In simulations from Clayton and Gumbel copulas across multiple dependence strengths, posterior credible intervals achieve near-nominal coverage for $R_L$, $R_U$, and $R_C$. We then analyze NHANES 2017--2018 fasting glucose (GLU) and HbA1c (GHB) ($n=2887$) at $α=0.05$, obtaining tight posterior credible intervals for both the dependence parameter and induced tail risks. The results reveal markedly elevated extremal co-movement relative to independence; under the Gumbel model, the posterior mean joint upper-tail risk is $R_U(α)=0.0286$, approximately $11.46\\times$ the independence benchmark $α^2=0.0025$. Overall, the proposed approach provides a principled, dependence-aware method for reporting joint and conditional extremal-risk summaries with Bayesian uncertainty quantification in biomedical applications."

In this paper, we introduce a fully training-free framework for ZSAD in 3D brain MRI that constructs localized volumetric tokens by aggregating multi-axis slices processed by 2D foundation models. These 3D patch tokens restore cubic spatial context and integrate directly with distance-based, batch-level anomaly detection pipelines. The framework provides compact 3D representations that are practical to compute on standard GPUs and require no fine-tuning, prompts, or supervision.

This decoupling prevents enforceable tail-latency guarantees, compute-aware admission control, and continuity under mobility. This paper proposes Network-Exposed AI-as-a-Service (NE-AIaaS) built around a new service primitive: the AI Session (AIS)-a contractual object that binds model identity, execution placement, transport Quality-of-Service (QoS), and consent/charging scope into a single lifecycle with explicit failure semantics. We introduce the AI Service Profile (ASP), a compact contract that expresses task modality and measurable service objectives (e.g., time-to-first-response/token, p99 latency, success probability) alongside privacy and mobility constraints. On this basis, we specify protocol-grade procedures for (i) DISCOVER (model/site discovery), (ii) AI PAGING (context-aware selection of execution anchor), (iii) two-phase PREPARE/COMMIT that atomically co-reserves compute and QoS resources, and (iv) make-before-break MIGRATION for session continuity.

    "abstract": "The web is littered with images, once created for human consumption and now increasingly interpreted by agents using vision-language models (VLMs). These agents make visual decisions at scale, deciding what to click, recommend, or buy. Yet, we know little about the structure of their visual preferences. We introduce a framework for studying this by placing VLMs in controlled image-based choice tasks and systematically perturbing their inputs. Our key idea is to treat the agent's decision function as a latent visual utility that can be inferred through revealed preference: choices between systematically edited images. Starting from common images, such as product photos, we propose methods for visual prompt optimization, adapting text optimization methods to iteratively propose and apply visually plausible modifications using an image generation model (such as in composition, lighting, or background). We then evaluate which edits increase selection probability. Through large-scale experiments on frontier VLMs, we demonstrate that optimized edits significantly shift choice probabilities in head-to-head comparisons. We develop an automatic interpretability pipeline to explain these preferences, identifying consistent visual themes that drive selection. We argue that this approach offers a practical and efficient way to surface visual vulnerabilities, safety concerns that might otherwise be discovered implicitly in the wild, supporting more proactive auditing and governance of image-based AI agents."

This work explores these non-topological structures within an extended Skyrme-Faddeev-type model that incorporates quartic derivative terms. In this context, harmonic time dependence and the presence of quartic terms constitute two independent stabilization mechanisms that allow the configurations to circumvent Derrick's scaling argument. We investigate the necessary conditions for the existence of these solutions and analyze the influence of quartic terms on the properties of the resulting compactons, specifically examining the $E(Q)$ relationship between energy and Noether charge. Our findings provide valuable insights into the stability and characteristics of compact boson stars within $CP^N$ models featuring higher-order derivative terms."

    "abstract": "We explore how different types and uses of memory can aid spatial navigation in changing uncertain environments. In the simple foraging task we study, every day, our agent has to find its way from its home, through barriers, to food. Moreover, the world is non-stationary: from day to day, the location of the barriers and food may change, and the agent's sensing such as its location information is uncertain and very limited. Any model construction, such as a map, and use, such as planning, needs to be robust against these challenges, and if any learning is to be useful, it needs to be adequately fast. We look at a range of strategies, from simple to sophisticated, with various uses of memory and learning. We find that an architecture that can incorporate multiple strategies is required to handle (sub)tasks of a different nature, in particular for exploration and search, when food location is not known, and for planning a good path to a remembered (likely) food location. An agent that utilizes non-stationary probability learning techniques to keep updating its (episodic) memories and that uses those memories to build maps and plan on the fly (imperfect maps, i.e. noisy and limited to the agent's experience) can be increasingly and substantially more efficient than the simpler (minimal-memory) agents, as the task difficulties such as distance to goal are raised, as long as the uncertainty, from localization and change, is not too large."

    "abstract": "Fair scores reward ensemble forecast members that behave like samples from the same distribution as the verifying observations. They are therefore an attractive choice as loss functions to train data-driven ensemble forecasts or post-processing methods when large training ensembles are either unavailable or computationally prohibitive. The adjusted continuous ranked probability score (aCRPS) is fair and unbiased with respect to ensemble size, provided forecast members are exchangeable and interpretable as conditionally independent draws from an underlying predictive distribution. However, distribution-aware post-processing methods that introduce structural dependency between members can violate this assumption, rendering aCRPS unfair. We demonstrate this effect using two approaches designed to minimize the expected aCRPS of a finite ensemble: (1) a linear member-by-member calibration, which couples members through a common dependency on the sample ensemble mean, and (2) a deep-learning method, which couples members via transformer self-attention across the ensemble dimension. In both cases, the results are sensitive to ensemble size and apparent gains in aCRPS can correspond to systematic unreliability characterized by over-dispersion. We introduce trajectory transformers as a proof-of-concept that ensemble-size independence can be achieved. This approach is an adaptation of the Post-processing Ensembles with Transformers (PoET) framework and applies self-attention over lead time while preserving the conditional independence required by aCRPS. When applied to weekly mean $T_{2m}$ forecasts from the ECMWF subseasonal forecasting system, this approach successfully reduces systematic model biases whilst also improving or maintaining forecast reliability regardless of the ensemble size used in training (3 vs 9 members) or real-time forecasts (9 vs 100 members)."

    "abstract": "While recent advances in humanoid locomotion have achieved stable walking on varied terrains, capturing the agility and adaptivity of highly dynamic human motions remains an open challenge. In particular, agile parkour in complex environments demands not only low-level robustness, but also human-like motion expressiveness, long-horizon skill composition, and perception-driven decision-making. In this paper, we present Perceptive Humanoid Parkour (PHP), a modular framework that enables humanoid robots to autonomously perform long-horizon, vision-based parkour across challenging obstacle courses. Our approach first leverages motion matching, formulated as nearest-neighbor search in a feature space, to compose retargeted atomic human skills into long-horizon kinematic trajectories. This framework enables the flexible composition and smooth transition of complex skill chains while preserving the elegance and fluidity of dynamic human motions. Next, we train motion-tracking reinforcement learning (RL) expert policies for these composed motions, and distill them into a single depth-based, multi-skill student policy, using a combination of DAgger and RL. Crucially, the combination of perception and skill composition enables autonomous, context-aware decision-making: using only onboard depth sensing and a discrete 2D velocity command, the robot selects and executes whether to step over, climb onto, vault or roll off obstacles of varying geometries and heights. We validate our framework with extensive real-world experiments on a Unitree G1 humanoid robot, demonstrating highly dynamic parkour skills such as climbing tall obstacles up to 1.25m (96% robot height), as well as long-horizon multi-obstacle traversal with closed-loop adaptation to real-time obstacle perturbations."

In addition to the results stated in the next paragraph, we present some classical results on absoluteness relevant to functional analysis that are well known to logicians but not nearly as well advertised as they should be. We show that the theory of separable C*-algebras can be developed in ZF (that is, without using any Choice). This includes proving the Gelfand-Naimark representation theorems as well as the Spectral Mapping Theorem for polynomials and developing continuous functional calculus for commuting normal elements. Some of our proofs are modifications of the standard ones, obtained by avoiding the use of Choice. Some other proofs require new ideas in order to avoid the use of Choice. Yet another batch of proofs proceeds by using the set-theoretic Shoenfield Absoluteness Theorem. This result (well known to logicians but regrettably not as well advertised as it deserves) implies that statements about standard Borel spaces of low quantifier complexity that are provable in ZFC, or even ZFC together with the Continuum Hypothesis are provable in ZF. One of the main objectives of this paper is to present these results in a convenient form that can be utilized by analysts not familiar with set theory. We also show that in the absence of Choice (more precisely, assuming the existence of a Russell set) there is a concretely representable unital commutative \\cstar-algebra that is not isomorphic to C(X) for any compact Hausdorff space X. Finally, from the model-theoretic point of view, while the property of having a tracial state is provably axiomatizable in ZFC, it is not provably axiomatizable in ZF+DC."

These quantum states form an important subclass of bosonic states arising in the study of indistinguishable particles. We introduce a tensor-based parametrization where the diagonal entries of these states are encoded as a symmetric tensor, enabling a direct translation between entanglement properties and well-studied convex cones of tensors. Our results bridge multipartite entanglement theory with semialgebraic geometry and the theory of completely positive and copositive tensors. This dictionary maps separability to completely positive tensors, the PPT property to moment tensors, entanglement witnesses to copositive tensors, and decomposable witnesses to sum of squares tensors. Using this framework, we construct explicit PPT entangled states in three or more qutrits. In this class of states, we establish that PPT entanglement exists for all multipartite systems with three qutrits or more, disproving a recent conjecture in [J. Math. Phys. 66, 022203 (2025)]. We also show that, for mixtures of Dicke states, the PPT condition with respect to the most balanced bipartition implies PPT with respect to any other bipartition. We further connect bosonic extendibility of mixtures of Dicke states to the duals of known hierarchies for non-negative polynomials, such as the ones by Reznick and Polya. We thus provide semidefinite programming relaxations for separability and entanglement testing in the Dicke subspace."

This work develops a hybrid approach for short and long-term forecasting based on two studies with the same purpose. A multimodal approach that combines images of the sky and photovoltaic energy history with meteorological data is proposed. The main goal is to improve the accuracy of ramp event prediction, increase the robustness of forecasts in cloudy conditions, and extend capabilities beyond nowcasting, to support more efficient operation of the power grid and better management of solar variability. Deep neural models are used for both nowcasting and forecasting solutions, incorporating individual and multiple meteorological variables, as well as an analytical solar position. The results demonstrate that the inclusion of meteorological data, particularly the surface long-wave, radiation downwards, and the combination of wind and solar position, significantly improves current predictions in both nowcasting and forecasting tasks, especially on cloudy days. This study highlights the importance of integrating diverse data sources to improve the reliability and interpretability of solar energy prediction models."

Inspired by neural rendering, we introduce NeRFscopy, a self-supervised pipeline for novel view synthesis and 3D reconstruction of deformable endoscopic tissues from a monocular video. NeRFscopy includes a deformable model with a canonical radiance field and a time-dependent deformation field parameterized by SE(3) transformations. In addition, the color images are efficiently exploited by introducing sophisticated terms to learn a 3D implicit model without assuming any template or pre-trained model, solely from data. NeRFscopy achieves accurate results in terms of novel view synthesis, outperforming competing methods across various challenging endoscopy scenes."

We evaluate several mLLMs across different table formats and prompting strategies. Our results show a clear gap between question answering and evidence attribution. Although question answering accuracy remains moderate, attribution accuracy is much lower, near random for JSON inputs, across all models. We also find that models are more reliable at citing rows than columns, and struggle more with textual formats than images. Finally, we observe notable differences across model families. Overall, our findings show that current mLLMs are unreliable at providing fine-grained, trustworthy attribution for structured data, which limits their usage in applications requiring transparency and traceability."

    "abstract": "The Partially Ordered Workflow Language (POWL) has recently emerged as a process modeling notation, offering strong quality guarantees and high expressiveness. While early versions of POWL relied on strict block-structured operators for choices and loops, the language has recently evolved into POWL 2.0, introducing choice graphs to enable the modeling of non-block-structured decisions and cycles. To bridge the gap between the theoretical advantages of POWL and the practical need for compatibility with established notations, robust model transformations are required. This paper presents a novel algorithm for transforming safe and sound workflow nets (WF-nets) into equivalent POWL 2.0 models. The algorithm recursively identifies structural patterns within the WF-net and translates them into their POWL representation. Unlike the previous approach that required separate detection strategies for exclusive choices and loops, our new algorithm utilizes choice graphs to capture generalized decision and cyclic patterns. We formally prove the correctness of our approach, showing that the generated POWL model preserves the language of the input WF-net. Furthermore, we prove the completeness of our algorithm on the class of separable WF-nets, which corresponds to nets constructed via the hierarchical nesting of state machines and marked graphs. We evaluate our algorithm on large-scale process models to demonstrate its high scalability. Furthermore, to test its practical expressiveness, we applied it to a benchmark of 1,493 industrial and synthetic process models. Our algorithm successfully transformed all models in this benchmark, suggesting that POWL 2.0's expressive power is generally sufficient to capture the complex logic found in real-world business processes. This work paves the way for broader adoption of POWL in practical process analysis and improvement applications."

As a result, scene understanding often deviates from the underlying geometric structure of scenes and becomes decoupled from the reconstruction process. In this work, we propose a novel approach that leverages language and geometry grounded sparse voxel representations to comprehensively model appearance, semantics, and geometry within a unified framework. Specifically, we use 3D sparse voxels as primitives and employ an appearance field, a density field, a feature field, and a confidence field to holistically represent a 3D scene. To promote synergy among the appearance, density, and feature fields, we construct a feature modulation module and distill language features from a 2D foundation model into our 3D scene model. In addition, we integrate geometric distillation into feature field distillation to transfer geometric knowledge from a geometry foundation model to our 3D scene representations via depth correlation regularization and pattern consistency regularization. These components work together to synergistically model the appearance, semantics, and geometry of the 3D scene within a unified framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves superior overall performance compared with state-of-the-art methods in holistic scene understanding and reconstruction."

Despite its simpler form, the GE KDE maintains similar flexibility and shape characteristics, aligning with distributions such as the gamma, which are known for their effectiveness in modelling positive data. We derive the asymptotic bias and variance of the proposed kernel density estimator, and formally demonstrate the order of magnitude of the remaining terms in these expressions. We also propose a second GE KDE, for which we are able to show that it achieves the optimal mean integrated squared error, something that is difficult to establish for the former.

Existing port-Hamiltonian neural network methods have recently been successfully applied for modeling mechanical systems. However, even though these methods are designed on power-balance principles, they usually do not consider power-preserving discretizations and often rely on Runge-Kutta numerical methods. In this work, we propose to use a second-order discrete gradient method embedded in the learning of dynamical systems with port-Hamiltonian neural networks. Numerical results are provided for three systems deliberately selected to span different ranges of dynamical behavior under control: a baseline harmonic oscillator with quadratic energy storage; a Duffing oscillator, with a non-quadratic Hamiltonian offering amplitude-dependent effects; and a self-sustained oscillator, which can stabilize in a controlled limit cycle through the incorporation of a nonlinear dissipation. We show how the use of this discrete gradient method outperforms the performance of a Runge-Kutta method of the same order. Experiments are also carried out to compare two theoretically equivalent port-Hamiltonian systems formulations and to analyze the impact of regularizing the Jacobian of port-Hamiltonian neural networks during training."

    "abstract": "We derive analytical nuclear gradients for state-averaged configuration interaction singles (SACIS) and its spin-projected extension (SAECIS), enabling efficient geometry optimization and minimum-energy conical intersection (MECX) searches within a low-cost CIS-based framework. The formulation employs a Lagrangian approach and explicitly removes null-space contributions in the coupled perturbed equations to ensure numerically stable gradients. For twisted-pyramidalized ethylene, both SACIS and SAECIS qualitatively reproduce the correct conical intersection topology, in sharp contrast to conventional CIS and ECIS. Benchmark calculations on twelve MECXs demonstrate that both methods reproduce geometries with mean RMSDs below 0.1~Å relative to high-level reference methods. SACIS captures the essential degeneracy through variational orbital relaxation, which alleviates ground-state Hartree--Fock (HF) orbital bias and effectively incorporates static correlation through localization effects; notably, spin projection is found to be non-essential for the qualitative description of these intersections. Overall, SACIS and SAECIS provide qualitatively reliable CX descriptions at mean-field computational cost in a black-box manner. Given their comparable accuracy and the additional overhead associated with spin projection, SACIS offers a more favorable cost-performance balance for general applications, whereas SAECIS may become advantageous when higher excited states with significant double-excitation character are involved."

We develop some of the basic theory of relative volutive categories and provide several equivalent formulations of lax volutive categories. We then study examples of interest, including categories of complete bornological vector spaces and modules over star-rings. We will also separately discuss unbounded operators between Hilbert spaces and Morita 2-categories, the latter of which in the context of fully closed symmetric monoidal 2-categories."

We show that these guiding-center variables obey a noncommutative geometry giving rise to a three-dimensional generalization of the Girvin-MacDonald-Platzman (GMP) algebra for projected density operators. Moreover, we relate this algebra to the canonical quantization of a topological BF+BB theory whose level is identified with the Dixmier-Douady invariant. Our results clarify the structure of incompressible quantum Hall-type phases and their geometric and topological features in three spatial dimensions."

    "abstract": "Entropy production is often interpreted as a proxy for microscopic disorder or environmental roughness in stochastic systems. We test this interpretation using controlled simulations of overdamped stochastic dynamics on curved surfaces in which local noise, geometry, and forces are held fixed while global constraints are varied. Trajectories are generated for particles evolving toward a central attractor, and entropy production is quantified using both a continuum probability-current estimator and coarse-grained Markov transition statistics across multiple spatial and temporal resolutions. Across systematic sweeps of timestep size, domain extent, and boundary topology, entropy production is governed primarily by constraint-induced probability flow rather than local stochastic variability. Periodic domains that permit sustained circulation yield substantially higher entropy production than reflecting domains despite identical local stochastic structure, with the magnitude of the separation depending on domain extent. In contrast, coarse-grained estimates decrease as temporal resolution increases and rise with finer spatial binning, demonstrating that discrete estimates depend strongly on observation scale and may fail to resolve topology-induced irreversible structure. Ergo, entropy production is not a direct measure of environmental roughness or randomness. Instead, it quantifies how strongly system dynamics are driven away from reversibility by global constraints, geometry, and the space of allowed trajectories. Interpreted in this way, entropy production maps function as diagnostics of organized probability flow and provide a principled method for detecting hidden dynamical constraints from trajectory data alone."

The particle generates a concentration field through the continuous emission of a chemical substance, and its motion is driven by gradients of this field as it diffuses within a confined channel whose ends perfectly reflect the chemical. The reflection of the chemical field leads to an effective confinement of the particle, which itself is reflected before encountering the channel ends. The system displays a transition from a passive state, where the particle rests at the channel midpoint, to an active state characterized by highly regular, non-chaotic oscillations. We analytically construct the phase diagram and derive the oscillation frequency and amplitude in the vicinity of the transition. A perturbative analysis perfectly describes the dynamics of the particle even for oscillations as large as half the channel size. Furthermore, we develop an analysis which explains the mechanism of particle reflection close to the channel edges in the regime of large activity."

While powerful, deep GNNs suffer from oversmoothing, where node features converge to a homogeneous, non-informative state. We re-frame this problem of representational collapse from a \\emph{bifurcation theory} perspective, characterizing oversmoothing as convergence to a stable ``homogeneous fixed point.'' Our central contribution is the theoretical discovery that this undesired stability can be broken by replacing standard monotone activations (e.g., ReLU) with a class of functions. Using Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction, we analytically prove that this substitution induces a bifurcation that destabilizes the homogeneous state and creates a new pair of stable, non-homogeneous \\emph{patterns} that provably resist oversmoothing. Our theory predicts a precise, nontrivial scaling law for the amplitude of these emergent patterns, which we quantitatively validate in experiments. Finally, we demonstrate the practical utility of our theory by deriving a closed-form, bifurcation-aware initialization and showing its utility in real benchmark experiments."

    "abstract": "Autonomous landing of Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) on oscillating marine platforms is severely constrained by wave-induced multi-frequency oscillations, wind disturbances, and prediction phase lags in motion prediction. Existing methods either treat platform motion as a general random process or lack explicit modeling of wave spectral characteristics, leading to suboptimal performance under dynamic sea conditions. To address these limitations, we propose SpecFuse: a novel spectral-temporal fusion predictive control framework that integrates frequency-domain wave decomposition with time-domain recursive state estimation for high-precision 6-DoF motion forecasting of Uncrewed Surface Vehicles (USVs). The framework explicitly models dominant wave harmonics to mitigate phase lags, refining predictions in real time via IMU data without relying on complex calibration. Additionally, we design a hierarchical control architecture featuring a sampling-based HPO-RRT* algorithm for dynamic trajectory planning under non-convex constraints and a learning-augmented predictive controller that fuses data-driven disturbance compensation with optimization-based execution. Extensive validations (2,000 simulations + 8 lake experiments) show our approach achieves a 3.2 cm prediction error, 4.46 cm landing deviation, 98.7% / 87.5% success rates (simulation / real-world), and 82 ms latency on embedded hardware, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 44%-48% in accuracy. Its robustness to wave-wind coupling disturbances supports critical maritime missions such as search and rescue and environmental monitoring. All code, experimental configurations, and datasets will be released as open-source to facilitate reproducibility."

    "abstract": "Electron diffraction from nanogratings provides a platform for free-electron interferometry, yet controlled manipulation of electron spin in such geometries remains largely unexplored. In particular, the role of the self-generated magnetic field arising from electron motion and the feasibility of coherent spin control without disrupting diffraction coherence have not been quantitatively investigated. In this article, a self-consistent Maxwell-Pauli framework is developed to study spin-resolved electron diffraction from nanogratings in the presence of magnetic fields. The model incorporates geometric confinement, image-charge interactions, self-generated magnetostatic fields, and externally applied magnetic fields. Numerical simulations show that the intrinsic magnetic self-field produced by the electron probability current is several orders of magnitude too weak to induce measurable spin mixing, demonstrating that nanogratings act as spin-conserving beam splitters under field-free conditions. When a uniform magnetic field is applied upstream of the nanograting, coherent Larmor precession enables controlled spin rotation without modifying the diffraction geometry or degrading coherence. The magnetic field required for a $π$ spin rotation scales inversely with the interaction length and electron de Broglie wavelength $λ_{dB}$. Furthermore, a downstream nonuniform magnetic field applied after the nanograting imparts a spatially varying Zeeman phase, producing opposite transverse momentum shifts for the two spin components. The spin-dependent transverse dynamics is analyzed using Husimi Q-function phase-space maps, which visualize spin-dependent population redistribution and momentum separation. The proposed approach enables tunable spatial separation of spin-resolved free electron beams and establishes an all-magnetic route for coherent spin rotation, control, and interferometry."

The method exploits analytic structure in the relevant Wigner-3j symbol configurations appearing in temperature and polarization coupling matrices, expressing all required quantities in terms of a small set of recurrence-generated values which are precomputed and stored in lookup tables. This approach reduces the computational cost of constructing the full coupling matrices whilst maintaining numerical accuracy. We demonstrate the performance of the threej_cosmo implementation using realistic survey masks from current CMB experiments. Relative to standard recursion-based approaches used in existing pseudo-C_l pipelines, the method achieves speedups of 6-25x in practical coupling-matrix constructions, with the largest gains occurring at high multipoles. The algorithm admits efficient parallelisation on both CPUs and GPUs, the latter providing additional acceleration, up to a further order of 50 on modern hardware, without altering the underlying formalism. Beyond full matrix construction, the approach is naturally suited to applications in which only a restricted set of l3 modes is required for each (l1,l2) pair, such as in the computation of band-limited coupling matrices and analytic covariance terms. These features make threej_cosmo a practical backend for pseudo-C_l estimation and related calculations in next-generation CMB analysis pipelines."

The star-forming gas (SFG) in HII regions and young stars (YSs) trace the recent evolutionary history of the galaxy. We aim to assess the extent to which the joint analysis of metallicity gradient alignment in YSs and SFG can constrain the recent evolutionary history of galaxies. Using the high-resolution run of the EAGLE project, we derived radial, azimuthally averaged oxygen abundance profiles for YSs (age < 2 Gyr) and SFG and measured their gradients as the slopes of linear fits to these profiles. We classified galaxies into four groups based on the signs (N for negative and P for positive) of the slopes: NN, NP, PP, and PN (the first letter is for YSs and the second for SFG). We found that galaxies with NN, NP, PP, and PN combinations of metallicity profiles reflect different evolutionary paths over the past ~ 2 Gyr. NN galaxies exhibit sustained inside-out growth accompanied by high star formation efficiency, whereas NP and PP systems show evidence of recent or ongoing feedback-driven disruption, with PP galaxies likely being predominantly shaped by supernova feedback. PN galaxies, by contrast, show evidence of past violent events followed by gradient recovery, highlighting the interplay between inflows, feedback, and gas cooling in shaping metallicity distributions. The degree of alignment between the stellar and gas metallicity gradients provides a way to time the occurrence of significant events in the evolutionary history of galaxies, which contribute through a combination of gas inflows, star formation triggering, and metal mixing. They could also serve as probes of sub-grid physics when observations provide suitable comparison datasets. [Abridged]"

Identifying how different inhalation routes modify the flow field is therefore crucial for understanding lower-airway disease transmission and for guiding targeted drug delivery. To gain a detailed understanding of the influence of the inhalation route on the flow structures in the human trachea, the flow field in the trachea is investigated in vitro in a non-compliant, refractive-index matched silicone model of the human respiratory tract. The investigations comprise steady inhalation, and oscillatory flow to simulate calm breathing. A realistic breathing pattern is approximated by a sinusoidal waveform for two Reynolds numbers of $Re_{Tr} = [400, 1200]$, based on the bulk velocity at maximum volume flux and the hydraulic diameter of the trachea and two Womersley numbers of $Wo = [3, 4.5]$, representing the oscillation time scales. To capture the inherently three-dimensional and asymmetric nature of the flow field, 3D particle-tracking velocimetry measurements are performed using the Shake-The-Box algorithm. Using a refractive-index matched fluid consisting of water and glycerin, the complex flow structures inside the trachea are fully resolved. The PTV measurements confirm that the nasal and/or oral cavity must be considered when analyzing the flow field in the lower respiratory tract. In particular, we find that the presence of both cavities significantly alters the flow field compared to idealised, fully developed inflow conditions. However, velocity profiles in the sagittal and coronal plane in the trachea as well as contour plots of the of the normalized velocity magnitude evidence nearly identical flow structures for oral and nasal inhalation, indicating minimal influence of the inhalation route."

In the compound Co$_{1/3}$TaS$_2$, the main electronic bands closely resemble those of pristine 2H-TaS$_2$, with no clear signs of band folding. However, a shallow electron pocket, referred to as the $β$-feature, was detected at the Fermi level near the corner of the superlattice Brillouin zone. The surface vs bulk origin of this feature is debated, as it cannot be reproduced using standard DFT calculations. To resolve this, we employed cluster perturbation theory (CPT) to incorporating an exact treatment of strong electron correlations (U) on the cobalt sites, going beyond DFT+U approximation. To further substantiate this, we studied an underdoped sample, Co$_{0.22}$TaS$_2$, where a reduced charge transfer leads to different Co orbital character near the Fermi level. We find that its electronic structure closely resembles that of undoped 2H-TaS$_2$, and crucially, lacks the $β$-feature. Our results demonstrate that the $β$-feature is of the bulk origin emerging from the strong electronic correlations where both the Co charge state and long-range crystallographic order play an important role. This work highlights the need for accurate treatment of electron correlations when studying intercalated transition metal dichalcogenides."

    "abstract": "The application of operator overloading algorithmic differentiation (AD) to computer programs in order to compute the derivative is quite common. But, the replacement of the underlying computational floating point type with the specialized type of an AD tool has two problems. First, the memory structure of the program is changed and floating-point data is interleaved with identifiers from AD. This prevents the compiler from performing optimizations such as SIMD optimizations. Second, the AD tool does not see any domain-specific operations, e.,g. linear algebra operations, that the program uses. This prevents the AD tool from using specialized algorithms in such places. We propose a new AD tool that is tailored to such situations. The memory structure of the primal data is retained by associating an identifier with each entity, e.,g. matrix, and not with each floating point value, e.,g. element of the matrix. Operations on such entities can then be annotated and a generator is used to create the AD overloads. We demonstrate that this approach provides performance comparable to that of other specializations. In addition, the run-time factor is below the theoretical 4.5 of reverse AD for programs that are written purely with linear algebra entities and operations."

It can be both beneficial, e.g., in power grids, and harmful, e.g., in epileptic seizures. In the latter case, efficient control methods to desynchronize the systems are crucial. Recent studies have shown that interactions are not always pairwise, but higher-order, i.e., many-body, and this greatly affects the dynamics. For instance, higher-order interactions increase the linear stability of synchronized states but simultaneously shrink their attraction basin, with potentially opposite effects on control methods. Here, we use a minimally invasive pairwise control based on Hamiltonian control theory, and investigate its efficiency on phase oscillators with higher-order interactions. We show that, if the initial phases are close to the synchronized state, higher-order interactions make desynchronization more difficult to achieve. Otherwise, a non-monotonic effect appears: intermediate strengths of higher-order interactions impede desynchronization while larger ones facilitate it. In all cases, the control can desynchronize the system with a sufficient number of controlled nodes and intensity."

    "abstract": "The long-tail distribution, where a few head labels dominate while rare tail labels abound, poses a persistent challenge for large-scale Multi-Label Classification (MLC) in real-world data mining applications. Existing resampling and reweighting strategies often disrupt inter-label dependencies or require brittle hyperparameter tuning, especially as the label space expands to tens of thousands of labels. To address this issue, we propose Curiosity-Driven Game-Theoretic Multi-Label Learning (CD-GTMLL), a scalable cooperative framework that recasts long-tail MLC as a multi-player game - each sub-predictor (\"player\") specializes in a partition of the label space, collaborating to maximize global accuracy while pursuing intrinsic curiosity rewards based on tail label rarity and inter-player disagreement. This mechanism adaptively injects learning signals into under-represented tail labels without manual balancing or tuning. We further provide a theoretical analysis showing that our CD-GTMLL converges to a tail-aware equilibrium and formally links the optimization dynamics to improvements in the Rare-F1 metric. Extensive experiments across 7 benchmarks, including extreme multi-label classification datasets with 30,000+ labels, demonstrate that CD-GTMLL consistently surpasses state-of-the-art methods, with gains up to +1.6% P@3 on Wiki10-31K. Ablation studies further confirm the contributions of both game-theoretic cooperation and curiosity-driven exploration to robust tail performance. By integrating game theory with curiosity mechanisms, CD-GTMLL not only enhances model efficiency in resource-constrained environments but also paves the way for more adaptive learning in imbalanced data scenarios across industries like e-commerce and healthcare."

    "abstract": "Online video understanding requires models to perform continuous perception and long-range reasoning within potentially infinite visual streams. Its fundamental challenge lies in the conflict between the unbounded nature of streaming media input and the limited context window of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Current methods primarily rely on passive processing, which often face a trade-off between maintaining long-range context and capturing the fine-grained details necessary for complex tasks. To address this, we introduce EventMemAgent, an active online video agent framework based on a hierarchical memory module. Our framework employs a dual-layer strategy for online videos: short-term memory detects event boundaries and utilizes event-granular reservoir sampling to process streaming video frames within a fixed-length buffer dynamically; long-term memory structuredly archives past observations on an event-by-event basis. Furthermore, we integrate a multi-granular perception toolkit for active, iterative evidence capture and employ Agentic Reinforcement Learning (Agentic RL) to end-to-end internalize reasoning and tool-use strategies into the agent's intrinsic capabilities. Experiments show that EventMemAgent achieves competitive results on online video benchmarks. The code will be released here: https://github.com/lingcco/EventMemAgent."

Each device maps its soft-label (class-probability) vector to nonnegative transmit energies under constant per-round power and constant-envelope signaling (PAPR near 1). At the server, a self-centering energy estimator removes the noise-energy offset and yields an unbiased estimate of the weighted soft-label average, with variance decaying on the order of 1/(SM) in the number of receive antennas M and repetition factor S. We also develop a pilot-free ratio-normalized variant that cancels unknown large-scale gains, provide a convergence bound consistent with coherent OTA-FD analyses, and present an overhead-based crossover comparison. SCENE targets short-coherence and hardware-constrained regimes, where avoiding per-round CSI is essential: it trades a modest noncoherent variance constant for zero uplink pilots, unbiased aggregation, and hardware-friendly transmission, and can outperform coherent designs when pilot overhead is non-negligible."

    "abstract": "Foundation models for agriculture are increasingly trained on massive spatiotemporal data (e.g., multi-spectral remote sensing, soil grids, and field-level management logs) and achieve strong performance on forecasting and monitoring. However, these models lack language-based reasoning and interactive capabilities, limiting their usefulness in real-world agronomic workflows. Meanwhile, large language models (LLMs) excel at interpreting and generating text, but cannot directly reason over high-dimensional, heterogeneous agricultural datasets. We bridge this gap with an agentic framework for agricultural science. It provides a Python execution environment, AgriWorld, exposing unified tools for geospatial queries over field parcels, remote-sensing time-series analytics, crop growth simulation, and task-specific predictors (e.g., yield, stress, and disease risk). On top of this environment, we design a multi-turn LLM agent, Agro-Reflective, that iteratively writes code, observes execution results, and refines its analysis via an execute-observe-refine loop. We introduce AgroBench, with scalable data generation for diverse agricultural QA spanning lookups, forecasting, anomaly detection, and counterfactual \"what-if\" analysis. Experiments outperform text-only and direct tool-use baselines, validating execution-driven reflection for reliable agricultural reasoning."

It has been shown that the decision problem for finding an integer array of length $\\ell+ρ$ or restricting the shift function up to values of $ρ$ is NP-complete (cf. the textbook of Garey and Johnson). As a practical heuristic, a greedy algorithm has been proposed to shift the $i$-th row until it forms a solution with its predecessor rows. Despite that this greedy algorithm is cherished for its good approximation in practice, we show that it actually exhibits an approximation ratio of $Θ(\\sqrt{\\ell+ρ})$. We give further hardness results for parameterizations such as the number of distinct rows or the maximum number of non-zero entries per row. Finally, we devise a DP-algorithm that solves the problem for double-logarithmic matrix widths or logarithmic widths for further restrictions. We study all these findings also under a new perspective by introducing a variant of the problem, where we wish to minimize the length of the resulting integer array by trimming the non-zero borders, which has not been studied in the literature before but has practical motivations."

Our solutions improve over the best known running times for these problems in terms of the worst-case time per letter, for which we achieve a poly-log-logarithmic time complexity, within a linear space. Best known results for these problems require a poly-logarithmic time complexity per letter or only provide amortized complexity bounds. As a result of independent interest, we give conversions between the longest previous factor array and the longest repeating suffix array in space and time bounds based on their irreducible representations, which can have sizes sublinear in the length of the input string."

Drawing on the framework of mechanistic interpretability, we identify and examine class-specific neurons by analyzing conditional activation patterns across diverse tasks. Our analysis reveals that SSL models foster the emergence of class-specific neurons that provide extensive coverage across novel task classes. These neurons exhibit shared responses across different semantic categories and acoustic similarities, such as speech attributes and musical pitch. We also confirm that these neurons have a functional impact on classification performance. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic neuron-level analysis of a general-purpose audio SSL model, providing new insights into its internal representation."

    "abstract": "Causal structure learning, also known as causal discovery, aims to estimate causal relationships between variables as a form of a causal directed acyclic graph (DAG) from observational data. One of the major frameworks is the order-based approach that first estimates a topological order of the underlying DAG and then prunes spurious edges from the fully-connected DAG induced by the estimated topological order. Previous studies often focus on the former ordering step because it can dramatically reduce the search space of DAGs. In practice, the latter pruning step is equally crucial for ensuring both computational efficiency and estimation accuracy. Most existing methods employ a pruning technique based on generalized additive models and hypothesis testing, commonly known as CAM-pruning. However, this approach can be a computational bottleneck as it requires repeatedly fitting additive models for all variables. Furthermore, it may harm estimation quality due to multiple testing. To address these issues, we introduce a new pruning method based on sparse additive models, which enables direct pruning of redundant edges without relying on hypothesis testing. We propose an efficient algorithm for learning sparse additive models by combining the randomized tree embedding technique with group-wise sparse regression. Experimental results on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrated that our method is significantly faster than existing pruning methods while maintaining comparable or superior accuracy."

We present a hybrid privacy-preserving framework that combines Federated Learning (FL) and Split Learning (SL) to support decision-oriented healthcare modeling without raw-data sharing. The approach keeps feature-extraction trunks on clients while hosting prediction heads on a coordinating server, enabling shared representation learning and exposing an explicit collaboration boundary where privacy controls can be applied. Rather than assuming distributed training is inherently private, we audit leakage empirically using membership inference on cut-layer representations and study lightweight defenses based on activation clipping and additive Gaussian noise. We evaluate across three public clinical datasets under non-IID client partitions using a unified pipeline and assess performance jointly along four deployment-relevant axes: factual predictive utility, uplift-based ranking under capacity constraints, audited privacy leakage, and communication overhead. Results show that hybrid FL-SL variants achieve competitive predictive performance and decision-facing prioritization behavior relative to standalone FL or SL, while providing a tunable privacy-utility trade-off that can reduce audited leakage without requiring raw-data sharing. Overall, the work positions hybrid FL-SL as a practical design space for privacy-preserving healthcare decision support where utility, leakage risk, and deployment cost must be balanced explicitly."

Compared with the existing literature, our approach overcomes the need for a stronger compact support assumption on the density of covariates arising from random denominators.

    "abstract": "Dataset distillation compresses the original data into compact synthetic datasets, reducing training time and storage while retaining model performance, enabling deployment under limited resources. Although recent decoupling-based distillation methods enable dataset distillation at large-scale, they continue to face an efficiency gap: optimization-based decoupling methods achieve higher accuracy but demand intensive computation, whereas optimization-free decoupling methods are efficient but sacrifice accuracy. To overcome this trade-off, we propose Exploration-Exploitation Distillation (E^2D), a simple, practical method that minimizes redundant computation through an efficient pipeline that begins with full-image initialization to preserve semantic integrity and feature diversity. It then uses a two-phase optimization strategy: an exploration phase that performs uniform updates and identifies high-loss regions, and an exploitation phase that focuses updates on these regions to accelerate convergence. We evaluate E^2D on large-scale benchmarks, surpassing the state-of-the-art on ImageNet-1K while being 18x faster, and on ImageNet-21K, our method substantially improves accuracy while remaining 4.3x faster. These results demonstrate that targeted, redundancy-reducing updates, rather than brute-force optimization, bridge the gap between accuracy and efficiency in large-scale dataset distillation.

However, practical implementations face two key limitations: error signals must still propagate from the output to early layers through multiple inference-phase steps, and feedback decays exponentially during this process, leading to vanishing updates in early layers. We propose direct Kolen-Pollack predictive coding (DKP-PC), which simultaneously addresses both feedback delay and exponential decay, yielding a more efficient and scalable variant of PC while preserving update locality. Leveraging direct feedback alignment and direct Kolen-Pollack algorithms, DKP-PC introduces learnable feedback connections from the output layer to all hidden layers, establishing a direct pathway for error transmission. This yields an algorithm that reduces the theoretical error propagation time complexity from O(L), with L being the network depth, to O(1), removing depth-dependent delay in error signals. Moreover, empirical results demonstrate that DKP-PC achieves performance at least comparable to, and often exceeding, that of standard PC, while offering improved latency and computational performance, supporting its potential for custom hardware-efficient implementations."

To this end, we introduce a two-level framework of appropriateness: baseline appropriateness, which guides the design process, and post-design appropriateness, which serves as a criterion for a posteriori evaluation. We provide distribution-free upper bounds on the risk of failing to meet the post-design appropriateness; these bounds are computable without using any additional test data. Under additional assumptions, lower bounds are also derived. As part of an effort to demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed methodology, the paper presents two practical examples in H2 and pole-placement problems.

    "abstract": "In Neyman's original formulation, a 1-alpha confidence interval procedure is justified by its long-run coverage properties, and a single realized interval is to be described only by the slogan that it either covers the parameter or it does not. On this view, post-data probability statements about the coverage of an individual interval are taken to be conceptually out of bounds. In this paper, I present two kinds of arguments against treating that \"either-or\" reading as the only legitimate interpretation of confidence. The first is informal, via a set of thought experiments in which the same joint probability model is used to compute both forward-looking and backward-looking probabilities for occurred-but-unobserved events. The second is more formal, recasting the standard confidence-interval construction in terms of infinite sequences of trials and their associated 0/1 coverage indicators. In that representation, the design-level coverage probability 1-alpha and the degenerate conditional probabilities given the full data appear simply as different conditioning levels of the same model. I argue that a strict behavioristic reading that privileges only the latter is in tension with the very mathematical machinery used to define long-run error rates. I then sketch an alternative view of confidence as a predictive probability (or forecast) about the coverage indicator, together with a simple normative rule for when intermediate probabilities for single coverage events should be allowed.

Under adaptive assignment, propensities can keep changing, so the predictable quadratic variation of AIPW/DML score increments may remain random. When no deterministic variance limit exists, Wald statistics normalized by a single long-run variance target can be conditionally miscalibrated given the realized variance regime. We assume no interference, sequential randomization, i.i.d. arrivals, and executed overlap on a prespecified scored set, and we require two auditable pipeline conditions: the platform logs the executed randomization probability for each unit, and the nuisance regressions used to score unit $t$ are constructed predictably from past data only. These conditions make the centered AIPW/DML scores an exact martingale difference sequence. Using self-normalized martingale limit theory, we show that the Studentized statistic, with variance estimated by realized quadratic variation, is asymptotically N(0,1) at the prespecified horizon, even without variance stabilization. Simulations validate the theory and highlight when standard fixed-variance Wald reporting fails."

    "abstract": "Quantifying biometric characteristics within hand gestures involve derivation of fitness scores from a gesture and identity aware feature space. However, evaluating the quality of these scores remains an open question. Existing biometric capacity estimation literature relies upon error rates. But these rates do not indicate goodness of scores. Thus, in this manuscript we present an exhaustive set of evaluation measures. We firstly identify ranking order and relevance of output scores as the primary basis for evaluation. In particular, we consider both rank deviation as well as rewards for: (i) higher scores of high ranked gestures and (ii) lower scores of low ranked gestures. We also compensate for correspondence between trends of output and ground truth scores. Finally, we account for disentanglement between identity features of gestures as a discounting factor. Integrating these elements with adequate weighting, we formulate advanced acceptance score as a holistic evaluation measure. To assess effectivity of the proposed we perform in-depth experimentation over three datasets with five state-of-the-art (SOTA) models. Results show that the optimal score selected with our measure is more appropriate than existing other measures. Also, our proposed measure depicts correlation with existing measures. This further validates its reliability. We have made our \\href{https://github.com/AmanVerma2307/MeasureSuite}{code} public."

    "abstract": "The LLM community often reports benchmark results as if they are synonymous with general model capabilities. However, benchmarks can have problems that distort performance, like test set contamination and annotator error. How can we know that a benchmark is a reliable indicator of some capability that we want to measure? This question concerns the construct validity of LLM benchmarks, and it requires separating benchmark results from capabilities when we model and predict LLM performance. Both social scientists and computer scientists propose formal models - latent factor models and scaling laws - for identifying the capabilities underlying benchmark scores. However, neither technique is satisfactory for construct validity. Latent factor models ignore scaling laws, and as a result, the capabilities they extract often proxy model size. Scaling laws ignore measurement error, and as a result, the capabilities they extract are both uninterpretable and overfit to the observed benchmarks. This thesis presents the structured capabilities model, the first model to extract interpretable and generalisable capabilities from a large collection of LLM benchmark results. I fit this model and its two alternatives on a large sample of results from the OpenLLM Leaderboard. Structured capabilities outperform latent factor models on parsimonious fit indices, and exhibit better out-of-distribution benchmark prediction than scaling laws. These improvements are possible because neither existing approach separates model scale from capabilities in the appropriate way. Model scale should inform capabilities, as in scaling laws, and these capabilities should inform observed results up to measurement error, as in latent factor models. In combining these two insights, structured capabilities demonstrate better explanatory and predictive power for quantifying construct validity in LLM evaluations."

Existing memory assisted methods often rely on textual summaries, which discard rich visual and spatial details and remain brittle in non-stationary environments. In this work, we propose a non-parametric memory framework that explicitly disentangles episodic and semantic memory for embodied exploration and question answering. Our retrieval-first, reasoning-assisted paradigm recalls episodic experiences via semantic similarity and verifies them through visual reasoning, enabling robust reuse of past observations without rigid geometric alignment. In parallel, we introduce a program-style rule extraction mechanism that converts experiences into structured, reusable semantic memory, facilitating cross-environment generalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on embodied question answering and exploration benchmarks, yielding a 7.3% gain in LLM-Match and an 11.4% gain in LLM MatchXSPL on A-EQA, as well as +7.7% success rate and +6.8% SPL on GOAT-Bench. Analyses reveal that our episodic memory primarily improves exploration efficiency, while semantic memory strengthens complex reasoning of embodied agents."

    "abstract": "This work presents a fully coupled, multiphysics computational framework for predicting the thermo-chemical material response of thermal protection systems in inductively coupled plasma (ICP) wind tunnels. The framework integrates a high-fidelity Navier-Stokes plasma solver, an electromagnetic field solver, and a discontinuous-Galerkin material response solver using a partitioned coupling strategy. This enables an ab initio, end-to-end simulation of the 350 kW Plasmatron X facility at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), including plasma generation, electromagnetic heating, near-wall thermochemistry, and time-accurate material ablation. The model captures key ICP physics such as vortex-mode recirculation, Joule-heating-driven plasma formation, and Lorentz-force-induced flow confinement, and accurately predicts the transition from subsonic to supersonic jet behavior at low pressures. Validation against cold-wall calorimetry and graphite ablation experiments shows that predicted stagnation-point heat fluxes fall well within experimental uncertainty, while fully coupled simulations accurately reproduce measured stagnation temperature histories and recession rates with errors below 12% and 10%, respectively. Remaining discrepancies during early transient heating are attributed to uncertainties in power-coupling efficiency, equilibrium ablation modeling, and material property datasets. Overall, the framework demonstrates strong predictive capability for ICP wind tunnel environments and provides a foundation for improved design, interpretation, and planning of hypersonic material testing campaigns."

    "abstract": "Neural audio codecs (NACs) typically encode the short-term energy (gain) and normalized structure (shape) of speech/audio signals jointly within the same latent space. As a result, they are poorly robust to a global variation of the input signal level in the sense that such variation has strong influence on the embedding vectors at the output of the encoder and their quantization. This methodology is inherently inefficient, leading to codebook redundancy and suboptimal bitrate-distortion performance. To address these limitations, we propose to introduce shape-gain decomposition, widely used in classical speech/audio coding, into the NAC framework. The principle of the proposed Equalizer methodology is to decompose the input signal -- before the NAC encoder -- into gain and normalized shape vector on a short-term basis. The shape vector is processed by the NAC, while the gain is quantized with scalar quantization and transmitted separately. The output (decoded) signal is reconstructed from the normalized output of the NAC and the quantized gain. Our experiments conducted on speech signals show that this general methodology, easily applicable to any NAC, enables a substantial gain in bitrate-distortion performance, as well as a massive reduction in complexity."

Suspended TMD monolayers provide an effective route to minimizing substrate-induced disorder. Here we demonstrate the spatially uniform excitonic spectrum from high-quality WSe2 suspended monolayers fabricated by gold-assisted exfoliation directly onto an Au contact electrode of a gate-tunable device. The resulting membranes span narrow suspended regions up to ~80 um and show spatially uniform photoluminescence at cryogenic temperatures with neutral-exciton linewidths as low as ~4.5 meV, comparable to the narrowest values reported for high-quality monolayers. Spectral reproducibility across the suspended regions supports an intrinsic optical response, while gate-dependent measurements resolve multiple excitonic species. This approach provides a practical route to electrically tunable potential landscapes in suspended TMD monolayers with a highly uniform excitonic response."

Smartphone-based mobile sensing enables passive, in-the-wild mood inference from everyday behaviors; however, deploying such systems at scale remains challenging due to privacy constraints, uneven sensing availability, and substantial variability in behavioral patterns. In this work, we study mood inference using smartphone sensing data in a cross-country federated learning setting, where each country participates as an independent client while retaining local data. We introduce FedFAP, a feature-aware personalized federated framework designed to accommodate heterogeneous sensing modalities across regions. Evaluations across geographically and culturally diverse populations show that FedFAP achieves an AUROC of 0.744, outperforming both centralized approaches and existing personalized federated baselines. Beyond inference, our results offer design insights for mood-aware systems, demonstrating how population-aware personalization and privacy-preserving learning can enable scalable and mood-aware mobile sensing technologies."

This study argues that the problem is fundamentally morphological and structural. The city's leapfrog urban expansion has produced fragmented peripheral clusters disconnected from a rigid, center-oriented bus network. As a result, demand remains intensely concentrated along the Kizilay-Ulus axis and western corridors, while peripheral districts experience either chronic under-service or enforced transfer dependency. The deficiency is therefore not merely quantitative but rooted in the misalignment between urban macroform and network architecture. The empirical analysis draws on a 173-day operational dataset derived from route-level passenger and trip reports published by EGO under the former \"Transparent Ankara\" initiative. To overcome the absence of stop-level geospatial data, a Connectivity-Based Weighted Distribution Model reallocates passenger volumes to 1 km x 1 km grid cells using network centrality. The findings reveal persistent center-periphery asymmetries, structural bottlenecks, and spatially embedded accessibility inequalities."

Ovcharenko and J. Podolsky, Phys. Rev. D 112 (2025) 064076]. We show that such exact solutions split into two main subclasses that (after a suitable re-parametrization) can be interpreted as either the uncharged Schwarzschild or C-metric in the external Bertotti-Robinson (BR) spacetime with geometry ${\\mathrm{AdS}_2\\times\\mathrm{S}_2}$, or as the charged Reissner-Nordstrom black hole accelerating in the external BR electromagnetic field. The distinction between these two subclasses is determined by the parameter $r_0$ that encodes relations between the external Maxwell field (given by the non-aligned components of the Faraday tensor ${Φ_0=Φ_2}$) and the Maxwell field created by the charge of the black hole (given by the aligned component $Φ_1$). Namely, if ${r_0=0}$ then the electromagnetic field is fully determined by ${Φ_0=Φ_2}$, and one gets the C-metric in the BR universe (including also the non-accelerating Schwarzschild-BR black hole). But if ${r_0\\neq 0}$ then the electromagnetic field is independently determined by both the external BR field and the field of a black hole itself, and this can be interpreted as the Reissner-Nordstrom black hole accelerating in the Bertotti-Robinson spacetime. Even though such an interpretation of the spacetime family is quite simple, it contains a lot of subtleties (e.g. the no-charge limit of the RN-BR spacetime, the non-trivial dependence on the signs of the mass and charge of a black hole, extreme black holes, and others) which we carefully investigate in this work. We also show the explicit relation to solutions previously found by Van den Bergh and Carminati, and we discuss the connection to the Alekseev-Garcia and Alexeev solutions."

Yet many studies still emphasize point-level results on curated base datasets, limiting value for model selection in practice. We introduce an evaluation protocol with unified event-level augmentations that simulate real-world issues: calibrated sensor dropout, linear and log drift, additive noise, and window shifts. We also perform sensor-level probing via mask-as-missing zeroing with per-channel influence estimation to support root-cause analysis. We evaluate 14 representative models on five public anomaly datasets (SWaT, WADI, SMD, SKAB, TEP) and two industrial datasets (steam turbine, nuclear turbogenerator) using unified splits and event aggregation. There is no universal winner: graph-structured models transfer best under dropout and long events (e.g., on SWaT under additive noise F1 drops 0.804->0.677 for a graph autoencoder, 0.759->0.680 for a graph-attention variant, and 0.762->0.756 for a hybrid graph attention model); density/flow models work well on clean stationary plants but can be fragile to monotone drift; spectral CNNs lead when periodicity is strong; reconstruction autoencoders become competitive after basic sensor vetting; predictive/hybrid dynamics help when faults break temporal dependencies but remain window-sensitive. The protocol also informs design choices: on SWaT under log drift, replacing normalizing flows with Gaussian density reduces high-stress F1 from ~0.75 to ~0.57, and fixing a learned DAG gives a small clean-set gain (~0.5-1.0 points) but increases drift sensitivity by ~8x."

The total size of live objects at any time is guaranteed to be at most a $1-ε$ fraction of the total memory. To handle an online update, the allocator may rearrange the objects in memory to make space, and the overhead for this update is defined as the total size of moved objects divided by the size of the object being inserted/deleted. Our main result is an allocator with worst-case expected overhead $\\mathrm{polylog}(ε^{-1})$. This exponentially improves the previous worst-case expected overhead $\\tilde O(ε^{-1/2})$ achieved by Farach-Colton, Kuszmaul, Sheffield, and Westover (2024), narrowing the gap towards the $Ω(\\logε^{-1})$ lower bound. Our improvement is based on an application of the sunflower lemma previously used by Erdős and Sárközy (1992) in the context of subset sums. Our allocator achieves polylogarithmic overhead only in expectation, and sometimes performs expensive rebuilds. Our second technical result shows that this is necessary: it is impossible to achieve subpolynomial overhead with high probability."

In Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning, these problems are often addressed by incorporating intrinsic drives that encourage prosocial or fair behavior. However, most existing methods assume that agents face identical incentives in the dilemma and require continuous access to global information about other agents to assess fairness. In this work, we introduce asymmetric variants of well-known SSD environments and examine how natural differences between agents influence cooperation dynamics. Our findings reveal that existing fairness-based methods struggle to adapt under asymmetric conditions by enforcing raw equality that wrongfully incentivize defection. To address this, we propose three modifications: (i) redefining fairness by accounting for agents' reward ranges, (ii) introducing an agent-based weighting mechanism to better handle inherent asymmetries, and (iii) localizing social feedback to make the methods effective under partial observability without requiring global information sharing. Experimental results show that in asymmetric scenarios, our method fosters faster emergence of cooperative policies compared to existing approaches, without sacrificing scalability or practicality."

The developed solver extends the existing IBM techniques available in OpenFOAM to compressible regimes, tackling challenges such as shock waves, expansions, and dynamic geometries without needing body-fitted meshes. A novel contribution of this work is the implementation of a slip boundary condition for velocity at immersed surfaces, specifically designed to handle inviscid highspeed flows. The method also combines the second-order polynomial IBM reconstruction with multiple flux schemes such as Kurganov, Tadmor, HLL (Harten-Lax-van Leer), and AUSM+up (Advection Upstream Splitting Method Plus Upwind). The technique achieves significant accuracy across diverse high-speed flow conditions. Extensive validation is performed through supersonic flow cases over a wedge, a cylinder, an aerofoil, a sphere, and a moving piston. Results show excellent agreement with analytical and body-fitted solutions, with sharp resolution of shocks, minimal numerical oscillations, and shock reflections. A grid convergence study confirms the solver's reliability across varying mesh resolutions, while three-dimensional simulations highlight its capability for scaled-up applications. This solver provides a flexible, efficient, and accurate tool for capturing high-speed flow phenomena across various Mach numbers and geometries. It offers significant advantages in mesh handling, particularly for dynamic or intricate configurations, making it ideal for aerospace and engineering applications involving compressible flows."

    "abstract": "Diffusion models often yield highly curved trajectories and noisy score targets due to an uninformative, memoryless forward process that induces independent data-noise coupling. We propose Adjoint Schrödinger Bridge Matching (ASBM), a generative modeling framework that recovers optimal trajectories in high dimensions via two stages. First, we view the Schrödinger Bridge (SB) forward dynamic as a coupling construction problem and learn it through a data-to-energy sampling perspective that transports data to an energy-defined prior. Then, we learn the backward generative dynamic with a simple matching loss supervised by the induced optimal coupling. By operating in a non-memoryless regime, ASBM produces significantly straighter and more efficient sampling paths. Compared to prior works, ASBM scales to high-dimensional data with notably improved stability and efficiency. Extensive experiments on image generation show that ASBM improves fidelity with fewer sampling steps. We further showcase the effectiveness of our optimal trajectory via distillation to a one-step generator."

    "abstract": "We study the builder-driven MEV arbitrage on BNB Smart Chain (BSC). BSC's Proposer--Builder Separation (PBS) adopts a leaner design: only whitelisted builders can participate, blocks are produced at shorter intervals, and private order flow bypasses the public mempool. These features have long raised community concerns over centralization, which we empirically confirm by tracing arbitrage activity of the two dominant builders from May to November 2025. Within months, 48Club and Blockrazor produced over 96\\% of blocks and captured about 92\\% of MEV profits. We find that profits concentrate in short, low-hop arbitrage routes over wrapped tokens and stablecoins, and that block construction rapidly converges toward monopoly. Beyond concentration alone, our analysis reveals a structural source of inequality: BSC's short block interval and whitelisted PBS collapse the contestable window for MEV competition, amplifying latency advantages and excluding slower builders and searchers. MEV extraction on BSC is not only more centralized than on Ethereum, but also structurally more vulnerable to censorship and weakened fairness."

Despite its privacy-preserving benefits, FL has significant drawbacks, including slow convergence, high communication cost, and non-independent-and-identically-distributed (non-IID) data. In this work, we present a novel FedAvg variation called Fractional-Order Federated Averaging (FOFedAvg), which incorporates Fractional-Order Stochastic Gradient Descent (FOSGD) to capture long-range relationships and deeper historical information. By introducing memory-aware fractional-order updates, FOFedAvg improves communication efficiency and accelerates convergence while mitigating instability caused by heterogeneous, non-IID client data. We compare FOFedAvg against a broad set of established federated optimization algorithms on benchmark datasets including MNIST, FEMNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, EMNIST, the Cleveland heart disease dataset, Sent140, PneumoniaMNIST, and Edge-IIoTset. Across a range of non-IID partitioning schemes, FOFedAvg is competitive with, and often outperforms, these baselines in terms of test performance and convergence speed. On the theoretical side, we prove that FOFedAvg converges to a stationary point under standard smoothness and bounded-variance assumptions for fractional order $0<α\\le 1$. Together, these results show that fractional-order, memory-aware updates can substantially improve the robustness and effectiveness of federated learning, offering a practical path toward distributed training on heterogeneous data."

    "abstract": "Multiple scattering of waves in complex media can be harnessed and tailored for diverse phenomena in sound and light. Despite the tremendous progress enabled by technologies such as time-reversal propagation and wavefront shaping, the full control of transmission matrix remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose a multi-scattering-based approach to design reflectionless complex media with a unitary transmission matrix of arbitrary structures. As such, the perfect transmission of waves through such a medium performs a unitary operation. Based on this principle, we experimentally demonstrated braiding of multiple waveguide modes in an acoustic waveguide via multiple scattering and showed non-Abelian characteristics arising from the concatenation of distinct complex media. Furthermore, we show that the principle can be extended for realizing arbitrary unitary operations beyond braiding. Our scheme uses generalized Wigner-Smith operators to design the optimal acoustic complex media with near-arbitrary targeted functionalities. The scheme is generally applicable beyond acoustics, with broad implications to other wave types. Our results demonstrate unprecedented control over multiple-scattering waves and are relevant to applications that require precise control over propagation, such as multiplexed communications, wave-based logic operations, and computations."

    "abstract": "Implicit feedback, such as user clicks, serves as the primary data source for modern recommender systems. However, click interactions inherently contain substantial noise, including accidental clicks, clickbait-induced interactions, and exploratory browsing behaviors that do not reflect genuine user preferences. Training recommendation models with such noisy positive samples leads to degraded prediction accuracy and unreliable recommendations. In this paper, we propose SAID (Semantics-Aware Implicit Denoising), a simple yet effective framework that leverages semantic consistency between user interests and item content to identify and downweight potentially noisy interactions. Our approach constructs textual user interest profiles from historical behaviors and computes semantic similarity with target item descriptions using pre-trained language model (PLM) based text encoders. The similarity scores are then transformed into sample weights that modulate the training loss, effectively reducing the impact of semantically inconsistent clicks. Unlike existing denoising methods that require complex auxiliary networks or multi-stage training procedures, SAID only modifies the loss function while keeping the backbone recommendation model unchanged. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that SAID consistently improves recommendation performance, achieving up to 2.2% relative improvement in AUC over strong baselines, with particularly notable robustness under high noise conditions."

    "abstract": "Transport in soft jammed materials is often described as fluid motion through a fixed structure, leading naturally to capillary based descriptions. This picture appears particularly appropriate in strongly jammed systems, where structural rearrangements are suppressed and little visible motion is observed. Here we investigate solvent transport in foam and show that this intuition fails to capture key aspects of the transport process. By directly observing both liquid penetration and bubble motion under controlled boundary conditions, we demonstrate that solvent transport is strongly influenced by the mechanical response of the foam structure, even though the intrinsic imbibition relative to the foam matrix remains purely capillary-driven. In closed systems, the jammed structure resists penetration and leads to a pronounced slowdown that cannot be accounted for by purely capillary descriptions. In contrast, in open systems, collective bubble motion accompanies solvent invasion, resulting in an apparent acceleration of transport. These results indicate that the lack of structural motion does not guarantee a purely capillary description of transport. Our findings reveal a boundary controlled coupling between flow and structure, and highlight the need to reconsider transport processes in soft jammed systems, including foams, dense colloids, and biological tissues."

However, existing MFL methods face three key limitations: a) they often specialize in specific modalities, and overlook effective shared complementary information across diverse modalities, hence limiting their generalizability for multi-disease analysis; b) they rely on computationally expensive models, restricting their applicability in resource-limited settings; and c) they lack robustness against adversarial attacks, compromising reliability in medical AI applications. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Multi-Attention Integration Learning (MAIL) network, incorporating two key components: a) an efficient residual learning attention block for capturing refined modality-specific multi-scale patterns and b) an efficient multimodal cross-attention module for learning enriched complementary shared representations across diverse modalities. Furthermore, to ensure adversarial robustness, we extend MAIL network to design Robust-MAIL by incorporating random projection filters and modulated attention noise. Extensive evaluations on 20 public datasets show that both MAIL and Robust-MAIL outperform existing methods, achieving performance gains of up to 9.34% while reducing computational costs by up to 78.3%. These results highlight the superiority of our approaches, ensuring more reliable predictions than top competitors. Code: https://github.com/misti1203/MAIL-Robust-MAIL."

In these settings, ER-MIA includes an arsenal of composable attack primitives and ensemble attacks that achieve high success rates under minimal attacker assumptions. Extensive experiments across multiple LLMs and long-term memory systems demonstrate that similarity-based retrieval constitutes a fundamental and system-level vulnerability, revealing security risks that persist across memory designs and application scenarios."

MAPF aims to move a group of agents from their corresponding starting locations to their goals. Lifelong MAPF (LMAPF) is a variant of MAPF that continuously assigns new goals for agents to reach. LMAPF applications, such as autonomous warehouses, often require a centralized, lifelong system to coordinate the movement of a fleet of robots, typically AGVs. However, existing works on MAPF and LMAPF often assume simplified kinodynamic models, such as pebble motion, as well as perfect execution and communication for AGVs. Prior work has presented SMART, a software capable of evaluating any MAPF algorithms while considering agent kinodynamics, communication delays, and execution uncertainties. However, SMART is designed for MAPF, not LMAPF. Generalizing SMART to an FMS requires many more design choices. First, an FMS parallelizes planning and execution, raising the question of when to plan. Second, given planners with varying optimality and differing agent-model assumptions, one must decide how to plan. Third, when the planner fails to return valid solutions, the system must determine how to recover. In this paper, we first present LSMART, an open-source simulator that incorporates all these considerations to evaluate any MAPF algorithms in an FMS. We then provide experiment results based on state-of-the-art methods for each design choice, offering guidance on how to effectively design centralized lifelong AGV Fleet Management Systems.

CrispEdit formulates editing as constrained optimization and enforces the constraint by projecting edit updates onto the low-curvature subspace of the capability-loss landscape. At the crux of CrispEdit is expressing capability constraint via Bregman divergence, whose quadratic form yields the Gauss-Newton Hessian exactly and even when the base model is not trained to convergence. We make this second-order procedure efficient at the LLM scale using Kronecker-factored approximate curvature (K-FAC) and a novel matrix-free projector that exploits Kronecker structure to avoid constructing massive projection matrices. Across standard model-editing benchmarks, CrispEdit achieves high edit success while keeping capability degradation below 1% on average across datasets, significantly improving over prior editors."

We address this challenge by proposing a TTA framework based on storing maximally informative (D-optimal) statistics, which jointly enables stable adaptation and principled parameter selection at test time. When applied to pretrained simulation surrogates, our method yields up to 7% out-of-distribution improvements at negligible computational cost. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic demonstration of effective TTA for high-dimensional simulation regression and generative design optimization, validated on the SIMSHIFT and EngiBench benchmarks."

We introduce FAST-EQA, a question-conditioned framework that (i) identifies likely visual targets, (ii) scores global regions of interest to guide navigation, and (iii) employs Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning over visual memory to answer confidently. FAST-EQA maintains a bounded scene memory that stores a fixed-capacity set of region-target hypotheses and updates them online, enabling robust handling of both single and multi-target questions without unbounded growth. To expand coverage efficiently, a global exploration policy treats narrow openings and doors as high-value frontiers, complementing local target seeking with minimal computation. Together, these components focus the agent's attention, improve scene coverage, and improve answer reliability while running substantially faster than prior approaches.

We study, for the first time, a task-incremental continual learning setting for chest radiograph classification, in which heterogeneous chest X-ray datasets arrive sequentially and task identifiers are unavailable at inference. We propose a continual adapter-based routing learning strategy for Chest X-rays (CARL-XRay) that maintains a fixed high-capacity backbone and incrementally allocates lightweight task-specific adapters and classifier heads. A latent task selector operates on task-adapted features and leverages both current and historical context preserved through compact prototypes and feature-level experience replay. This design supports stable task identification and adaptation across sequential updates while avoiding raw-image storage. Experiments on large-scale public chest radiograph datasets demonstrate robust performance retention and reliable task-aware inference under continual dataset ingestion. CARL-XRay outperforms joint training under task-unknown deployment, achieving higher routing accuracy (75.0\\% vs.\\ 62.5\\%), while maintaining competitive diagnostic performance with AUROC of 0.74 in the oracle setting with ground-truth task identity and 0.75 under task-unknown inference, using significantly fewer trainable parameters.

The universality of the vertical lift is a key part of the axioms of a tangent category as presented in [4]. The categorical dimension presented in this paper provides insight into the nature of this property. The main result is Theorem 3.7, showing that if it exists, the dimension of the tangent bundle must fulfill an equation relating the dimension of the tangent bundle to the dimension of the base. In particular, when the dimension function is a strong tangent dimension, Theorem 3.8 shows that the dimension of the tangent bundles is either twice the dimension of the base, or equal to the dimension of the base. Many examples of dimension functions are provided to demonstrate the utility of the definition. In particular, a consequence of Theorem 3.7 is that there are limitations on which functors may be tangent bundle endofunctors for a category. We show that this means that there are no non-trivial tangent structures on sets, as an example."

    "abstract": "Fine-tuning aligned language models on benign tasks unpredictably degrades safety guardrails, even when training data contains no harmful content and developers have no adversarial intent. We show that the prevailing explanation, that fine-tuning updates should be orthogonal to safety-critical directions in high-dimensional parameter space, offers false reassurance: we show this orthogonality is structurally unstable and collapses under the dynamics of gradient descent. We then resolve this through a novel geometric analysis, proving that alignment concentrates in low-dimensional subspaces with sharp curvature, creating a brittle structure that first-order methods cannot detect or defend. While initial fine-tuning updates may indeed avoid these subspaces, the curvature of the fine-tuning loss generates second-order acceleration that systematically steers trajectories into alignment-sensitive regions. We formalize this mechanism through the Alignment Instability Condition, three geometric properties that, when jointly satisfied, lead to safety degradation. Our main result establishes a quartic scaling law: alignment loss grows with the fourth power of training time, governed by the sharpness of alignment geometry and the strength of curvature coupling between the fine-tuning task and safety-critical parameters. These results expose a structural blind spot in the current safety paradigm. The dominant approaches to safe fine-tuning address only the initial snapshot of a fundamentally dynamic problem. Alignment fragility is not a bug to be patched; it is an intrinsic geometric property of gradient descent on curved manifolds. Our results motivate the development of curvature-aware methods, and we hope will further enable a shift in alignment safety analysis from reactive red-teaming to predictive diagnostics for open-weight model deployment."

    "abstract": "Understanding how polymer architecture governs transport through nanopores is essential for nanocomposite fabrication, membrane design, and polymer upcycling. However, the effect of the nanoscale structure of copolymers on chain transport through nanoporous media remains poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrate that simply inverting the surface orientation of lamellar poly(styrene-block-2-vinylpyridine) (PS-b-P2VP) diblock copolymers, composed of two monomers with strongly contrasting affinities for SiO2, at the entrance of nanoporous silica significantly alters the kinetics of capillary rise infiltration. Using in situ spectroscopic ellipsometry, we find that infiltration of symmetric PS-b-P2VP into silica nanoparticle (SiO2 NP) packings is significantly faster when the P2VP domain is the top layer of the film and first contacts the nanoparticles, compared to when the PS domain is the top layer. Coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations reveal that this difference originates from block-specific adsorption pathways that reorganize the nanophase structure around nanoparticles: P2VP-first infiltration forms thin adsorbed layers that drive PS into the pore interiors, generating continuous interfacial pathways that enable rapid, interface-mediated transport. In contrast, PS-first infiltration produces thicker P2VP layers that isolate PS domains and disrupt pathway connectivity, forcing chains to rely on a slower, connectivity-limited transport mechanism through P2VP-rich interstitial regions. Above the order-disorder transition, or upon silanizing nanoparticles to neutralize surface affinity, the rate difference disappears. These findings demonstrate how the interplay between nanoscale domain configuration and polymer-surface affinity governs infiltration dynamics, providing mechanistic insight into tuning transport in nanostructured block copolymers."

As one instantiation, we show how Active Inference, a concept from neuroscience, can support self-organizing services in continuously interpreting their environment to optimize service quality. Still, we conclude that no existing solution achieves our vision, but that research on service orchestration faces several structural challenges. Most notably: provide standardized simulation and evaluation environments for comparing the performance of orchestration mechanisms. Together, the challenges outline a research roadmap toward resilient and scalable service orchestration in the CC."

In general, it is shown that SGE enables the use of any classical general solution representation combined with a Helmholtz decomposition for the gradient part of the displacement field. Consistency is also established between the presented Papkovich-Neuber representation and the general solutions of SGE proposed previously by Mindlin (1964), Lurie et al.

    "abstract": "A growing literature uses large language models (LLMs) as synthetic participants to generate cost-effective and nearly instantaneous responses in social science experiments. However, there is limited guidance on when such simulations support valid inference about human behavior. We contrast two strategies for obtaining valid estimates of causal effects and clarify the assumptions under which each is suitable for exploratory versus confirmatory research. Heuristic approaches seek to establish that simulated and observed human behavior are interchangeable through prompt engineering, model fine-tuning, and other repair strategies designed to reduce LLM-induced inaccuracies. While useful for many exploratory tasks, heuristic approaches lack the formal statistical guarantees typically required for confirmatory research. In contrast, statistical calibration combines auxiliary human data with statistical adjustments to account for discrepancies between observed and simulated responses. Under explicit assumptions, statistical calibration preserves validity and provides more precise estimates of causal effects at lower cost than experiments that rely solely on human participants. Yet the potential of both approaches depends on how well LLMs approximate the relevant populations. We consider what opportunities are overlooked when researchers focus myopically on substituting LLMs for human participants in a study."

To automate their analysis, numerous deep learning methods based on convolutional neural networks and Vision Transformers have been developed and have achieved strong performance in segmentation and classification tasks. However, due to the large size and complex cellular organization of WSIs, these models rely on patch-based representations, losing vital tissue-level context. We propose using scalable Graph Transformers on a full-WSI cell graph for classification. We evaluate this methodology on a challenging task: the classification of healthy versus tumor epithelial cells in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC), where both cell types exhibit very similar morphologies and are therefore difficult to differentiate for image-based approaches. We first compared image-based and graph-based methods on a single WSI. Graph Transformer models SGFormer and DIFFormer achieved balanced accuracies of $85.2 \\pm 1.5$ ($\\pm$ standard error) and $85.1 \\pm 2.5$ in 3-fold cross-validation, respectively, whereas the best image-based method reached $81.2 \\pm 3.0$. By evaluating several node feature configurations, we found that the most informative representation combined morphological and texture features as well as the cell classes of non-epithelial cells, highlighting the importance of the surrounding cellular context. We then extended our work to train on several WSIs from several patients. To address the computational constraints of image-based models, we extracted four $2560 \\times 2560$ pixel patches from each image and converted them into graphs. In this setting, DIFFormer achieved a balanced accuracy of $83.6 \\pm 1.9$ (3-fold cross-validation), while the state-of-the-art image-based model CellViT256 reached $78.1 \\pm 0.5$."

PIFF is widely used in leading weak-lensing surveys, including the Dark Energy Survey (DES), the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) Survey, and the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). The PSF characterizes how a point source, such as a star, is imaged after its light traverses the atmosphere and telescope optics, effectively representing the \"blurred fingerprint'' of the entire imaging system. Accurate PSF modeling is essential for weak gravitational lensing analyses, as biases in its estimation propagate directly into cosmic shear measurements -- one of the primary cosmological probes of the expansion history of the Universe and the growth of large-scale structure for dark energy studies. To address the limitations of PIFF, which constructs PSF models independently for each CCD and therefore loses spatial coherence across the focal plane, we introduce a deep-learning-based framework for PSF reconstruction. In this approach, an autoencoder is trained on stellar images obtained with the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) of the Subaru Telescope and combined with a Gaussian process to interpolate the PSF across the telescope's full field of view. This hybrid model captures systematic variations across the focal plane and achieves a reconstruction error of $3.4 \\times 10^{-6}$ compared to PIFF's $3.7 \\times 10^{-6}$, laying the foundation for integration into the LSST Science Pipelines."

Belief-based methods are limited by their focus on past experiences without fully leveraging global information, while communication methods often lack a robust model to effectively utilize the auxiliary information they provide. To solve this issue, we propose Global State Diffusion Algorithm~(GlobeDiff) to infer the global state based on the local observations. By formulating the state inference process as a multi-modal diffusion process, GlobeDiff overcomes ambiguities in state estimation while simultaneously inferring the global state with high fidelity. We prove that the estimation error of GlobeDiff under both unimodal and multi-modal distributions can be bounded. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that GlobeDiff achieves superior performance and is capable of accurately inferring the global state."

    "abstract": "Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires an agent to follow natural-language instructions and navigate through previously unseen environments. Recent approaches increasingly employ large language models (LLMs) as high-level navigators due to their flexibility and reasoning capability. However, prompt-based LLM navigation often suffers from inefficient decision-making, as the model must repeatedly interpret instructions from scratch and reason over noisy and verbose navigable candidates at each step. In this paper, we propose a retrieval-augmented framework to improve the efficiency and stability of LLM-based VLN without modifying or fine-tuning the underlying language model. Our approach introduces retrieval at two complementary levels. At the episode level, an instruction-level embedding retriever selects semantically similar successful navigation trajectories as in-context exemplars, providing task-specific priors for instruction grounding. At the step level, an imitation-learned candidate retriever prunes irrelevant navigable directions before LLM inference, reducing action ambiguity and prompt complexity. Both retrieval modules are lightweight, modular, and trained independently of the LLM. We evaluate our method on the Room-to-Room (R2R) benchmark. Experimental results demonstrate consistent improvements in Success Rate, Oracle Success Rate, and SPL on both seen and unseen environments. Ablation studies further show that instruction-level exemplar retrieval and candidate pruning contribute complementary benefits to global guidance and step-wise decision efficiency. These results indicate that retrieval-augmented decision support is an effective and scalable strategy for enhancing LLM-based vision-and-language navigation."

These can be modulated with high bandwidth controlled by the local tweezer intensity.

We introduce Average Minimum Distance (AMD) and Symmetric Average Minimum Distance (SAMD), new measures that quantify semantic change via local correspondence between word usages across time periods. Across multiple languages, encoder models, and representation spaces, we show that AMD often provides more robust performance, particularly under dimensionality reduction and with non-specialised encoders, while SAMD excels with specialised encoders. We suggest that LSCD may benefit from considering alternative semantic change metrics beyond APD and PRT, with AMD offering a robust option for contextualised embedding-based analysis."

    "abstract": "Connecting the dynamics of biomolecular networks to experimentally measurable cell phenotypes remains a central challenge in systems biology. Here we introduce a model-based definition of phenotype as a partial steady state that is committed to a certain dynamical outcome while otherwise being minimally constrained. We focus on Boolean models and define \\emph{dynamical phenotypes} as complete trap spaces that maximally specify a chosen set of phenotype-determining nodes that correspond to biomarkers while keeping external inputs unconstrained. We show that dynamical phenotypes can be efficiently identified without full attractor enumeration. Using four published models, including a 70-node Boolean model of T cell differentiation, we show that dynamical phenotypes recover known cell types and activation states, and indicate the environmental conditions ensuring their existence. We also propose a method to identify informative phenotype-determining nodes based on the canalization of the Boolean functions. This method reveals biologically relevant cell state information that is complementary to the phenotypes manually defined by model creators and is validated by two attractor-based approaches. Our results demonstrate that dynamical phenotypes provide a scalable framework for linking model structure, external inputs, and phenotypic outcomes, and offer a principled tool for model-guided biomarker selection."

    "abstract": "Modern digital services have evolved into indispensable tools, driving the present large-scale information systems. Yet, the prevailing platform-centric model, where services are optimized for platform-driven metrics such as engagement and conversion, often fails to align with users' true needs. While platform technologies have advanced significantly-especially with the integration of large language models (LLMs)-we argue that improvements in platform service quality do not necessarily translate to genuine user benefit. Instead, platform-centric services prioritize provider objectives over user welfare, resulting in conflicts against user interests. This paper argues that the future of digital services should shift from a platform-centric to a user-centric agent. These user-centric agents prioritize privacy, align with user-defined goals, and grant users control over their preferences and actions. With advancements in LLMs and on-device intelligence, the realization of this vision is now feasible. This paper explores the opportunities and challenges in transitioning to user-centric intelligence, presents a practical device-cloud pipeline for its implementation, and discusses the necessary governance and ecosystem structures for its adoption."

In this work, we investigate whether these symmetries can be broken by an uncountable infinity of fields. We find that the symmetries can be broken, but as soon as we add these fields the EFT breaks down and in some cases decompactifies to a higher-dimensional theory without the non-compact gauge symmetry, akin to undoing a Kaluza-Klein reduction on a non-compact space. We make various comments on the species scale, free parameters, and the Weak Gravity Conjecture along the way."

    "abstract": "Northrop Frye's theory of four fundamental narrative genres (comedy, romance, tragedy, satire) has profoundly influenced literary criticism, yet computational approaches to his framework have focused primarily on narrative patterns rather than character functions. In this paper, we present a new character function framework that complements pattern-based analysis by examining how archetypal roles manifest differently across Frye's genres. Drawing on Jungian archetype theory, we derive four universal character functions (protagonist, mentor, antagonist, companion) by mapping them to Jung's psychic structure components. These functions are then specialized into sixteen genre-specific roles based on prototypical works. To validate this framework, we conducted a multi-model study using six state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) to evaluate character-role correspondences across 40 narrative works. The validation employed both positive samples (160 valid correspondences) and negative samples (30 invalid correspondences) to evaluate whether models both recognize valid correspondences and reject invalid ones. LLMs achieved substantial performance (mean balanced accuracy of 82.5%) with strong inter-model agreement (Fleiss' $κ$ = 0.600), demonstrating that the proposed correspondences capture systematic structural patterns. Performance varied by genre (ranging from 72.7% to 89.9%) and role (52.5% to 99.2%), with qualitative analysis revealing that variations reflect genuine narrative properties, including functional distribution in romance and deliberate archetypal subversion in satire. This character-based approach demonstrates the potential of LLM-supported methods for computational narratology and provides a foundation for future development of narrative generation methods and interactive storytelling applications."

Several successful CEvNS measurements have been achieved in recent years with tens-of-kg detector masses, with a CsI scintillating crystal, a liquid argon single-phase detector, and high-purity germanium spectrometers. For the next phase, COHERENT aims at high-statistics detection of CEvNS events for precision tests of the standard model of particle physics, and to probe new physics beyond-the-standard model. Percent-level precision can be achieved by lowering thresholds, reducing backgrounds, and by scaling up the detector masses. It goes hand in hand with benchmarking the neutrino flux from the SNS. Further detectors will measure CEvNS in additional nuclei, including lighter target nuclei such as sodium and neon, to continue to test the expected neutron-number-squared dependence of the cross section. COHERENT can furthermore study charged-current and neutral-current inelastic neutrino-nucleus cross sections on various nuclei at neutrino energies below $\\sim$50 MeV.

Specifically, we aim to learn a generative surrogate model which approximates the underlying, data-generating DS, and recreates its long-term properties (`climate statistics'). In scientific and medical areas, in particular, these models need to be mechanistically tractable -- through their mathematical analysis we would like to obtain insight into the recovered system's workings. Piecewise-linear (PL), ReLU-based RNNs (PLRNNs) have a strong track-record in this regard, representing SOTA DSR models while allowing mathematical insight by virtue of their PL design. However, all current PLRNN variants are discrete-time maps. This is in disaccord with the assumed continuous-time nature of most physical and biological processes, and makes it hard to accommodate data arriving at irregular temporal intervals. Neural ODEs are one solution, but they do not reach the DSR performance of PLRNNs and often lack their tractability. Here we develop theory for continuous-time PLRNNs (cPLRNNs): We present a novel algorithm for training and simulating such models, bypassing numerical integration by efficiently exploiting their PL structure. We further demonstrate how important topological objects like equilibria or limit cycles can be determined semi-analytically in trained models. We compare cPLRNNs to both their discrete-time cousins as well as Neural ODEs on DSR benchmarks, including systems with discontinuities which come with hard thresholds."

Moreover, also the starburst ring of these sources is bright in the radio and hence, a potential source of $γ$-rays and neutrinos. We aim to explain the non-thermal features of these two sources with our homogeneous steady-state Seyfert-starburst composite model, which we refined in this work. Hereby, we account for stochastic diffuse acceleration and energy losses within the corona and $γγ$-pair attenuation of the escaping $γ$-rays. Since the non-thermal features of Seyfert sources contribute only marginally to the electromagnetic spectrum, only few data points can be assigned to the starburst ring or the AGN corona. Hence, prior information on the physical parameters is incorporated within a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach to avoid overfitting. Based on this Bayesian parameter study we show, that the non-thermal features of NGC 1068 can be explained well. Still a more detailed treatment of the spatial inhomogeneities in the central region of the AGN could further improve the fit results. This manifests itself even more clearly in the case of NGC 7469, where the mm-bump needs to emerge from a coronal size $R_{\\rm c}>100\\,\\mathcal{R}_{\\rm s}$, whereas (TeV-PeV)-neutrino emission requires $R_{\\rm c}< 10\\,\\mathcal{R}_{\\rm s}$. Similar to what has previously been shown in other wavebands, our analysis highlights that the spatial extension of the so-called AGN corona depends the considered energy of the messenger. Hence, it seems that there is not a unique edge of the corona and a substantial progress in the understanding of these phenomena is expected if future analysis account for these spatial inhomogeneities."

Classical stopping rules are strict and non-randomized, limiting natural exploration in RL settings. To address this, we introduce entropy regularization, allowing randomized stopping policies that balance exploitation and exploration. We derive an explicit analytical solution to the regularized problem and prove convergence of the associated free boundary to the classical stopping threshold as the entropy vanishes. The regularized problem admits a natural formulation as a singular stochastic control problem. Building on this structure, we propose both model-based and model-free policy iteration algorithms to learn the optimal boundary. The model-free method operates without knowledge of system dynamics, using only trajectories from the stochastic environment. We establish convergence guarantees and illustrate strong numerical performance. This framework provides a principled and tractable approach for data-driven stopping problems under uncertainty."

We propose the Neural Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (Neural-POD), a plug-and-play neural operator framework that constructs nonlinear, orthogonal basis functions in infinite-dimensional space using neural networks. Unlike the classical Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD), which is limited to linear subspace approximations obtained through singular value decomposition (SVD), Neural-POD formulates basis construction as a sequence of residual minimization problems solved through neural network training. Each basis function is obtained by learning to represent the remaining structure in the data, following a process analogous to Gram--Schmidt orthogonalization. This neural formulation introduces several key advantages over classical POD: it enables optimization in arbitrary norms (e.g., $L^2$, $L^1$), learns mappings between infinite-dimensional function spaces that is resolution-invariant, generalizes effectively to unseen parameter regimes, and inherently captures nonlinear structures in complex spatiotemporal systems. The resulting basis functions are interpretable, reusable, and enabling integration into both reduced order modeling (ROM) and operator learning frameworks such as deep operator learning (DeepONet). We demonstrate the robustness of Neural-POD with different complex spatiotemporal systems, including the Burgers' and Navier-Stokes equations. We further show that Neural-POD serves as a high performance, plug-and-play bridge between classical Galerkin projection and operator learning that enables consistent integration with both projection-based reduced order models and DeepONet frameworks."

However, conventional BP writing remains a rigid, linear process that often fails to reflect the dynamic and recursive nature of entrepreneurial ideation. This mismatch is particularly challenging for novice entrepreneurial students, who struggle with the substantial cognitive demands of developing and refining ideas. While reflection and meta-reflection are critical strategies for fostering divergent and convergent thinking, existing writing tools rarely scaffold these higher-order processes. To address this gap, we present the Meflex System, a large language model (LLM)-based writing tool that integrates BP writing scaffolding with a nonlinear idea canvas to support iterative ideation through reflection and meta-reflection. We report findings from an exploratory user study with 30 participants that examined the system's usability and cognitive impact. Results show that Meflex effectively scaffolds BP writing, promotes divergent thinking through LLM-supported reflection, and enhances meta-reflective awareness while reducing cognitive load during complex idea development. These findings highlight the potential of non-linear LLM-based writing tools to foster deeper and coherent entrepreneurial thinking."

A multi-connected Jaynes--Cummings lattice is a one-dimensional lattice constructed from alternating qubits and resonators with different left and right couplings. The nearest-neighbour interaction or cross-Kerr coupling is implemented dispersively through ladder-type qutrits between each nearest neighboring pair of resonator modes. Projecting onto the lower-polaritonic manifold, we derive an extended two-mode (bipartite) Bose--Hubbard-like model featuring on-site and attractive nearest-neighbor interactions. Employing a continuum bosonization approach, we express the Hamiltonian in terms of symmetric ($+$) and antisymmetric ($-$) collective modes. In the regime where the ($-$) sector acquires a finite gap, one can reduce the system to an effective single-component Luttinger liquid model for the $+$ sector. The cross-Kerr term reduces the compressibility of the ($+$) mode, thereby enhancing the corresponding Luttinger parameter $K_{+}$, resulting in the slower algebraic decay of single-particle correlations, $G(x)\\propto|x|^{-1/(4K_{+})}$."

    "abstract": "We develop a perturbation theory to study the shape and the orientation of an initially spherical capsule of radius R with a viscosity contrast, a surface tension σ and a bending rigidity $κ$ in linear flows. The elastic mechanical response of membrane to deformations is described by three elastic constitutive law which are either Hookean, Neohookean or Skalak type leading to the introduction of a surface shear elastic modulus $G_s$ and the Poisson ratio (or analog quantities). At the leading order, the deformation, i.e. the so-called Taylor parameter is proportional to the elastic capillary number Ca which evaluates the ratio between the external viscous stress and the elastic membrane response. In this linear regime, the results do not depend on the elastic constitutive law as expected. Without surface tension and bending rigidity, we recover the results of Barthes-Biesel & Rallison (1981) and notably the fact that the Taylor parameter does not depend on the viscosity contrast $λ$ contrary to the case of a viscous droplet. In our more general model, the deformation does no longer depend on $λ$ at the upper order. Now, the Taylor parameter also depends on two other dimensionless numbers: the surface elastocapillary ratio $σ/G_s$ and the dimensionless bending rigidity $B= κ/G_sR^2$. At the further order, the angle of inclination of the capsule with the direction of the shear flow, the analog of the Chaffey and Brenner equation for droplets is determined in each case. The results are in excellent agreement with the numerical ones performed with a code based on the boundary integral method providing an useful method to valid numerical developments."

The interaction between these plasma cells and the Sun's magnetic field provides valuable insights into plasma dynamics near the solar surface and how they evolve in the presence of magnetic fields. This study analyses the morphological characteristics of solar convective cells, investigating the relationship between magnetic field properties and granule dynamics - specifically how granule area, shape, and brightness vary under different magnetic field conditions. Observations of the active region NOAA 11768 were taken with the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope (SST). A segmentation algorithm was applied to continuum intensity images to identify individual granules and determine their sizes, shapes, and mean brightness. The magnetic field vector and line-of-sight velocity were derived from CRISP spectropolarimetric data to investigate their role in shaping granule properties. We find that granular area decreases systematically with increasing magnetic field strength, with the largest granules occurring in non-magnetic regions and a mean granule area of approximately 1.58 arcsec$^2$ (effective diameter of 1.42 arcseconds). Both mean continuum intensity and granule size decrease with stronger fields, confirming the suppression of convective energy transport in magnetised regions. No correlation was found between mean granule brightness and mean up-flow velocity. Highly elongated granules appear in both magnetic and non-magnetic regions, while near-circular granules are exclusive to non-magnetic areas. An alignment between granule major axes and magnetic field azimuth is observed where the horizontal field component is strong, confirming that granules are highly sensitive to magnetic fields, which inhibit the lateral expansion of convective cells."

In particular, we describe several score functions for discrete algorithms which result in approximations of Glauber dynamics for the correct target distribution.

Although automated tools can enhance the identification of sexist content, they are often restricted to binary classification. Consequently, more subtle manifestations of sexism may remain undetected due to the lack of fine-grained, context-sensitive labels. To address this issue, we make the following contributions: (1) we present FineMuSe, a new multimodal sexism detection dataset in Spanish that includes both binary and fine-grained annotations; (2) we introduce a comprehensive hierarchical taxonomy that encompasses forms of sexism, non-sexism, and rhetorical devices of irony and humor; and (3) we evaluate a wide range of LLMs for both binary and fine-grained sexism detection. Our findings indicate that multimodal LLMs perform competitively with human annotators in identifying nuanced forms of sexism; however, they struggle to capture co-occurring sexist types when these are conveyed through visual cues."

A key goal is to design node embeddings whose dot products capture meaningful notions of node similarity induced by the graph. Graph kernels offer a principled way to define such similarities, but their direct computation is often prohibitive for large networks. Inspired by random feature methods for kernel approximation in Euclidean spaces, we introduce randomized spectral node embeddings whose dot products estimate a low-rank approximation of any specific graph kernel. We provide theoretical and empirical results showing that our embeddings achieve more accurate kernel approximations than existing methods, particularly for spectrally localized kernels. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of randomized spectral constructions for scalable and principled graph representation learning."

SecCodeBench-V2 comprises 98 generation and fix scenarios derived from Alibaba Group's industrial productions, where the underlying security issues span 22 common CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) categories across five programming languages: Java, C, Python, Go, and Node.js. SecCodeBench-V2 adopts a function-level task formulation: each scenario provides a complete project scaffold and requires the model to implement or patch a designated target function under fixed interfaces and dependencies. For each scenario, SecCodeBench-V2 provides executable proof-of-concept (PoC) test cases for both functional validation and security verification. All test cases are authored and double-reviewed by security experts, ensuring high fidelity, broad coverage, and reliable ground truth. Beyond the benchmark itself, we build a unified evaluation pipeline that assesses models primarily via dynamic execution. For most scenarios, we compile and run model-generated artifacts in isolated environments and execute PoC test cases to validate both functional correctness and security properties. For scenarios where security issues cannot be adjudicated with deterministic test cases, we additionally employ an LLM-as-a-judge oracle. To summarize performance across heterogeneous scenarios and difficulty levels, we design a Pass@K-based scoring protocol with principled aggregation over scenarios and severity, enabling holistic and comparable evaluation across models. Overall, SecCodeBench-V2 provides a rigorous and reproducible foundation for assessing the security posture of AI coding assistants, with results and artifacts released at https://alibaba.github.io/sec-code-bench.

    "abstract": "The superficial alignment hypothesis (SAH) posits that large language models learn most of their knowledge during pre-training, and that post-training merely surfaces this knowledge. The SAH, however, lacks a precise definition, which has led to (i) different and seemingly orthogonal arguments supporting it, and (ii) important critiques to it. We propose a new metric called task complexity: the length of the shortest program that achieves a target performance on a task. In this framework, the SAH simply claims that pre-trained models drastically reduce the complexity of achieving high performance on many tasks. Our definition unifies prior arguments supporting the SAH, interpreting them as different strategies to find such short programs. Experimentally, we estimate the task complexity of mathematical reasoning, machine translation, and instruction following; we then show that these complexities can be remarkably low when conditioned on a pre-trained model. Further, we find that pre-training enables access to strong performances on our tasks, but it can require programs of gigabytes of length to access them. Post-training, on the other hand, collapses the complexity of reaching this same performance by several orders of magnitude. Overall, our results highlight that task adaptation often requires surprisingly little information -- often just a few kilobytes."

    "abstract": "Microwave synthesizers are central to test and measurement systems across applications including wireless communications, radar, spectroscopy, and time and frequency metrology. State-of-the-art microwave sources, however, are fundamentally constrained by trade-offs between frequency tunability and spectral purity. Electro-optic frequency division (eOFD) is an emerging technique for dividing down the purity of optical sources to the microwave domain. Previously reported eOFD-based synthesizers generally have limited tunability due to feedback stabilization requirements. Here we demonstrate a feed-forward eOFD architecture in which the frequency tunability of a microwave source is preserved while optical spectral purity is divided through feed-forward cancellation, without any downstream electronic frequency synthesis. By canceling the phase noise of the microwave source without feedback, this eOFD approach removes loop bandwidth and source noise constraints observed in prior eOFD architectures. We achieve octave-spanning tunability, including the entire X-band, with phase noise below -140 dBc/Hz at kilohertz offsets and a high-frequency noise floor between -155 dBc/Hz and -145 dBc/Hz for carrier frequencies from 8 to 16 GHz. This performance corresponds to single-femtosecond integrated timing jitter, enabling, to our knowledge, the first demonstration of coherent, optically referenced microwave synthesis under wide tuning with this level of spectral purity."

    "abstract": "21cm radiation from neutral hydrogen serves as a direct probe of the Epoch of Reionization. However, both its detection and physical interpretation are severely hindered by contamination from astrophysical foreground emission and instrumental noise that are several orders of magnitude brighter than the signal of interest. A promising way to tackle these challenges is to cross-correlate the 21cm signal with other independent tracers of large-scale structure, most notably high-redshift galaxies. Besides validating putative 21cm detections, such joint analyses are expected to provide independent insights into the properties of ionizing sources and the evolving morphology of ionized regions during reionization. The 21cm signal, however, is intrinsically highly non-Gaussian, limiting the effectiveness of conventional two-point cross-correlation statistics, which capture information only up to the second order. In this work, we therefore investigate the utility of k-nearest-neighbour cumulative distribution functions (kNN CDF), which encode information from the joint clustering at all orders, as an alternative framework for probing 21cm-galaxy cross-correlations. Using self-consistently simulated mock 21cm fields and a catalog of line-emitting galaxies at z = 7, we conducted a proof-of-concept study comparing the kNN CDF formalism and the two-point cross-correlation approach. We find that the kNN CDF statistics outperform the two-point statistics in detecting 21cm-galaxy cross-correlations, even in the presence of instrumental noise and aggressive foreground filtering. Moreover, at a fixed global ionized fraction, it is even able to differentiate between reionization models that remain indistinguishable using two-point statistics. These results demonstrate the power and unexplored potential of exploiting higher-order statistics for extracting maximal information from 21cm-galaxy synergies."

By using a pseudo-similarity transformation to the non-Hermitian operators, we prove their Hermiticity with a suitable positive-definite pseudo-metric operator. We then construct Hilbert space representations associated with these pseudo-Hermitian operators. Finally, we study the eigenvalue problem of a free particle in this deformed space and we show that this deformation curved the quantum levels allowing particles to jump from one state to another with low energy transitions."

Using this structure, we first prove that a finite equatorial high-frequency package of quasinormal-mode frequencies determines the mass and rotation parameter $(M,a)$ (for fixed cosmological constant $Λ>0$), with a quantitative stability estimate. As a key geometric input we compute explicit second-order (in $a$) corrections to the equatorial photon-orbit invariants which control the leading real and imaginary parts of the quasinormal modes. Finally, allowing $Λ$ to vary in a compact interval, we show that adding one damping observable (the scaled imaginary part of a single equatorial mode) yields a three-parameter inverse theorem: a finite package of three independent real observables determines $(M,a,Λ)$ locally in the slow-rotation regime away from $a=0$."

To advance model alignment and autonomy, we implement a new asynchronous reinforcement learning infrastructure that drastically improves post-training efficiency by decoupling generation from training. Furthermore, we propose novel asynchronous agent RL algorithms that further improve RL quality, enabling the model to learn from complex, long-horizon interactions more effectively. Through these innovations, GLM-5 achieves state-of-the-art performance on major open benchmarks.

    "abstract": "Laser guide stars (LGSs) have been deployed for the last 20-30 years in ground-based astronomical telescopes to overcome the limited sky coverage of classical adaptive optics (AO) systems. Unfortunately, slow altitude drifts of the sodium layer compromise focus measurements, generating the so-called slow focus error, and, consequently, a natural guide star (NGS) is needed to compensate for that error. Our goal is to develop and operationalize a focal plane wavefront sensing (FPWFS) technique for slow focus tracking for the Keck I telescope, which can significantly increase sky coverage and allow slow focus tracking at higher frequencies, reducing the lag error. We develop, characterize, and compare three different FPWFS algorithms, namely Gerchberg-Saxton (GS), linearized focal plane technique (LiFT), and Gaussian fit (Gf). These algorithms were studied for the specific purpose of slow focus sensing in the NIR (H and K bands) using numerical simulations and data collected at Keck in 2025 (bench and on-sky). The three algorithms were studied and characterized against different criteria such as linearity, computational costs, and resistance to low signal-to-noise ratio and/or residuals. From the results obtained, the main candidate for an on-sky deployment was GS. On-sky tests showed promising results, with GS successfully compensating for purposely introduced focus errors, even under the presence of high turbulence conditions. This work can also be extrapolated to other existing 8-10 m class telescopes, or even future 30-40 m class telescopes, where the use of FPWFS can significantly improve sky coverage and reduce the lag error."

These folk theories highlight a breakdown in algorithmic design that we explain using the framework of entanglement, a phenomenon where there is a disconnect between users' actions and platform outcomes on an emotional level. Participants' designs to address entanglement and mitigate harms centered on contextualizing their engagement and restoring explicit user control on social media.

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative condition necessitating early and precise diagnosis to provide prompt clinical management. Given the paramount importance of early diagnosis, recent studies have increasingly focused on computer-aided diagnostic models to enhance precision and reliability. However, most graph-based approaches still rely on fixed structural designs, which restrict their flexibility and limit generalization across heterogeneous patient data. To overcome these limitations, the Meta-Relational Copula-Based Graph Attention Network (MRC-GAT) is proposed as an efficient multimodal model for AD classification tasks. The proposed architecture, copula-based similarity alignment, relational attention, and node fusion are integrated as the core components of episodic meta-learning, such that the multimodal features, including risk factors (RF), Cognitive test scores, and MRI attributes, are first aligned via a copula-based transformation in a common statistical space and then combined by a multi-relational attention mechanism. According to evaluations performed on the TADPOLE and NACC datasets, the MRC-GAT model achieved accuracies of 96.87% and 92.31%, respectively, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance compared to existing diagnostic models. Finally, the proposed model confirms the robustness and applicability of the proposed method by providing interpretability at various stages of disease diagnosis."

In this paper, we present an end-to-end pipeline for the generation and causal estimation of latent textual interventions. Our work first performs hypothesis generation and steering via sparse autoencoders (SAEs), followed by robust causal estimation. Our pipeline addresses both computational and statistical challenges in text-as-treatment experiments. We demonstrate that naive estimation of causal effects suffers from significant bias as text inherently conflates treatment and covariate information. We describe the estimation bias induced in this setting and propose a solution based on covariate residualization. Our empirical results show that our pipeline effectively induces variation in target features and mitigates estimation error, providing a robust foundation for causal effect estimation in text-as-treatment settings."

We have examined 3D orientation and elastic strain tensor fields across 82 $γ$ grains together with the spatial distribution of over 37,000 MC carbides in an ABD-900AM alloy sample manufactured by the Directed Energy Deposition (DED) LAM process. Carbides are spatially associated with the cellular sub-grain network with a weak but present orientation relationship with their parent $γ$ grains. The MC carbides, known to be Ti, Ta and Nb rich, form in regions of high solute segregation, resulting in a significant volumetric lattice parameter patterning in the associated $γ$ phase regions. These chemically distinct solute-rich regions possess a higher associated elastic modulus compared to intercellular regions and determine the local residual stress patterning. These results provide the first non-destructive 3D study of the relationship between rapid solidification-induced segregation, deformation heterogeneity and carbide architectures in an additively manufactured Ni-based superalloy. The insights provide crucial detail to rationalise LAM process parameter optimisation and the coupled spatially governed structural performance."

In this work, we present a unified security framework for DB-CRNs that simultaneously provides location privacy, user anonymity, verifiable location, and DoS resilience. Our framework, denoted as SLAPX, enables privacy-preserving spectrum queries using delegatable anonymous credentials, supports adaptive location verification without revealing precise user location, and mitigates DoS attacks through verifiable delay functions (VDFs) combined with RLRS-based rate limiting. Extensive cryptographic benchmarking and network simulations demonstrate that SLAPX achieves significantly lower latency and communication overhead than existing solutions while effectively resisting location spoofing and DoS attacks. These results show that SLAPX is practical and well-suited for secure next-generation DB-CRN deployments."

    "abstract": "As artificial intelligence (AI) increasingly integrates into crowdfunding practices, strategic disclosure of AI involvement has become critical. Yet, empirical insights into how different disclosure strategies influence investor decisions remain limited. Drawing on signaling theory and Aristotle's rhetorical framework, we examine how mandatory AI disclosure affects crowdfunding performance and how substantive signals (degree of AI involvement) and rhetorical signals (logos/explicitness, ethos/authenticity, pathos/emotional tone) moderate these effects. Leveraging Kickstarter's mandatory AI disclosure policy as a natural experiment and four supplementary online experiments, we find that mandatory AI disclosure significantly reduces crowdfunding performance: funds raised decline by 39.8% and backer counts by 23.9% for AI-involved projects. However, this adverse effect is systematically moderated by disclosure strategy. Greater AI involvement amplifies the negative effects of AI disclosure, while high authenticity and high explicitness mitigate them. Interestingly, excessive positive emotional tone (a strategy creators might intuitively adopt to counteract AI skepticism) backfires and exacerbates negative outcomes. Supplementary randomized experiments identify two underlying mechanisms: perceived creator competence and AI washing concerns. Substantive signals primarily affect competence judgments, whereas rhetorical signals operate through varied pathways: either mediator alone or both in sequence. These findings provide theoretical and practical insights for entrepreneurs, platforms, and policymakers strategically managing AI transparency in high-stakes investment contexts."

In this article we review this claim from several points of view. We first offer an extended analysis of the methods used in that study. We show that the OSC methodology induces a bias that is able by itself to explain the discrepancy between the OSC estimates of reproducibility and other more optimistic estimates made by similar studies. The article also offers a more general literature review and discussion of reproducibility in experimental science. We argue, for both scientific and ethical reasons, that a considered balance of false positive and false negative rates is preferable to a single-minded concentration on false positive rates alone."

In particular, this applies to periodic orbits, and both results hold for Reeb flows on fiber-wise star-shaped hypersurfaces, including non-reversible Finsler flows, which answers a question of Rademacher.

    "abstract": "Minimizing volatility and adjustment costs is of central importance in many economic environments, yet it is often complicated by evolving feasibility constraints. We study a decision maker who repeatedly selects an action from a stochastically evolving interval of feasible actions in order to minimize either average adjustment costs or variance. We show that for strictly convex adjustment costs (such as quadratic variation), the optimal decision rule is a reference rule in which the decision maker minimizes the distance to a target action. In general, the optimal target depends both on the previous action and the expectation of future constraints; but for the special case where the constraints follow a random walk, the optimal mechanism is to simply target the previous action. If the decision maker minimizes variance, the optimal policy is also a reference rule, but the target is a constant, which is not necessarily equal to the long-term average action. Compared to mid-point heuristics, these optimal rules may substantially reduce quadratic variation and variance, in natural environments by $50\\%$ or more. Applied to stock market auctions, our results provide an explanation for the wide-spread use of reference price rules. We also apply our results to bilateral trade in over-the-counter markets, capacity planning in supply chains, and positioning in political agenda setting."

    "abstract": "Assessing human muscle fatigue is critical for optimizing performance and safety in physical human-robot interaction(pHRI). This work presents a data-driven framework to estimate fatigue in dynamic, cyclic pHRI using arm-mounted surface electromyography(sEMG). Subject-specific machine-learning regression models(Random Forest, XGBoost, and Linear Regression predict the fraction of cycles to fatigue(FCF) from three frequency-domain and one time-domain EMG features, and are benchmarked against a convolutional neural network(CNN) that ingests spectrograms of filtered EMG. Framing fatigue estimation as regression (rather than classification) captures continuous progression toward fatigue, supporting earlier detection, timely intervention, and adaptive robot control. In experiments with ten participants, a collaborative robot under admittance control guided repetitive lateral (left-right) end-effector motions until muscular fatigue. Average FCF RMSE across participants was 20.8+/-4.3% for the CNN, 23.3+/-3.8% for Random Forest, 24.8+/-4.5% for XGBoost, and 26.9+/-6.1% for Linear Regression. To probe cross-task generalization, one participant additionally performed unseen vertical (up-down) and circular repetitions; models trained only on lateral data were tested directly and largely retained accuracy, indicating robustness to changes in movement direction, arm kinematics, and muscle recruitment, while Linear Regression deteriorated. Overall, the study shows that both feature-based ML and spectrogram-based DL can estimate remaining work capacity during repetitive pHRI, with the CNN delivering the lowest error and the tree-based models close behind. The reported transfer to new motion patterns suggests potential for practical fatigue monitoring without retraining for every task, improving operator protection and enabling fatigue-aware shared autonomy, for safer fatigue-adaptive pHRI control."

    "abstract": "Probabilistic modeling is an effective tool for evaluating team performance and predicting outcomes in sports. However, an important question that hasn't been fully explored is whether these models can reliably reflect actual performance while assigning meaningful probabilities to rare results that differ greatly from expectations. In this study, we create an inference-based probabilistic framework built on expected goals (xG). This framework converts shot-level event data into season-level simulations of points, rankings, and outcome probabilities. Using the English Premier League 2015/16 season as a data, we demonstrate that the framework captures the overall structure of the league table. It correctly identifies the top-four contenders and relegation candidates while explaining a significant portion of the variance in final points and ranks. In a full-season evaluation, the model assigns a low probability to extreme outcomes, particularly Leicester City's historic title win, which stands out as a statistical anomaly. We then look at the ex ante inferential and early-diagnostic role of xG by only using mid-season information. With first-half data, we simulate the rest of the season and show that teams with stronger mid-season xG profiles tend to earn more points in the second half, even after considering their current league position. In this mid-season assessment, Leicester City ranks among the top teams by xG and is given a small but noteworthy chance of winning the league. This suggests that their ultimate success was unlikely but not entirely detached from their actual performance. Our analysis indicates that expected goals models work best as probabilistic baselines for analysis and early-warning diagnostics, rather than as certain predictors of rare season outcomes."

This study quantifies the separate and combined dosimetric impact of these effects using the GSI TRiP4D treatment planning system. Eighteen lung cancer 4DCT datasets from TCIA were analyzed. A modulation power ($P_{\\mathrm{mod}}$) was assigned to lung voxels. Three values were sampled from a Gaussian distribution ($200μ\\mathrm{m} \\pm 67μ\\mathrm{m}$), and an extreme value of $750μ\\mathrm{m}$ was tested. Interplay doses were computed by combining scanned-beam delivery with patient-specific respiratory motion. Four scenarios were studied: static, static with modulation, interplay, and interplay with modulation. Metrics included $D95\\%$, $V95\\%$, homogeneity index (HI), lung $V16\\mathrm{Gy}$, and heart $V20\\mathrm{Gy}$. Interplay reduced target coverage by $5.2 \\pm 1.5$ pp ($D95\\%$), $12.1 \\pm 5.9$ pp ($V95\\%$), and $8.3 \\pm 2.4$ pp (HI). Extreme $P_{\\mathrm{mod}}$ alone caused small degradations. When combined with interplay, it partially compensated the loss. This effect decreased with 4D optimization. Fractionation mitigated interplay, leaving lung modulation as the main residual effect."

    "abstract": "The scarcity of high-quality training data presents a fundamental bottleneck to scaling machine learning models. This challenge is particularly acute in recommendation systems, where extreme sparsity in user interactions leads to rugged optimization landscapes and poor generalization. We propose the Recursive Self-Improving Recommendation (RSIR) framework, a paradigm in which a model bootstraps its own performance without reliance on external data or teacher models. RSIR operates in a closed loop: the current model generates plausible user interaction sequences, a fidelity-based quality control mechanism filters them for consistency with user's approximate preference manifold, and a successor model is augmented on the enriched dataset. Our theoretical analysis shows that RSIR acts as a data-driven implicit regularizer, smoothing the optimization landscape and guiding models toward more robust solutions. Empirically, RSIR yields consistent, cumulative gains across multiple benchmarks and architectures. Notably, even smaller models benefit, and weak models can generate effective training curricula for stronger ones. These results demonstrate that recursive self-improvement is a general, model-agnostic approach to overcoming data sparsity, suggesting a scalable path forward for recommender systems and beyond.

These diagnostics have rarely been studied together during the modern era of high-resolution solar flare observations, and never at the spectral and spatial resolution of the DKIST. We directly compare DKIST spectra to state-of-the-art RADYN+RH simulations, including one heated by a nonthermal electron beam and one by in-situ thermal conduction. While certain salient properties of the spectra such as the width of H-epsilon are reproduced, the models severely underestimate the width of Ca II H in the red wing and fail to reproduce the exact relative intensity of Ca II H to H-epsilon. The models exhibit a range of condensation electron densities spanning over an order of magnitude. Unlike the modeled lower-order Balmer-series lines, we find that the width of H-epsilon is not solely related to the condensation properties; the widths and intensities are also sensitive to the deeper flare layers. We outline possible avenues towards improvement of flare models, such as a comprehensive evaluation of flare heating mechanisms in the context of both impulsive and decay phase high-resolution data."

Determining the correct ripeness level during the harvest period is crucial for both preventing losses for producers and ensuring consumers receive a quality product. However, traditional methods, i.e., visual assessments alone, can be subjective and have a high margin of error. Therefore, computer-assisted systems are needed. However, the scarcity of comprehensive datasets accessible to everyone in the literature makes it difficult to compare studies in this field. In this study, a new and publicly available strawberry ripeness dataset, consisting of 566 images and 1,201 labeled objects, prepared under variable light and environmental conditions in two different greenhouses in Turkey, is presented to the literature. Comparative tests conducted on the data set using YOLOv8, YOLOv9, and YOLO11-based models showed that the highest precision value was 90.94% in the YOLOv9c model, while the highest recall value was 83.74% in the YOLO11s model. In terms of the general performance criterion mAP@50, YOLOv8s was the best performing model with a success rate of 86.09%. The results show that small and medium-sized models work more balanced and efficiently on this type of dataset, while also establishing a fundamental reference point for smart agriculture applications."

We detect polarization-entangled photon pairs with a concurrence of $0.905\\pm0.053$ and a Bell state fidelity of $0.939\\pm0.027$.

Existing research typically treats interpretability and accuracy as separate objectives, with concept-based explainability techniques focusing primarily on transparency, while Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods targeting factual grounding through external retrieval. We present Concept-Enhanced Multimodal RAG (CEMRAG), a unified framework that decomposes visual representations into interpretable clinical concepts and integrates them with multimodal RAG. This approach exploits enriched contextual prompts for RRG, improving both interpretability and factual accuracy. Experiments on MIMIC-CXR and IU X-Ray across multiple VLM architectures, training regimes, and retrieval configurations demonstrate consistent improvements over both conventional RAG and concept-only baselines on clinical accuracy metrics and standard NLP measures. These results challenge the assumed trade-off between interpretability and performance, showing that transparent visual concepts can enhance rather than compromise diagnostic accuracy in medical VLMs. Our modular design decomposes interpretability into visual transparency and structured language model conditioning, providing a principled pathway toward clinically trustworthy AI-assisted radiology."

In addition, we study the finite-temperature stability of the structures and find that thermodynamic effects further stabilize planar configurations relative to their compact counterparts. To explore the potential energy surface, we use the Minima Hopping algorithm combined with a machine-learned potential. Since the machine-learned potential does not apply to ionized clusters, we introduce a charge-correction term to incorporate Coulomb interactions and charge screening."

This enables the construction of an adaptive, acceleration-based constraint map that iteratively refines trajectories toward near-optimal performance under spatially varying track and vehicle behavior. In simulation, our approach achieves a 17.38% lap time reduction compared to a controller parametrized with maximum static acceleration. On real hardware, tested with different tire compounds ranging from high to low friction, we obtain a 7.60% lap time improvement without explicitly parametrizing friction.

We formulate semantic adaptation driven by human feedback as a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP) whose state captures semantic quality, human preferences, queue slack, and channel dynamics, and solve it via a primal--dual proximal policy optimization algorithm with action shielding and latency-aware reward shaping. The resulting policy preserves PPO-level semantic rewards while tightening the variability of both air-interface and near-real-time RAN intelligent controller processing budgets.

In systems with a dominant attractor -- homeostatic physiology, nominal industrial operation, stable network traffic -- this creates a systematic \\emph{Stationarity Bias}: simple methods appear superior because the benchmark predominantly samples the easy, low-entropy regime where they trivially succeed. We formalize this bias and propose a \\emph{Stratified Stress-Test} that partitions evaluation into Stationary and Transient regimes. Using Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) as a testbed -- chosen for its rigorous ground-truth forcing functions (meals, insulin) that enable precise regime identification -- we establish three findings with broad implications:(i)~Stationary Efficiency: Linear interpolation achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction during stable intervals, confirming that complex architectures are computationally wasteful in low-entropy regimes.(ii)~Transient Fidelity: During critical transients (post-prandial peaks, hypoglycemic events), linear methods exhibit drastically degraded morphological fidelity (DTW), disproportionate to their RMSE -- a phenomenon we term the \\emph{RMSE Mirage}, where low pointwise error masks the destruction of signal shape.(iii)~Regime-Conditional Model Selection: Deep learning models preserve both pointwise accuracy and morphological integrity during transients, making them essential for safety-critical downstream tasks. We further derive empirical missingness distributions from clinical trials and impose them on complete training data, preventing models from exploiting unrealistically clean observations and encouraging robustness under real-world missingness.

In this work we unify and extend three complementary structures of $A_n$. First, starting from the Stirling number expansion of zigzag numbers, we derive a contour integral representation, as well as a positive Laplace-type integral representation $$ A_n = 2^n \\int_0^\\infty e^{-y} f_n(y)\\, dy, \\qquad f_n(y) := \\sum_{k=0}^{n} (-1)^k S(n,k) \\left(\\frac{y}{2}\\right)^k, $$ where the kernel $f_n(y)$ is the polynomial generating function of Stirling numbers. A continuous interpolation of the discrete product (falling factorial) is introduced subsequently. This provides a direct analytic bridge between set partitions and Laplace asymptotics. Second, using the partial fraction expansion of $\\tan$, we obtain the well-known hyperbolic integral representation $$ A_{2n+1}=\\frac{1}π\\int_0^\\infty\\frac{y^{2n+1}}{\\sinh(y/2)}\\,dy, $$ equivalently expressed in classical $\\cosh$ form for $A_{2n}$. This representation interprets zigzag numbers as spectral moments associated with half-integer poles. The connection with Fourier analysis and Mellin transforms is also outlined. Finally, combining spectral expansions with Stirling identities, we derive congruence relations modulo primes for $A_n$. These results exhibit a dual analytic-combinatorial structure of zigzag numbers, linking partition expansions, trigonometric spectra, and arithmetic properties."

    "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning (RL) has significantly improved large language model reasoning, but existing RL fine-tuning methods rely heavily on heuristic techniques such as entropy regularization and reweighting to maintain stability. In practice, they often experience late-stage performance collapse, leading to degraded reasoning quality and unstable training. We derive that the magnitude of token-wise policy gradients in RL is negatively correlated with token probability and local policy entropy. Building on this result, we prove that training instability is driven by a tiny fraction of tokens, approximately 0.01\\%, which we term \\emph{spurious tokens}. When such tokens appear in correct responses, they contribute little to the reasoning outcome but inherit the full sequence-level reward, leading to abnormally amplified gradient updates. Motivated by this observation, we propose Spurious-Token-Aware Policy Optimization (STAPO) for large-scale model refining, which selectively masks such updates and renormalizes the loss over valid tokens. Across six mathematical reasoning benchmarks using Qwen 1.7B, 8B, and 14B base models, STAPO consistently demonstrates superior entropy stability and achieves an average performance improvement of 7.13\\% over GRPO, 20-Entropy and JustRL."

    "abstract": "Ensuring user fairness in wireless communications is a fundamental challenge, as balancing the trade-off between fairness and sum rate leads to a non-convex, multi-objective optimization whose complexity grows with network scale. To alleviate this conflict, we propose an optimization-based unsupervised learning approach based on the wireless transformer (WiT) architecture that learns from channel state information (CSI) features. We reformulate the trade-off by combining the sum rate and fairness objectives through a Lagrangian multiplier, which is updated automatically via a dual-ascent algorithm. This mechanism allows for a controllable fairness constraint while simultaneously maximizing the sum rate, effectively realizing a trace on the Pareto front between two conflicting objectives. Our findings show that the proposed approach offers a flexible solution for managing the trade-off optimization under prescribed fairness."

We analyze archival near-infrared polarimetric data of the protoplanetary disk (PPD) around HD 163296. Whereas previous studies considered only single-epoch snapshots, we perform a consistent multi-epoch time-series analysis, extracting the polarization angle and its uncertainty from the polarized images. The resulting six-epoch time series is consistent with a constant polarization angle within the measurement uncertainties, while being sensitive to timescales of $\\sim 170-400$ days. The typical polarization angle uncertainties are $1.6$--$6.4$ degrees, partly driven by multiple scattering in the optically thick disk, which broadens the intrinsic polarization angle distribution and introduces additional dispersion in the representative polarization angle. Based on these data, we derive the first upper limits on the ALP-photon coupling from PPD polarization variability, $g_{aγ} \\lesssim 7.5 \\times 10^{-12} (m_a / 10^{-22}\\,{\\rm eV})\\,{\\rm GeV}^{-1}$. Furthermore, we forecast that achieving a polarization angle uncertainty of $σ\\sim 0.1$ degrees would enable world-leading sensitivity to ALP-induced birefringence."

For the first time, this carbon budget will be accompanied by a macroeconomic assessment of its impact on growth, employment, inflation and inequality. Researchers from the Institute of New Economic Thinking (INET) Oxford are working in partnership with the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero to deliver this assessment using our data-driven macroeconomic agent-based model (ABM). This extended abstract presents the work in progress towards this pioneering policymaking using our data-driven macroeconomic ABM. We are conducting our work in three work packages. By the time of the workshop, we hope to be able to present preliminary findings from the first two work packages. In WP1, we adapt an existing macro-ABM prototype and build a UK macroeconomic baseline. The main task for this is initialising the model with suitable UK household microdata. We present the options considered and the approach settled upon. In WP2, we conduct preliminary modelling that represents UK decarbonisation as an external shock to financial flows and technical coefficients. In order to present results in time to influence the June 2026 policy decision, this second work package exogenously forces the ABM to follow the CB7 green investment and associated technological change projections provided by the Climate Change Committee. Finally, we will implement more sophisticated social and technological learning packages in WP3, building our own projections of likely decarbonisation pathways that may diverge from UK government plans. For the workshop, we will present the progress of WP1 and WP2."

Execution-time certificate guarantees that the NMPC controller returns a solution before the next sampling time, and achieving faster worst-case and average execution times further enables its use in a wider set of applications. However, NMPC produces a nonlinear program (NLP) for which it is challenging to derive its execution time certificates. Our previous works, \\citep{wu2025direct,wu2025time} provide data-independent execution time certificates (certified number of iterations) for box-constrained quadratic programs (BoxQP). To apply the time-certified BoxQP algorithm \\citep{wu2025time} for state-input constrained NMPC, this paper i) learns a linear model via Koopman operator; ii) proposes a dynamic-relaxation construction approach yields a structured BoxQP rather than a general QP; iii) exploits the structure of BoxQP, where the dimension of the linear system solved in each iteration is reduced from $5N(n_u+n_x)$ to $Nn_u$ (where $n_u, n_x, N$ denote the number of inputs, states, and length of prediction horizon), yielding substantial speedups (when $n_x \\gg n_u$, as in PDE control)."

    "abstract": "Spatiotemporal flows govern diverse phenomena across physics, biology, and engineering, yet modelling their multiscale dynamics remains a central challenge. Despite major advances in physics-informed machine learning, existing approaches struggle to simultaneously maintain long-term temporal evolution and resolve fine-scale structure across chaotic, turbulent, and physiological regimes. Here, we introduce Uni-Flow, a unified autoregressive-diffusion framework that explicitly separates temporal evolution from spatial refinement for modelling complex dynamical systems. The autoregressive component learns low-resolution latent dynamics that preserve large-scale structure and ensure stable long-horizon rollouts, while the diffusion component reconstructs high-resolution physical fields, recovering fine-scale features in a small number of denoising steps. We validate Uni-Flow across canonical benchmarks, including two-dimensional Kolmogorov flow, three-dimensional turbulent channel inflow generation with a quantum-informed autoregressive prior, and patient-specific simulations of aortic coarctation derived from high-fidelity lattice Boltzmann hemodynamic solvers. In the cardiovascular setting, Uni-Flow enables task-level faster than real-time inference of pulsatile hemodynamics, reconstructing high-resolution pressure fields over physiologically relevant time horizons in seconds rather than hours. By transforming high-fidelity hemodynamic simulation from an offline, HPC-bound process into a deployable surrogate, Uni-Flow establishes a pathway to faster-than-real-time modelling of complex multiscale flows, with broad implications for scientific machine learning in flow physics."

    "abstract": "Depression manifests through a diverse set of symptoms such as sleep disturbance, loss of interest, and concentration difficulties. However, most existing works treat depression prediction either as a binary label or an overall severity score without explicitly modeling symptom-specific information. This limits their ability to provide symptom-level analysis relevant to clinical screening. To address this, we propose a symptom-specific and clinically inspired framework for depression severity estimation from speech. Our approach uses a symptom-guided cross-attention mechanism that aligns PHQ-8 questionnaire items with emotion-aware speech representations to identify which segments of a participant's speech are more important to each symptom. To account for differences in how symptoms are expressed over time, we introduce a learnable symptom-specific parameter that adaptively controls the sharpness of attention distributions. Our results on EDAIC, a standard clinical-style dataset, demonstrate improved performance outperforming prior works. Further, analyzing the attention distributions showed that higher attention is assigned to utterances containing cues related to multiple depressive symptoms, highlighting the interpretability of our approach. These findings outline the importance of symptom-guided and emotion-aware modeling for speech-based depression screening."

Such soft folds arise from a balance between elastic bending and gravity, yet their stability, packing limits, and dynamics remain poorly understood. Here we show that these behaviors are governed by a single physical length scale, the elasto-gravity length $\\ell_{eg}$. Using experiments and heavy-elastica theory, we demonstrate that $\\ell_{eg}$ sets the characteristic fold geometry, determines when a fold becomes unstable and unfolds, and limits how many reversible folds can be stacked in rectangular and circular sheets. In particular, when lengths are rescaled by $\\ell_{eg}$, fold shapes and stability thresholds collapse across materials and thicknesses. We further show that unfolding follows a universal speed scaling $v \\sim \\sqrt{g\\,\\ell_{eg}}$, revealing a gravity-controlled time scale for the release of stored bending energy. Together, these results establish a unified physical framework for reversible folding, compact storage, and gravity-assisted deployment of thin elastic sheets."

This study evaluates a state-of-the-art simulation-based inference (SBI) framework that uses neural networks (NN) for parameter estimation. This framework is applied to an established labour market ABM based on job transition networks. The ABM is initiated with synthetic datasets and the real U.S. labour market. Next, we compare the effectiveness of summary statistics derived from a list of statistical measures with that learned by an embedded NN. The results demonstrate that the NN-based approach recovers the original parameters when evaluating posterior distributions across various dataset scales and improves efficiency compared to traditional Bayesian methods."

    "abstract": "Urban infrastructure degrades over time, necessitating periodic renovation to maintain functionality and safety. When renovation is delayed beyond the infrastructure's remaining lifespan, costly emergency interventions become necessary to prevent failure. Decision makers must therefore balance expected emergency intervention costs against traffic congestion impacts. We formalize this trade-off as a road network maintenance scheduling problem with uncertain deadlines, which presents optimization challenges including computationally expensive evaluation and an exponentially growing solution space. To address these challenges, this paper contributes a hybrid optimization approach combining machine learning with genetic algorithms for large-scale infrastructure renovation scheduling under uncertainty. We formulate the problem as a bi-level multi-objective optimization problem that explicitly accounts for uncertain infrastructure lifespans through probabilistic failure models. We develop a progressive lower bound evaluation method that integrates machine learning surrogate models with a multi-objective genetic algorithm to improve solution quality by enabling more iterations within fixed computational budgets. We demonstrate the method's effectiveness on substantially larger problem instances (76 projects) than previously addressed in the literature, achieving statistically significant improvements across multiple performance metrics by increasing computational efficiency up to 40 times compared to standard approaches."

This paper presents VLM-DEWM, a cognitive architecture that decouples VLM reasoning from world-state management through a persistent, queryable Dynamic External World Model (DEWM). Each VLM decision is structured into an Externalizable Reasoning Trace (ERT), comprising action proposal, world belief, and causal assumption, which is validated against DEWM before execution. When failures occur, discrepancy analysis between predicted and observed states enables targeted recovery instead of global replanning. We evaluate VLM-DEWM on multi-station assembly, large-scale facility exploration, and real-robot recovery under induced failures. Compared to baseline memory-augmented VLM systems, VLM DEWM improves state-tracking accuracy from 56% to 93%, increases recovery success rate from below 5% to 95%, and significantly reduces computational overhead through structured memory. These results establish VLM-DEWM as a verifiable and resilient solution for long-horizon robotic operations in dynamic manufacturing environments."

To this end, we utilize a policy evaluation-based similarity measure that identifies suitable policies for initialization from a library. We demonstrate that this measure correlates with the reduction in environment interactions needed to reach target performance and is therefore suited for initialization. Extensive simulation and real-world experiments confirm that our control architecture achieves state-of-the-art control performance, and that our initialization scheme saves on average up to $73.5\\%$ of environment interactions (compared to training a policy from scratch) across diverse quadrotor and hexarotor designs, paving the way for efficient cross-embodiment transfer in reinforcement learning."

The reported assistance information serves as input to a neural network (NN), which predicts the quantization accuracy of various CB types for each served user.

In this work, a generalized notion of correlations via arbitrary products is formulated. Remarkably, as a universal property, the connection between such general products and tensor products is established, allowing one to relate generic non-product states to the common notion of entangled states. We construct the set of free operations for general types of products by extending the local-operation-and-classical-communication paradigm, familiar from standard entanglement theory, thereby establishing a resource theory of correlations for general products. A generalization is provided beyond two factors that can be universally related to multipartite entanglement. Applications that highlight the usefulness of the approach are discussed, such as the factorization of fermionic states, the non-local factorization of multi-photon states into single-photon states, and the interesting possibility of understanding prime numbers as a form of single-party entanglement."

The article clarifies the distinction between two universality classes: the FPUT-$αβ$ model, characterized by $δ= 1/3$ and linked to Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) physics, and the symmetric FPUT-$β$ model, where numerical and theoretical evidence support $δ= 2/5$. We investigate how finite-size effects - unavoidably induced by the thermostatting protocols - can disguise the asymptotic scaling. Additionally, we analyze the role of conservative noise in preserving hydrodynamic properties and examine how proximity to integrable limits leads to long-lived quasi-particles and, thereby, to diffusive regimes over intermediate spatial scales."

    "abstract": "Volatile loss from exoplanetary atmospheres and its possible implications for the longevity of habitable surface conditions is a topic of vigorous debate currently. The vast majority of the habitable zone terrestrial-like exoplanets known to date orbit low-mass M- and K-dwarf stars and are subject to the conditions drastically different to those of terrestrial planets in the Solar System. In particular, they orbit far closer to their host stars than similar planets around G-dwarfs similar to the Sun. Therefore they receive higher X-ray and UV fluxes, even though luminosities of M- and K-dwarfs are lower than those of heavier stars. Furthermore, due to their slower evolution, M-dwarfs retain high activity on the gigayear timescales. The combination of these two effects has led to claims that most terrestrial planets orbiting M-dwarfs may have their atmospheres stripped from the higher X-ray and UV fluxes of their host stars. Opposing this are researchers who point out that volatile inventories for terrestrial exoplanets are ill-constrained, and hence, they may be able to \"weather the storm\" of these higher X-ray and UV fluxes. In this chapter, we focus on exploring volatile loss in the upper atmospheres of terrestrial planets in our solar system and applications to those in exoplanetary systems around stars of different types."

    "abstract": "General-purpose super-resolution models, particularly Vision Transformers, have achieved remarkable success but exhibit fundamental inefficiencies in common infrared imaging scenarios like surveillance and autonomous driving, which operate from fixed or nearly-static viewpoints. These models fail to exploit the strong, persistent spatial priors inherent in such scenes, leading to redundant learning and suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose the Regional Prior attention Transformer for infrared image Super-Resolution (RPT-SR), a novel architecture that explicitly encodes scene layout information into the attention mechanism. Our core contribution is a dual-token framework that fuses (1) learnable, regional prior tokens, which act as a persistent memory for the scene's global structure, with (2) local tokens that capture the frame-specific content of the current input. By utilizing these tokens into an attention, our model allows the priors to dynamically modulate the local reconstruction process. Extensive experiments validate our approach. While most prior works focus on a single infrared band, we demonstrate the broad applicability and versatility of RPT-SR by establishing new state-of-the-art performance across diverse datasets covering both Long-Wave (LWIR) and Short-Wave (SWIR) spectra"

Establishing new platforms among already popular competitors is difficult. Prior research has richly documented people's experiences within individual platforms, yet situating those experiences within the entirety of a user's social media experience remains challenging. What platforms have people used, and why have they transitioned between them? We collected data from a quota-based sample of 1,000 U.S. participants. We introduce the concept of \\emph{Social Media Journeys} to study the entirety of their social media experiences systematically. We identify push and pull factors across the social media landscape. We also show how different generations adopted social media platforms based on personal needs. With this work, we advance HCI by moving towards holistic perspectives when discussing social media technology, offering new insights for platform design, governance, and regulation."

Traditional methods for calculating STOI typically requires clean reference speech, which limits their applicability in the real world. To address this, numerous deep learning-based nonintrusive speech assessment models have garnered significant interest. Many studies have achieved commendable performance, but there is room for further improvement. We propose the use of bottleneck transformer, incorporating convolution blocks for learning frame-level features and a multi-head self-attention (MHSA) layer to aggregate the information. These components enable the transformer to focus on the key aspects of the input data. Our model has shown higher correlation and lower mean squared error for both seen and unseen scenarios compared to the state-of-the-art model using self-supervised learning (SSL) and spectral features as inputs."

We show that QRC implemented in this circuit can accurately classify complex probability distributions, including those with heavy tails, and identify regimes in correlated time series, such as periods of high volatility generated by standard econometric models. We find QRC to outperform some of the best classical methods when the amount of information is limited. This demonstrates its potential to be a noise-resilient quantum learning approach capable of tackling real-world problems within currently available superconducting platforms. We further discuss how to improve our QRC algorithm in real superconducting hardware to benefit from a much larger Hilbert space."

Our model is learned on millions of synthetic optimization problems sampled from a novel prior spanning both convex and non-convex objectives. We evaluate POP on an established benchmark including 47 optimization functions of various complexity, where it consistently outperforms first-order gradient-based methods, non-convex optimization approaches (e.g., evolutionary strategies), Bayesian optimization, and a recent meta-learned competitor under matched budget constraints.

While this enhanced scaling is known to appear in several settings, it is generally believed to be forbidden in Wigner-Jordan integrable spin chains charged via quantum-quench protocols. Here, we show that an extended cluster-Ising model, despite belonging to the above category, exhibits super-extensive charging power over wide ranges of system sizes, reaching up to a thousand spins, in proper parameter regimes. This remarkable anomalous scaling is due to a corresponding super-extensive growth of the stored energy, implying that it occurs at large but finite size and cannot persist in the thermodynamic limit. This phenomenon appears robust against finite-temperature effects."

Meanwhile, open-source multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong visual-linguistic reasoning, but their potential in biometric forensics remains underexplored. In this paper, we present the first systematic zero-shot evaluation of open-source MLLMs for single-image MAD, using publicly available weights and a standardized, reproducible protocol. Across diverse morphing techniques, many MLLMs show non-trivial discriminative ability without any fine-tuning or domain adaptation, and LLaVA1.6-Mistral-7B achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing highly competitive task-specific MAD baselines by at least 23% in terms of equal error rate (EER). The results indicate that multimodal pretraining can implicitly encode fine-grained facial inconsistencies indicative of morphing artifacts, enabling zero-shot forensic sensitivity. Our findings position open-source MLLMs as reproducible, interpretable, and competitive foundations for biometric security and forensic image analysis. This emergent capability also highlights new opportunities to develop state-of-the-art MAD systems through targeted fine-tuning or lightweight adaptation, further improving accuracy and efficiency while preserving interpretability. To support future research, all code and evaluation protocols will be released upon publication."

Our main aim is to pave the way to testing the adoption of quantum optimization in the inference of the cosmological parameters that describe the universe evolution. AEQGA computes the merit function classically, and then uses a quantum circuit to entangle the population and perform crossover and mutation operations. The results show consistency with the isocontours of the objective functions.

We also introduce weak and strong notions of antidistinguiahbaility ($x$-antidistinguishability) depending on whether all states or all $x$-tuples are exhaustively eliminated. Our results reveal striking differences between state exclusion and the more familiar task of state discrimination. In particular, we show that LOCC antidistinguishability of multipartite product states is symmetric with respect to the initiating party but this symmetry breaks down for higher-order $x$-antidistinguishability. Most notably, we establish a manifestation of \\emph{nonlocality without entanglement} in the context of state exclusion: we prove that three bipartite product states can be globally antidistinguishable while failing to be LOCC antidistinguishable, demonstrating that three is the minimal number of states required for this phenomenon. We further extend this separation to $2$-antidistinguishability and present example exhibiting the same type of nonlocality. At last, we provide an antidistinguishable tripartite product states that are not LOCC antidistinguishable across any bipartition, which ensures the phenomenon of \\emph{genuine nonlocality without entanglement} in this framework."

Furthermore, mandatory interventions primarily modulate contagion between households rather than within them. We developed an approach to quantify the role of household size in epidemics by separating within-household from out-household transmission, and found that household size explains 41% of the variability in cumulative COVID-19 incidence across 34 European countries (95% confidence interval: [15%, 46%]). The contribution of households to the overall dynamics can be quantified by a boost factor that increases with the effective household size, implying that countries with larger households require more stringent interventions to achieve the same levels of containment. This suggests that households constitute a structural (dis-)advantage that must be considered when designing and evaluating mitigation strategies."

We ask whether an analogous conclusion holds approximately when the distributions are close instead of equal. Building on the observation of Nielsen et al. (2025) that closeness in KL divergence need not imply high linear representational similarity, we study a distributional distance based on logit differences and show that closeness in this distance does yield linear similarity guarantees. Specifically, we define a representational dissimilarity measure based on the models' identifiability class and prove that it is bounded by the logit distance. We further show that, when model probabilities are bounded away from zero, KL divergence upper-bounds logit distance; yet the resulting bound fails to provide nontrivial control in practice. As a consequence, KL-based distillation can match a teacher's predictions while failing to preserve linear representational properties, such as linear-probe recoverability of human-interpretable concepts. In distillation experiments on synthetic and image datasets, logit-distance distillation yields students with higher linear representational similarity and better preservation of the teacher's linearly recoverable concepts."

Nonetheless, region-based abstractions have been shown to outperform zones in specific subclasses of TA. To complement and support mature zone-based tools, we introduce TARZAN, a C++ region-based verification library for TA. The algorithms implemented in TARZAN use a novel region abstraction that tracks the order in which clocks become unbounded. This additional ordering induces a finer partitioning of the state space, enabling backward algorithms to avoid the combinatorial explosion associated with enumerating all ordered partitions of unbounded clocks, when computing immediate delay predecessor regions. We validate TARZAN by comparing forward reachability results against the state-of-the-art tools Uppaal and TChecker. The experiments confirm that zones excel when TA have large constants and strict guards. In contrast, TARZAN exhibits superior performance on closed TA and TA with punctual guards. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of our backward algorithms, establishing a foundation for region-based analysis in domains like Timed Games, where backward exploration is essential."

In addition to resolving and quantifying the initial gradual decrease of the work function with temperature, which is associated with thermal expansion, the experiment revealed that the work function then undergoes a distinct drop both in magnitude and in slope that signifies the onset of nanoparticle melting. This establishes that a structural phase transition can be detected via a high-resolution measurement of the photoemission threshold. The melting temperature of nanoparticles with diameters of 7-9 nm is reduced by nearly 100 K relative to the bulk value. This suppression aligns with predictions from the Gibbs-Thomson equation which describes finite-size phase transitions."

Employing an interpretive case study approach, we triangulated data from participant observation, focus groups, questionnaires, and collaborative visioning workshops to investigate the socio-technical dynamics enabling long-term resilience in a fully online, nonreciprocal far-peer tutoring setting. Our findings reveal that while age proximity fosters trust and open communication, it also poses challenges for tutors who must balance peer rapport with instructional authority. Volunteer engagement is driven primarily by intrinsic motives - educational impact and community belonging - while optional micro-earning is envisioned as a practical enabler for long-term sustainability. Tutees report significant gains in confidence, self-expression, and accelerated comprehension, attributing these outcomes to personalized, interactive sessions within a \"family-like\" safe space that combines academic instruction with socio-emotional support. Notably, tutees view tutors as aspirational role models and express strong intentions to return as tutors themselves, envisioning a self-regenerating cycle of intergenerational reciprocity that carries knowledge and solidarity from generation to generation. Both cohorts call for a dedicated platform featuring integrated scheduling, personalization, feedback, and quality assurance mechanisms. We synthesize these insights into theory-informed implications and five design principles for sustainable P2P learning ecosystems at scale."

We, therefore, theoretically explore the emergence of dichroism in EELS for a canonical single-twist helix nanostructure and present a detailed analysis of the optimal parameters to obtain a robust signal.

However, in this paper, we present the chaotic behavior that is completely attributed to the non-linear back-reaction of non-Markovian environment. To be specific, we derive the dynamical equations of an optomechanical system and demonstrate that the non-linearity (cause of chaos) in the equations arises entirely from the time-domain convolutions (TDCs) induced by non-Markovian corrections. Under Markovian conditions, these TDCs are reduced into constants, thereby losing the nonlinearity and ultimately leading to the disappearance of chaos. Furthermore, we also observe chaos generation in the absence of optomechanical couplings, which further confirms that the non-Markovian effect is the sole inducement of chaos and the environmental parameters play important roles in the generation of chaos. We hope these results may open a new direction to investigate chaotic dynamics purely caused by non-Markovian environments."

    "abstract": "We investigate the well-posedness of the periodic boundary value problem for the steady compressible isentropic Navier-Stokes system under the van der Waals equation of state. The main difficulty arises from the non-monotonicity of the pressure, which induces liquid-vapor phase transitions and consequently leads to both physical instabilities and mathematical non-uniqueness of solutions. It is shown that the occurrence of a phase transition is determined by whether the integral average of the specific volume lies inside the gas-liquid coexistence region defined by the Maxwell construction. By introducing an artificial viscosity, we construct an approximate system. When the integral average of the specific volume falls within the Maxwell region, the approximate solution converges, as the artificial viscosity tends to zero, to the equilibrium states given by Maxwell's construction, with the diffuse interface sharpening into a discontinuity. Conversely, if the integral average of the specific volume lies outside this region, the limiting solution remains outside as well, meaning that no phase transition occurs. These results demonstrate that the non-monotonicity of the pressure, combined with the condition that the integral average of the specific volume belongs to the Maxwell region, can act as a nucleation mechanism for phase transitions in the isentropic gas-liquid problem. Furthermore, the proposed approximation not only offers a regularized framework for describing phase transitions but also provides, from a rigorous mathematical viewpoint, a definition of admissible solutions related to phase transitions. The detailed proof relies on the artificial viscosity method, the calculus of variations, the anti-derivative technique, phase-plane analysis, and the level-set method."

The space-filling property is characterized by the covering and separation radii of a design, which are integrated through the unified criterion of quasi-uniformity.

The first algorithm generates rank-1 lattice point sets as an approximation of quasi-uniform Kronecker sequences, where the generating vector is determined explicitly. As a byproduct of our analysis, we prove that this explicit point set achieves an isotropic discrepancy of $O(N^{-1/d})$. The second algorithm utilizes Korobov lattice point sets, employing the Lenstra--Lenstra--Lovász (LLL) basis reduction algorithm to identify the generating vector that ensures quasi-uniformity. Numerical experiments are provided to validate our theoretical claims regarding quasi-uniformity.

    "abstract": "While leveraging LLMs to automatically generate SystemVerilog assertions (SVAs) from natural language specifications holds great potential, existing techniques face a key challenge: LLMs often lack sufficient understanding of IC design, leading to poor assertion quality in a single pass. Therefore, verifying whether the generated assertions effectively cover the functional specifications and designing feedback mechanisms based on this coverage remain significant hurdles. To address these limitations, this paper introduces CoverAssert, a novel iterative framework for optimizing SVA generation with LLMs. The core contribution is a lightweight mechanism for matching generated assertions with specific functional descriptions in the specifications. CoverAssert achieves this by clustering the joint representations of semantic features of LLM-generated assertions and structural features extracted from abstract syntax trees (ASTs) about signals related to assertions, and then mapping them back to the specifications to analyze functional coverage quality. Leveraging this capability, CoverAssert constructs a feedback loop based on functional coverage to guide LLMs in prioritizing uncovered functional points, thereby iteratively improving assertion quality. Experimental evaluations on four open-source designs demonstrate that integrating CoverAssert with state-of-the-art generators, AssertLLM and Spec2Assertion, achieves average improvements of 9.57 % in branch coverage, 9.64 % in statement coverage, and 15.69 % in toggle coverage."

This manuscript introduces a novel approach to computing the CL reserves based on a fundamental restructuring of the data utilization for the CL prediction procedure. Instead of rolling forward the cumulative claims with estimated CL factors, we estimate multi-period factors that project the latest observations directly to the ultimate claims. This alternative perspective on CL reserving creates a natural pathway for the application of machine learning techniques to individual claims reserving. As a proof of concept, we present a small-scale real data application employing neural networks for individual claims reserving."

    "abstract": "Web agents based on large language models have demonstrated promising capability in automating web tasks. However, current web agents struggle to reason out sensible actions due to the limitations of predicting environment changes, and might not possess comprehensive awareness of execution risks, prematurely performing risky actions that cause losses and lead to task failure. To address these challenges, we propose WAC, a web agent that integrates model collaboration, consequence simulation, and feedback-driven action refinement. To overcome the cognitive isolation of individual models, we introduce a multi-agent collaboration process that enables an action model to consult a world model as a web-environment expert for strategic guidance; the action model then grounds these suggestions into executable actions, leveraging prior knowledge of environmental state transition dynamics to enhance candidate action proposal. To achieve risk-aware resilient task execution, we introduce a two-stage deduction chain. A world model, specialized in environmental state transitions, simulates action outcomes, which a judge model then scrutinizes to trigger action corrective feedback when necessary. Experiments show that WAC achieves absolute gains of 1.8% on VisualWebArena and 1.3% on Online-Mind2Web."

    "abstract": "Day-to-night unpaired image translation is important to downstream tasks but remains challenging due to large appearance shifts and the lack of direct pixel-level supervision. Existing methods often introduce semantic hallucinations, where objects from target classes such as traffic signs and vehicles, as well as man-made light effects, are incorrectly synthesized. These hallucinations significantly degrade downstream performance. We propose a novel framework that detects and suppresses hallucinations of target-class features during unpaired translation. To detect hallucination, we design a dual-head discriminator that additionally performs semantic segmentation to identify hallucinated content in background regions. To suppress these hallucinations, we introduce class-specific prototypes, constructed by aggregating features of annotated target-domain objects, which act as semantic anchors for each class. Built upon a Schrodinger Bridge-based translation model, our framework performs iterative refinement, where detected hallucination features are explicitly pushed away from class prototypes in feature space, thus preserving object semantics across the translation trajectory.Experiments show that our method outperforms existing approaches both qualitatively and quantitatively. On the BDD100K dataset, it improves mAP by 15.5% for day-to-night domain adaptation, with a notable 31.7% gain for classes such as traffic lights that are prone to hallucinations."

We systematically tackle various challenges posed by absence of training data for Tulu by combining explicit grammar documentation, negative constraints to suppress high-probability tokens from related languages, romanization standardization, and quality-controlled synthetic data generation via self-play. Evaluated on a manually curated held-out set across three LLMs (Gemini 2.0 Flash, GPT-4o, Llama 3.1 70B) and validated by native speakers, our approach reduces vocabulary contamination from 80% to 5% while achieving 85% grammatical accuracy. Cross-model analysis reveals that negative constraints provide consistent improvements (12--18 percentage points), while grammar documentation effects vary by model architecture (8--22 points)."

We emphasize local deployment of small language models and propose decentralized distillation with flowcharts to mitigate data scarcity and privacy issues in model training. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness in various service tasks, with superior quantitative and application performance compared to strong baselines and market products.

    "abstract": "Longitudinal electronic health record (EHR) data offer opportunities to study biomarker trajectories; however, association estimates-the primary inferential target-from standard models designed for regular observation times may be biased by a two-stage hierarchical missingness mechanism. The first stage is the visiting process (informative presence), where encounters occur at irregular times driven by patient health status; the second is the observation process (informative observation), where biomarkers are selectively measured during visits. To address these mechanisms, we propose a unified semiparametric joint modeling framework that simultaneously characterizes the visiting, biomarker observation, and longitudinal outcome processes. Central to this framework is a shared subject-specific Gaussian latent variable that captures unmeasured frailty and induces dependence across all components. We develop a three-stage estimation procedure and establish the consistency and asymptotic normality of our estimators. We also introduce a sequential procedure that imputes missing biomarkers prior to adjusting for irregular visiting and examine its performance. Simulation results demonstrate that our method yields unbiased estimates under this mechanism, whereas existing approaches can be substantially biased; notably, methods adjusting only for irregular visiting may exhibit even greater bias than those ignoring both mechanisms. We apply our framework to data from the All of Us Research Program to investigate associations between neighborhood-level socioeconomic status indicators and six blood-based biomarker trajectories, providing a robust tool for outpatient settings where irregular monitoring and selective measurement are prevalent."

Focusing on linear programs, we introduce a decision-focused notion of data informativeness that formalizes when a data set is sufficient to recover the optimal decision. Our notion abstracts away the notion of estimators (how data is used): it depends solely on the structure of the optimization task and the uncertainty. Our main result provides a geometric characterization of data sufficiency: a data set is sufficient if and only if, together with prior knowledge, it captures all cost directions that can change the optimal solution, given the task structure and the uncertainty set. Building on our characterization, we develop a tractable algorithm to determine minimal sufficient data sets under general data collection constraints. Taken together, our work introduces a principled framework for task-aware data collection. We demonstrate the approach in two applications: selecting where to conduct field experiments to inform infrastructure design and choosing which candidates to interview in order to make an optimal hiring decision. Our results illustrate that small, carefully selected data sets often suffice to determine the optimal decisions."

Here, we present a systematic study of the structure, magnetism, and magnetotransport of high-quality SRO (111) thin films with thicknesses t = 1.2-60 nm grown on SrTiO3 (111) substrates by machine-learning-assisted molecular beam epitaxy. We achieved a residual resistivity ratio of 45.5 in a 60 nm-thick film, the highest reported for this orientation, enabling access to intrinsic electronic and magnetic behavior. Temperature-dependent resistivity confirms Fermi-liquid transport below 15 K in both coherently strained (t = 10, 20 nm) and strain-relaxed (t = 60 nm) films, thereby enabling detailed magnetotransport and magnetic measurements. The linear, non-saturating positive magnetoresistance persists up to 14 T, while Hall-effect measurements and temperature scaling separate intrinsic (Karplus-Luttinger) and extrinsic (side-jump) contributions to the anomalous Hall effect, with the relative weight tuned by (111) epitaxial strain. X-ray magnetic circular dichroism at the Ru M2,3 and O K edges, together with SQUID magnetometry, demonstrates an intrinsically low-spin Ru ground state for both coherently strained and relaxed films, resolving ambiguities among prior reports. These detailed crystalline, electrical, and magnetic characterizations provide a rigorous foundation for understanding and engineering quantum transport in SRO (111)."

    "abstract": "Graph streams are rapidly evolving sequences of edges that convey continuously changing relationships among entities, playing a crucial role in domains such as networking, finance, and cybersecurity. Their massive scale and high dynamism make obtaining accurate statistics challenging with limited memory constraints. Traditional methods summarize graph streams through hand-crafted sketches, while recent studies have begun to replace these sketches with neural counterparts to improve adaptability and accuracy. However, this shift faces a major challenge: under limited memory, dominant frequent items tend to overshadow rare ones, hindering the neural network's ability to recover accurate statistics. To address this, we propose Crane, a hierarchical neural sketch architecture for graph stream summarization. Crane uses a hierarchical carry mechanism that automatically elevates frequent items to higher memory layers, reducing interference between frequent and infrequent items within the same layer. To better accommodate real-world deployment, Crane further adopts an adaptive memory expansion strategy that dynamically adds new layers once the occupancy of the top layer exceeds a threshold, enabling scalability across diverse data magnitudes. Extensive experiments on various datasets ranging from 20K to 60M edges demonstrate that Crane reduces estimation error by roughly 10x compared to state-of-the-art methods."

We present DAV-GSWT, a data-efficient framework that leverages diffusion priors and active view sampling to synthesize high-fidelity Gaussian Splatting Wang Tiles from minimal input observations. By integrating a hierarchical uncertainty quantification mechanism with generative diffusion models, our approach autonomously identifies the most informative viewpoints while hallucinating missing structural details to ensure seamless tile transitions.

    "abstract": "Imitation learning frameworks that learn robot control policies from demonstrators' motions via hand-mounted demonstration interfaces have attracted increasing attention. However, due to differences in physical characteristics between demonstrators and robots, this approach faces two limitations: i) the demonstration data do not include robot actions, and ii) the demonstrated motions may be infeasible for robots. These limitations make policy learning difficult. To address them, we propose Feasibility-Aware Behavior Cloning from Observation (FABCO). FABCO integrates behavior cloning from observation, which complements robot actions using robot dynamics models, with feasibility estimation. In feasibility estimation, the demonstrated motions are evaluated using a robot-dynamics model, learned from the robot's execution data, to assess reproducibility under the robot's dynamics. The estimated feasibility is used for multimodal feedback and feasibility-aware policy learning to improve the demonstrator's motions and learn robust policies. Multimodal feedback provides feasibility through the demonstrator's visual and haptic senses to promote feasible demonstrated motions. Feasibility-aware policy learning reduces the influence of demonstrated motions that are infeasible for robots, enabling the learning of policies that robots can execute stably. We conducted experiments with 15 participants on two tasks and confirmed that FABCO improves imitation learning performance by more than 3.2 times compared to the case without feasibility feedback."

Both models used 5-fold cross-validation, enabling robust assessment of generalization performance across multiple random splits. The CACTUS dataset provides expert-annotated cardiac ultrasound images with diverse views. We adopt an identical training protocol for both models to ensure a fair comparison. Both models are configured with a learning rate of 0.0001 and a weight decay of 0.01. For each fold, we record performance metrics including ROC-AUC, accuracy, F1-score, and recall. Our results indicate that USF-MAE consistently outperforms MoCo v3 across metrics. The average testing AUC for USF-MAE is 99.99% (+/-0.01% 95% CI), compared to 99.97% (+/-0.01%) for MoCo v3. USF-MAE achieves a mean testing accuracy of 99.33% (+/-0.18%), higher than the 98.99% (+/-0.28%) reported for MoCo v3. Similar trends are observed for the F1-score and recall, with improvements statistically significant across folds (paired t-test, p=0.0048 < 0.01). This proof-of-concept analysis suggests that USF-MAE learns more discriminative features for cardiac view classification than MoCo v3 when applied to this dataset. The enhanced performance across multiple metrics highlights the potential of USF-MAE for improving automated cardiac ultrasound classification."

Twenty-four students performed pairwise model comparisons, providing per-question judgments on (i) preferred model, (ii) perceived correctness, (iii) consistency, (iv) verbosity, and (v) confidence, along with global ratings of overall model quality, satisfaction across multiple dimensions (e.g., accuracy and clarity), and perceived mental effort required to verify answers. To benchmark technical validity, we applied an independent judge-based evaluation against official solutions for all ten questions, using strict correctness criteria. Results reveal a consistent gap between perceived helpfulness and formal correctness: for the most sequentially demanding problems (Q1- Q7), none of the evaluated LLMs matched the official answers, despite producing confident, well-structured explanations that students often rated favorably. Error analysis indicates that models frequently default to canonical textbook templates (e.g., standard ripple counters) and struggle to translate circuit structure into exact state evolution and timing behavior. These findings suggest that, without verification scaffolds, LLMs may be unreliable for core digital logic topics and can inadvertently reinforce misconceptions in undergraduate instruction."

While existing studies of nonstationary transport rely primarily on numerical solutions of advection--diffusion equations or parametric impulse-response fitting, they do not provide a closed-form description of trajectory-level arrival dynamics at absorbing boundaries. By adopting a change-of-measure formulation, we reveal a structural decomposition of the first-hitting-time density into a cumulative-drift displacement term and a stochastic boundary-flux modulation factor. This leads to an explicit analytical expression for the Corrected-Inverse-Gaussian (C-IG) density, extending the classical IG model to strongly nonstationary drift conditions while preserving constant-complexity evaluation. High-precision Monte Carlo simulations under both smooth pulsatile and abrupt switching drift profiles confirm that the proposed model accurately captures complex transport phenomena, including phase modulation, multi-pulse dispersion, and transient backflow. The resulting framework provides a physics-informed, computationally efficient channel model suitable for system-level analysis and receiver design in dynamic biological and molecular communication environments."

We advance this framework along three directions: scalable equilibrium engineering via reduced-rank and uncertainty-aware correlated equilibria, decentralized mechanism design for equilibrium selection without enforcement, and structured noncooperative dynamics with convergence guarantees. Beyond these technical contributions, we discuss core design principles that govern incentive-compatible coordination in decentralized systems. Together, these results establish a foundation for scalable, robust coordination in safety-critical air traffic systems."

To evaluate the impact of these power corrections, we estimate the twist-4 unpolarized FF using a spectator model and compute the normalized differential cross section for $π^0$ production. Our numerical analysis reveals that the interplay between kinematic hadron mass corrections and dynamical twist-4 effects improves the theoretical description of recent BESIII data at relatively low-$z$ region. Furthermore, the $Q$-dependence confirms that higher-twist corrections are dominant at intermediate energy scales. These findings indicate that standard leading-twist global analyses must be extended to include these power corrections for precise studies of hadronization dynamics."

OSCAR mechanically encodes the ovipositor-inspired motion pattern through a spring-loaded cam system that drives twelve circumferential sliders in a coordinated, phase-shifted sequence. By tuning the motion profile to maximize the retract phase relative to the advance phase, the capsule creates a controlled friction anisotropy at the interface that generates net forward thrust. We developed an analytical model incorporating a Kelvin-Voigt formulation to capture the viscoelastic stick--slip interactions between the sliders and the tissue, linking the asymmetry between advance and retract phase durations to mean thrust, and slider-reversal synchronization to thrust stability. Comprehensive force characterization experiments in ex-vivo porcine colon revealed a mean steady-state traction force of 0.85 N, closely matching the model. Furthermore, experiments confirmed that thrust generation is speed-independent and scales linearly with the phase asymmetry, in agreement with theoretical predictions, underscoring the capsule's predictable performance and scalability. In locomotion validation experiments, OSCAR demonstrated robust performance, achieving an average speed of 3.08 mm/s, a velocity sufficient to match the cecal intubation times of conventional colonoscopy. By coupling phase-encoded friction anisotropy with a predictive model, OSCAR delivers controllable thrust generation at low normal loads, enabling safer and more robust self-propelling locomotion for robotic capsule colonoscopy."

Classical GOF procedures are commonly calibrated either at fixed significance level (CLT scale) or through exponential error exponents (LDP scale). We establish that Bayes-risk optimal calibration operates on the moderate-deviation (MDP) scale, producing canonical $\\sqrt{\\log n}$ inflation of rejection thresholds and polynomially decaying Type I error. Our main contributions are: (i) we formalise the Rubin--Sethuraman program for KS-type statistics as a risk-calibration theorem with explicit regularity conditions on priors and empirical-process functionals; (ii) we develop the precise connection between Bayes-risk expansions and Sanov information asymptotics, showing how $\\log n$-order truncations arise naturally when risk, rather than pure exponents, is the evaluation criterion; (iii) we provide detailed applications to location testing under Laplace families, shape testing via Bayes factors, and connections to Fisher information geometry. The organizing principle throughout is that sample size enters Bayes-optimal GOF cutoffs through the MDP scale, unifying KS-based and Sanov-based perspectives under a single risk criterion."

    "abstract": "Modern deep neural networks achieve high predictive accuracy but remain poorly calibrated: their confidence scores do not reliably reflect the true probability of correctness. We propose a quantum-inspired classification head architecture that projects backbone features into a complex-valued Hilbert space and evolves them under a learned unitary transformation parameterised via the Cayley map. Through a controlled hybrid experimental design - training a single shared backbone and comparing lightweight interchangeable heads - we isolate the effect of complex-valued unitary representations on calibration. Our ablation study on CIFAR-10 reveals that the unitary magnitude head (complex features evolved under a Cayley unitary, read out via magnitude and softmax) achieves an Expected Calibration Error (ECE) of 0.0146, representing a 2.4x improvement over a standard softmax head (0.0355) and a 3.5x improvement over temperature scaling (0.0510). Surprisingly, replacing the softmax readout with a Born rule measurement layer - the quantum-mechanically motivated approach - degrades calibration to an ECE of 0.0819. On the CIFAR-10H human-uncertainty benchmark, the wave function head achieves the lowest KL-divergence (0.336) to human soft labels among all compared methods, indicating that complex-valued representations better capture the structure of human perceptual ambiguity. We provide theoretical analysis connecting norm-preserving unitary dynamics to calibration through feature-space geometry, report negative results on out-of-distribution detection and sentiment analysis to delineate the method's scope, and discuss practical implications for safety-critical applications.

    "abstract": "To support the emergence of AI-as-a-Service (AIaaS), communication service providers (CSPs) are on the verge of a radical transformation-from pure connectivity providers to AIaaS a managed network service (control-and-orchestration plane that exposes AI models). In this model, the CSP is responsible not only for transport/communications, but also for intent-to-model resolution and joint network-compute orchestration, i.e., reliable and timely end-to-end delivery. The resulting end-to-end AIaaS service thus becomes governed by communications impairments (delay, loss) and inference impairments (latency, error). A central open problem is an operational AIaaS control-and-orchestration framework that enforces high fidelity, particularly under multi-domain federation. This paper introduces an assurance-oriented AIaaS management plane based on Tail-Risk Envelopes (TREs): signed, composable per-domain descriptors that combine deterministic guardrails with stochastic rate-latency-impairment models. Using stochastic network calculus, we derive bounds on end-to-end delay violation probabilities across tandem domains and obtain an optimization-ready risk-budget decomposition. We show that tenant-level reservations prevent bursty traffic from inflating tail latency under TRE contracts. An auditing layer then uses runtime telemetry to estimate extreme-percentile performance, quantify uncertainty, and attribute tail-risk to each domain for accountability. Packet-level Monte-Carlo simulations demonstrate improved p99.9 compliance under overload via admission control and robust tenant isolation under correlated burstiness."

However, such training risks models learning to obfuscate their deception to evade the detector. Prior work has studied obfuscation only in artificial settings where models were directly rewarded for harmful output. We construct a realistic coding environment where reward hacking via hardcoding test cases naturally occurs, and show that obfuscation emerges in this setting. We introduce a taxonomy of possible outcomes when training against a deception detector. The model either remains honest, or becomes deceptive via two possible obfuscation strategies. (i) Obfuscated activations: the model outputs deceptive text while modifying its internal representations to no longer trigger the detector. (ii) Obfuscated policy: the model outputs deceptive text that evades the detector, typically by including a justification for the reward hack. Empirically, obfuscated activations arise from representation drift during RL, with or without a detector penalty. The probe penalty only incentivizes obfuscated policies; we theoretically show this is expected for policy gradient methods. Sufficiently high KL regularization and detector penalty can yield honest policies, establishing white-box deception detectors as viable training signals for tasks prone to reward hacking."

However, successful networked entanglement swapping relies on generating indistinguishable pairs of photons and preserving them over deployed fibers. This has limited most previous demonstrations to laboratory settings or relied on sophisticated methods to maintain the necessary indistinguishability. Here, we demonstrate a scalable entanglement swapping experiment using naturally indistinguishable entanglement sources based on warm atomic vapor cells. Without sharing lasers or optical frequency references between nodes, nor the need for pulsing the sources, we achieve a swapping rate of nearly 500 pairs/s while maintaining the CHSH parameter above 2. Additionally, we demonstrate the scalability of our method by maintaining the quality of the entanglement swapping on 17.6-km of deployed fibers in NYC, relying on commercially available SPADs at the spoke nodes, SNSPDs at the hub and standard time-synchronization techniques. Our work paves the way for the practical deployment of large-scale hub-and-spoke quantum networks within cities and data centers."

In this work, we bridge this gap by introducing a class of gradient-descent-type in-context Transformers that are Lipschitz-continuous by construction. We realize both MLP and attention blocks as explicit Euler steps of negative gradient flows, ensuring inherent stability without sacrificing expressivity. We prove a universal approximation theorem for this class within a Lipschitz-constrained function space. Crucially, our analysis adopts a measure-theoretic formalism, interpreting Transformers as operators on probability measures, to yield approximation guarantees independent of token count. These results provide a rigorous theoretical foundation for the design of robust, Lipschitz continuous Transformer architectures."

Here we provide a controlled demonstration of this physics in the spin-$\\tfrac{1}{2}$ quantum Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the breathing pyrochlore lattice with symmetry-allowed Dzyaloshinskii--Moriya interactions, using the pseudofermion functional renormalization group. We show that tuning the breathing asymmetry stabilizes extended quantum analogues of both rank-1 and rank-2 $U(1)$ Coulomb liquids within a single microscopic model, directly distinguished by their characteristic pinch-point morphologies in momentum space. This provides the first controlled quantum realization in three dimensions where gauge theories of different rank emerge within a single microscopic spin Hamiltonian. In addition, quantum fluctuations qualitatively reshape the classical nearest-neighbor atlas of phases, causing an incommensurate spiral instability and an extended quantum-disordered regime without dipolar order, both absent from the classical model. Our results establish the breathing pyrochlore as a timely and experimentally relevant platform where higher-rank gauge constraints, conventional magnetic order, and fluctuation-driven quantum phases compete on equal footing, opening a direct route to diagnosing emergent gauge structure in three-dimensional quantum magnets."

These algorithms are (essentially) optimal with respect to their communication (message) complexity in the {\\em quantum routing model} introduced in [PODC 2025]. The message complexity of our algorithms is $\\tilde{O}(n)$ for leader election, broadcast, and MST, and $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{mn})$ for BFS ($n$ and $m$ are the number of nodes and edges of the network, respectively). These message bounds are nearly tight in the quantum routing model since we show almost matching corresponding quantum message lower bounds. Our results significantly improve on the prior work of [PODC 2025], who presented distributed quantum algorithms under the same model that had a message complexity of $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{mn})$ for leader election. Our algorithms demonstrate the significant communication advantage that quantum routing has over classical in distributed computing, since $Ω(m)$ is a well-established classical message lower bound for leader election, broadcast, MST, and BFS that applies even to randomized Monte-Carlo algorithms [JACM 2015]. Thus, our quantum algorithms can, in general, give a quadratic advantage in the communication cost for these fundamental problems. A main technical tool we use to design our distributed algorithms is quantum walks based on electric networks. We posit a framework for using quantum walks in the distributed setting to design communication-efficient distributed quantum algorithms. Our framework can be used as a black box to significantly reduce communication costs and may be of independent interest. Additionally, our lower-bound technique for establishing distributed quantum message lower bounds can also be applied to other problems."

    "abstract": "Although speculative decoding is widely used to accelerate Vision-Language Models (VLMs) inference, it faces severe performance collapse when applied to Video Large Language Models (Vid-LLMs). The draft model typically falls into the trap of attention dilution and negative visual gain due to key-value cache explosion and context window mismatches. We observe a visual semantic internalization phenomenon in Vid-LLMs, indicating that critical visual semantics are implicitly encoded into text hidden states during deep-layer interactions, which renders raw visual inputs structurally redundant during deep inference. To address this, we propose the Sparrow framework, which first utilizes visually-aware text-anchored window attention via hidden state reuse to fully offload visual computation to the target model, and leverages intermediate-layer visual state bridging to train the draft model with semantic-rich intermediate states, thereby filtering out low-level visual noise. Additionally, a multi-token prediction strategy is introduced to bridge the training-inference distribution shift. Experiments show that Sparrow achieves an average speedup of 2.82x even with 25k visual tokens, effectively resolving the performance degradation in long sequences and offering a practical solution for real-time long video tasks."

LX consistently outperforms leading models, including GPT-4 Turbo, RoBERTa, and DeepSeek, achieving 81% macro-F1 accuracy on open-ended survey responses and greater than 95% accuracy on third-party-annotated Amazon and Yelp reviews. An application of LX to online retail data, using seemingly unrelated regression, affirms that review-expressed emotions predict product ratings, which in turn predict purchase behavior. Most emotional effects are mediated by product ratings, though some emotions, such as discontent and peacefulness, influence purchase directly, indicating that emotional tone provides meaningful signals beyond star ratings. To support its use, a no-code, cost-free, LX web application is available, enabling scalable analyses of consumer-authored text. In establishing a new methodological foundation for consumer perception measurement, this research demonstrates new methods for leveraging large language models to advance marketing research and practice, thereby achieving validated detection of marketing constructs from consumer data."

    "abstract": "Misclassifications in spam and phishing detection are very harmful, as false negatives expose users to attacks while false positives degrade trust. Existing uncertainty-based detectors can flag potential errors, but possibly be deceived and offer limited interpretability. This paper presents X-MAP, an eXplainable Misclassification Analysis and Profilling framework that reveals topic-level semantic patterns behind model failures. X-MAP combines SHAP-based feature attributions with non-negative matrix factorization to build interpretable topic profiles for reliably classified spam/phishing and legitimate messages, and measures each message's deviation from these profiles using Jensen-Shannon divergence. Experiments on SMS and phishing datasets show that misclassified messages exhibit at least two times larger divergence than correctly classified ones. As a detector, X-MAP achieves up to 0.98 AUROC and lowers the false-rejection rate at 95% TRR to 0.089 on positive predictions. When used as a repair layer on base detectors, it recovers up to 97% of falsely rejected correct predictions with moderate leakage. These results demonstrate X-MAP's effectiveness and interpretability for improving spam and phishing detection."

In particular, the shape parameter of the GPD characterizes the extremal properties of the distribution. As described in this paper, we propose a method for grouping shape parameters in the GPD for clustered data via graph fused lasso. The proposed method simultaneously estimates the model parameters and identifies which clusters can be grouped together. We establish the asymptotic theory of the proposed estimator and demonstrate that its variance is lower than that of the cluster-wise estimator. This variance reduction not only enhances estimation stability but also provides a principled basis for identifying homogeneity and heterogeneity among clusters in terms of their tail behavior. We assess the performance of the proposed estimator through Monte Carlo simulations. As an illustrative example, our method is applied to rainfall data from 996 clustered sites across Japan."

    "abstract": "With AI-as-a-Service (AIaaS) now deployed across multiple providers and model tiers, selecting the appropriate model instance at run time is increasingly outside the end user's knowledge and operational control. Accordingly, the 6G service providers are envisioned to play a crucial role in exposing AIaaS in a setting where users submit only an intent while the network helps in the intent-to-model matching (resolution) and execution placement under policy, trust, and Quality of Service (QoS) constraints. The network role becomes to discover candidate execution endpoints and selects a suitable model/anchor under policy and QoS constraints in a process referred here to as AI-paging (by analogy to cellular call paging). In the proposed architecture, AI-paging is a control-plane transaction that resolves an intent into an AI service identity (AISI), a scoped session token (AIST), and an expiring admission lease (COMMIT) that authorizes user-plane steering to a selected AI execution anchor (AEXF) under a QoS binding. AI-Paging enforces two invariants: (i) lease-gated steering (without COMMIT, no steering state is installed) and (ii) make-before-break anchoring to support continuity and reliability of AIaaS services under dynamic network conditions. We prototype AI-Paging using existing control- and user-plane mechanisms (service-based control, QoS flows, and policy-based steering) with no new packet headers, ensuring compatibility with existing 3GPP-based exposure and management architectures, and evaluate transaction latency, relocation interruption, enforcement correctness under lease expiry, and audit-evidence overhead under mobility and failures."

    "abstract": "Dynamical billiards consist of a particle on a two-dimensional table, bouncing elastically off a boundary curve. The state of the system is given by two numbers: one describing the location along the curve where the bounce occurs, and another describing the incoming angle of the bounce. Successive bounces define a two-dimensional area preserving map, and iterating this map gives a dynamical system first studied by Birkhoff. One of the simplest smooth table shapes is that of an ellipse, in which case the dynamics of the billiard map is completely integrable. The longstanding Birkhoff conjecture is that elliptical tables are the only smooth convex table for which complete integrability occurs. In this spirit, we present an implicit real analytic method for iterating billiard maps on perturbed elliptical tables. This method allows us to compute local stable and unstable manifolds of periodic orbits using the parameterization method. Globalizing these local manifolds numerically provides insight into the dynamics of the table."

    "abstract": "Generating realistic synthetic populations is essential for agent-based models (ABM) in transportation and urban planning. Current methods face two major limitations. First, many rely on a single dataset or follow a sequential data fusion and generation process, which means they fail to capture the complex interplay between features. Second, these approaches struggle with sampling zeros (valid but unobserved attribute combinations) and structural zeros (infeasible combinations due to logical constraints), which reduce the diversity and feasibility of the generated data. This study proposes a novel method to simultaneously integrate and synthesize multi-source datasets using a Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN) with gradient penalty. This joint learning method improves both the diversity and feasibility of synthetic data by defining a regularization term (inverse gradient penalty) for the generator loss function. For the evaluation, we implement a unified evaluation metric for similarity, and place special emphasis on measuring diversity and feasibility through recall, precision, and the F1 score. Results show that the proposed joint approach outperforms the sequential baseline, with recall increasing by 7\\% and precision by 15\\%. Additionally, the regularization term further improves diversity and feasibility, reflected in a 10\\% increase in recall and 1\\% in precision. We assess similarity distributions using a five-metric score. The joint approach performs better overall, and reaches a score of 88.1 compared to 84.6 for the sequential method. Since synthetic populations serve as a key input for ABM, this multi-source generative approach has the potential to significantly enhance the accuracy and reliability of ABM."

    "abstract": "Learning generalist policies capable of accomplishing a plethora of everyday tasks remains an open challenge in dexterous manipulation. In particular, collecting large-scale manipulation data via real-world teleoperation is expensive and difficult to scale. While learning in simulation provides a feasible alternative, designing multiple task-specific environments and rewards for training is similarly challenging. We propose Dex4D, a framework that instead leverages simulation for learning task-agnostic dexterous skills that can be flexibly recomposed to perform diverse real-world manipulation tasks. Specifically, Dex4D learns a domain-agnostic 3D point track conditioned policy capable of manipulating any object to any desired pose. We train this 'Anypose-to-Anypose' policy in simulation across thousands of objects with diverse pose configurations, covering a broad space of robot-object interactions that can be composed at test time. At deployment, this policy can be zero-shot transferred to real-world tasks without finetuning, simply by prompting it with desired object-centric point tracks extracted from generated videos. During execution, Dex4D uses online point tracking for closed-loop perception and control. Extensive experiments in simulation and on real robots show that our method enables zero-shot deployment for diverse dexterous manipulation tasks and yields consistent improvements over prior baselines. Furthermore, we demonstrate strong generalization to novel objects, scene layouts, backgrounds, and trajectories, highlighting the robustness and scalability of the proposed framework."

The proof techniques developed so far are non-constructive, and no meaningful bounds on the size of interpolants are known. Hybrid modal logics (or modal logics with nominals) are a particularly interesting class of logics without CIP: in their case, CIP cannot be restored without sacrificing decidability and, in applications, interpolants in these logics can serve as definite descriptions and separators between positive and negative data examples in description logic knowledge bases. In this contribution we show, using a new hypermosaic elimination technique, that in many standard hybrid modal logics Craig interpolants can be computed in fourfold exponential time, if they exist. On the other hand, we show that the existence of uniform interpolants is undecidable, which is in stark contrast to modal or intuitionistic logic where uniform interpolants always exist."

    "abstract": "Sketching is inherently a sequential process, in which strokes are drawn in a meaningful order to explore and refine ideas. However, most generative models treat sketches as static images, overlooking the temporal structure that underlies creative drawing. We present a data-efficient approach for sequential sketch generation that adapts pretrained text-to-video diffusion models to generate sketching processes. Our key insight is that large language models and video diffusion models offer complementary strengths for this task: LLMs provide semantic planning and stroke ordering, while video diffusion models serve as strong renderers that produce high-quality, temporally coherent visuals. We leverage this by representing sketches as short videos in which strokes are progressively drawn on a blank canvas, guided by text-specified ordering instructions. We introduce a two-stage fine-tuning strategy that decouples the learning of stroke ordering from the learning of sketch appearance. Stroke ordering is learned using synthetic shape compositions with controlled temporal structure, while visual appearance is distilled from as few as seven manually authored sketching processes that capture both global drawing order and the continuous formation of individual strokes. Despite the extremely limited amount of human-drawn sketch data, our method generates high-quality sequential sketches that closely follow text-specified orderings while exhibiting rich visual detail. We further demonstrate the flexibility of our approach through extensions such as brush style conditioning and autoregressive sketch generation, enabling additional controllability and interactive, collaborative drawing."

In the present work, owing to the special properties of the coefficients constructed with the Gaussian measure, we bound the distance to $1$ of the ratio of the expected energy to the expected enstrophy (this ratio is at most $1$ with our normalization). Together with our companion article, this shows that for suitable Brownian forcings an inviscid condensation inducing an attrition of all but the lowest modes takes place."

For configuration, geometry-driven analytical approaches are appealing for their simplicity and real-time operation, but their performance in challenging environments such as industrial halls with dense multipath and metallic scattering is not well established. To this end, we present a measurement-based evaluation of geometry-driven RIS beam steering in a large industrial hall using a 5 GHz RIS prototype. A novel RIS configuration is proposed in which four patch antennas are mounted in close proximity in front of the RIS to steer the incident field and enable controlled reflection. For this setup, analytically computed, quantized configurations are implemented. Two-dimensional received power maps from two measurement areas reveal consistent, spatially selective focusing. Configurations optimized near the receiver produce clear power maxima, while steering to offset locations triggers a rapid 20-30 dB reduction. With increasing RIS-receiver distance, elevation selectivity broadens due to finite-aperture and geometric constraints, while azimuth steering remains robust. These results confirm the practical viability of geometry-driven RIS beam steering in industrial environments and support its use for spatial field control and localization under non-ideal propagation."

Conventional encoding methods (e.g., one-hot) often fail to convey the nuanced relationships among closely related subtypes, limiting AI's semantic comprehension. To address this limitation, this study proposes a novel training approach that employs large language model (LLM) embeddings (e.g., OpenAI GPT and Meta LLaMA) as encodings to preserve finer distinctions in building semantics. We evaluated the proposed method by training GraphSAGE models to classify 42 building object subtypes across five high-rise residential building information models (BIMs). Various embedding dimensions were tested, including original high-dimensional LLM embeddings (1,536, 3,072, or 4,096) and 1,024-dimensional compacted embeddings generated via the Matryoshka representation model. Experimental results demonstrated that LLM encodings outperformed the conventional one-hot baseline, with the llama-3 (compacted) embedding achieving a weighted average F1-score of 0.8766, compared to 0.8475 for one-hot encoding. The results underscore the promise of leveraging LLM-based encodings to enhance AI's ability to interpret complex, domain-specific building semantics. As the capabilities of LLMs and dimensionality reduction techniques continue to evolve, this approach holds considerable potential for broad application in semantic elaboration tasks throughout the AECO industry."

The issue is resolved by applying the Lindblad equation which is in accordance with a proper quantum map. The Lindblad equation, however, also implies the absence of steady state coherence. We conclude that steady state coherence in a a qubit is incompatible with a quantum map."

Specifically, we consider three different stability notions: envy-freeness, swap stability, and jump stability.

With scaling laws only beginning to be studied in the field, we investigate neural scaling laws for boosted jet classification using the public JetClass dataset. We derive compute optimal scaling laws and identify an effective performance limit that can be consistently approached through increased compute. We study how data repetition, common in HEP where simulation is expensive, modifies the scaling yielding a quantifiable effective dataset size gain. We then study how the scaling coefficients and asymptotic performance limits vary with the choice of input features and particle multiplicity, demonstrating that increased compute reliably drives performance toward an asymptotic limit, and that more expressive, lower-level features can raise the performance limit and improve results at fixed dataset size."

    "abstract": "When moving away from stability or in loosely-bound systems, few-body clusterized structures like two-neutron halo nuclei appear. These emerge from the interplay between the many- and few-body degrees of freedom, and/or strong coupling between bound and continuum states. This motivates the development of models that can accurately describe few-body dynamics while enforcing shell effects. This work has two goals: understanding how to accurately enforce the Pauli principle in few-body models, as well as presenting new technical developments that allow for more robust and cheaper three-body calculations. We focus on properties of the two-neutron halo 22C, but expect the conclusions to apply to other few-body systems. We use a three-body, hyperspherical harmonics formalism combined with the R-matrix method. We compare predictions for properties of 22C starting from phenomenological interactions and using two methods to remove Pauli-forbidden states, the projection and supersymmetric methods. We also present the algorithms and derivations used. Additionally, we explore model space truncations that allow for reduced computational time. We show convergence of the calculation of both bound and scattering states for $K_{max}\\sim 40$. The two methods to enforce the Pauli-exclusion principle lead to different predictions of 22C properties; the projection method is more accurate. We find one efficient channel truncation that reduces the computational cost of our calculations by 20%. Our study clarifies that the projection method is more accurate than the supersymmetric one to enforce the Pauli-exclusion principle. Technical and algorithmic developments enable accurate and efficient computation of two-neutron halo properties. This development paves the way to robust uncertainty quantification in three-body predictions, and is a useful starting point to tackle more complex systems and observables."

    "abstract": "On two-sided matching platforms such as online dating and recruiting, recommendation algorithms often aim to maximize the total number of matches. However, this objective creates an imbalance, where some users receive far too many matches while many others receive very few and eventually abandon the platform. Retaining users is crucial for many platforms, such as those that depend heavily on subscriptions. Some may use fairness objectives to solve the problem of match maximization. However, fairness in itself is not the ultimate objective for many platforms, as users do not suddenly reward the platform simply because exposure is equalized. In practice, where user retention is often the ultimate goal, casually relying on fairness will leave the optimization of retention up to luck. In this work, instead of maximizing matches or axiomatically defining fairness, we formally define the new problem setting of maximizing user retention in two-sided matching platforms. To this end, we introduce a dynamic learning-to-rank (LTR) algorithm called Matching for Retention (MRet). Unlike conventional algorithms for two-sided matching, our approach models user retention by learning personalized retention curves from each user's profile and interaction history. Based on these curves, MRet dynamically adapts recommendations by jointly considering the retention gains of both the user receiving recommendations and those who are being recommended, so that limited matching opportunities can be allocated where they most improve overall retention. Naturally but importantly, empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets from a major online dating platform show that MRet achieves higher user retention, since conventional methods optimize matches or fairness rather than retention."

We present a three-fold contribution, with the PicoCal calorimeter, planned for the LHCb Upgrade II experiment, used as a test case. First, we develop a lightweight autoencoder to compress a 32-sample timing readout, representative of that of the PicoCal, into a two-dimensional latent space. Second, we introduce a systematic, hardware-aware quantization strategy and show that the model can be reduced to 10-bit weights with minimal performance loss. Third, as a barrier to the adoption of on-detector ML is the lack of support for radiation-hard FPGAs in the High-Energy Physics community's standard ML synthesis tool, hls4ml, we develop a new backend for this library. This new back-end enables the automatic translation of ML models into High-Level Synthesis (HLS) projects for the Microchip PolarFire family of FPGAs, one of the few commercially available and radiation hard FPGAs. We present the synthesis of the autoencoder on a target PolarFire FPGA, which indicates that a latency of 25 ns can be achieved. We show that the resources utilized are low enough that the model can be placed within the inherently protected logic of the FPGA. Our extension to hls4ml is a significant contribution, paving the way for broader adoption of ML on FPGAs in high-radiation environments."

    "abstract": "Recent advances in urban region representation learning have enabled a wide range of applications in urban analytics, yet existing methods remain limited in their capabilities to generalize across cities and analytic tasks. We aim to generalize urban representation learning beyond city- and task-specific settings, towards a foundation-style model for urban analytics. To this end, we propose UrbanVerse, a model for cross-city urban representation learning and cross-task urban analytics. For cross-city generalization, UrbanVerse focuses on features local to the target regions and structural features of the nearby regions rather than the entire city. We model regions as nodes on a graph, which enables a random walk-based procedure to form \"sequences of regions\" that reflect both local and neighborhood structural features for urban region representation learning. For cross-task generalization, we propose a cross-task learning module named HCondDiffCT. This module integrates region-conditioned prior knowledge and task-conditioned semantics into the diffusion process to jointly model multiple downstream urban prediction tasks. HCondDiffCT is generic. It can also be integrated with existing urban representation learning models to enhance their downstream task effectiveness. Experiments on real-world datasets show that UrbanVerse consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across six tasks under cross-city settings, achieving up to 35.89% improvements in prediction accuracy."

We introduce a generative-first architecture for audio autoencoding that increases temporal downsampling from 2048x to 3360x and supports continuous and discrete representations and common audio channel formats in one model. By balancing compression, quality, and speed, it delivers 10x faster encoding, 1.6x lower rates, and eliminates channel-format-specific variants while maintaining competitive reconstruction quality. This enables applications previously constrained by processing costs: a 60-second mono signal compresses to 788 tokens, making generative modeling more tractable."

    "abstract": "Shallow ensembles provide a convenient strategy for uncertainty quantification in machine learning interatomic potentials, that is computationally efficient because the different ensemble members share a large part of the model weights. In this work, we systematically investigate training strategies for shallow ensembles to balance calibration performance with computational cost. We first demonstrate that explicit optimization of a negative log-likelihood (NLL) loss improves calibration with respect to approaches based on ensembles of randomly initialized models, or on a last-layer Laplace approximation. However, models trained solely on energy objectives yield miscalibrated force estimates. We show that explicitly modeling force uncertainties via an NLL objective is essential for reliable calibration, though it typically incurs a significant computational overhead. To address this, we validate an efficient protocol: full-model fine-tuning of a shallow ensemble originally trained with a probabilistic energy loss, or one sampled from the Laplace posterior. This approach results in negligible reduction in calibration quality compared to training from scratch, while reducing training time by up to 96%. We evaluate this protocol across a diverse range of materials, including amorphous carbon, ionic liquids (BMIM), liquid water (H$_2$O), barium titanate (BaTiO$_3$), and a model tetrapeptide (Ac-Ala3-NHMe), establishing practical guidelines for reliable uncertainty quantification in atomistic machine learning."

    "abstract": "In solar-like stars, acoustic modes provide the main way of probing their internal structure and dynamics. Although these modes are expected to be ubiquitous in stars with convective envelopes, Kepler observations reveal that a significant fraction of solar-like stars show no detectable acoustic modes, particularly among rapidly rotating and magnetically active stars. Recent theoretical work by Bessila et al. (2025) has proposed that rotation tends to inhibit convective motions, thereby reducing the power available for stochastic mode excitation. Here, we test this prediction using fully compressible hydrodynamical simulations of a solar-like star. We perform a series of 2.5D simulations, which consider longitudinal symmetry, using the MUSIC code spanning rotation rates from 0 to 8 $Ω_{\\odot}$. We find a clear and systematic decline of acoustic mode amplitudes with increasing rotation rate. In the most rapidly rotating models, mode damping rates are also enhanced. The combined reduction in excitation and increase in damping with increasing rotation rate provide a physical explanation for the observed decrease in mode detectability in rapidly rotating solar-like stars. Our results demonstrate that rotation can significantly modify oscillation properties and must be accounted for when interpreting asteroseismic observations."

    "abstract": "Humanoid motion control has witnessed significant breakthroughs in recent years, with deep reinforcement learning (RL) emerging as a primary catalyst for achieving complex, human-like behaviors. However, the high dimensionality and intricate dynamics of humanoid robots make manual motion design impractical, leading to a heavy reliance on expensive motion capture (MoCap) data. These datasets are not only costly to acquire but also frequently lack the necessary geometric context of the surrounding physical environment. Consequently, existing motion synthesis frameworks often suffer from a decoupling of motion and scene, resulting in physical inconsistencies such as contact slippage or mesh penetration during terrain-aware tasks. In this work, we present MeshMimic, an innovative framework that bridges 3D scene reconstruction and embodied intelligence to enable humanoid robots to learn coupled \"motion-terrain\" interactions directly from video. By leveraging state-of-the-art 3D vision models, our framework precisely segments and reconstructs both human trajectories and the underlying 3D geometry of terrains and objects. We introduce an optimization algorithm based on kinematic consistency to extract high-quality motion data from noisy visual reconstructions, alongside a contact-invariant retargeting method that transfers human-environment interaction features to the humanoid agent. Experimental results demonstrate that MeshMimic achieves robust, highly dynamic performance across diverse and challenging terrains. Our approach proves that a low-cost pipeline utilizing only consumer-grade monocular sensors can facilitate the training of complex physical interactions, offering a scalable path toward the autonomous evolution of humanoid robots in unstructured environments."

On the module side, we introduce the \\emph{Galois transport distance}, defined by factoring two modules through a common ``apex'' poset via pairs of Galois insertions and measuring the maximal displacement in the index poset. This construction generalizes the interleaving distance in both the classical one-parameter and multiparameter settings, and yields an extended metric on isomorphism classes of $\\mathbf{P}$-modules. On the homological side, we define a bottleneck distance between minimal projective resolutions by matching indecomposable projectives degreewise, with contractible cones playing the role of diagonal terms. Our main theorem shows that this resolution-level bottleneck distance is always bounded above by the Galois transport distance, providing a metric stability result formulated entirely at the level of modules and their minimal projective resolutions. We then treat persistence as an application. Passing to the interval poset and a kernel construction, we interpret persistence diagrams as minimal projective resolutions of kernel modules and obtain a corresponding stability inequality. In the one-parameter case this recovers classical bottleneck stability, while in the multiparameter setting it extends naturally to signed diagrams arising from minimal projective resolutions. Via a general relationship between minimal projective resolutions and Möbius inversion, these results can be interpreted as a stability theorem for Möbius homology, while remaining entirely phrased in the language of projective resolutions."

Existing methods improve reasoning by expanding token-level search through chain-of-thought prompting, self-consistency, or reinforcement learning, but they leave the model's latent representation space fixed. When the required abstraction is not already encoded in this space, performance collapses. We propose Recursive Concept Evolution (RCE), a framework that enables pretrained language models to modify their internal representation geometry during inference. RCE introduces dynamically generated low-rank concept subspaces that are spawned when representational inadequacy is detected, selected through a minimum description length criterion, merged when synergistic, and consolidated via constrained optimization to preserve stability. This process allows the model to construct new abstractions rather than recombining existing ones. We integrate RCE with Mistral-7B and evaluate it across compositional reasoning benchmarks. RCE yields 12-18 point gains on ARC-AGI-2, 8-14 point improvements on GPQA and BBH, and consistent reductions in depth-induced error on MATH and HLE."

Despite this limitation, under natural assumptions on a Gagliardo-type energy, we succeed in proving a variety of small energy regularity results and improve on known results, even in the isotropic case for which some monotonicity formula is available. To this end, we exploit recent developments in the regularity theory of nonlocal equations and as a by-product, we explain how these results apply to classes of harmonic maps with free boundary and lead to new potential-theoretic estimates. As another application, we obtain higher differentiability results for the fractional harmonic map heat flow."

In the general setting, for unimodular $\\vp$, we obtain exact formulas and two sided estimates for $m(D_{\\varphi})$ by analyzing the norms of associated Toeplitz and Hankel operators restricted to the model space.

Akin to classical Lagrange-Newton methods, including primal-dual interior point methods the Bregman proximal point algorithm repeatedly solves regularized KKT inclusions by minimizing a smooth Bregman augmented Lagrangian function, obtained after marginalizing out the multiplier variables. Thanks to non-Euclidean geometries the marginal function is generalized self-concordant and therefore within the regime of Newton's method which converges quadratically if the step-size in the outer proximal point loop is chosen carefully. The operator-theoretic viewpoint allows us to employ the framework of metric subregularity to derive fast rates for the outer loop, and eventually state a joint complexity bound. Important special cases of our framework are a proximal variant of the exponential multiplier method due to Tseng and Bertsekas and interior-point proximal augmented Lagrangian schemes closely related to those of Pougkakiotis and Gondzio."

This assistant proactively communicates step-by-step instructions to a user performing a furniture assembly task, and answers user questions. We construct a dataset containing conversations where the assistant guides the user in performing the task. On observing that an off-the-shelf language model is a very talkative assistant, we design a novel User Whim Agnostic (UWA) LoRA finetuning method which improves the model's ability to suppress less informative dialogues, while maintaining its tendency to communicate important instructions. This leads to >30% improvement in the F-score. Finetuning the model also results in a 16x speedup by eliminating the need to provide in-context examples in the prompt.

In many of these models, there is a gap between the best known results for the unweighted and weighted versions. In this work, we address the question of closing this gap.

We find an economically small but statistically significant negative average effect of income inequality on subsequent economic growth, together with strong evidence of substantial heterogeneity and selective publication based on statistical significance, but no evidence of systematic directional bias. To explain the observed heterogeneity, we estimate a meta-regression. The results indicate that both real-world characteristics and research design choices shape reported effect sizes. In particular, inequality measured net of taxes and transfers is associated with more negative growth effects, and the adverse impact of inequality is weaker - or even reversed - in high-income economies relative to developing countries. Methodological choices also matter: cross-sectional studies tend to report more negative estimates, while fixed-effects, instrumental-variable, and GMM estimators are associated with more positive estimates in panel settings."

By exploiting inequality constraints, such tests can achieve substantial gains in power and interpretability. However, these gains come at a cost: when the imposed constraints are misspecified, the resulting inferences may be misleading or even invalid, and Type III errors may occur, i.e., the null hypothesis may be rejected when neither the null nor the alternative is true. To address this problem, this paper introduces safe tests. Heuristically, a safe test is a testing procedure that is asymptotically free of Type III errors. The proposed test is accompanied by a certificate of validity, a pre--test that assesses whether the original hypotheses are consistent with the data, thereby ensuring that the null hypothesis is rejected only when warranted, enabling principled inference without risk of systematic error. Although the development in this paper focus on testing problems in order--restricted inference, the underlying ideas are more broadly applicable. The proposed methodology is evaluated through simulation studies and the analysis of well--known illustrative data examples, demonstrating strong protection against Type III errors while maintaining power comparable to standard procedures."

We present a theoretical analysis and a recipe for obtaining an optimal energy ratio between such selected ions and molecular ions in unwanted rovibronic states, created by direct photoionization. It is shown that the second-order chromatic aberration of a dc quadrupole bender can be used to isolate the state-selectively prepared molecular ions. The phase-space properties of ions prepared by MATI are ideally suited for axial injection into a linear radio-frequency trap. A modified approach for carrying out MATI within such an ion trap is also described."

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence is increasingly embedded in education, yet there remains a need to explain how students conceptualize AI's role in their thinking and learning. This study proposes a framework positioning AI as a dynamic cognitive partner whose function shifts across learning situations. Using qualitative analysis of written responses from 133 secondary students in Hong Kong following completion of an AI literacy course, we identified nine interrelated dimensions through which learners described AI as partnering with their cognition: conceptual scaffolding for difficult ideas; feedback and error detection; idea stimulation; cognitive organization; adaptive tutoring support; metacognitive monitoring support; task and cognitive load regulation; learning continuity beyond classroom boundaries; and explanation reframing through representational flexibility during moments of being stuck or overwhelmed. Across these dimensions, students distinguished between productive support that extends understanding and unproductive reliance that replaces cognitive effort, indicating situational awareness of when AI should and should not be used. Grounded in sociocultural theory, distributed cognition, self-regulated learning, and cognitive load perspectives, the framework clarifies how AI becomes integrated into learners' cognitive activity while illuminating the boundary between cognitive extension and substitution."

Due to its small ionization energy (large electron affinity), deposited Cs atoms (C$_{60}$ molecules) are expected to provide a solid surface with electrons (holes). Upon dosing the dopants to Mott-insulating Ca$_2$RuO$_4$, we found a new Ru $3d$ photoemission peak emerging on the lower binding-energy side, suggesting the creation of a core-hole screening channel associated with coherent Ru $4d$ states around the Fermi level. For both the Cs and C$_{60}$ dosing, this change occurred without an appreciable chemical potential jump. The coherent state, therefore, develops within the Mott gap through hybridization with the impurity level of the dopants. The present work highlights the flexibility of Mott-insulator surfaces as a playground for metal-insulator transitions."

Based on the Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon equations, combined with the Tulczyjew spin supplementary condition, we derive the orbital dynamic equations for spinning particles moving in the equatorial plane and impose a timelike constraint to exclude unphysical superluminal trajectories. By comparing with the classical Schwarzschild black hole, we systematically analyze the effects of the nonlocal gravitational parameters $ζ$ and $b$ on the effective potential governing the radial motion of particles and the innermost stable circular orbit. In addition, gravitational waveforms exhibit significant phase differences: an increase in $ζ$ induces a phase delay, whereas an increase in $b$ results in a phase advance. A one-year simulation of the orbital evolution of an extreme mass ratio inspiral demonstrates that when $b=2$ and $ζ\\approx10^{-6}$, the mismatch between the gravitational waveforms predicted for the nonlocal gravity black hole and those for the Schwarzschild black hole reaches the distinguishable threshold ($\\mathcal{M}=0.0125$), providing a basis for observational discrimination between general relativity and nonlocal gravity."

Here, we introduce ultrasonic lubrication as a method to actively control friction in robotic locomotion. By exciting resonant structures at ultrasonic frequencies, contact interfaces can dynamically switch between \"grip\" and \"slip\" states, enabling locomotion. We developed two friction control modules, a cylindrical design for lumen-like environments and a flat-plate design for external surfaces, and integrated them into bio-inspired systems modeled after inchworm and wasp ovipositor locomotion. Both systems achieved bidirectional locomotion with nearly perfect locomotion efficiencies that exceeded 90%. Friction characterization experiments further demonstrated substantial friction reduction across various surfaces, including rigid, soft, granular, and biological tissue interfaces, under dry and wet conditions, and on surfaces with different levels of roughness, confirming the broad applicability of ultrasonic lubrication to locomotion tasks. These findings establish ultrasonic lubrication as a viable active friction control mechanism for robotic locomotion, with the potential to reduce design complexity and improve efficiency of robotic locomotion systems."

Here, I investigate the Néel temperature of the (hypothetical) altermagnetic state of bulk RuO$_2$, stabilized via the DFT$+U$ technique, by mapping on a Heisenberg Hamiltonian. The Néel temperature scales monotonously with the magnetic moment up to the point where a large $+U$ term opens a band gap and turns RuO$_2$ semiconducting. The maximum Néel temperature obtained by this procedure is 408\\,K at $U=3$\\,eV, and much smaller values for smaller $U$. A reciprocal-space eigenvalue analysis reveals a helimagnetic groundstate of the spin model due to intra-sublattice antiferromagnetic coupling. This situation resembles the isostructural $β$-MnO$_2$, which is a prototype helimagnet. Further comparison with calculations on CrO$_2$ and altermagnetic MnF$_2$ taking $U$ as an adjustable parameter supports the validity of the spin model analysis."

    "abstract": "This article investigates the causal antecedents of conflictual language and the geometry of interaction in online threaded conversations related to climate change. We employ three annotation dimensions, inferred through LLM prompting and averaging, to capture complementary aspects of discursive conflict (such as stance: agreement vs disagreement; tone: attacking vs respectful; and emotional versus factual framing) and use data from a threaded online forum to examine how these dimensions respond to temporal, conversational, and arborescent structural features of discussions. We show that, as suggested by the literature, longer delays between successive posts in a thread are associated with replies that are, on average, more respectful, whereas longer delays relative to the parent post are associated with slightly less disagreement but more emotional (less factual) language. Second, we characterize alignment with the local conversational environment and find strong convergence both toward the average stance, tone and emotional framing of older sibling posts replying to the same parent and toward those of the parent post itself, with parent post effects generally stronger than sibling effects. We further show that early branch-level responses condition these alignment dynamics, such that parent-child stance alignment is amplified or attenuated depending on whether a branch is initiated in agreement or disagreement with the discussion's root message. These influences are largely additive for civility-related dimensions (attacking vs respectful, disagree vs agree), whereas for emotional versus factual framing there is a significant interaction: alignment with the parent's emotionality is amplified when older siblings are similarly aligned."

    "abstract": "What, if anything, should a frequentist say about a single realized confidence interval (CI) and its chance of having covered the parameter? Jerzy Neyman's original answer was to refuse any nondegenerate probability for coverage ex post and, instead, to \"state that the interval covers\". In this paper I argue that the usual frequentist machinery already supports a different reading. I treat the coverage event as a Bernoulli random variable, with the nominal level 1-alpha as its design-based success probability, and view \"confidence\" as a probability forecast for that Bernoulli outcome. Using strictly proper scoring rules, I show that 1-alpha is the unique optimal constant forecast for coverage, both before and after observing the data, and that it remains optimal post-trial in common unbounded, translation-invariant models with pivot-based CIs. When the design yields a theta-free statistic--such as the relative width of the interval in a finite-window uniform model--the conditional coverage given that statistic provides a nonconstant, design-based refinement of 1-alpha that strictly improves predictive performance. Two thought experiments, a Monty Hall-style shell game and the \"lost submarine\" example of Morey et al. (2016), illustrate how this perspective resolves familiar interpretational puzzles about CIs without appealing to priors or single-case subjective degrees of belief. I conclude with simple \"what to do when you see an interval\" guidance for applied work and some implications for teaching confidence intervals as tools for forecasting long-run coverage.

Recent work has shown the existence of allocations that simultaneously satisfy multiplicative approximate MMS and envy-based guarantees such as EF1 or EFX. Motivated by this line of research, we study for the first time the compatibility between ordinal approximations of MMS and envy-based fairness notions. In particular, we establish the existence of allocations satisfying the following combined guarantees: (i) simultaneous $1$-out-of-$\\lceil 3n/2 \\rceil$ MMS and EFX for ordered instances; (ii) simultaneous $1$-out-of-$\\lceil 3n/2 \\rceil$ MMS and EF1 for top-$n$ instances; and (iii) simultaneous $1$-out-of-$4\\lceil n/3 \\rceil$ MMS and EF1 for ordered instances."

This gap stems from the reliance on single static workflows, fundamentally limiting scalability to out-of-distribution and long-tail scenarios. Instead of requiring users to select suitable methods through extensive experimentation, we attempt to enable systems to adaptively construct workflows at inference time. Through theoretical and empirical analysis, we demonstrate that optimal dynamic policies consistently outperform the best static workflow, with performance gains fundamentally driven by heterogeneity across candidate workflows. Motivated by this, we propose SquRL, a reinforcement learning framework that enhances LLMs' reasoning capability in adaptive workflow construction. We design a rule-based reward function and introduce two effective training mechanisms: dynamic actor masking to encourage broader exploration, and pseudo rewards to improve training efficiency. Experiments on widely-used Text-to-SQL benchmarks demonstrate that dynamic workflow construction consistently outperforms the best static workflow methods, with especially pronounced gains on complex and out-of-distribution queries.

To address this, we introduce an efficient algorithm that use consensus alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) framework to alternately update the transmit waveform and radar filter. The proposed method effectively handles the non-convex fractional sensing's SINR formulation and ensures fast convergence. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves better trade-offs between communication sum rate and sensing's SINR compared to existing benchmark schemes."

We propose ZeroSyl, a simple training-free method to extract syllable boundaries and embeddings directly from a frozen WavLM model. Using L2 norms of features in WavLM's intermediate layers, ZeroSyl achieves competitive syllable segmentation performance. The resulting segments are mean-pooled, discretized using K-means, and used to train a language model. ZeroSyl outperforms prior syllabic tokenizers across lexical, syntactic, and narrative benchmarks.

This work presents a reconstruction framework that recovers physically consistent masks before exporting CNN-ready fields. It introduces two novel strategies, distance-based masking and an adaptive alpha-shape formulation that normalizes alpha using local data resolution, and evaluates them against classical alpha-shape boundary recovery. A quantitative, topology-aware metric suite is introduced to assess retention, suppression of unsupported regions, overlap consistency, and connectivity. The novel distance-based method is robust across the geometries considered under the same threshold rule, with tau set to the minimum CFD grid spacing, and achieves 500-800 times speedups over classical alpha-shapes. The adaptive alpha-shape remains stable when its control parameter is set to 1 and is 1.7-2.6 times faster than the classical variant, which requires geometry-specific alpha tuning. A lightweight boundary inflation post-process using a minimal dilation further improves retention by up to 2.96% with negligible unsupported activation (less than 0.08%). Overall, the distance-based method is recommended as the default due to its accuracy, stability, minimal tuning, and low cost, while the adaptive alpha-shape is a strong alternative when grid-spacing information for threshold selection is unavailable. A companion web application operationalizes the workflow end to end, enabling 2D ASCII dataset upload, parameter tuning, mask and boundary generation, and export of CNN-ready outputs."

Working within the Hartree-Fock approximation, we analyze the system directly in the thermodynamic limit by solving a self-consistent fixed-point equation for the one-particle density matrix. We prove that, provided that the interactions among fermions are sufficiently weak, there exists a unique one-particle density matrix that solves the self-consistency condition. By choosing the Fermi-Dirac distribution as the function in the fixed-point equation, this approach can describe both positive and zero-temperature cases. At zero temperature and when the chemical potential of the non-interacting system lies in a spectral gap of the free Landau operator, our self-consistent solution is an orthogonal projection (an \"interacting\" effective Fermi projection). We prove that its integrated density of states varies linearly with the external magnetic field, provided the interaction is weak enough: the slope of this variation is quantized and independent of the interaction. According to the Středa formula, this can be seen as yet another expression of the universality of the quantum Hall effect in weakly interacting systems, at least within the Hartree-Fock approximation."

A semantic filtering framework was proposed for category-aware transient removal using vision-language models. CLIP similarity scores between rendered views and distractor text prompts were accumulated per-Gaussian across training iterations. Gaussians exceeding a calibrated threshold underwent opacity regularization and periodic pruning. Unlike motion-based approaches, semantic classification resolved parallax ambiguity by identifying object categories independently of motion patterns. Experiments on the RobustNeRF benchmark demonstrated consistent improvement in reconstruction quality over vanilla 3DGS across four sequences, while maintaining minimal memory overhead and real-time rendering performance. Threshold calibration and comparisons with baselines validated semantic guidance as a practical strategy for transient removal in scenarios with predictable distractor categories."

    "abstract": "Mathematical morphology (MM) is a powerful and widely used framework in image processing. Through set-theoretic and discrete geometric principles, MM operations such as erosion, dilation, opening, and closing effectively manipulate digital images by modifying local structures via structuring elements (SEs), while cubical homology captures global topological features such as connected components and loop structures within images. Building on the GUDHI package for persistent homology (PH) computation on cubical complexes, we propose the MMPersistence library, which integrates MM operations with diverse SEs and PH computation to extract multiscale persistence information. By employing SEs of different shapes to construct topological filtrations, the proposed MM-based PH framework encodes both spatial and morphological characteristics of digital images, providing richer local geometric information than conventional cubical homology alone and establishing a unified foundation for analyzing digital images that integrates topological insight with morphological image processing techniques."

    "abstract": "When using the Focused Information Criterion (FIC) for assessing and ranking candidate models with respect to how well they do for a given estimation task, it is customary to produce a so-called FIC plot. This plot has the different point estimates along the y-axis and the root-FIC scores on the x-axis, these being the estimated root-mean-square scores. In this paper we address the estimation uncertainty involved in each of the points of such a FIC plot. This needs careful assessment of each of the estimators from the candidate models, taking also modelling bias into account, along with the relative precision of the associated estimated mean squared error quantities. We use confidence distributions for these endeavours. This leads to fruitful CD-FIC plots, helping the statistician to judge to what extent the seemingly best models really are better than other models, etc. These efforts also lead to two further developments. The first is a new tool for model selection, which we call the quantile FIC, which helps overcome certain difficulties associated with the usual FIC procedures, related to somewhat arbitrary schemes for handling estimated squared biases. A particular case is the median-FIC. The second development is to form model averaged estimators with fruitful weights determined by the relative sizes of the median- and quantile-FIC scores.

    "abstract": "Minutiae extraction, a fundamental stage in fingerprint recognition, is increasingly shifting toward deep learning. However, truly end-to-end methods that eliminate separate preprocessing and postprocessing steps remain scarce. This paper introduces LEADER (Lightweight End-to-end Attention-gated Dual autoencodER), a neural network that maps raw fingerprint images to minutiae descriptors, including location, direction, and type. The proposed architecture integrates non-maximum suppression and angular decoding to enable complete end-to-end inference using only 0.9M parameters. It employs a novel \"Castle-Moat-Rampart\" ground-truth encoding and a dual-autoencoder structure, interconnected through an attention-gating mechanism. Experimental evaluations demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy on plain fingerprints and robust cross-domain generalization to latent impressions. Specifically, LEADER attains a 34% higher F1-score on the NIST SD27 dataset compared to specialized latent minutiae extractors. Sample-level analysis on this challenging benchmark reveals an average rank of 2.07 among all compared methods, with LEADER securing the first-place position in 47% of the samples-more than doubling the frequency of the second-best extractor. The internal representations learned by the model align with established fingerprint domain features, such as segmentation masks, orientation fields, frequency maps, and skeletons. Inference requires 15ms on GPU and 322ms on CPU, outperforming leading commercial software in computational efficiency. The source code and pre-trained weights are publicly released to facilitate reproducibility."

For any fixed elliptic solver operating at finite precision, the parameter $δ$ can be chosen small enough to defeat the solver; no uniform numerical scheme based on the ellipticity constant alone can handle the entire family. Despite this, every member of the family is explicitly solvable -- and its initial value problem well posed -- by elementary means once a transport-theoretic invariant is identified. The cost of the transport solution is independent of $δ$. The example serves as a cautionary tale: the ellipticity constant alone does not determine the practical difficulty of a first-order PDE. Before invoking an elliptic solver, one should compute the transport obstruction $G$; its vanishing -- or smallness -- signals structure that standard elliptic methods miss entirely."

Recent studies have introduced Quantum Digital Twins (QDTs) to enhance performance through quantum computing, addressing challenges such as quantum-resistant security and efficient task offloading in healthcare environments.

    "abstract": "Integrating reasoning in large language models and large vision-language models has recently led to significant improvement of their capabilities. However, the generalization of reasoning models is still vaguely defined and poorly understood. In this work, we present an evaluation framework to rigorously examine how well chain-of-thought (CoT) approaches generalize on a simple planning task. Specifically, we consider a grid-based navigation task in which a model is provided with a map and must output a sequence of moves that guides a player from a start position to a goal while avoiding obstacles. The versatility of the task and its data allows us to fine-tune model variants using different input representations (visual and textual) and CoT reasoning strategies, and systematically evaluate them under both in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) test conditions. Our experiments show that, while CoT reasoning improves in-distribution generalization across all representations, out-of-distribution generalization (e.g., to larger maps) remains very limited in most cases when controlling for trivial matches with the ID data. Surprisingly, we find that reasoning traces which combine multiple text formats yield the best (and non-trivial) OOD generalization. Finally, purely text-based models consistently outperform those utilizing image-based inputs, including a recently proposed approach relying on latent space reasoning."

To this end, we focus on the class of $f(R,T)$ models defined by $f(R,T)=R+F(T)$, which provide a simple yet theoretically consistent realization of nonminimal matter-gravity interactions and can be reformulated as general relativity minimally coupled to a modified matter Lagrangian. Using nonstandard global monopole solutions as a toy model for realistic particles, we show that the spatial average of $F$ typically differs significantly from $F$ evaluated at the spatially averaged trace of $T$, implying that homogeneous cosmological models generally fail to capture the correct large-scale dynamics of the Universe. We further show that dust in these theories generally exhibits a non-vanishing proper pressure. Our results underscore the necessity of properly accounting for spatial averaging when modeling cosmology in theories with nonminimal matter-gravity couplings."

Ba4Ir3O10 has a quasi-2D structure composed of buckled sheets, which constitute corner-connected Ir3O12 trimers containing three distorted face-sharing IrO6 octahedra. The Ir atoms are distributed over two symmetrically inequivalent sites: the center of the trimer (Ir1) and its two tips (Ir2). The Ir1 - Ir2 distance within the trimer is quite small and equals to 2.58 A at low temperature. As a result, the clear formation of bonding and antibonding states at the Ir1 site occurs. The large bonding-antibonding splitting stabilizes the dyz-orbital-dominant antibonding state of t2g holes and produces a wide energy gap at the Fermi level. However, the energy gap opens up only with taking into account strong Coulomb correlations at the Ir2 site. Therefore, we have quite a unique situation when the insulating state is driven by both the dimerization at the Ir1 site and Mott insulating behavior at the Ir2 one. We have investigated resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) spectra at the Ir L3 edge. The calculated results are in good agreement with experimental data. The RIXS spectrum possesses several sharp features below 2.1 eV corresponding to transitions within the Ir t2g levels. The excitation located from 2.1 to 4.6 eV is due to t2g to eg and O2p to t2g transitions. The wide structure situated at 6.2-12 eV appears due to charge transfer and O2p to eg transitions. We have also presented comprehensive theoretical calculations of the RIXS spectrum at the oxygen K edge."

We show that the fixed point at the tropical origin is asymptotically stable if the maximum eigenvalue of the tropical Jacobian matrix is negative. On the other hand, it is unstable if the maximum eigenvalue of the tropical Jacobian matrix is positive. Since $0$ is the tropical multiplicative identity, these results are analogous to those in the usual linearization process."

These findings enhance the characterization of lithium as a quantum material in which the interplay between electronic and ionic degrees of freedom is nontrivial, and call for a microscopic understanding beyond simple models. Additionally, the slope of the work function curves was observed to vanish in the low temperature limit, as had been predicted on the basis of the Third Law of thermodynamics."

Based on a non-Markovian master equation, we show that the cat state can be transferred purely through the memory effect of the non-Markovian common environment, even without any direct couplings between neighbor cavities. The mechanism of the environment induced cat state transfer is analyzed both analytically and numerically to demonstrate that the transfer is a unique phenomenon in non-Markovian regime. From this example, the non-Markovian environment is shown to be qualitatively different from the Markovian environment reflected by the finite versus zero residue coherence. Besides, we also show the influence of environmental parameters are crucial for the transfer. We hope the cat state transfer studied in this work may shed more light on the fundamental difference between non-Markovian and Markovian environments."

These networks capture friendship, health advice, financial help, and adversarial relationships, allowing us to show how cooperation and conflict jointly shape social structure. Using node-level network measures derived from near-census sociocentric village networks, we leverage mixed-effects zero-inflated negative binomial models to assess the influence of individual attributes, such as gender, marital status, education, religion, and indigenous status, and of village characteristics, on the dynamics of social networks over time. We complement these node-level models with dyadic assortativity (odds-ratio-based homophily) and community-level measures to describe how sorting by key attributes differs across network types and between waves. Our results demonstrate significant assortativity based on gender and religion, particularly within health and financial networks. Across networks, gender and religion exhibit the most consistent assortative mixing. Additionally, community-level assortativity metrics indicate that educational and financial factors increasingly influence social ties over time. Our findings provide insights into how personal attributes and community dynamics interact to shape network formation and socio-economic relationships in rural settings over time."

    "abstract": "This paper introduces an input-output bilinear Koopman realization with an optimization algorithm of lifting functions. For nonlinear systems with inputs, Koopman-based modeling is effective because the Koopman operator enables a high-dimensional linear representation of nonlinear dynamics. However, traditional approaches face significant challenges in industrial applications. Measuring all system states is often impractical due to constraints on sensor installation. Moreover, the predictive performance of a Koopman model strongly depends on the choice of lifting functions, and their design typically requires substantial manual effort. In addition, although a linear time-invariant (LTI) Koopman model is the most commonly used model structure in the Koopman framework, such model exhibit limited predictive accuracy. To address these limitations, we propose an input-output bilinear Koopman modeling in which the design parameters of radial basis function (RBF)-based lifting functions are optimized using a global metaheuristic algorithm to improve long-term prediction performance. Consideration of the long-term prediction performance enhances the reliability of the resulting model. The proposed methodology is validated in simulations and experimental tests, with the airpath control system of a diesel engine as the plant to be modeled. This plant represents a challenging industrial application because it exhibits strong nonlinearities and coupled multi-input multi-output (MIMO) dynamics. These results demonstrate that the proposed input-output bilinear Koopman model significantly outperforms traditional linear Koopman models in predictive accuracy."

    "abstract": "We investigate how quasiperiodic spatial structure enables protocol-induced acceleration in open quantum systems by analyzing the Pontus-Mpemba effect in one-dimensional chains subject to Markovian dephasing. The dynamics are governed by a Lindblad superoperator that drives all initial states toward a maximally mixed infinite-temperature steady state, isolating dynamical mechanisms from static equilibrium properties. Considering two representative quasiperiodic models, namely a tight-binding chain with a mosaic potential and its extension with power-law long-range hopping, we show that a properly engineered two-step protocol, in which the system is first steered to a finite temperature intermediate state, yields a strictly shorter overall relaxation time than direct evolution from the same initial configuration. This protocol-induced acceleration persists for both initially localized and extended eigenstates and remains robust in the presence of long-range hopping. A Liouvillian spectral analysis reveals that the mechanism originates from a redistribution of spectral weight that suppresses overlap with the slowest decay modes, rather than from any modification of the decay spectrum itself. Our results establish quasiperiodic chains as a controlled setting for engineering relaxation pathways through Liouvillian spectral structure."

By drawing both the data samples and the radius from a continuous uniform distribution at each iteration, DSMS effectively performs a better exploration of the density landscape. We show that this randomized bandwidth policy acts as an implicit regularization mechanism, and provide convergence theoretical results. Comparative experiments on synthetic Gaussian mixtures reveal that DSMS significantly outperforms standard and stochastic Mean-Shift baselines, exhibiting remarkable stability and preventing over-segmentation in sparse clustering scenarios without other performance degradation."

A key finding is that continuous coupling, unlike discrete coupling at finite points, breaks the constant phase difference condition, thereby weakening the interference effects in giant atom-waveguide systems. In addition, a key technical advantage of the SSE approach is that auto- and cross-correlation functions can directly reflect the complex photon emission/absorption processes and time-delay effects in giant atom-waveguide systems. Moreover, the SSE approach also naturally handles multiple excitations, without increasing equation complexity as the number of excitations grows. This feature enables the investigation of multi-excitation initial states of the waveguide, such as thermal and squeezed initial states. Overall, our approach provides a powerful tool for studying the dynamics of giant atoms coupled to waveguide, particularly for continuous coupling and multi-excitation systems."

    "abstract": "Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) powered by Large Language Models have unlocked advanced collaborative reasoning, yet they remain shackled by the inefficiency of discrete text communication, which imposes significant runtime overhead and information quantization loss. While latent state transfer offers a high-bandwidth alternative, existing approaches either assume homogeneous sender-receiver architectures or rely on pair-specific learned translators, limiting scalability and modularity across diverse model families with disjoint manifolds. In this work, we propose the Vision Wormhole, a novel framework that repurposes the visual interface of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to enable model-agnostic, text-free communication. By introducing a Universal Visual Codec, we map heterogeneous reasoning traces into a shared continuous latent space and inject them directly into the receiver's visual pathway, effectively treating the vision encoder as a universal port for inter-agent telepathy. Our framework adopts a hub-and-spoke topology to reduce pairwise alignment complexity from O(N^2) to O(N) and leverages a label-free, teacher-student distillation objective to align the high-speed visual channel with the robust reasoning patterns of the text pathway. Extensive experiments across heterogeneous model families (e.g., Qwen-VL, Gemma) demonstrate that the Vision Wormhole reduces end-to-end wall-clock time in controlled comparisons while maintaining reasoning fidelity comparable to standard text-based MAS.

The class of systems of interest includes systems with drift which are affine in control and which cannot be stabilized by continuous state feedback. The approach is independent of the selection of a Lyapunov type function, but requires the solution of a nonlinear programming 'satisficing problem' stated in terms of the logarithmic coordinates of flows. As opposed to other approaches, point-to-point steering is not required to achieve asymptotic stability. Instead, the flow of the controlled system is required to intersect periodically a certain reachable set in the space of the logarithmic coordinates."

Most existing approaches address these issues primarily through optimization strategies, while the role of architectural priors in shaping representation learning and decision dynamics is less explored. Inspired by structural principles of the cerebellum, we propose a biologically grounded RL architecture that incorporate large expansion, sparse connectivity, sparse activation, and dendritic-level modulation. Experiments on noisy, high-dimensional RL benchmarks show that both the cerebellar architecture and dendritic modulation consistently improve sample efficiency, robustness, and generalization compared to conventional designs. Sensitivity analysis of architectural parameters suggests that cerebellum-inspired structures can offer optimized performance for RL with constrained model parameters. Overall, our work underscores the value of cerebellar structural priors as effective inductive biases for RL."

However, clinical deployment is limited by the challenges of controlling such systems under fluoroscopic imaging, which provides low frame rate and noisy pose feedback. This paper presents a control framework that remains accurate and stable under such conditions by combining a nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) framework that directly outputs coil currents, an analytically differentiable magnetic field model based on Zernike polynomials, and a Kalman filter to estimate the robot state. Experimental validation is conducted with two magnetic robots in a 3D-printed fluid workspace and a spine phantom replicating drug delivery in the epidural space. Results show the proposed control method remains highly accurate when feedback is downsampled to 3 Hz with added Gaussian noise (sigma = 2 mm), mimicking clinical fluoroscopy. In the spine phantom experiments, the proposed method successfully executed a drug delivery trajectory with a root mean square (RMS) position error of 1.18 mm while maintaining safe clearance from critical anatomical boundaries."

This API builds on previously proposed MPI extensions and leverages HPE Slingshot 11 network card capabilities. We demonstrate the utility and performance of the API by showing how the API naturally enables CPU-free gather/scatter halo exchange communication primitives in the Cabana/Kokkos performance portability framework, and through a performance comparison with Cray MPICH on the Frontier and Tuolumne supercomputers. Results from this evaluation show up to a 50% reduction in medium message latency in simple GPU ping-pong exchanges and a 28% speedup improvement when strong scaling a halo-exchange benchmark to 8,192 GPUs of the Frontier supercomputer."

The average number of photons radiated by a charged particle passing through a plate made of this metamaterial is obtained. Given the positions of the transition radiation maxima in momentum space for different velocities of a charged particle, the method for reconstruction of the dispersion law of plasmon-polaritons in metamaterials is proposed. Applying this method conversely, one can predict the radiation spectrum and polarization properties of transition radiation by means of the dispersion law of plasmon-polaritons in the metamaterial known, for example, from the effective model. It is shown that the strong spatial dispersion alters qualitatively the properties of transition radiation from a charged particle traversing normally a plate made of the helical metamaterial along its symmetry axis in the paraxial regime, viz., there is a nonzero forward radiation in contrast to transition radiation in media without strong spatial dispersion. Vavilov-Cherenkov radiation and the anomalous Doppler effect in helical metamaterials with strong spatial dispersion are described."

    "abstract": "Code smell is a great challenge in software refactoring, which indicates latent design or implementation flaws that may degrade the software maintainability and evolution. Over the past of decades, the research on code smell has received extensive attention. Especially the researches applied machine learning-technique have become a popular topic in recent studies. However, one of the biggest challenges to apply machine learning-technique is the lack of high-quality code smell datasets. Manually constructing such datasets is extremely labor-intensive, as identifying code smells requires substantial development expertise and considerable time investment. In contrast, automatically generated datasets, while scalable, frequently exhibit reduced label reliability and compromised data quality. To overcome this challenge, in this study, we explore a semi-automatic approach to generate a code smell dataset with high quality data samples. Specifically, we first applied a set of automatic generation rules to produce candidate smelly samples. We then employed multiple metrics to group the data samples into an automatically accepted group and a manually reviewed group, enabling reviewers to concentrate their efforts on ambiguous samples. Furthermore, we established structured review guidelines and developed a annotation tool to support the manual validation process. Based on the proposed semi-automatic generation approach, we created an open-source code smell dataset, SACS, covering three widely studied code smells: Long Method, Large Class, and Feature Envy. Each code smell category includes over 10,000 labeled samples. This dataset could provide a large-scale and publicly available benchmark to facilitate future studies on code smell detection and automated refactoring."

    "abstract": "Large language model (LLM) alignment relies on complex reward signals that often obscure the specific behaviors being incentivized, creating critical risks of misalignment and reward hacking. Existing interpretation methods typically rely on pre-defined rubrics, risking the omission of \"unknown unknowns\", or fail to identify objectives that comprehensively cover and are causal to the model behavior. To address these limitations, we introduce Obj-Disco, a framework that automatically decomposes an alignment reward signal into a sparse, weighted combination of human-interpretable natural language objectives. Our approach utilizes an iterative greedy algorithm to analyze behavioral changes across training checkpoints, identifying and validating candidate objectives that best explain the residual reward signal. Extensive evaluations across diverse tasks, model sizes, and alignment algorithms demonstrate the framework's robustness. Experiments with popular open-source reward models show that the framework consistently captures > 90% of reward behavior, a finding further corroborated by human evaluation. Additionally, a case study on alignment with an open-source reward model reveals that Obj-Disco can successfully identify latent misaligned incentives that emerge alongside intended behaviors. Our work provides a crucial tool for uncovering the implicit objectives in LLM alignment, paving the way for more transparent and safer AI development."

The critical theory represents a novel QED-Chern-Simons framework: a charged sector at a bosonic Laughlin-superfluid critical point is coupled, via emergent gauge fields and Chern-Simons mixing, to a neutral spinon Fermi surface. Integrating out matter fields to quadratic order yields an explicit Ioffe-Larkin composition rule for the full resistivity tensor, showing how longitudinal channels add in series while Chern-Simons terms generate Hall response. To obtain the DC limit in the quantum critical fan, we develop a controlled large-N expansion where both fermion flavors and Chern-Simons levels scale with $N$, and solve a quantum Boltzmann equation at leading nontrivial order $1/N$. Gauge-mediated inelastic scattering removes the collisionless Drude singularity and produces a universal scaling function $Σ(ω/T)$ and finite DC conductivities $σ(0) \\approx 0.033 e^2/\\hbar$ ($ν=-1/2$) and $0.047 e^2/\\hbar$ ($ν=-3/4$). We also identify a Chern-Simons \"filtering\" mechanism that suppresses transmission of Landau damping from the spinon Fermi surface to the critical gauge mode.

This paper introduces a symbolic data-driven subgrid-scale model that requires no phenomenological assumptions and has no adjustable parameters, yet it outperforms leading LES models. A combination of a priori and a posteriori benchmarks shows that the model produces accurate predictions of various quantities including local fluxes across a broad range of two-dimensional turbulent flows. While the model is inferred using LES-style spatial coarse-graining, its structure is more similar to RANS models, as it employs an additional field to describe subgrid scales. We find that this field must have a rank-two tensor structure in order to correctly represent both the components of the subgrid-scale stress tensor and the various fluxes."

Such ultra-relativistic fields would imprint a dispersive, anti-chirp signature in clock-frequency time series, delayed with respect to the LIGO-Virgo gravitational wave detection. We construct network-median pseudo-frequency data from eighteen Rb satellite clocks referenced to a terrestrial hydrogen maser and conduct a template-bank search spanning ELF pulse duration, arrival delay, and characteristic frequency. No statistically significant signal is observed after accounting for noise statistics and template-bank trials. We derive 95\\% confidence-level lower bounds on the interaction energy scale $Λ_α$ of quadratic couplings driving variations in electromagnetic fine-structure constant.

    "abstract": "Non-reference metrics (NRMs) can assess the visual quality of images and videos without a reference, making them well-suited for the evaluation of user-generated content. Nonetheless, rate-distortion optimization (RDO) in video coding is still mainly driven by full-reference metrics, such as the sum of squared errors, which treat the input as an ideal target. A way to incorporate NRMs into RDO is through linearization (LNRM), where the gradient of the NRM with respect to the input guides bit allocation. While this strategy improves the quality predicted by some metrics, we show that it can yield limited gains or degradations when evaluated with other NRMs. We argue that NRMs are highly non-linear predictors with locally unstable gradients that can compromise the quality of the linearization; furthermore, optimizing a single metric may exploit model-specific biases that do not generalize across quality estimators. Motivated by this observation, we extend the LNRM framework to optimize ensembles of NRMs and, to further improve robustness, we introduce a smoothing-based formulation that stabilizes NRM gradients prior to linearization. Our framework is well-suited to hybrid codecs, and we advocate for its use with overfitted codecs, where it avoids iterative evaluations and backpropagation of neural network-based NRMs, reducing encoder complexity relative to direct NRM optimization. We validate the proposed approach on AVC and Cool-chic, using the YouTube UGC dataset. Experiments demonstrate consistent bitrate savings across multiple NRMs with no decoder complexity overhead and, for Cool-chic, a substantial reduction in encoding runtime compared to direct NRM optimization."

Existing studies of gravitational wave production from evaporating PBHs typically assume vacuum evaporation, neglecting the fact that PBHs in the early Universe are embedded in a hot thermal plasma. In this work, we investigate gravitational wave production from primordial black holes whose evaporation is thermally influenced by their surrounding environment. We adopt a thermal evaporation framework in which interactions with the ambient plasma modify the effective decay rate of the black hole, leading to enhanced mass loss at early times and a redistribution of the evaporation history compared to the standard non-thermal vacuum case. Since graviton emission is intrinsically tied to the evaporation history of PBHs, these thermal effects play a crucial role in determining the timing and spectral properties of the resulting stochastic gravitational wave background. Our results provide a consistent framework for incorporating thermal effects into gravitational wave production from evaporating primordial black holes and set the stage for a detailed analysis of their observational signatures."

This behavior reveals a dramatic efficiency advantage of physically realistic, finite-speed searchers over Brownian ones and illustrates how diffusive macroscopic models may be conceptually misleading in predicting the short-time behavior of a physical system. We extend our analysis to anomalous diffusion generated by Riemann-Liouville-type dichotomous noises and find that target detection is more efficient in the superdiffusive regime, followed by normal and then subdiffusive regimes, in agreement with physical intuition and contrary to earlier predictions."

The construction is based on a doubling of degrees of freedom and independent of a foliation. The action naturally decomposes into a bulk term furnishing Einstein's equations and a boundary term, which is related to conserved quantities, such as the Komar mass. We find that since only trivial connecting conditions must be specified on boundaries, the variational action principle for gravity as an initial value problem is rendered well-posed without the need to add additional boundary terms. The SKG approach to gravity offers a novel and complementary avenue to solve for the metric of spacetime directly from the action, bypassing the governing equations."

    "abstract": "Inverse design problems are common in engineering and materials science. The forward direction, i.e., computing output quantities from design parameters, typically requires running a numerical simulation, such as a FEM, as an intermediate step, which is an optimization problem by itself. In many scenarios, several design parameters can lead to the same or similar output values. For such cases, multi-modal probabilistic approaches are advantageous to obtain diverse solutions. A major difficulty in inverse design stems from the structure of the design space, since discrete parameters or further constraints disallow the direct use of gradient-based optimization. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel inverse design method based on diffusion models. Our approach relaxes the original design space into a continuous grid representation, where gradients can be computed by implicit differentiation in the forward simulation. A diffusion model is trained on this relaxed parameter space in order to serve as a prior for plausible relaxed designs. Parameters are sampled by guided diffusion using gradients that are propagated from an objective function specified at inference time through the differentiable simulation. A design sample is obtained by backprojection into the original parameter space. We develop our approach for a composite material design problem where the forward process is modeled as a linear FEM problem. We evaluate the performance of our approach in finding designs that match a specified bulk modulus. We demonstrate that our method can propose diverse designs within 1% relative error margin from medium to high target bulk moduli in 2D and 3D settings. We also demonstrate that the material density of generated samples can be minimized simultaneously by using a multi-objective loss function."

Chem. Theory Comput. 2025, 21, 20, 10293], where the in-principle exact formalism of DFT is combined with that of density matrix embedding theory (DMET). In generalized LPFET (gLPFET), the embedding clusters are designed from a full-size gKS system where the (in-principle non-local) Hartree-Fock exchange potential is combined with a local (in the localized orbital representation) correlation potential. The latter is optimized self-consistently such that gKS and local embedding cluster's densities match. Unlike in DMET, which uses the same (global) chemical potential value in all clusters, each embedded orbital has its own chemical potential in gLPFET. We show analytically that, when electron correlation is strongly local, the latter potential becomes a simple functional of the correlation potential. Numerical calculations on model systems confirm the high accuracy of gLPFET in this regime, in contrast to DMET. Moreover, we show that gLPFET completely fixes the flaw of LPFET in weaker correlation regimes, through its appropriate description of the Hartree-exchange potential."

We reformulate the optimization task as a graph-partitioning problem based on the independent sets (ISs) of a scheduling graph that encodes delivery incompatibilities. Each partition corresponds to deliveries assigned to a single drone, with the objective of minimizing the total number of partitions. While the ISs represent time-feasible schedules, battery-duration constraints are enforced through a classical post-processing routine. This methodology enables the recovery of optimal delivery schedules, provided a sufficient number of samples is collected from the QPU to resolve the solution space. We benchmark the hybrid workflow through numerical emulations and demonstrate its effectiveness on Pasqal's Fresnel QPU, reporting hardware experiments with configurations of up to 100 atoms."

    "abstract": "Current bounds on the tensor-to-scalar ratio imply that the energy scale of inflation may lie below the grand-unified scale. In this paper, we show that in a broad class of single-field inflation models with sufficiently small energy scales, an extremely efficient tachyonic instability develops at the end of inflation. This instability rapidly drives the system into a nonlinear regime before coherent oscillations can be established, leading to a first-order phase-transition--like phenomenon without tunneling or barrier crossing. The resulting ultra-relativistic shock fronts surrounding the bubble interiors expand to near the Hubble scale, corresponding to the most strongly enhanced tachyonic modes, and collide with one another, producing energetic inflaton particles and gravitational waves. As a result, the post-inflationary dynamics can differ significantly from the conventional high-scale inflationary scenario. Interestingly, inflation at MeV--EeV energy scales can be probed via gravitational-wave observations, including pulsar timing arrays, ground-based detectors, and future space-based experiments. Recent limits from the LIGO--KAGRA--Virgo collaboration already constrain EeV-scale inflation, while pulsar timing array results may be interpreted as evidence for gravitational waves generated by GeV-scale inflation. We also briefly discuss further implications of the resulting tachyonic shocks."

We study spherically symmetric pulsations of nonrotating relativistic stars built from cold, charge-neutral, $β$-equilibrated pure nucleonic matter described within relativistic mean-field theory. As a baseline we adopt the UCIa parameter set [Astron. Astro-phys. 689, A242 (2024)], and we implement high-density stiffening via the $σ$-cut scheme by adding a regulator potential $U_{\\rm cut}(σ)$ [Phys. Rev. C 92, no.5, 052801 (2015), Phys. Rev. C 106, no.5, 055806 (2022)]. For representative choices $f_s=0$ (no cutoff) and $f_s=0.58$ (stiffened), we solve the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff and tidal perturbation equations to obtain equilibrium sequences, mass-radius relations, and tidal deformabilities. We then derive and solve the linear general-relativistic radial pulsation equations to compute the eigenfrequencies and eigenfunctions of the fundamental and overtone modes. The $σ$-cutoff suppresses the growth of the scalar field at supranuclear density, increases the pressure, and shifts the maximum mass, radii, and $Λ_{1.4}$ accordingly, while systematically raising the radial-mode frequencies at fixed mass. Using the sign change of $ω_0^2$ as a stability criterion, we identify stiffened models that remain radially stable up to the observed $\\sim 2M_\\odot$ mass scale and are consistent with current multimessenger constraints, demonstrating how radial spectra complement static EoS tests."

    "abstract": "Recent advances in deep reinforcement learning (RL) have achieved strong results on high-dimensional control tasks, but applying RL to reachability problems raises a fundamental mismatch: reachability seeks to maximize the set of states from which a system remains safe indefinitely, while RL optimizes expected returns over a user-specified distribution. This mismatch can result in policies that perform poorly on low-probability states that are still within the safe set. A natural alternative is to frame the problem as a robust optimization over a set of initial conditions that specify the initial state, dynamics and safe set, but whether this problem has a solution depends on the feasibility of the specified set, which is unknown a priori. We propose Feasibility-Guided Exploration (FGE), a method that simultaneously identifies a subset of feasible initial conditions under which a safe policy exists, and learns a policy to solve the reachability problem over this set of initial conditions. Empirical results demonstrate that FGE learns policies with over 50% more coverage than the best existing method for challenging initial conditions across tasks in the MuJoCo simulator and the Kinetix simulator with pixel observations."

Here, we present analyses of the spatially resolved GMCs of the lenticular galaxy NGC 1387, exploiting high spatial resolution (0.15\" or 14 pc) 12CO(2-1) line observations from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. We identify 1285 individual GMCs and measure the fundamental properties (radius, velocity dispersion, and molecular gas mass) of each with a modified version of the CPROPStoo package. Unusually for an ETG, the GMCs of NGC 1387 follow scaling relations very similar to those of the Milky Way disc and Local Group galaxy clouds, and most are virialised. GMCs with large masses and radii and/or small galactocentric distances have their angular momenta aligned with the large-scale galactic rotation, while other GMCs do not. These results show that ETGs have more diversified GMC properties than previously thought. We discuss potential reasons for such diversity, and viewing-angle dependency is a plausible candidate."

    "abstract": "Type II supernovae (SNe II) have been traditionally separated into several subgroups based on their photometric and spectroscopic properties, but whether these represent distinct progenitors or a continuous distribution remains debated. Over the past decade, growing observational evidence has suggested a possible continuity between slow- (IIP) and fast-declining (IIL) SNe. We investigate the continuity of the SNe IIP/L subclasses through a data-driven statistical analysis of spectral time series, aiming to determine whether significant correlations exist between overall spectral shapes and light-curve decline rates. We introduce a novel standardization method for SN II spectra. After empirically flattening the spectra via continuum normalization, we interpolate the resulting \"feature spectra\" onto a fixed grid of epochs using Gaussian Process regression. The interpolated spectra are then analyzed using Principal Component Analysis to explore correlations. We find that SNe IIP and IIL form a continuum spectroscopically, though some clustering remains. The spectral diversity is characterized mainly by two components: one continuous group with well-defined P-Cygni profiles and another with \"less-regular\" features likely driven by enhanced circumstellar material (CSM) interaction. Our results reveal that the spectral diversity of SNe IIP/L diminishes over time. We confirm observational correlations: steeper light-curve declines correspond to weaker spectral features, indicating that SNe IIL tend to show weaker emission and, in some cases, a lack of distinct absorption lines. These trends seemingly break down by enhanced CSM interaction that affects the P-Cygni profiles. Our data-driven method reveals underlying spectral correlations and supports a continuous distribution between IIP and IIL subtypes. This method paves the way for more refined classification algorithms."

    "abstract": "Synaptic transmission must balance the need for reliable signalling against the metabolic cost of achieving that reliability. How energetic constraints shape synaptic precision and its regulation during plasticity remains unclear. Here we develop an energy--constrained framework in which synapses minimise postsynaptic response variance subject to a fixed mean and an effective energy budget. Combinations of candidate physiological costs are used to estimate an energy cost for synaptic transmission; this cost is then inferred from quantal statistics. Analysing five published pre- and post-plasticity datasets, we find that observed synaptic mean--variance pairs cluster near a minimal-energy boundary, indicating that precision is limited by energetic availability. Model comparison identifies a dominant calcium pump-like cost paired with a smaller vesicle turnover-like cost, yielding a separable precision--energy relationship, $σ^{-2} \\propto E^5$. We further show that plasticity systematically updates synaptic energy budgets according to the scale-free magnitude of mean change, enabling accurate prediction of post-plasticity variance from energy allocation alone. These results provide direct experimental support for the hypothesis that synaptic precision is governed by energy budgets, establishing energy allocation as a fundamental principle linking metabolic constraints, synaptic reliability, and plasticity."

    "abstract": "We establish results on the dynamics of interacting charged null fluids in general relativity, specifically in the context of the bouncing continuation proposed in [Ori91]. In this model - the setting for a number of prominent case studies on black hole formation - charged massless particles may instantaneously change direction (bounce) after losing all their 4-momentum due to electrostatic repulsion. We initiate the study of timelike bounce hypersurfaces in spherical symmetry: scenarios in which an incoming beam of charged null dust changes direction along a timelike surface $\\mathcal{B}$, which is the (free) boundary of an interacting 2-dust region. We identify a novel decoupling of the equations of motion in this region. First, it is shown that every timelike curve segment $γ$ in the spherically symmetric quotient of Minkowski or Reissner-Nordström spacetimes arises as the bounce hypersurface $\\mathcal{B}$ of a charged null dust beam incident from past null infinity $\\mathcal{I}^-$. We construct a spacetime $(\\mathcal{M},g_{μν})$ describing the full trajectory of the beam, which includes gluing to Reissner-Nordström and Vaidya regions. Across $\\mathcal{B}$ the metric has regularity $g_{μν}\\in C^{2,1}$ and satisfies Einstein's equation classically, while $C^\\infty$ gluing may be achieved across all other interfaces. We also obtain examples of timelike bounce hypersurfaces terminating in a null point. Since these constructions are teleological, we secondly consider a given charged incoming beam from past null infinity. We formulate and solve a free boundary problem which represents the formation of a timelike bounce hypersurface. The result is conditional, applying only in the exterior region of a Reissner-Nordström spacetime, and subject to a technical regularity condition."

This innovative algorithm re-frames the single-step generation task into a multi-step process of \"generate-understand-regenerate\". By explicitly leveraging the model's understanding capability during generation, we successfully mitigate the optimization dilemma, achieved stronger generation results and improved understanding ability which are related to the generation process.

    "abstract": "Latent heat flux is a primary pathway for ocean-atmosphere exchange of heat and moisture, yet the influence of sea surface temperature variability at fine scales ($\\leq$ 100 km) on latent heat flux variability, particularly over the Southern Ocean, remains poorly understood. Here we quantify the scale-dependent drivers of latent heat flux (LHF) variability using a year-long, global, fully coupled ocean-atmosphere simulation with kilometer-scale resolution. Annual-mean LHF in eddy-rich regions reaches $\\approx$ 215 W m$^{-2}$, approximately three times larger than in eddy-poor regions. Spectral analyses show that ocean mesoscale [$\\mathcal{O}$(100 km)] and submesoscale [$\\mathcal{O}$(1-10 km)] variability accounts for up to $\\approx$ 80% of the total LHF variance in eddy-rich sectors, but as little as 10% in eddy-poor regions, and increases proportionally with eddy kinetic energy and sea surface temperature (SST) variance. We also find that strong submesoscale SST fronts ($\\approx$ 5 $^\\circ$C over 10 km) force a localized secondary circulation that extends well above the marine boundary layer into the mid-troposphere. Comparison with ERA5 shows that fine ocean scales, responsible for about 17% of the ocean-driven LHF variance in the simulation, are largely unresolved in the reanalysis, leading to a muted atmospheric response lacking any secondary circulation. Despite a strong heterogeneity in LHF variability, the atmospheric dynamics are mostly uniform across the domain, suggesting a non local atmospheric response to ocean forcing. These results highlight the potential for ocean meso- and submesoscales, commonly under-resolved in climate models and reanalysis, to influence Southern Ocean air-sea coupling and atmosphere both locally and remotely."

    "abstract": "Recent advances in photonic inverse design have demonstrated the ability to automatically synthesize compact, high-performance photonic components that surpass conventional, hand-designed structures, offering a promising path toward scalable and functionality-rich photonic hardware. However, the practical deployment of inverse-designed PICs is bottlenecked by manufacturability: their irregular, subwavelength geometries are highly sensitive to fabrication variations, leading to large performance degradation, low yield, and a persistent gap between simulated optimality and fabricated performance. Unlike electronics, photonics lacks a systematic, flexible mask optimization flow. Fabrication deviations in photonic components cause large optical response drift and compounding error in cascaded circuits, while calibrating fabrication models remains costly and expertise-heavy, often requiring repeated fabrication cycles that are inaccessible to most designers. To bridge this gap, we introduce PRISM, a photonics-informed inverse lithography workflow that makes photonic mask optimization data-efficient, reliable, and optics-informed. PRISM (i) synthesizes compact, informative calibration patterns to minimize required fabrication data, (ii) trains a physics-grounded differentiable fabrication model, enabling gradient-based optimization, and (iii) performs photonics-informed inverse mask optimization that prioritizes performance-critical features beyond geometry matching. Across multiple inverse-designed components with both electron-beam lithography and deep ultra-violet photolithography processes, PRISM significantly boosts post-fabrication performance and yield while reducing calibration area and turnaround time, enabling and democratizing manufacturable and high-yield inverse-designed photonic hardware at scale."

While prior work typically relies on predefined test cases to evaluate correctness, in this work, we leverage differential fuzzing to check functional equivalence in LLM-generated code refactorings. Unlike test-based evaluation, a differential fuzzing-based equivalence checker needs no predefined test cases and can explore a much larger input space by executing and comparing thousands of automatically generated test inputs. In a large-scale evaluation of six LLMs (CodeLlama, Codestral, StarChat2, Qwen-2.5, Olmo-3, and GPT-4o) across three datasets and two refactoring types, we find that LLMs show a non-trivial tendency to alter program semantics, producing 19-35% functionally non-equivalent refactorings. Our experiments further demonstrate that about 21% of these non-equivalent refactorings remain undetected by the existing test suites of the three evaluated datasets. Collectively, the findings of this study imply that reliance on existing tests might overestimate functional equivalence in LLM-generated code refactorings, which remain prone to semantic divergence."

The inorganic double perovskite Cs2AgBiBr6 has emerged as a promising candidate owing to its robust three-dimensional crystal structure and suitable visible-range bandgap. However, best power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) for Cs2AgBiBr6 solar cells reported so far - 6.37% experimentally and 27.78% in numerical studies - remain below the theoretical performance potential, largely due to suboptimal charge transport layers, and interface-related recombination losses. Here, we address this gap using a 3D finite-element method (FEM) implemented in COMSOL Multiphysics, which couples optical simulations with semiconductor drift-diffusion transport. To our knowledge, this work represents the first comprehensive 3D FEM-based study of a double halide perovskite solar cell. Screening of 25 electron transport layer (ETL)-hole transport layer (HTL) combinations identifies CeO2 and P3HT as the optimal ETL and HTL respectively. Device performance is further analyzed through systematic variation of layer thicknesses, doping concentrations and defect densities within the FTO/CeO2/Cs2AgBiBr6/P3HT/Au architecture. Under optimized parameters, the simulated device achieves a PCE of 31.76%, representing the theoretical upper bound predicted by the model. Overall, this work demonstrates 3D physics-based device engineering as a decisive pathway for overcoming efficiency bottlenecks in lead-free double perovskite photovoltaics."

Experiments with state-of-the-art MLLMs reveal substantial degradation in multi-turn settings due to error accumulation and breakdowns in shared context, with strong performance on stylistic edits but frequent execution failures on data-centric transformations.

It is based on a new analytical formulation of the unsteady fluid-estructure interaction valid for small-amplitude oscillations and deformations of the foil immersed in an inviscid fluid. The formulation extends a previous analysis by including the effects of gravity and a second flexural mode, increasing its validity range to much smaller rigidities. The analytical results are validated with available numerical results, capturing the first two natural flexural modes down to values of the stiffness parameter $S$ of order $10^{-1}$. When only passive heave, or only passive pitch, is allowed, the rigid foil is stable, existing an upper stiffness bound for the flexural instabilities, wich become coupled with the spring instability mode for small spring constant increasing the growth rate. These coupled spring (linear or torsional) and flexural instability modes occur below a threshold value of $S$ and above a threshold value of $R$, both depending on the corresponding spring constant. Coupled pitch-heave flutter instabilities of a rigid foil occur in a region below a curve of the parametric plane of the two springs constants that depends on $R$, which shrinks to zero as $R$ decreases. For a flexible foil, the flexural unstable modes become coupled with the springs unstable mode as $S$ decreases from infinity, enlarging the mass ratio range for flutter instability and increasing its growth rate, the more so the smaller the springs constants. The parametric regions for flutter instabilities are easily characterized with the present analytical tool, providing the corresponding frequency and critical flutter velocity. The present results can be useful as a guide in the design of future turbines based on flexible oscillating foils."

Here, we investigate the singular value decomposition (SVD) of the effective transition matrix and the scattering matrix of periodic metasurfaces within a parameter range where the metasurface sustains a BIC. Our analysis yields general and practically applicable conditions on the singular values and singular vectors that enable BIC formation. At the BIC eigenfrequency, the inverse of the largest singular value of both matrices vanishes, and the corresponding left (right) singular vector is orthogonal to outgoing (incoming) plane waves that propagate in the directions of open diffraction orders. Our SVD-based approach predicts the spectral position of the BIC and provides detailed information about its properties, including the expansion coefficients in the multipole and plane-wave bases, as well as its behavior under perturbations that transform the BIC into a quasi-BIC. The approach is numerically validated by considering both symmetry-protected and accidental BICs in arrays of scatterers supporting electromagnetic or acoustic multipole resonances. The presented SVD framework offers a broadly applicable foundation for engineering BICs and quasi-BICs in complex metasurfaces, potentially enabling new routes for wave-based devices with tailored radiative properties."

Most existing centrality measures face a critical limitation: they either discard directional information through symmetrization or produce sparse, implementation-dependent rankings that obscure structural importance. We introduce a unified spectral framework for centrality analysis in directed networks grounded in the Singular value decomposition of the incidence matrix. The proposed approach derives both vertex and edge centralities via the pseudoinverse of Hodge Laplacians, yielding dense and well-resolved rankings that overcome the sparsity limitations commonly observed in betweenness centrality for directed graphs. Unlike traditional measures that require graph symmetrization, our framework naturally preserves directional information, enabling principled hub/authority analysis while maintaining mathematical consistency through spectral graph theory. The method extends naturally to hypergraphs through the same mathematical foundation. Experimental validation on real-world networks demonstrates the framework's effectiveness across diverse domains where traditional centrality measures encounter limitations due to implementation dependencies and sparse outputs."

    "abstract": "Visual analogy learning enables image manipulation through demonstration rather than textual description, allowing users to specify complex transformations difficult to articulate in words. Given a triplet $\\{\\mathbf{a}$, $\\mathbf{a}'$, $\\mathbf{b}\\}$, the goal is to generate $\\mathbf{b}'$ such that $\\mathbf{a} : \\mathbf{a}' :: \\mathbf{b} : \\mathbf{b}'$. Recent methods adapt text-to-image models to this task using a single Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) module, but they face a fundamental limitation: attempting to capture the diverse space of visual transformations within a fixed adaptation module constrains generalization capabilities. Inspired by recent work showing that LoRAs in constrained domains span meaningful, interpolatable semantic spaces, we propose LoRWeB, a novel approach that specializes the model for each analogy task at inference time through dynamic composition of learned transformation primitives, informally, choosing a point in a \"space of LoRAs\". We introduce two key components: (1) a learnable basis of LoRA modules, to span the space of different visual transformations, and (2) a lightweight encoder that dynamically selects and weighs these basis LoRAs based on the input analogy pair. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance and significantly improves generalization to unseen visual transformations. Our findings suggest that LoRA basis decompositions are a promising direction for flexible visual manipulation. Code and data are in https://research.nvidia.com/labs/par/lorweb"

    "abstract": "Nonconvexities in markets with discrete decisions and nonlinear constraints make efficient pricing challenging, often necessitating subsidies. A prime example is the unit commitment (UC) problem in electricity markets, where costly subsidies are commonly required. We propose a new pricing scheme for nonconvex markets with both discreteness and nonlinearity, by convexifying nonconvex structures through a semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation and deriving prices from the relaxation's dual variables. When the choice set is bounded, we establish strong duality for the SDP, which allows us to extend the envelope theorem to the value function of the relaxation. This extension yields a marginal price signal for demand, which we use as our pricing mechanism. We demonstrate that under certain conditions-for instance, when the relaxation's right hand sides are linear in demand-the resulting lost opportunity cost is bounded by the relaxation's optimality gap. This result highlights the importance of achieving tight relaxations. The proposed framework applies to nonconvex electricity market problems, including for both direct current and alternating current UC. Our numerical experiments indicate that the SDP relaxations are often tight, reinforcing the effectiveness of the proposed pricing scheme. Across a suite of IEEE benchmark instances, the lost opportunity cost under our pricing scheme is, on average, 46% lower than that of the commonly used fixed-binary pricing scheme."

    "abstract": "Across the natural and life sciences, images have become a primary measurement modality, yet the dominant analytic paradigm remains semantics-first. Structure is recovered by predicting or enforcing domain-specific labels. This paradigm fails systematically under the conditions that make image-based science most valuable, including open-ended scientific discovery, cross-sensor and cross-site comparability, and long-term monitoring in which domain ontologies and associated label sets drift culturally, institutionally, and ecologically. A deductive inversion is proposed in the form of criteria-first and semantics-later. A unified framework for criteria-first structure discovery is introduced. It separates criterion-defined, semantics-free structure extraction from downstream semantic mapping into domain ontologies or vocabularies and provides a domain-general scaffold for reproducible analysis across image-based sciences. Reproducible science requires that the first analytic layer perform criterion-driven, semantics-free structure discovery, yielding stable partitions, structural fields, or hierarchies defined by explicit optimality criteria rather than local domain ontologies. Semantics is not discarded; it is relocated downstream as an explicit mapping from the discovered structural product to a domain ontology or vocabulary, enabling plural interpretations and explicit crosswalks without rewriting upstream extraction. Grounded in cybernetics, observation-as-distinction, and information theory's separation of information from meaning, the argument is supported by cross-domain evidence showing that criteria-first components recur whenever labels do not scale. Finally, consequences are outlined for validation beyond class accuracy and for treating structural products as FAIR, AI-ready digital objects for long-term monitoring and digital twins."

In the chemical regime, the framework predicts ground-state energies of molecular Hamiltonians derived from PySCF, achieving near FCI accuracy while maintaining favorable O(N^2) scaling with molecular size. In the physical counterpart, we applied the same model to quantized Simple Harmonic Motion systems (SHM), successfully reproducing its ground and excited states through VQE and Variational Quantum Deflation (VQD) methods. Benchmark results on NVIDIA GPUs reveal significant speedups over CPU-based implementations, validating CUDAQ's capability to handle large-scale variational workloads efficiently. Overall, this study establishes VQE-LSTM as a viable and scalable approach for GPU accelerated quantum simulation, bridging quantum chemistry and condensed-matter physics through a unified, meta-learned initialization strategy."

Income distributions in this case can be represented as points on the two-dimensional income-share simplex. In this representation, classical decomposability translates into concrete geometric restrictions of within- and between-group components. The geometric framework makes it possible to localize and compare violations of decomposability across inequality measures. The analysis is applied to the Mean Log Deviation, the Gini coefficient, the coefficient of variation, and the Theil index."

MOCAdb provides a census of memberships for 10259 associations and open clusters within 500 pc of the Sun, with a comprehensive compilation of literature measurements such as spectral types, kinematics, rotation periods, activity indices, spectral indices, and photometry. All known substellar objects are cataloged in MOCAdb, along with 2943 public spectra, to enable the characterization of substellar association members. MOCAdb also features periodically updated calculations such as Galactic UVW space velocities. We use this compilation to construct mappings between independent association definitions, and to update the BANYAN $Σ$ membership classification tool, which now includes 8125 associations. The BANYAN $Σ$ model construction is improved to account for heterogeneous and correlated errors and to capture complex association shapes using Gaussian mixture models. Combined with Gaia DR3, this enabled us to identify 11535 yet unrecognized candidate members of young associations within 500 pc, mostly M dwarfs. Our results corroborate a recent observation that systematics up to $\\approx$4 km/s remain in Gaia DR3 radial velocities for A-type stars. We present an updated census of age-calibrated exoplanets and substellar objects: 134 age-calibrated exoplanet systems (plus 121 TESS exoplanet candidates), 99 of which did not appear to have known memberships so far, and 455 substellar (L0 or later) candidate members of young associations, 196 of which appear newly recognized. We bring the total of candidate isolated planetary-mass objects to 101, 53 of which are newly recognized candidate members."

We model the cross-correlation of the ISWRS effect with gravitational potential tracers like galaxy clustering, cosmic shear, and CMB-lensing potential, to forecast results from these experiments. Our analysis also accounts for the presence of massive neutrinos to assess the feasibility of identifying the $ν$$Λ$CDM model and constraining the neutrino mass sum, M$ν$. Our findings indicate that the CMB-lensing potential reconstructed by CMB-HD is expected to provide the most promising results, achieving $\\gtrsim$ 5$σ$ detections even under conservative assumptions for detector noise and foregrounds, thereby allowing differentiation between $ν$$Λ$CDM models. Galaxy clustering can also yield significant detections, whereas cosmic shear can provide valuable results only if non-linearities are accurately modelled, beyond the capabilities of currently available analytical approaches. These latter LSS probes do not provide strong constraining power on M$ν$. While our findings suggest that future CMB experiments and LSS surveys will enable the detection of the ISWRS effect, they do not imply significant prospects for imposing new constraints on neutrino masses in the near future."

ECG language models (ELMs) have recently emerged as a promising framework for ECG classification accompanied by report generation. However, current models cannot forecast future cardiac events despite the immense clinical value for planning earlier intervention. To address this gap, we propose CAMEL, the first ELM that is capable of inference over longer signal durations which enables its forecasting capability. Our key insight is a specialized ECG encoder which enables cross-understanding of ECG signals with text. We train CAMEL using established LLM training procedures, combining LoRA adaptation with a curriculum learning pipeline. Our curriculum includes ECG classification, metrics calculations, and multi-turn conversations to elicit reasoning. CAMEL demonstrates strong zero-shot performance across 6 tasks and 9 datasets, including ECGForecastBench, a new benchmark that we introduce for forecasting arrhythmias. CAMEL is on par with or surpasses ELMs and fully supervised baselines both in- and out-of-distribution, achieving SOTA results on ECGBench (+7.0% absolute average gain) as well as ECGForecastBench (+12.4% over fully supervised models and +21.1% over zero-shot ELMs)."

We study neural forecasters through the lens of representational alignment, introducing anchor-based, geometry-agnostic relative embeddings that remove rotational and scaling ambiguities in latent spaces. Applying this framework across seven canonical dynamical systems - ranging from periodic to chaotic - we reveal reproducible family-level structure: multilayer perceptrons align with other MLPs, recurrent networks with RNNs, while transformers and echo-state networks achieve strong forecasts despite weaker alignment. Alignment generally correlates with forecasting accuracy, yet high accuracy can coexist with low alignment. Relative geometry thus provides a simple, reproducible foundation for comparing how model families internalize and represent dynamical structure."

We introduce PERSONA, a training-free framework that achieves fine-tuning level performance through direct manipulation of personality vectors in activation space. Our key insight is that personality traits appear as extractable, approximately orthogonal directions in the model's representation space that support algebraic operations. The framework operates through three stages: Persona-Base extracts orthogonal trait vectors via contrastive activation analysis; Persona-Algebra enables precise control through vector arithmetic (scalar multiplication for intensity, addition for composition, subtraction for suppression); and Persona-Flow achieves context-aware adaptation by dynamically composing these vectors during inference. On PersonalityBench, our approach achieves a mean score of 9.60, nearly matching the supervised fine-tuning upper bound of 9.61 without any gradient updates. On our proposed Persona-Evolve benchmark for dynamic personality adaptation, we achieve up to 91% win rates across diverse model families. These results provide evidence that aspects of LLM personality are mathematically tractable, opening new directions for interpretable and efficient behavioral control."

Although many methods exist, selecting suitable models and tuning parameters remains a major bottleneck in practice. Hence, we introduce the 3D data Analysis Optimization Pipeline, a method designed to facilitate the design and parameterization of segmentation and classification using two Bayesian Optimization stages. First, the pipeline selects a segmentation model and optimizes postprocessing parameters using a domain-adapted syntactic benchmark dataset. To ensure a concise evaluation of segmentation performance, we introduce a segmentation quality metric that serves as the objective function. Second, the pipeline optimizes design choices of a classifier, such as encoder and classifier head architectures, incorporation of prior knowledge, and pretraining strategies. To reduce manual annotation effort, this stage includes an assisted class-annotation workflow that extracts predicted instances from the segmentation results and sequentially presents them to the operator, eliminating the need for manual tracking. In four case studies, the 3D data Analysis Optimization Pipeline efficiently identifies effective model and parameter configurations for individual datasets."

This design improves performance on long-horizon tasks but creates a security risk: untrusted external content observed during a benign session can be stored as memory and later treated as instruction. We study this risk and formalize a persistent attack we call a Zombie Agent, where an attacker covertly implants a payload that survives across sessions, effectively turning the agent into a puppet of the attacker. We present a black-box attack framework that uses only indirect exposure through attacker-controlled web content. The attack has two phases. During infection, the agent reads a poisoned source while completing a benign task and writes the payload into long-term memory through its normal update process. During trigger, the payload is retrieved or carried forward and causes unauthorized tool behavior. We design mechanism-specific persistence strategies for common memory implementations, including sliding-window and retrieval-augmented memory, to resist truncation and relevance filtering. We evaluate the attack on representative agent setups and tasks, measuring both persistence over time and the ability to induce unauthorized actions while preserving benign task quality. Our results show that memory evolution can convert one-time indirect injection into persistent compromise, which suggests that defenses focused only on per-session prompt filtering are not sufficient for self-evolving agents."

However, existing evaluation methods primarily assess outcome based performance, such as safety and trajectory accuracy, without determining whether model decisions reflect human relevant considerations. As a result, it remains unclear whether explanations produced by such models correspond to genuine reason responsive decision making or merely post hoc rationalizations. This limitation is especially significant in safety critical domains because it can create false confidence. To address this gap, we propose CARE Drive, Context Aware Reasons Evaluation for Driving, a model agnostic framework for evaluating reason responsiveness in vision language models applied to automated driving. CARE Drive compares baseline and reason augmented model decisions under controlled contextual variation to assess whether human reasons causally influence decision behavior. The framework employs a two stage evaluation process. Prompt calibration ensures stable outputs. Systematic contextual perturbation then measures decision sensitivity to human reasons such as safety margins, social pressure, and efficiency constraints. We demonstrate CARE Drive in a cyclist overtaking scenario involving competing normative considerations. Results show that explicit human reasons significantly influence model decisions, improving alignment with expert recommended behavior. However, responsiveness varies across contextual factors, indicating uneven sensitivity to different types of reasons. These findings provide empirical evidence that reason responsiveness in foundation models can be systematically evaluated without modifying model parameters."

Experiments on standard RCPSP and RCPSP/max test suites show that these inferred constraints improve search performance and tighten objective bounds on favorable instances, while incurring little degradation on unfavorable ones. Additionally, these experiments discover 25 new lower bounds and five new best solutions; eight of the lower bounds are obtained directly from the inferred constraints."

In this paper, we investigate passive correlation-based imaging in the daylight configuration, where uncontrolled noise sources illuminate the medium and only ambient fields are recorded by a sensor array. We first analyze daylight migration for a point reflector embedded in a homogeneous background. By introducing a searching wave speed into the migration functional, we derive an explicit characterization of the deterministic shift and defocusing effects induced by wave-speed mismatch. We show that the maximum of the envelope of the resulting functional provides a reliable estimator of the true wave speed. We then extend the analysis to a random medium with correlation length smaller than the wavelength. Leveraging the shift formula obtained in the homogeneous case, we introduce a virtual guide star that remains fixed under migration with different searching speeds. This property enables an effective wave-speed estimation strategy based on spatial averaging around the virtual guide star. For both homogeneous and random media, we establish resolution analyses for the proposed wave-speed estimators. Numerical experiments are conducted to validate the theoretical result."

    "abstract": "Models based on partial differential equations (PDEs) are powerful for describing a wide range of complex relationships in the natural sciences. Accurately identifying the PDE model, which represents the underlying physical law, is essential for a proper understanding of the problem. This reconstruction typically relies on indirect and noisy measurements of the system's state and, without specifically tailored methods, rarely yields symbolic expressions, thereby hindering interpretability. In this work, we address this issue by considering existing neural network architectures based on rational functions for the symbolic representation of physical laws. These networks leverage the approximation power of rational functions while also benefiting from their flexibility in representing arithmetic operations. Our main contribution is an identifiability result, showing that, in the limit of noiseless, complete measurements, such symbolic networks can uniquely reconstruct the simplest physical law within the PDE model. Specifically, reconstructed laws remain expressible within the symbolic network architecture, with regularization-minimizing parameterizations promoting interpretability and sparsity in case of $L^1$-regularization. In addition, we provide regularity results for symbolic networks. Empirical validation using the ParFam architecture supports these theoretical findings, providing evidence for the practical reconstructibility of physical laws."

    "abstract": "Certified machine unlearning can be achieved via noise injection leading to differential privacy guarantees, where noise is calibrated to worst-case sensitivity. Such conservative calibration often results in performance degradation, limiting practical applicability. In this work, we investigate an alternative approach based on adaptive per-instance noise calibration tailored to the individual contribution of each data point to the learned solution. This raises the following challenge: how can one establish formal unlearning guarantees when the mechanism depends on the specific point to be removed? To define individual data point sensitivities in noisy gradient dynamics, we consider the use of per-instance differential privacy. For ridge regression trained via Langevin dynamics, we derive high-probability per-instance sensitivity bounds, yielding certified unlearning with substantially less noise injection. We corroborate our theoretical findings through experiments in linear settings and provide further empirical evidence on the relevance of the approach in deep learning settings."

    "abstract": "We investigate the problem of mechanical stability in two-dimensional Bose-Fermi mixtures at zero temperature, focusing on systems with a tunable Bose-Fermi (BF) interaction and a weak but finite boson-boson (BB) repulsion. The analysis is carried out within the framework of the lowest-order constrained variational (LOCV) approach, which allows for a non-perturbative treatment of strong interspecies correlations while retaining analytical transparency. The BF interaction is modeled by a properly regularized attractive contact potential, enabling the exploration of both the attractive and repulsive energy branches. We determine the minimal BB repulsion required to ensure mechanical stability of the mixture by evaluating the inverse compressibility matrix over the full range of BF coupling strengths, within the domain of validity of the LOCV approximation. The interaction contribution to the energy is benchmarked against available experimental data and Quantum Monte Carlo results in the single-impurity limit, showing good agreement. Our analysis reveals how the critical BB coupling depends on interaction strength, density imbalance, and mass ratio. In particular, we find that mixtures with equal boson and fermion masses exhibit enhanced stability, requiring the smallest BB repulsion to prevent mechanical instability. In this case, a relatively small BB interaction is sufficient to stabilize attractive mixtures for all values of the BF interaction. These results provide a theoretical framework for assessing stability conditions in experimentally realizable two-dimensional Bose-Fermi mixtures with tunable interactions."

    "abstract": "A mixed integer maximization problem involving several additional constraints defined with both a lower and an upper bound is considered. It is assumed that one of such constraints is more restrictive than the others. As it can be seen as a resource window constraint, it defines the so-called window-constrained problem. From a bi-objective perspective, a 2-phase algorithm, called BORWin, is devised. It stands for Bi-Objective Relaxation for Window-constrained problems. The first phase is generic for any window-constrained problem and provides a family of upper bounds based on a bi-objective relaxation of the additional constraints. It is shown that the latter bounds strongly relate to the Lagrangian dual bounds. The second phase is derived for a variant involving a graph structure, namely the window-constrained longest-path problem on an acyclic graph. The aim is to take advantage of the upper bounds to devise an efficient label extension algorithm. It is shown that complementary upper bounds could be derived to further improve performance in some special cases. A typical example is when the additional constraints have special knapsack structures. This is the case for the Hydro-Unit Commitment problem with a single plant (1-HUC). From numerical experiments for the 1-HUC, BOR-Win appears to be very efficient compared to state-of-the-art approaches."

Remarkably, RNNs differ from DNNs only by weight sharing, as can be shown through unrolling in time. How does this structural similarity fit with the distinct functional properties these networks exhibit? To address this question, we here develop a unified mean-field theory for RNNs and DNNs in terms of representational kernels, describing fully trained networks in the feature learning ($μ$P) regime. This theory casts training as Bayesian inference over sequences and patterns, directly revealing the functional implications induced by the RNNs' weight sharing. In DNN-typical tasks, we identify a phase transition when the learning signal overcomes the noise due to randomness in the weights: below this threshold, RNNs and DNNs behave identically; above it, only RNNs develop correlated representations across timesteps. For sequential tasks, the RNNs' weight sharing furthermore induces an inductive bias that aids generalization by interpolating unsupervised time steps. Overall, our theory offers a way to connect architectural structure to functional biases."

    "abstract": "When a multimodal Transformer answers a visual question, is the prediction driven by visual evidence, linguistic reasoning, or genuinely fused cross-modal computation -- and how does this structure evolve across layers? We address this question with a layer-wise framework based on Partial Information Decomposition (PID) that decomposes the predictive information at each Transformer layer into redundant, vision-unique, language-unique, and synergistic components. To make PID tractable for high-dimensional neural representations, we introduce \\emph{PID Flow}, a pipeline combining dimensionality reduction, normalizing-flow Gaussianization, and closed-form Gaussian PID estimation. Applying this framework to LLaVA-1.5-7B and LLaVA-1.6-7B across six GQA reasoning tasks, we uncover a consistent \\emph{modal transduction} pattern: visual-unique information peaks early and decays with depth, language-unique information surges in late layers to account for roughly 82\\% of the final prediction, and cross-modal synergy remains below 2\\%. This trajectory is highly stable across model variants (layer-wise correlations $>$0.96) yet strongly task-dependent, with semantic redundancy governing the detailed information fingerprint. To establish causality, we perform targeted Image$\\rightarrow$Question attention knockouts and show that disrupting the primary transduction pathway induces predictable increases in trapped visual-unique information, compensatory synergy, and total information cost -- effects that are strongest in vision-dependent tasks and weakest in high-redundancy tasks. Together, these results provide an information-theoretic, causal account of how vision becomes language in multimodal Transformers, and offer quantitative guidance for identifying architectural bottlenecks where modality-specific information is lost."

    "abstract": "Robot motion distributions often exhibit multi-modality and require flexible generative models for accurate representation. Streaming Flow Policies (SFPs) have recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for generating robot trajectories by integrating learned velocity fields directly in action space, enabling smooth and reactive control. However, existing formulations lack mechanisms for adapting trajectories post-training to enforce safety and task-specific constraints. We propose Constraint-Aware Streaming Flow (CASF), a framework that augments streaming flow policies with constraint-dependent metrics that reshape the learned velocity field during execution. CASF models each constraint, defined in either the robot's workspace or configuration space, as a differentiable distance function that is converted into a local metric and pulled back into the robot's control space. Far from restricted regions, the resulting metric reduces to the identity; near constraint boundaries, it smoothly attenuates or redirects motion, effectively deforming the underlying flow to maintain safety. This allows trajectories to be adapted in real time, ensuring that robot actions respect joint limits, avoid collisions, and remain within feasible workspaces, while preserving the multi-modal and reactive properties of streaming flow policies. We demonstrate CASF in simulated and real-world manipulation tasks, showing that it produces constraint-satisfying trajectories that remain smooth, feasible, and dynamically consistent, outperforming standard post-hoc projection baselines."

In this work, we address these shortcomings with an empirical study of QAT in the low-bit regime. We show that k-means based weight quantization outperforms integer formats and can be implemented efficiently on standard hardware. Furthermore, we find that, under a fixed inference memory budget, the best performance on generative downstream tasks is achieved with $1$-bit quantized weights."

However, many dynamic processes in the solar atmosphere involve strong horizontal motions (in the plane perpendicular to the line-of-sight: vx, vy). Existing methods for estimating horizontal velocities are generally insensitive to variations in height (the z-coordinate), providing them only on a single plane perpendicular to the line-of-sight: vx(x,y), vy(x,y). Motivated by the fact that modern analysis techniques allow us to retrieve the height dependence of vz and B, our goal is to infer also this height dependence for the horizontal velocity field in the solar atmosphere. As a first step, we present, and test a method for the two-dimensional case on the (y,z) plane so as to show that the z dependence can be successfully retrieved. The components of the two-dimensional magnetic induction equation are discretized via finite differences, leading to an overdetermined system whose solution provides vy. The method assumes that B, its time variation, as well as vz are known. This is currently possible through modern Stokes inversion techniques applied to spatially and temporally resolved spectropolarimetric observations. Using analytically prescribed values and two-dimensional magneto-hydrodynamic simulations of the solar surface, we demonstrate that, in these idealized cases, the horizontal velocity component in a two-dimensional domain, can be successfully recovered with a mean error of about 1 %. The proposed method successfully retrieves the horizontal velocity field in the (y,z) plane, thereby establishing the foundation for future extensions to three-dimensional reconstructions of the horizontal velocity field."

From these simulations we derive spin-dependent subgrid prescriptions from first principles, applicable to hot accretion flows with low-Eddington ratios ($f_{\\rm Edd}\\lesssim10^{-3}$), for adoption in cosmological simulations and semi-analytic models. We provide compact analytic fits for the time-averaged accretion rate $\\dot M(R_B,a_\\ast)$ and feedback power $\\dot E_{\\rm fb}(R_B,a_\\ast)$ with respect to the Bondi rate $\\dot{M}_B$, which are largely insensitive to the initial gas configuration and magnetic field strength. To capture intrinsic time-variability, we also quantify the full distributions of $\\dot M$ and feedback efficiency $η$, both well described by lognormal statistics, with widths that increase toward larger $R_B$. We further measure self-consistent spin evolution in the hot accretion mode, finding that the spin-up parameter varies as $s(a_\\ast)\\simeq -3.7\\,a_\\ast$, which implies a very long spindown timescale $t_s\\simeq 12(10^{-3}/f_{\\rm Edd})\\,{\\rm Gyr}$.

The quasar (QSO) number densities are a powerful probe for understanding the effects of intervening material. Absorption lines in QSO spectra reveal the presence of interstellar and intergalactic gas, which can change observed fluxes through dust extinction and plasma lensing. By combining observations from radio (VLASS), infrared (WISE), and optical bands (DESI), we assembled a sample of QSOs: ~4000 sources with MgII absorbers, and ~12, 000 non-absorbers. In the radio band, the MgII sample shows a moderate excess at the bright end of the flux distribution, which is broadly consistent with plasma lensing predications. In the optical, the MgII sample turns over at higher g-band fluxes and exhibits a steeper decline at the faint end than the non-MgII sample. Control samples were constructed by matching in redshift, infrared (W1), and optical (g) luminosities. In these comparisons, the radio excess becomes less prominent, suggesting that the apparent magnification may not be robust evidence for plasma lensing. Nevertheless, a weak contribution cannot be ruled out, especially given residual excess observed at the bright end relative to the non-MgII sample. Dust extinction along the line-of-sight remains a plausible alternative. Regardless of the dominant mechanism, the multi-wavelength differences offer a valuable probe of the physical state of the intervening medium."

We first study the motion of neutral test particles and derive the fundamental orbital and epicyclic frequencies, which are then employed to analyze different quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) models. Using observational QPO data from stellar-mass, intermediate-mass, and supermassive black hole candidates, we perform a Bayesian parameter estimation through a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis and obtain constraints on the black hole parameters. The results show that the presence of the quantum correction significantly affects the location of the QPO radii and the separation between the QPO orbit and the ISCO. We then examine the scalar perturbations by deriving the Schrödinger-like radial equation and the corresponding effective potential. The influence of the parameters $Q$ and $ζ$ on the perturbation potential and stability of the spacetime is discussed. Furthermore, we compute the greybody factor and the energy emission rate in the high-frequency (geometric-optics) regime, showing how the quantum correction modifies the absorption probability and radiation spectrum. Finally, we study the effect of thermal fluctuations on the black hole entropy and obtain the logarithmic corrections to the Bekenstein-Hawking area law. We show that these corrections become important for small black holes, while for large horizon radius the standard thermodynamic behavior is recovered. Our analysis demonstrates that the quantum correction parameter leaves observable imprints on both dynamical and thermodynamical properties of the spacetime and can be constrained through QPO observations."

Inspired by the principles of human active perception, we propose a dynamic information fusion framework designed to maximize the efficiency and robustness of VLA models. Our approach introduces a lightweight adaptive routing architecture that analyzes the current text prompt and observations from a wrist-mounted camera in real-time to predict the task-relevance of multiple camera views. By conditionally attenuating computations for views with low informational utility and selectively providing only essential visual features to the policy network, Our framework achieves computation efficiency proportional to task relevance. Furthermore, to efficiently secure large-scale annotation data for router training, we established an automated labeling pipeline utilizing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to minimize data collection and annotation costs. Experimental results in real-world robotic manipulation scenarios demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves significant improvements in both inference efficiency and control performance compared to existing VLA models, validating the effectiveness and practicality of dynamic information fusion in resource-constrained, real-time robot control environments."

In this study, we investigate how deviations from the standard nearly-scale-free primordial power spectrum impact observables for the fully compact, orientable Euclidean topologies ($E_1$--$E_6$). We examine how such deviations modify the detectability of the underlying topology, depending on whether they are an intrinsic consequence of non-trivial topology or independent of it. We compute CMB temperature correlation matrices across a range of topologies, fundamental domain sizes, and observer locations for both standard and modified primordial power spectra. The impact of these modifications on the detectability of topology is quantified using the Kullback-Leibler divergence, providing an estimate of the distinguishability of non-trivial and simply-connected topologies based solely on CMB temperature observations. In addition, we employ the CatBoost machine learning algorithm to classify harmonic-space realizations of CMB temperature maps and thereby assess the observational prospects for topology detection. Signatures of non-trivial topology are encoded in the off-diagonal structure of the CMB temperature correlation matrices and are most prominent on the largest angular scales. Deviations from the simple power-law primordial spectrum at these scales can substantially alter the detectability of topology, either enhancing its characteristic CMB imprints or suppressing them below observational sensitivity. Our results demonstrate that uncertainties in the primordial power spectrum must be carefully accounted for in robust searches for cosmic topology using the CMB."

By providing these environmental signals, Eco-Amazon enables the community to develop, benchmark, and evaluate the next generation of sustainable retrieval and recommendation models.

    "abstract": "Patients' expectations towards their treatment have a substantial effect on the treatments' success. While primarily studied in clinical settings, online patient platforms like medical subreddits may hold complementary insights: treatment expectations that patients feel unnecessary or uncomfortable to share elsewhere. Despite this, no studies examine what type of expectations users discuss online and how they express them. Presumably this is because expectations have not been studied in natural language processing (NLP) before. Therefore, we introduce the task of Expectation Detection, arguing that expectations are relevant for many applications, including opinion mining and product design. Subsequently, we present a case study for the medical domain, where expectations are particularly crucial to extract. We contribute RedHOTExpect, a corpus of Reddit posts (4.5K posts) to study expectations in this context. We use a large language model (LLM) to silver-label the data and validate its quality manually (label accuracy ~78%). Based on this, we analyze which linguistic patterns characterize expectations and explore what patients expect and why. We find that optimism and proactive framing are more pronounced in posts about physical or treatment-related illnesses compared to mental-health contexts, and that in our dataset, patients mostly discuss benefits rather than negative outcomes.

However, high-resolution transmission spectroscopy is currently limited by our capability of removing planet-occulted line-distortion (POLD) contamination from the signal. Aims. In this paper, we aim to characterize the transmission spectrum of WASP-31 b from two and a half transits observed with the ESPRESSO spectrograph at the VLT. Methods. The Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) signature was analyzed using the RM \"revolutions\" method. Before extracting the transmission spectrum of the planet, we corrected the dataset for telluric lines using molecfit and further modeled the POLD deformations using EvE. Results. We confirm the planet low sky-projected spin-orbit angle from previous studies and further refine its value to $λ= -0.09^{+0.31}_{-0.32}$ deg. We do not detect any species (including previously detected species such as K or CrH) in the planetary atmosphere. In most cases the non-detections are due to the strong POLDs contamination or lack of observable lines in the ESPRESSO wavelength range, and so previous detections cannot be ruled out. Conclusions. Planet-occulted line-distortion contamination continues to be the main limitation of high-resolution transmission spectroscopy for species present in both the star and the planet, hindering atmospheric detections even with state-of-the-art models, in particular for planets with a low sky-projected spin-orbit angle. Developing advanced techniques to isolate planetary signatures is of utmost importance in the advent of ELT-like observations."

    "abstract": "It has been shown that a neural network's Lipschitz constant can be leveraged to derive robustness guarantees, to improve generalizability via regularization or even to construct invertible networks. Therefore, a number of methods varying in the tightness of their bounds and their computational cost have been developed to approximate the Lipschitz constant for different classes of networks. However, comparatively little research exists on methods for exact computation, which has been shown to be NP-hard. Nonetheless, there are applications where one might readily accept the computational cost of an exact method. These applications could include the benchmarking of new methods or the computation of robustness guarantees for small models on sensitive data. Unfortunately, existing exact algorithms restrict themselves to only ReLU-activated networks, which are known to come with severe downsides in the context of Lipschitz-constrained networks. We therefore propose a generalization of the LipBaB algorithm to compute exact Lipschitz constants for arbitrary piecewise linear neural networks and $p$-norms. With our method, networks may contain traditional activations like ReLU or LeakyReLU, activations like GroupSort or the related MinMax and FullSort, which have been of increasing interest in the context of Lipschitz constrained networks, or even other piecewise linear functions like MaxPool."

The heavy-tailed resets generate magnetisation distributions that differ significantly from both equilibrium dynamics and the previously studied Ising model with exponentially distributed reset times. In two dimensions, for $T > T_C$, we find a quasi-ferro state for all $α$, marked by a double-peaked distribution that diverges at $m=0$ and $m=m_0$; no steady state exists for $α< 1$, while a stationary state emerges for $α> 1$. For $T < T_C$, power law resetting produces two distinct regimes separated by a crossover exponent $α^* = 1-c$: a single-peak ferromagnetic phase localised at $m_{eq}$ for $α< α^*$, and a dual-peak ferromagnetic phase with divergences at $m_{eq}$ and $m_0$ for $α> α^*$. Analytic results in one and two dimensions, supported by simulations, yield a rich phase diagram in the $(T,α)$ plane and reveal how heavy-tailed resetting generates nonequilibrium phases very different from those seen in the case of exponential resetting."

Purpose: We aim at constructing a semi-microscopic reaction model that describes neutron elastic scattering off $^6$Li up to 50 MeV taking the breakup channels of $^6$Li into account. Methods: We adopt the continuum-discretized coupled-channels method (CDCC) with an $α+p+n$ three-body model of $^6$Li. We employ the $g$-matrix effective interaction by Jeukenne, Lejeune, and Mahaux (JLM). The renormalization factors of the real and imaginary parts of the JLM interaction are treated as free parameters. Results: The renormalization parameter of the real part of the JLM interaction is found to be constant ($=1.1$), whereas that for the imaginary part has a smooth energy dependence. The four-body CDCC calculation with these parameters well describes the angular distributions of both proton and neutron elastic scatterings as well as the neutron total cross section and proton total reaction cross section. The applicable energy range is found to be from 7 MeV to 50 MeV. Conclusions: We have constructed a reliable reaction model for describing nucleon-$^6$Li scattering between 7 MeV and 50 MeV. This model can directly be applied to inelastic scattering and break reactions for $^6$Li with the help of the complex scaling method."

    "abstract": "For a static and spherically symmetric spacetime, we investigate the class of exact solutions that arise when two fundamental geometric constraints are imposed simultaneously: the Karmarkar's condition and the vanishing of the Weyl tensor. These conditions restrict the curvature in such a way that the spacetime becomes conformally flat and belongs to the family of embedding class-I solutions. Even though the subsequent solutions namely, the Schwarzschild interior solution and the de Sitter solution are well known, the novelty of our presentation is that these solutions are shown to be a direct consequence of the imposed geometric constraints. The physical matter composition becomes highly constrained by the associated geometry under such conditions. The Schwarzschild interior solution describes the spacetime of an incompressible fluid sphere while the de Sitter solution corresponds to a vacuum energy dominated configuration. Interestingly, pressure anisotropy as well as `complexity factor' vanish identically once the Karmarkar's condition and the conformal flatness conditions are applied simultaneously. As these two geometric constraints alone are sufficient to determine the background spacetime uniquely, Karmarkar's condition might not be a suitable method for the development of realistic stellar models in a conformally flat spacetime unless one invokes other factors into consideration such as time-dependent metric potentials."

Recently, it was discovered that the fastest-known algorithm for solving the reachability problem for VASS has the same complexity in terms of $g$ as in terms of $d$. This suggests that the geometric dimension may in fact be a more adequate parameter for measuring the complexity of VASS reachability problems. We initiate a more systematic study of the geometric dimension. We discuss differences between two parameters: the geometric dimension and the SCC dimension. Our main technical result states that classical results about the coverability and boundedness problems can be improved from dimension $d$ to geometric dimension $g$. Namely, coverability is witnessed by runs of length $n^{2^{\\mathcal{O}(g)}}$ instead of $n^{2^{\\mathcal{O}(d)}}$, and unboundedness can be witnessed by runs of length $n^{2^{\\mathcal{O}(g\\log g)}}$ instead of $n^{2^{\\mathcal{O}(d\\log d )}}$, where $n$ is the size of the instance.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are changing the coding paradigm, known as vibe coding, yet synthesizing algorithmically sophisticated and robust code still remains a critical challenge. Incentivizing the deep reasoning capabilities of LLMs is essential to overcoming this hurdle. Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) has emerged as a promising strategy to address this need. However, most existing approaches overlook the heterogeneous difficulty and granularity inherent in test cases, leading to an imbalanced distribution of reward signals and consequently biased gradient updates during training. To address this, we propose Test-driven and cApability-adaptive cuRriculum reinfOrcement fine-Tuning (TAROT). TAROT systematically constructs, for each problem, a four-tier test suite (basic, intermediate, complex, edge), providing a controlled difficulty landscape for curriculum design and evaluation. Crucially, TAROT decouples curriculum progression from raw reward scores, enabling capability-conditioned evaluation and principled selection from a portfolio of curriculum policies rather than incidental test-case difficulty composition. This design fosters stable optimization and more efficient competency acquisition. Extensive experimental results reveal that the optimal curriculum for RFT in code generation is closely tied to a model's inherent capability, with less capable models achieving greater gains with an easy-to-hard progression, whereas more competent models excel under a hard-first curriculum. TAROT provides a reproducible method that adaptively tailors curriculum design to a model's capability, thereby consistently improving the functional correctness and robustness of the generated code. All code and data are released to foster reproducibility and advance community research at https://github.com/deep-diver/TAROT."

Understanding the origin of in-gap states and their evolution in time during aging of the glass is therefore important for the control of the resistance drift in phase change memory devices. Here, we use a machine learning interatomic potential to generate several models of Ge$_2$Sb$_2$Te$_5$ whose electronic structure is then analyzed within density functional theory with a hybrid functional. A detailed statistical analysis of the structural motifs on which the in-gap states are localized, reveals that the vast majority of in-gap states involve wrong bonds (homopolar or Ge-Sb bonds) often accompanied by Ge in tetrahedral configurations or overcoordinated Ge and Sb atoms. Metadynamics simulations mimicking glass aging support the picture that structural relaxations lead to the depletion of in-gap states and then to an increase of resistance. The simulations thus provide important insights for the mitigation of the resistance drift in phase change memory devices."

We introduce a particle-based virtual ultrasound machine that uses a novel smoothed dissipative particle dynamics variant with an implicit pressure solver and a negative-pressure stabilization scheme, required to mimic acoustic propagation across MHz-GHz frequencies. We demonstrate its capabilities by modeling the acoustophoresis of encapsulated microbubbles, a key mechanism in ultrasound-mediated drug delivery.

In online deliberation platforms, algorithmic selection is increasingly used to automate this process. However, such automation is not without consequences. For instance, enforcing consensus-seeking algorithmic strategies can imply ignoring or flattening conflicting preferences, which may lead to erasing minority voices and reducing content diversity. More generally, across the variety of existing selection strategies (e.g., consensus, diversity), it remains unclear how each approach influences desired democratic criteria such as proportional representation. To address this gap, we benchmark several algorithmic approaches in this context. We also build on social choice theory to propose a novel algorithm that incorporates both diversity and a balanced notion of representation in the selection strategy. We find empirically that while no single strategy dominates across all democratic desiderata, our social-choice-inspired selection rule achieves the strongest trade-off between proportional representation and diversity."

In this article, the self-regulation mechanism of the AUG core plasma during flux pumping is investigated at realistic parameters using the JOREK code based on the two-temperature, nonlinear, full magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model. A key milestone in AUG flux pumping modelling is achieved by quantitatively reproducing the clamped current density and safety factor profiles in the plasma core, demonstrating the effectiveness of the dynamo effect in sustaining the flux pumping state. The dynamo term, that is of particular interest, is primarily generated by the pressure-gradient driven m/n = 1/1 quasi-interchange-like MHD instability. The work systematically extrapolates the parameter regimes of flux pumping from the above AUG base case by scanning dissipation coefficients and plasma beta. The simulation results reveal bifurcated plasma behaviours at different Hartmann numbers, including distinct states such as flux pumping (helical core with a flat current density), sawteeth (periodic kink-cycling), single crash (without subsequent cycle), and quasi-stationary magnetic island (peaked current density). Transitions from marginal flux pumping state to sawteeth are observed in long-term simulations. The relationships between system dissipation, plasma beta, and different plasma states are carefully analyzed. For practical purposes, the potential operational window for flux pumping, as determined by plasma density and temperature, is estimated. The modelling efforts advance the understanding of flux pumping and facilitate the development of a fast surrogate model for efficient evaluation of flux pumping."

Our findings reveal that experts do not follow fundamentally different transitions between data science phases than novices (e.g., Data Import, EDA, Model Training, Visualization). Instead, expertise is distinguished by the overall workflow structure from a problem-solving perspective and cell-level, fine-grained action patterns. Novices tend to follow long, linear processes, whereas experts employ shorter, more iterative strategies enacted through efficient, context-specific action sequences. These results provide data science educators with empirical insights for curriculum design and assessment, shifting the focus from final products toward the development of the flexible, iterative thinking that defines expertise-a priority in a field increasingly shaped by AI tools."

Using I-band measurements in 48 GCs from P. Stetson's database, we determined $M_{I,0} = -3.948^{+0.037}_{-0.034}$ mag (1.6% in distance). Calibrating the TRGB using Gaia's homogeneous, space-based RP photometry of 53 GCs, we found $M_{RP,0} = -3.807^{+0.041}_{-0.035}$ mag (1.8%). The stated uncertainties include statistical and systematic effects, including the correlated nature of the GC distances. The robustness of our calibrations is demonstrated via tests against small-number statistics and analysis choices.

    "abstract": "This study explores a handheld, battery-operated e-ink device displaying Google Scholar citation statistics. The StatCounter places academic metrics into the flow of daily life rather than a desktop context. The work draws on a first-person, longitudinal auto-ethnographic inquiry examining how constant access to scholarly metrics influences motivation, attention, reflection, and emotional responses across work and non-work settings. The ambient proximity and pervasive availability of scholarly metrics invites frequent micro-checks, short reflective pauses, but also introduces moments of second-guessing when numbers drop or stagnate. Carrying the device prompts new narratives about academic identity, including a sense of companionship during travel and periods away from the office. Over time, the presence of the device turns metrics from an occasional reference into an ambient background of scholarly life. The study contributes insight into how situated, embodied access to academic metrics reshapes their meaning, and frames opportunities for designing tools that engage with scholarly evaluation in reflective ways."

    "abstract": "It is not fully understood why some solar filaments erupt while others do not. Those that do typically undergo a slow rise followed by an acceleration phase, though this transition requires further investigation. Erupting prominences have been observed to heat up during the acceleration phase, but the origin of this heating remains unclear. Moreover, some coronal mass ejections possess additional fine structure in white-light observations beyond the classical three-part morphology. We aim to elaborate on the dynamics of erupting prominences, investigate the heating during the acceleration phase, and correlate our findings with observations. We employ the open-source MPI-AMRVAC code to solve the 2.5D MHD equations on a coronal domain extending to 300 Mm, using adaptive mesh refinement to attain high resolution. Controlled combinations of footpoint shearing and converging motions applied to an initial magnetic arcade produce erupting flux ropes with self-consistent prominence and coronal rain formation due to thermal instability. We find both non-erupting and erupting cases related to the system energization. Comparison with observations from the AIA Filament Eruption Catalog shows that the slow-rise and impulsive phases are modulated by magnetic reconnection. The transition to acceleration corresponds to an increase in the inflow Alfvén Mach number. Thermal conduction and compressional heating can lead to prominence evaporation. We obtain nested circular fine structure in EUV images of the ejected flux ropes, partly resulting from plasmoid interactions. We conclude that internal heating processes and magnetic reconnection play key roles in the early evolution of CMEs."

    "abstract": "The increasing size and complexity of modern deep neural networks (DNNs) pose significant challenges for on-device inference on mobile GPUs, with limited memory and computational resources. Existing DNN acceleration frameworks primarily deploy a weight preloading strategy, where all model parameters are loaded into memory before execution on mobile GPUs. We posit that this approach is not adequate for modern DNN workloads that comprise very large model(s) and possibly execution of several distinct models in succession. In this work, we introduce FlashMem, a memory streaming framework designed to efficiently execute large-scale modern DNNs and multi-DNN workloads while minimizing memory consumption and reducing inference latency. Instead of fully preloading weights, FlashMem statically determines model loading schedules and dynamically streams them on demand, leveraging 2.5D texture memory to minimize data transformations and improve execution efficiency. Experimental results on 11 models demonstrate that FlashMem achieves 2.0x to 8.4x memory reduction and 1.7x to 75.0x speedup compared to existing frameworks, enabling efficient execution of large-scale models and multi-DNN support on resource-constrained mobile GPUs."

    "abstract": "Cryptographic digests (e.g., MD5, SHA-256) are designed to provide exact identity. Any single-bit change in the input produces a completely different hash, which is ideal for integrity verification but limits their usefulness in many real-world tasks like threat hunting, malware analysis and digital forensics, where adversaries routinely introduce minor transformations. Similarity-based techniques address this limitation by enabling approximate matching, allowing related byte sequences to produce measurably similar fingerprints. Modern enterprises manage tens of thousands of endpoints with billions of files, making the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed techniques more important than ever in security applications. Security researchers have proposed a range of approaches, including similarity digests and locality-sensitive hashes (e.g., ssdeep, sdhash, TLSH), as well as more recent machine-learning-based methods that generate embeddings from file features. However, these techniques have largely been evaluated in isolation, using disparate datasets and evaluation criteria. This paper presents a systematic comparison of learning-based classification and similarity methods using large, publicly available datasets. We evaluate each method under a unified experimental framework with industry-accepted metrics. To our knowledge, this is the first reproducible study to benchmark these diverse learning-based similarity techniques side by side for real-world security workloads. Our results show that no single approach performs well across all dimensions; instead, each exhibits distinct trade-offs, indicating that effective malware analysis and threat-hunting platforms must combine complementary classification and similarity techniques rather than rely on a single method."

    "abstract": "We present a purely theoretical, self-contained argument that the Second Law of Thermodynamics cannot be a universal fundamental law in the form ``entropy does not decrease'' (whether asserted trajectory-wise or as a universal statistical principle) when the underlying microscopic dynamics are time-reversal invariant. The core is a mirror-state construction: for any microstate $A$ one constructs its time-reversed partner $B$ (momenta inverted). If a universal monotonicity statement is applied to both $A$ and $B$, it implies that $A$ is a local minimum of entropy at every moment, which forces entropy to be constant and destroys any entropic arrow of time. The consistent replacement is that entropy is a stochastic variable described by a probability distribution $P(S)$, whose shape depends on constraints and boundary conditions. We then prove from first principles that constraints necessarily reshape the long-time entropy distribution $P_{\\infty}(S;λ)$ by altering the invariant measure through changes in the Hamiltonian and/or the accessible phase space. A sharp criterion is given: in the microcanonical setting, the \\emph{only} way $P_{\\infty}^{(E)}(S;λ)$ can remain the same up to translation is when all accessible macrostate volumes are scaled by a common factor; otherwise the distribution changes structurally."

    "abstract": "Generative models have made it possible to synthesize highly realistic images, potentially providing an abundant data source for training machine learning models. Despite the advantages of these synthesizable data sources, the indiscriminate use of generated images as real images for training can even cause mode collapse due to modality discrepancies between real and synthetic domains. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for discriminative use of generated images, coined GMAIL, that explicitly treats generated images as a separate modality from real images. Instead of indiscriminately replacing real images with generated ones in the pixel space, our approach bridges the two distinct modalities in the same latent space through a multi-modal learning approach. To be specific, we first fine-tune a model exclusively on generated images using a cross-modality alignment loss and then employ this aligned model to further train various vision-language models with generated images. By aligning the two modalities, our approach effectively leverages the benefits of recent advances in generative models, thereby boosting the effectiveness of generated image learning across a range of vision-language tasks. Our framework can be easily incorporated with various vision-language models, and we demonstrate its efficacy throughout extensive experiments. For example, our framework significantly improves performance on image captioning, zero-shot image retrieval, zero-shot image classification, and long caption retrieval tasks. It also shows positive generated data scaling trends and notable enhancements in the captioning performance of the large multimodal model, LLaVA."

A dipole flow model is built to analytically calculate the streamlines of the flow field inside the domain which allocates the optical/fluidic source and sink pairs at arbitrary positions. Liquid core/liquid cladding (L2) configuration is used in the experiment to trace the light via a specific streamline. Experimental results verify that the light paths agree well with the theoretical predictions, and demonstrate that a good range of tunability can be achieved by adjusting the flow rates and the source-sink positions of optical/fluidic source and sink pairs."

We analyze Lomb-Scargle periodograms produced with new and archival, multi-instrument spectroscopic time series of Balmer H and He spectral lines. We find that 153.17 $\\pm$ 0.42 d and 306.56 $\\pm$ 1.19 d are both equally suitable periods at phasing the spectral and magnetic time series data in a manner consistent with the Oblique Rotator Model. The 306.56 d period implies a magnetic geometry for NGC 1624-2 that is quite different from the previously accepted one, for which both magnetic poles should be observed during a full rotational cycle. If this is the case, the star's magnetic South pole has yet to be observed, and additional spectropolarimetric observations should be acquired in order to confirm whether or not the south pole is in fact observable."

    "abstract": "Mixture distributions are a workhorse model for multimodal data in information theory, signal processing, and machine learning. Yet even when each component density is simple, the differential entropy of the mixture is notoriously hard to compute because the mixture couples a logarithm with a sum. This paper develops a deterministic, closed-form toolkit for bounding and accurately approximating mixture entropy directly from component parameters. Our starting point is an information-theoretic channel viewpoint: the latent mixture label plays the role of an input, and the observation is the output. This viewpoint separates mixture entropy into an average within-component uncertainty plus an overlap term that quantifies how much the observation reveals about the hidden label. We then bound and approximate this overlap term using pairwise overlap integrals between component densities, yielding explicit expressions whenever these overlaps admit a closed form. A simple, family-dependent offset corrects the systematic bias of the Jensen overlap bound and is calibrated to be exact in the two limiting regimes of complete overlap and near-perfect separation. A final clipping step guarantees that the estimate always respects universal information-theoretic bounds. Closed-form specializations are provided for Gaussian, factorized Laplacian, uniform, and hybrid mixtures, and numerical experiments validate the resulting bounds and approximations across separation, dimension, number of components, and correlated covariances."

Our focus is on the role of information geometry on semantic encoding and the linear representation hypothesis. As an illustrative application, we develop \"dual steering\", a method for robustly steering representations to exhibit a particular concept using linear probes. We prove that dual steering optimally modifies the target concept while minimizing changes to off-target concepts. Empirically, we find that dual steering enhances the controllability and stability of concept manipulation."

We propose a joint-sampling framework for flow-matching video generators that improves batch diversity while preserving temporal consistency. Our approach applies diversity-driven updates and then removes only the components that would decrease a temporal-consistency objective. To avoid image-space gradients, we compute both objectives with lightweight latent-space models, avoiding video decoding and decoder backpropagation. Experiments on a state-of-the-art text-to-video flow-matching model show diversity comparable to strong joint-sampling baselines while substantially improving temporal consistency and color naturalness.

In modern search and recommendation systems, ranking and personalization policies play a central role in shaping such exposure and its long-term effects on users. To study these effects in a controlled setting, we present FrameRef, a large-scale dataset of 1,073,740 systematically reframed claims across five framing dimensions: authoritative, consensus, emotional, prestige, and sensationalist, and propose a simulation-based framework for modeling sequential information exposure and reinforcement dynamics characteristic of ranking and recommendation systems. Within this framework, we construct framing-sensitive agent personas by fine-tuning language models with framing-conditioned loss attenuation, inducing targeted biases while preserving overall task competence. Using Monte Carlo trajectory sampling, we show that small, systematic shifts in acceptance and confidence can compound over time, producing substantial divergence in cumulative information health trajectories. Human evaluation further confirms that FrameRef's generated framings measurably affect human judgment. Together, our dataset and framework provide a foundation for systematic information health research through simulation, complementing and informing responsible human-centered research.

    "abstract": "Many natural processes, such as chemical reactions and wave dynamics, are modeled as production-destruction (PD) systems that obey positivity and linear conservation laws. Classical time integrators do not guarantee positivity and can produce negative or nonphysical numerical solutions. This paper presents a modular correction strategy that can be applied to implicit Runge-Kutta schemes, in particular SDIRK methods. The strategy combines stage-wise clipping with a ratio-based scaling that enforces invariants and is guaranteed to yield nonnegative, conservative solutions. We provide a theoretical analysis of the corrected schemes and characterize their worst-case order of accuracy relative to the underlying base method. Numerical experiments on stiff ODE systems (Robertson, MAPK, stratospheric chemistry) and a nonlinear PDE (the Korteweg-De Vries equation) demonstrate that the corrected SDIRK methods preserve positivity and invariants without significant loss of accuracy. Importantly, corrections applied only to the final stage are sufficient in practice, while applying them at all stages may distort dynamics in some cases. For explicit Runge-Kutta schemes, the correction maintained positivity but reduced convergence to first order. These results show that the proposed framework provides a simple and effective way to construct positivity-preserving integrators for stiff PD systems."

We introduce NeuroSymActive, a modular framework that combines a differentiable neural-symbolic reasoning layer with an active, value-guided exploration controller for Knowledge Graph Question Answering. The method couples soft-unification style symbolic modules with a neural path evaluator and a Monte-Carlo style exploration policy that prioritizes high-value path expansions.

    "abstract": "Asynchronous Federated Learning (AFL) has emerged as a significant research area in recent years. By not waiting for slower clients and executing the training process concurrently, it achieves faster training speed compared to traditional federated learning. However, due to the staleness introduced by the asynchronous process, its performance may degrade in some scenarios. Existing methods often use the round difference between the current model and the global model as the sole measure of staleness, which is coarse-grained and lacks observation of the model itself, thereby limiting the performance ceiling of asynchronous methods. In this paper, we propose FedPSA (Parameter Sensitivity-based Asynchronous Federated Learning), a more fine-grained AFL framework that leverages parameter sensitivity to measure model obsolescence and establishes a dynamic momentum queue to assess the current training phase in real time, thereby adjusting the tolerance for outdated information dynamically. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and comparisons with various methods demonstrate the superior performance of FedPSA, achieving up to 6.37\\% improvement over baseline methods and 1.93\\% over the current state-of-the-art method."

    "abstract": "Understanding how language models carry out long-horizon reasoning remains an open challenge. Existing interpretability methods often highlight tokens or spans correlated with an answer, but they rarely reveal where the model makes consequential reasoning turns, which earlier context causally triggers those turns, or whether the highlighted text actually steers the reasoning process. We introduce Directional Reasoning Trajectory Change (DRTC), a process-causal framework for interpreting long-form reasoning from a single on-policy rollout. DRTC detects pivot decision points using uncertainty and distribution-shift signals, then applies receiver-side interventions that preserve the realized rollout without resampling the continuation while blocking information flow from selected earlier chunks only at a pivot. It measures whether each intervention redirects the direction of the model's log-probability trajectory relative to the realized rollout direction, producing a signed per-chunk attribution score. We also compute turning-angle curvature changes on raw logits as a complementary diagnostic and introduce curvature signatures to summarize shared intervention-response geometry. Empirically, directional influence is sharply concentrated across four reasoning models (per-example |DRTC| shares yield Gini 0.50 to 0.58 and top-5 percent mass 0.23 to 0.28), and learned pivots induce stronger intervention magnitudes than matched random spans. In a scaling study on 500 MATH problems with R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, learned spans outperform matched random spans (median delta = 0.409, 355 of 500 positive; sign test p = 2.3e-21). Overall, DRTC provides a causally grounded, trajectory-level view of how specific context elements steer reasoning under on-policy dynamics."

    "abstract": "The recent demonstrations of cascaded PDC (CPDC) and the hopeful prospects of realizing third-order PDC (TOPDC) for the generation of three-photon entangled states are paving the way for experimental studies on genuine three-photon interference. In this article, we formulate three-photon interference in terms of ``each three-photon interfering only with itself.'' We show that although a generalized two-alternative three-photon interference setup based on CPDC or TOPDC involves eight different length parameters, the interference can be fully characterized in terms of only three independent parameters. The first parameter is the three-photon path-length difference, which has a direct analog in the one-photon and two-photon cases, and the other two parameters quantify the path-asymmetry length. Unlike two-photon interference, which requires only one parameter to quantify path-asymmetry, two independent parameters are needed in three-photon interference. This results in a broader class of nonclassical three-photon effects, including three-photon HOM-type effects. Our work provides the theoretical basis for existing and future three-photon interference experiments exploring the rich and complex quantum correlations associated with three-particle entanglement and potentially enabling the development of novel protocols for harnessing those correlations."

    "abstract": "We study the lattice $\\mathbf{tors}(A)$ of torsion pairs in the category $\\mathrm{mod}(A)$ of finitely generated modules over an artinian ring $A$. It was shown by the authors in previous work that $\\mathbf{tors}(A)$ is isomorphic to a lattice formed by certain closed sets, called maximal rigid, in the Ziegler spectrum of the unbounded derived category $\\mathrm{D}(A)$ of $A$. Moreover, the structure of this lattice is described by an operation on maximal rigid sets which encompasses (the dual of) silting mutation. In this paper we provide an explicit description of this operation and we discuss how it is reflected in the lattice $\\mathbf{tors}(A)$. We establish a bijection between the wide intervals in $\\mathbf{tors}(A)$ and the closed rigid sets in the Ziegler spectrum of $\\mathrm{D}(A)$. Moreover, we show that the arrows in the Hasse quiver of $\\mathbf{tors}(A)$ correspond to the closed rigid sets that are almost complete, or equivalently, that can be completed to a maximal rigid set in exactly two ways. Our results are most interesting in the case when $A$ is a finite dimensional algebra. In fact, we generalise results by Adachi, Iyama and Reiten, with an important difference: not every point in a maximal rigid set is mutable. We use the topology on the Ziegler spectrum to determine the mutable points. In the last section of the paper we illustrate our results by the example of a finite dimensional algebra arising from a triangulation of an annulus."

However, when the domain and its boundary are unbounded, such a method is unavailable. In this paper, using the technique of sphericalization developed in the prior paper~[32], we establish the existence of solutions to the Dirichlet boundary value problem for $p$-harmonic functions in unbounded uniform domains with unbounded boundary when $1<p<\\infty$. We also explore the issue of whether such solutions are unique by considering $p$-parabolicity and $p$-hyperbolicity properties of the domain."

    "abstract": "Hot subluminous stars (sdO/B) are evolved low mass stars originating from red giants that lost their envelope almost entirely. The multitude of observed phenomena imply that several pathways may form hot subdwarfs, most involving close binary channels. The Hamburg Quasar Survey (HQS) led to the discovery of many faint blue stars including hot subdwarf. Many of the HQS-sdB stars have been studied in detail, but analyses of the helium-rich sdOB and sdO stars are lacking. The recent development of hybrid LTE/non-LTE model spectra 2nd generation Bamberg model grids enables us to improve the spectroscopic analyses of the sdB stars as well as of the previously unstudied sdO stars allowing precise atmospheric parameters to be derived, while consistently accounting for parameter correlations and systematic uncertainties. ... We use spectral energy distributions to identify composite-colour sdB binaries and present the result of detailed spectroscopic analyses of 122 non-composite subdwarfs from the HQS to identify potential evolutionary pathways. ...Their derived mass distribution and median mass of 0.45 Msun is consistent with the canonical EHB mass. ... The helium-rich sdOB and sdO stars, are found near the helium main-sequence (He-MS). The derived mass distribution of the extremely He-rich subdwarfs is broader (0.48 to 1.05 Msun) and peaks at a median of 0.70 Msun, significantly larger than those of the hydrogen-rich stars. Intermediate He-rich subdwarfs are also He-MS stars, but of lower mass (0.55 Msun) than the extremely He-rich. This strongly supports the merger scenario for the origin of He-rich sdO stars, in which two helium white dwarfs merge following orbital decay driven by gravitational-wave emission, producing a He-rich sdO or sdOB star. From comparison to the results of similar studies we speculate that older populations produce more massive He-WD mergers.(abbreviated)"

    "abstract": "The increasing demand for robust and scalable encryption algorithms is driven by rapid advancements in computing technology, and emerging technologies like quantum cryptanalysis pose significant threats to information security. This paper presents a novel trinary-based multistage encryption algorithm designed for scalability and enhanced security through the use of the less-explored trinary number system. By leveraging a dynamically adapting, pseudo-random, multi-dimensional key space and high diffusion transform, the algorithm introduces significant resistance to common attacks. Additionally, two innovative generative steganography schemes are proposed that algorithmically generate unique musical compositions or chess positions directly from the ciphertext. The overall algorithm operates at linear complexity, which ensures optimal performance. To contextualize practicality, the system is benchmarked against established lightweight cryptographic baselines, and a dataset of 1000 plaintext–ciphertext pairs has been publicly released to support independent analysis. Ultimately, this work presents a complete and flexible framework that uniquely combines a novel cipher with generative steganography, offering a robust and efficient system."

LLM reasoning enables adaptive decision-making, context-aware planning, and human-aligned interaction, while AI agents extend these capabilities into structured autonomy pipelines that coordinate perception, reasoning, and control. These advancements are particularly critical in safety-sensitive domains such as autonomous driving (AD) and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). This survey provides a comprehensive review of LLM reasoning and AI agents across scenario generation, decision-making, multimodal perception, cooperative V2X interactions, and UAV swarm autonomy. We examine the role of simulation platforms and datasets, including CARLA, Apollo ADS, AirSim, nuScenes, DriveLM, and emerging synthetic environments, in supporting reproducible evaluation and benchmarking. In addition, we analyze pressing security and robustness challenges, including adversarial prompt injection, data poisoning, multimodal perturbations, privacy leakage, and vulnerabilities in cooperative agent communication. Finally, we propose future research directions including adversarially robust pipelines, hybrid symbolic LLM planning, secure multimodal fusion, privacy-preserving human alignment, distributed trust mechanisms for swarm autonomy, and optimized Drone-LLM deployment across on-drone, edge, and cloud environments. By unifying applications, datasets, benchmarks, reasoning, agents, and security, this survey establishes a roadmap for developing robust, trustworthy, and secure LLM-enabled autonomous systems."

For the purposes of monitoring sport events for dangerous injuries, we envision a coordinated UAV fleet designed to capture high-quality, multi-view video footage of collision events in real-time. The extracted video data is crucial for analyzing athletes’ motions and investigating the probability of sports-related traumatic brain injuries (TBI) during impacts. This research implemented a UAV fleet system on the NetLogo platform, utilizing custom collision observation algorithms to compare against traditional TV-coverage strategies. Our system supports decentralised data capture and autonomous processing, providing resilience in the rapidly evolving dynamics of sports collisions. The collaboration algorithm integrates both shared and local data to generate multi-step analyses aimed at determining the efficacy of custom methods in enhancing the accuracy of TBI prediction models. Missions are simulated in real-time within a two-dimensional model, focusing on the strategic capture of collision events that could lead to TBI, while considering operational constraints such as rapid UAV maneuvering and optimal positioning. Preliminary results from the NetLogo simulations suggest that custom collision record methods offer superior performance over standard TV-coverage strategies by enabling more precise and timely data capture. This comparative analysis highlights the advantages of tailored algorithmic approaches in critical sports safety applications."

    "abstract": "Medical image segmentation is a critical yet challenging task due to the intricate anatomical structures, low contrast, and high noise levels inherent in medical images. Leveraging the inductive bias for spatial locality, window attention-based Transformer models have demonstrated significant promise in advancing image analysis tasks. However, the reliance on manually tuned window attention mechanisms limits their adaptability to varying feature modeling requirements and the unique challenges posed by medical imaging, resulting in suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose evolutionary window attention adaptation (EW2A), a novel method specifically designed to overcome these challenges. In particular, a window attention-based supernet architecture is constructed firstly, where its search space focuses on two key aspects: optimal shift sizes for the window attention mechanism and effective upsampling strategies for the decoding process. Then, an adaptive Swin Transformer block and an adaptive upsampling block are built to enable the adaptability for effectively capturing both global and local contexts. Lastly, an evolutionary search algorithm is introduced to systematically explore the search space, identifying the optimal architecture that is highly effective for handling medical image segmentation tasks. Experimental results on benchmark medical image segmentation datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of EW2A, outperforming other competing approaches."

    "abstract": "Uncertainty modeling with different granularity structures is a research hotspot in granular computing. However, most granularity-related uncertainty measures lack effective means to represent and exploit the inherent granularity information in data, making it difficult for them to capture the distribution characteristics of samples and causing noise samples in high-aggregation regions to be misidentified. Meanwhile, they rarely involve noise-resistance mechanisms and struggle to accurately characterize the differences between samples in strongly disturbed environments, resulting in sensitivity to noise and insufficient robustness. Motivated by these issues, we investigate a novel granular-ball distinguishing measure that enhances noise-resistance on three levels: the algebraic perspective (dependency function), information theory (variable-precision entropy), and granular-ball computing (granulation mechanism). To this end, we define a relative-distance fuzzy similarity relation that fully considers local and global data distribution, thus effectively mitigating the influence of noise and outliers. A relative-distance granular-ball dependency function is then introduced by means of the relative-distance fuzzy similarity relation and fuzzy decision. Moreover, several granular-ball fuzzy entropy measures are presented, incorporating a variable-precision view to flexibly deal with noise and uncertainty. Finally, a granular-ball distinguishing measure is presented to comprehensively evaluate the distinguishing ability of candidate features. From the view of maintaining the classification ability, we further developed a heuristic feature selection algorithm with the distinguishing measure. Numerical experiments on 18 benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed model, as well as its superiority over six state-of-the-art comparative algorithms."

    "abstract": "Video Frame Interpolation (VFI) is an essential method for improving scientific and atmospheric visuals. The advanced VFI models trained on general video datasets struggle when directly used on specialized satellite images because of a substantial domain shift. The non-linear, flexible movement of clouds and other atmospheric events create significant visual distortions and blurriness that conventional models struggle to manage. This research addresses this challenge. First, a baseline is established by demonstrating a well-known VFI model trained on generic data that fails to produce coherent results on the specialized Weather Map Service (WMS) imagery. Second, a robust and effective transfer learning framework is introduced. This involves fine-tuning the pre-trained model on the WMS dataset using a novel custom loss function specifically designed to address the non-rigid dynamics of the cloud motion. The experiments show a significant improvement in the performance for satellite imagery. This suggests a refined model that significantly diminishes artifacts and improves perceptual quality, surpassing the standard baseline by a considerable margin on quantitative measures such as PSNR and SSIM, along with visual comparisons in terms of quality. This study validates that domain adaptation is a significant phase for utilizing VFI in scientific contexts and offers a robust, demonstrable method for interpolating intricate atmospheric phenomena."

The paper describes a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based system of artificial intelligence (AI)-based wireless security monitoring that will be more accurate, scalable and able to respond in real-time. The model also requires a Wasserstein GAN with Gradient Penalty (WGAN-GP) structure to generate adversarial traffic patterns to provide a reasonable training of the discriminator that boosts its sensitivity to both known and zero-day threats. The experimental tests have shown that the suggested model has a detection accuracy of 96.8, an average inference time of 95 ms, and the detection latency is reduced by 34% relative to other traditional intrusion detection systems. In addition, the system identifies zero-day threats including spoofing and replay attacks with more than 90 percent completeness, which makes them resilient to dynamic threats. These findings confirm how GANs could be used to further enhance the security infrastructure in wireless, and users can count on these scalable and dependable infrastructures as a solution to the cloud-based network."

    "abstract": "The wide range of deformation artifacts that arise from complex light propagation, scattering, and depth-dependent attenuation makes the underwater image restoration to remain a challenging problem. Like other single deep regressor networks, conventional GAN-based restoration methods struggle to perform well across this heterogeneous domain, since a single generator network is typically insufficient to capture the full range of visual degradations. In order to overcome this limitation, we propose xOp-GAN, a novel GAN model with several expert generator networks, each trained solely on a particular subset with a certain image quality. Thus, each generator can learn to maximize its restoration performance for a particular quality range. Once a xOp-GAN is trained, each generator can restore the input image and the best restored image can then be selected by the discriminator based on its perceptual confidence score. As a result, xOP-GAN is the first GAN model with multiple generators where the discriminator is being used during the inference of the regression task. Experimental results on benchmark Large Scale Underwater Image (LSUI) dataset demonstrates that xOp-GAN achieves PSNR levels up to 25.16 dB, surpassing all single-regressor models by a large margin even, with reduced complexity."

The dataset consists of 150 audio recordings (100 normal and 50 apraxia), each 10-15 seconds long, processed in MATLAB. The system converts raw audio into standardized spectrogram segments and trains a CNN to classify them as either Normal or Apraxia.

Despite substantial advances in specialized deep learning hardware, data loading continues to be a major bottleneck that limits training and inference speed. To address this challenge, we propose training models directly on encoded JPEG features, reducing the computational overhead associated with full JPEG decoding and significantly improving data loading efficiency. While prior works have focused on recognition tasks, we investigate the effectiveness of this approach for the restoration task of single-image super-resolution (SISR). We present a lightweight super-resolution pipeline that operates on JPEG discrete cosine transform (DCT) coefficients in the frequency domain. Our pipeline achieves a 2.6 x speedup in data loading and a 2.5 x speedup in training, while preserving visual quality comparable to standard SISR approaches."

To address this, this paper proposes ASCID-Net, a novel semi-supervised framework that unifies imputation and classification in an end-to-end manner by learning the joint distribution of features and labels. The framework integrates three core components: a dynamic autoregressive modeler to learn the joint data distribution, a label-guided transformation network to enhance feature representations using label signals, and a hybrid semi-supervised trainer to effectively leverage unlabeled data. Experiments on public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and competitive performance of the proposed approach."

Taking a one-to-sixteen Wilkinson power divider as an example, a data set containing characteristic parameters such as micro strip line width, length, and isolation resistor values is constructed through theoretical calculations and electromagnetic simulations. Using ADS(Advanced Design System) software, 700 sets of simulation data are generated, with port power distribution ratios, maximum insertion loss, and maximum voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR) as inputs, and characteristic parameters as outputs, to train four independent DNN models. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively predicts the structural parameters of the power divider within the frequency range of 1.15–1.35 GHz. All performance metrics (insertion loss < 1 dB, VSWR < 1.5, isolation > 15 dB, phase balance ±5°) meet the design requirements, validating the feasibility and efficiency of neural networks in microwave device design."

The posture detection algorithm analyses the human body movement information in the image or video to extract the position and movement trajectory of the key points, so as to achieve the recognition and analysis of human body posture. It has important application value in many fields such as sports, traffic safety, medical treatment and so on, but there are few related researches in police tactical training, paper propose a research on the application of YOLOPose in police tactical training based on YOLOv5, to analyse the human body postures of the trainees in police tactical training, and to effectively improve the safety and timeliness of police tactical training. This gap highlights the need for intelligent, data-driven tools that can enhance the precision and safety of tactical training environments, where split-second decisions and accurate posture control are critical. The experimental conclusions show that the use of YOLOPose in police combat training can effectively detect the posture changes and psychological fluctuations of trainees, provide auxiliary decision-making for the detection of trainees' posture errors and clinical psychological problems, and significantly improve the safety and timeliness of police tactical training.

    "abstract": "Driven by the dual carbon goals, green finance has become a core force in promoting industrial structure upgrading and achieving ecological sustainable development. As a key tool for direct financing, the market size of green bonds has been steadily growing. However, as the issuers become increasingly diverse and the industry coverage continues to expand, some enterprises have encountered problems such as insufficient environmental protection information disclosure and a mismatch between ESG performance and financing purposes, gradually highlighting the default risk of green bonds. To this end, this paper proposes the LSTM-Adaboost fusion classification algorithm. Firstly, data features are mined through correlation analysis and violin graph analysis, and then comparative experiments are conducted with various machine learning algorithms such as decision tree, random forest, AdaBoost, KNN, XGBoost, and GBDT. The results show that the LSTM-Adaboost model performs the best in all evaluation indicators. The accuracy rate and recall rate both reach 86.5%, the precision rate is 83.7%, the F1 value is 83.8%, and the AUC value is 90.1%. The accuracy rate is 3 percentage points higher than that of the suboptimal GBDT model. It has significant advantages in the accuracy of positive and negative sample recognition, comprehensive classification efficiency and generalization ability. In the comparison models, GBDT performed outstandingly comprehensively, with XGBoost achieving an accuracy rate of 80.1%. However, the other models had performance shortcomings. This model, by integrating the sequence feature capture capability of LSTM with the integrated learning advantages of AdaBoost, effectively makes up for the deficiencies of traditional models in feature extraction depth and classification accuracy, providing an efficient technical solution for the precise prevention and control of green bond default risks. It has significant practical significance for consolidating the foundation of green finance development and ensuring the smooth progress of the dual carbon goals."

This paper introduces a privacy-preserving machine-learning framework utilizing Cheonimim Song (CKKS) Homomorphic Encryption to provide secure computation on encrypted medical data without divulging plaintext values. The proposed approach employs logistic regression to predict potential health risks with end-to-end encryption throughout the whole process. For additional protection of data in transit, a second level of Advanced Encryption Standard - Galois/Counter Mode (AES- GCM) encryption is applied. The experimental outputs demonstrate that the accuracy of the encrypted model is the same as the accuracy of the non-encrypted one, which confirms that homomorphic encryption may allow to do secure machine learning without significant performance degradation. Homomorphic encryption may increase the computation load, though; batch encoding and cipher text packing make it more efficient. These findings lead to the possibility of machine learning in encrypted medicine, and more research can be done to create safe medical AI systems."

In the HMDiff, videos are first compressed into discrete latent codes through a vector-quantized variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE). Then, vid3o frames are predicted in this latent space conditioned on the latent codes of historical frame and motion. Finally, anomalies are detected by the frame-level prediction error. Extensive experiments on UCSD Ped2, CUHK Avenue, and ShanghaiTech demonstrate that HMDiff achieves competitive performance compared with recent baselines, especially on long-temporal-range scenarios."

The chatbot, coded in Python and developed in a Docker environment with a PostgreSQL database, uses the Groq large language model (LLM) along with the Chainlit interface to analyze user queries and generate STCW compliant content. Thanks to the unique structure of the RGC method, the scenario creation process ensures suitability for maritime operations by considering roles, results, goals, context, and constraints. When the RGC prompt is entered into the system, the system generates scenarios, questions, and multiple-choice options for the user. This contributes to the development of competency assessment processes in maritime education. Future studies will include pilot applications to test the system’s validity and reliability, as well as the integration of other international maritime conventions."

One of the key indicators of flutter is the flutter speed, which represents the critical airspeed that may cause structural instability. This project aims to increase the flutter speed of airfoils using a control law. The study compares the control efficiency between two airfoils: NACA 0012 and NACA 64A010. The control method used in this study is gain feedback control, designed using the Linear-Quadratic Regulator (LQR) approach in MATLAB. The aerodynamic loads acting on the airfoils are calculated using the Theodorsen Unsteady Modeling while the flutter speed is determined using the <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{P}-\\mathbf{K}$</tex> method, which relies on the eigenvalues of a state-space system. The comparison is conducted at 120 % of the flutter speed for each airfoil. The results show that aeroelasticity control law for NACA 64A010 is more effective than aeroelasticity control law for NACA 0012. However, it is important to note that this study does not include thickness and shape airfoil. Future work should consider the thickness case to improve the accuracy of the analysis."

Using bidirectional contrastive learning, CFN aligns intermediate feature representations, enabling efficient knowledge transfer and incremental adaptation without full retraining. Evaluated on the Cityscapes dataset using only fine annotations, CFN improves segmentation performance while reducing reliance on additional supervision. Its modular design supports transparency and continual refinement, making it well-suited for data-constrained and evolving AV scenarios. CFN contributes to the broader goals of explainable and efficient learning in AV systems. Code is publicly available at: https://github.com/ MargiPandya27/ContraFusionNet."

This research suggests a Dynamic Pricing Framework that is based on Reinforcement Learning with the use of Deep Q-Networks (DQN) to make optimal price decisions in real time. Pricing problem is defined as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) where the states are the demand patterns, inventory levels and competitor prices and the actions are (price changes). The reward feature is seen to maximize revenue growth in the long term as opposed to the short-term. The framework is implemented with the help of TensorFlow and trains a deep neural network to produce approximations of Q-values, making it possible to implement adaptive pricing policies. Simulations of synthetic e-commerce data shows that the average revenue is dramatically improved when using the experimental simulation method over the traditional rule-based and demand-elasticity approaches. The findings point at the prospects of integrating reinforcement learning and scalable deep learning applications to design smart, competitive, customer-sensitive pricing systems of modern e-commerce platforms."

Mean Squared Error (MSE) as well as Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) were utilized such that performance metrics could be evaluated across four test images. The results depict that MSE diminishes by 13.3% on average while PSNR gains climb up to 1.9%, also PSNR values get to 79.13 dB in the best instance. Considerably, the procedure improved the MSE regarding Image 2 via 27.8% also heightened definition substantially while conserving border honesty. Improved visual outcomes strengthen these numerical enhancements. The procedure is simple and yields superior renovation, appropriate for instantaneous subaquatic imagery applications.

Sequencing in this manner is able to suppress underlying patterns and structural relationships among complaints that become apparent only when data are viewed in the aggregate to avoid this weakness, the proposed approach models the complaint context as a graph, where a complaint is a node and edges are formed based on relations such as geographical proximity, keyword similarity, similar re-submissions by the same individual, timing, or department relevance.

The method takes advantage of hierarchical attention to learn local distortions of wireless signals, as well as global dependencies, and self-supervised learning minimizes the need to use labeled data, leading to increased flexibility to novel channel scenarios. Federated fine-tuning also provides privacy preserving updates of models between heterogeneous edge devices. The system, implemented based on the Hugging face Transformers ecosystem and PyTorch Lightning, shows better performance compared to CNN, GAN, and GNN-based baselines and provides better SNR improvement, BER decrease, and lower processing latency. It has been experimentally shown that the proposed system provides a scalable, robust, and efficient solution, which makes Vision Transformers one of the enabling factors of a reliable 6G communication system."

This approach incorporates observation angle information to enhance the ability to classify different materials while retaining the frequency domain information of the Fourier features, extends the dimension of features in the spatial domain and introduces a residual structure in the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to prevent the degradation of feature information.

To these challenges, this study proposes a transfer learning-based approach for automated tea leaf disease detection. The key contributions of the work include, a) utilization of publicly available dataset for training and evaluation, b) development of customized transfer learning models based on EfficientNet B7, MobileNetV2, Diseases of the tea plant have a major impact on the yield and quality of tea produced worldwide. Therefore, to guarantee sustained cultivation and avoid financial losses, early and precise detection is crucial. Thus, incorporation of parameter optimization and fine-tuning strategies to enhance classification performance. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves an average accuracy of 96% significantly outperforming conventional methods, providing a robust solution for precision agriculture and sustainable tea production."

    "abstract": "This study introduces a novel AI-driven framework for automated orange fruit size estimation using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) combined with explainable AI (XAI) techniques. The proposed model classifies orange sizes into discrete categories (small, medium, large) based on high-resolution RGB images, achieving over 95 % classification accuracy. Our system leverages the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection family (YOLOv8 through YOLOv12) for fruit localization and bounding box regression, coupled with Grad-CAM for interpretability. Comparative experimental results demonstrate YOLOv12 offers superior detection precision and recall at the cost of significantly increased inference time. Furthermore, we incorporate realfield dataset annotations aligned with ground-truth measurements to validate model robustness. The explainable outputs provide critical insights into the visual features driving model predictions, making the system both transparent and trustworthy.

    "abstract": "The UK government set a legally binding net-zero greenhouse gas emission target aiming for a fully decarbonized energy system by 2050. Achieving this will require major reforms in the electricity market. However, a clear, officially recognized pathway to decarbonization has yet to be provided. Several research organizations including the Energy Systems Catapult, the National Energy System Operatthe Centere Center for Alternative Tech and the Climate Change Committee have proposed decarbonization pathways. Although these pathways differ in their assumptions and approaches, they all anticipate a significant increase in both electricity demand and renewable generation. In these scenarios, electricity generation is projected to increase by 51% to 160% by 2050, creating both opportunities and challenges for the power transmission network of GB. In this study, we employ a modeling framework to examine the potential impacts of these decarbonization policies on the Great Britain electricity transmission system up to 2050. We identify likely congestion points and critical transmission lines under the predicted growth in load and generation across all seven pathways, providing information to support planning for a resilient and low-carbon electricity network."

    "abstract": "Recent years, to achieve carbon peaking and carbon neutrality, the popularization of electric vehicles (EVs) makes great contributions to the reduction of carbon emissions. However, the charging behavior of large-scale EVs also brings great challenges to the safe and stable operation of the power system. The rational allocation of photovoltaic (PV) and energy storage (ES) in solar charging stations, including their optimal site selection and capacity allocation, plays a critical role in mitigating EVs charging loads and ensuring the secure operation of distribution networks. This paper proposes a mathematical model for site selection and capacity allocation of mobile photovoltaic charging stations (MPVCS), which mainly consist of two parts: mobile PV(MPV) and mobile ES (MES). The site selection and capacity allocation of MPVCS directly affect their operating costs and overall feasibility. In order to minimize the total annualized costs of MPVCS, including investment costs, maintenance costs, power purchase costs, PV curtailment costs and network loss costs within a one-year dispatch horizon, guided by nodal tariffs, MPVCS can flexibly adjust the siting and capacity of MPV and MES. Case studies demonstrate that MPVCS significantly reduces total costs compared to fixed photovoltaic charging stations (FPVCS) and the risk of voltage overruns is greatly reduced, providing theoretical support for the future promotion of MPVCS."

    "abstract": "Early and proper detection of grape leaf diseases is of great importance to maintain the health and global wine production of the vineyards. Although deep learning has been demonstrated in the context of plant disease diagnostics, the current models that use convolutional neural networks ( CNNs) tend to be less sensitive to fine-grained visual features of various pathologies since they not only focus on the local features but also on the global context features. To overcome this drawback, this research suggests an innovative hybrid architecture that makes the best of ConvNeXt, which is a contemporary CNN, and a Vision Transformer (ViT). The suggested framework utilises a pretrained ConvNeXt backbone as an effective feature extractor to learn hierarchical local features like lesions and spots. The resulting rich feature maps are tokenized and run through a Transformer encoder, which uses self-attention to learn long-range dependency and global contextual relationships across the leaf. This dual stream methodology allows our model to gain insight into the fine details of the symptoms in an integrated manner, as well as the space-based interaction of these symptoms, which is important to distinguish between two visually similar diseases, such as Esca and Leaf Blight. Applied to the Grape400 dataset, the proposed hybrid model achieves the state-of-the-art macro F1-score of 98.2, which is far above the standard CNN and pure Transformer baseline. The suggested findings indicate that the suggested ConvNeXt-ViT framework is a powerful and efficient system to address fine-grained agricultural classification problems and can be applied in the context of precision viticulture."

However, the visible light channel is easily affected by environmental factors and presents fast time-varying characteristics, and the traditional methods have the problems of insufficient modeling accuracy and adaptive ability in dynamic scenes. By introducing the idea of cognitive radio, this paper designs a hybrid deep learning architecture combining convolutional neural network and long short-term memory network to realize end-to-end spectrum idle state judgment and channel parameter prediction. Experimental results show that the proposed model significantly outperforms traditional algorithms such as energy detection and matched filtering in terms of detection probability and prediction accuracy, and verifies its effectiveness in improving system performance through feature sharing and collaborative optimization.

    "abstract": "Due to the fast development of digital communication, there is an increasing necessity to have smart email management tools, which will get the opportunity to identify the emotional intent of the message and assign it the highest priority. The conventional email filtering systems are unable to detect nuanced emotional signals in written material, which results in latency in response and lost important messages. This paper introduces a Transformer-Driven Multimodal Emotion Cognition Framework with Adaptive Priority Routing and secure feature of Google o Auth2 authentication to provide real-time emotion-aware email notification. In the model, a transformer backbone that is based on DeBERTa and multimodal features, including punctuations intensity, lexical stress, and emoj ies are used to gain an understanding of emotions on a fine-grained scale. The system can classify emails as expressions of anger, urgency, joy, and neutral states with a precision of 96.72 according to advanced attention mechanisms and probability calibration outperforming traditional machine learning and previous baselines of deep-learning. The adaptive routing layer also optimizes priority assignment, based on reinforcement learning based on user interaction feedback. Detailed analysis of key performance indicators has shown that the system has improved significant operation in response time (reduced by a 60-67%), routing accuracy (more than 94%) and very low system latency of less than 250 ms at high loads. The framework has a high potential in terms of minimizing cognitive overloads and making sure that emotionally important communication is addressed in time. The future plans involve the incorporation of multilingual transformers, modeling of cross-senders and multimodal speech-text fusion to analyze voice-enabled emails. The suggested system lays a strong and safe foundation of emotionally intelligent fulfillment and management of email messages applicable in individual, enterprise, and massive communications processes."

This study evaluates the potential of static Time-of-Use (ToU) tariffs as a demand-side strategy to shift household appliance use to solar production hours in an IMG setting. A bottom-up, appliance-level simulation was developed to model household load profiles and evaluate cost savings from load shifting under ToU pricing. Implementing ToU pricing led to a 64 percent reduction in diesel use, 24 percent decrease in customer energy costs, and 25 percent reduction in solar energy curtailment. These results demonstrate that demand flexibility reduces customer energy costs, lowers developers’ reliance on fossil-fuel backup generation, and enhances solar photovoltaic (PV) utilisation."

To address this challenge, we propose a novel synthetic dataset generated through a Dual GAN-Diffusion-based generative learning framework. The method combines the diversity of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) with the high-fidelity refinement of Diffusion Models to create realistic and class-balanced images of pomegranate diseases.

This paper investigates whether six generally accessible AI detection tools-AI Text Classifier, Content Detector AI, Copyleaks, QuillBot, GPT-2, and GPTZero-can consistently recognize text generated by DeepSeek, a recently published LLM. We further investigated DeepSeek’s ability to classify AI vs. human text using few-shot and Chain-ofThought (CoT) prompting techniques. Previous studies, mainly on ChatGPT and other well-known LLMs, have shown that detection accuracy varies significantly among different tools. However, there is a clear void in the literature, given the paucity of information available about DeepSeek. We collected 49 humanauthored question-answer pairs from pre-LLM sources and generated matching responses using DeepSeek to close this gap, hence producing 49 AI-generated samples. Next, we paraphrased 49 of these samples to examine whether content alteration affects detection results. While QuillBot and Copyleaks obtain nearperfect recognition rates for original and paraphrased DeepSeek text, other tools, particularly AI Text Classifier and GPT-2, struggle to show consistent detection performance. The few-shot and chain-of-thought techniques yielded very high accuracy in classification. The findings highlight the need for continuous improvements in AI content identification and urge users in research, professional, and educational settings to exercise caution when relying on current detection tools. This paper builds on and extends existing work by evaluating the new LLM DeepSeek and highlighting its implications for integrity and content verification in an increasingly digital environment."

A researcher-developed survey instrument, validated by experts and pilot-tested for reliability, was used to collect data. Descriptive statistics revealed that athletes were generally uncertain about ChatGPT’s ease of use and usefulness for workout planning. Spearman’s rho correlation analysis indicated significant and strong positive relationships between perceived usefulness and behavioral intention and between perceived ease of use and behavioral intention. These findings suggest that although athletes are familiar with technology in general, they have not fully explored the use of generative AI tools like ChatGPT in the context of fitness planning.

Different machine learning, deep learning and transformer-based models are implemented in this study with the aim of sentiment analysis. Tf-idf (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) and Bow (Bag of Words) techniques were used to process text while performing analysis. We compared different machine learning (Naive bayes, SVM), deep learning (CNN, LSTM), and transformer (BERT, GPT, Roberta) models to carry out context-sensitive sentiment analysis on 100 k Twitter post. Performance bechnmarking and evalaution of Models was carried out based on Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, ROC-AUC and training time. The highest accuracy was reported by RoBERTa (93.2%), followed by BERT (91.8%), GPT (90.1%), LSTM (88.4%) and CNN (85.3%). SVM and Naive Bayes were at the bottom with accuracies of 82.6% and 78.2%. Findings indicate the benefit of contextual transformers on informal, sarcasm-prone text, at the cost of a trade-off in training cost. Although, the great accuracy of machine learning models, it is was not easy to gauge and comprehend instances of sarcasm, irony and other forms of contextual slangs in written comments. The study also proposes sentiment analysis on multilingual and multimodal materials which would combine text, images, speech and videos.

    "abstract": "Ovarian cancer is a very heterogeneous disease and, therefore, it is difficult to diagnose, which makes it necessary to clearly categorize the subtype in order to achieve further progress in patient care. The existing classification systems do not effectively use large amounts of molecular and clinical data, uncovering the best performance in the detection of cancer subtypes and in the detection of outliers. The presented literature review presents more than 20 articles published between 2000 and 2024 to review the latest methods of machine learning in the process of classifying subtypes of ovarian cancer and detecting outliers. The major shortcoming of current models is that they do not effectively combine multi-omics data, including genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic profiles, which are essential in improving the accuracy of the classification. Also, current methods of outlier detection often fail to focus on the clinical importance of uncommon subtypes of ovarian cancer, which may be deprived of significant information about the disease. This review will systematize the recent studies in three key directions: (1) development of sophisticated classification algorithms based on extensive molecular and clinical data, (2) development of new outlier detection algorithms to detect rare or unusual cases, and (3) the use and validation of machine learning models in clinical care. The two methodologies are considered based on the ability of the approach to generate clinically actionable information, and to improve individualized treatment plans specifically. Through the evaluation of these developments, this survey shows that the state-of-the-art machine learning solutions can help to fill existing gaps in the classification of subtypes of ovarian cancer and detecting outliers. It further pre-empts the work to come to incorporate computational models into practical clinical environments to eventual enhancements in the accuracy of diagnosis and improved patient outcomes by means of precision medicine."

    "abstract": "The abundance of digital and paper document forgery requires strong automated detection tools against financial fraud. This research provides a classical machine learning method for forged receipt detection using multimodal features from image and text modalities. The approach entailed designing a feature set to obtain textural and statistical attributes from receipt images via Local Binary Patterns (LBP) and Canny edge detection, along with structural features obtained from the associated text files. Another demanding issue in this area is the excessive class imbalance between genuine and forged documents. To overcome this issue, Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) is used to create a balanced training dataset. The models are assessed using the macro F1-score, precision, recall, PR AUC and ROC AUC to address class imbalance. The enhanced detection of the minority class is achieved using SMOTE, while hyperparameter tuning leads to the improvements in performance. The final Tuned Support Vector Machine model achieves a macro F1-score of 0.5429, and it has the highest recall on forged receipts, demonstrating that it detects more histories of tampered documents effectively. This research sets a good baseline for receipt forgery detection and emphasizes that class imbalance solving is a key towards creating a working system."

The panel features one incoming and eight outgoing circuits, using a compact design with a combination of aluminium (Al) and copper (Cu) busbars to minimise theft risk and reduce overall costs. Additionally, the panel features an optimised busbar layout that reduces the overall temperature rise. The fibre-reinforced polymer (FRP) has been opted for in the fabrication of the panel body to minimise noise, eddy current, and hysteresis losses. Along with this panel design, a previous experimental design of a panel is also discussed in the study. A detailed comparison between the proposed and previous panel designs is given for a better interpretation of the results. Through these design choices, the panel demonstrates improved efficiency, safety, and cost-effectiveness, which can be implemented in various commercial and industrial setups."

    "abstract": "Deep learning has revolutionized medical image analysis (MIA), offering unprecedented capabilities in diagnostics, prognosis, and treatment planning. However, its full potential is constrained by inherent challenges of medical data, including scarcity of large-scale annotated datasets, significant class imbalance, and the lack of model robustness to data distribution shifts. Curriculum learning (CL), a training paradigm inspired by human pedagogy, addresses these challenges by systematically structuring the learning process from easy to hard examples. This study presents a domain-focused review of CL in MIA. We synthesize how CL has been applied across diverse medical imaging tasks such as lesion detection, segmentation, and disease staging, demonstrating consistent gains in efficiency, robustness, and predictive accuracy. To provide structure to this field, we compile a taxonomy that categorizes CL approaches by their underlying difficulty criteria and learning paradigms. We further discuss open challenges and highlight promising avenues for future research, including the use of large pre-trained models, multi-modal data integration, and federated learning. By consolidating current evidence and perspectives, this study offers researchers and practitioners a comprehensive resource on CL in medical imaging and underscores its potential to advance clinically reliable AI systems."

The resulting velocity fields trained spacing-specific ANNs with adaptive yaw-weighted loss functions. The networks reproduced LES wake structures with mean relative errors below 7% while reducing computation time from 17.2 hours per LES run to 0.16 seconds. The model accurately captured wake deflection, recovery, and velocity deficits across configurations, achieving a 400,000× speed-up over LES.

By constructing an intelligent Blue Force with an asymmetric cognitive model, a hybrid decision engine, and a continuous learning mechanism, and by designing rules and environments that support cross-domain confrontation, this system aims to provide a highly realistic, intensely competitive, and professional opposition environment for the Red side, who participates as support personnel.

Through a dynamic weight allocation mechanism, it achieves coordinated optimization of global context and local details. Experimental results on both ICVL and Urban datasets demonstrate that the proposed model delivers superior performance in denoising tasks."

When natural disasters or emergencies occur, whether communication is unobstructed directly affects the success or failure of rescue operations and the safety of people's lives. Monitoring and early warning, and resource allocation play a crucial role in emergency communication, rescue, and disaster relief. Traditional emergency communication has the pain points of manual information capture and unintelligent command and dispatch. This paper designs an AI agent for emergency communication command and dispatch, which provides capabilities such as intelligent screening and identification of emergency communication information, information integration and association, intelligent dispatch of personnel and materials, decision support for command and dispatch, and automatic dispatch of emergency work orders. Meanwhile, a new emergency communication command and dispatch process was designed based on the proposed agent, which realized the automatic generation of emergency briefings, the automatic generation and dynamic adjustment of dispatch plans, and the automatic distribution of emergency work orders. The efficiency of emergency briefing editing and command and dispatch plan generation was increased by 82%, and the input of emergency communication on-duty personnel was reduced."

Dynamic, heterogenous, and dynamic workloads encountered by large-scale cloud systems are commonly not appropriate to be served by classic static or rule-based orchestration systems. AISF is a decentralized intelligent orchestration architecture that exploits predictive modeling and mutants-enabled deep reinforcement learning for contextually-aware, real-time resource allocation. In order to forecast load dynamics and dynamically re-distribute resources automatically using hierarchical control loops, including always evaluating system telemetry data, the AISF architecture makes use of learning agents that are deployed directly at service fabric level. AISF surpasses other baselines that include static-auto scaling and single-agent reinforcement learning in Google Cluster Workload Traces. It maintains 98.6% SLA satisfaction and demonstrates up to 25% resources saving, 40% latency reduction, and 21.9% energy expenditure mitigation. The model also possesses advantages of the better scalability, faster policy convergence, fault tolerance through distributed multi-agent coordination. AISF realizes energy-efficient and greening of cloud by the help of prediction with energy-awareness to stimulate carbon-conscious operation. The proposed solution positions AI as a fundamental power supply for future intelligent infrastructure management solutions and is a major step toward self-learning, self-healing, and self-optimization in the cloud."

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), their integration with external tools has become a key research area, greatly enhancing their applicability in real-world scenarios. However, a core challenge lies in enabling LLMs to accurately and efficiently invoke these tools while adhering to precise structured output formats. Prevailing approaches, which predominantly depend on instruction tuning and reinforcement learning, often overlook the potential of in-context learning and exhibit limited generalization across diverse tools and contexts, underscoring the demand for more adaptable and robust solutions. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel framework that enhances tool invocation by combining clustering and retrieval strategy, namely cluster-augmented demonstration retrieval (CA-DR) mechanism that significantly improves the tool invocation accuracy, leading to an average 25.8% improvement in coarse-grained accuracy over baselines on ToolACE and BFCL benchmarks. By considering both the relevance and diversity of demonstrations, our approach effectively improves the few-shot capabilities of LLMs. Evaluation across multiple different types and scales of LLMs show that our method achieves relatively high tool invocation accuracy while maintaining high efficiency."

    "abstract": "The VLSI technology has evolved from 180 nm to 45 nm technology. In this evolution process power consumption and delay reduction are considered to be major requirements to be met. Any VLSI circuit is made up of many subunits, but it is known that the memory unit is considered to be one among the circuits, that consume major power and are responsible for delay operation. The memory unit majorly requires hold time to switch between read and write operations; that is the reason why the memory unit consumes the most power. In order to reduce the power consumption and improve the speed, sleeper cells can be introduced. In this work, initially SRAM is constructed using 3T, 6T & 9T technology. The power and delay measurements for read, write, and hold are carried out. Further, sleeper cells are introduced. Basically, a sleeper cell is constructed using PMOS, NMOS, and a combination of both. Power and delay performance of the SRAM memory unit is done with the deployment of the sleeper cell, without affecting the read, write, and hold operation. Through the experimentation it observed that the impact of adding NMOS, PMOS, and a combination of both is a significant reduction in leakage power in the majority of setups, along with a noticeable increase in speed during read and write operations. The work concludes that the sleeper cell composed of NMOS and PMOS appeared to balance speed and power savings the best during the sleeper cell analysis process in comparison with sleeper cell designed exclusively by PMOS and NMOS. With the introduction of sleeper cells made up of both NMOS and PMOS, a 90% reduction in power leakage is achieved. The obtained results clearly show that the deployment of sleeper transistors in SRAM designs can result in a memory unit that is more energy-efficient for modern SoCs and portable electronics."

    "abstract": "With the rapid penetration of distributed energy resources and single-phase loads in distribution networks, three-phase imbalance has emerged as a critical power quality issue affecting system efficiency and equipment lifespan. Traditional imbalance mitigation approaches often overlook user participation willingness and the heterogeneous characteristics of different flexible resources, leading to suboptimal performance and low user satisfaction. This paper proposes an intelligent three-phase imbalance optimization method that considers the participation willingness of various flexible resources including residential air conditioners, commercial air conditioners, electric vehicles, water heaters, and distributed energy storage systems. A Long Short-Term Memory neural network is employed to predict user participation willingness based on historical behavior patterns, economic incentives, and temporal characteristics. A multi-objective optimization framework is developed to balance imbalance mitigation and user comfort through coordinated control strategies. The proposed elastic willingness guidance mechanism dynamically adjusts incentive strategies based on three-phase imbalance severity levels. Simulation results on a typical distribution network demonstrate that the proposed method reduces three-phase imbalance violations while maintaining user comfort levels above acceptable thresholds, achieving improvements in power quality and user satisfaction compared to conventional approaches."

This research explores how edge computing can enhance power grid fault detection, with an emphasis on how rapid fault detections are avoided. There is a comparison with conventional cloud-based systems with improved response times, energy consumption, and system reliability. Various fault detection methods, such as Wavelet Transform-based thresholding, Zscore anomaly detection, and Isolation Forest algorithm are compared. The performance indicates that although the Z-score did not detect transient disturbances and the Isolation Forest detected more anomalies (with more false advantages), the Wavelet Transform approach was the best performing and computationally most efficient for edge nodes and thus suitable for real-time fault detection in power networks."

The primary contribution is a dualmetric evaluation method that concurrently assesses the elbow flexion angle and the spatial stability of the elbow joint. This method enables the real-time identification of biomechanical errors, such as excessive joint displacement, while tracking repetitions based on adherence to a target angular range. The efficacy of this approach is validated through a quantitative analysis of captured motion data, which demonstrates a clear correlation between decreased joint stability and the terminal phases of flexion and extension.

Second, a neighborhood edge extension module adaptively expands the graph using shared neighbor constraints and similarity thresholds.

The proposed research seeks to address the question of how teachers of various backgrounds view and experience the use of AI in the open learning setting. A qualitative research design was used to gather data using in-depth interviews and focus group discussions with 30 educators selected in terms of disciplines, institutions, and regions. Five major themes have been uncovered: (1) AI tools are perceived as a means to improve administrative efficiency but not to substitute pedagogical judgment; (2) there are concerns about algorithmic bias, learner data privacy, and cultural neutrality; (3) AI-driven platforms can create digital divides unless equitably deployed; (4) educators want to have more agency and training in the adoption of AI; and (5) attitudes and preparedness toward AI depend heavily on disciplinary and regional contexts. The results indicate that inclusive AI policies should put a lot of emphasis on the voice of educators, contextual awareness, and lifelong learning. To make AI truly useful in open learning, systems should shift away from automation to supporting educators as co-designers of equitable, AI-enhanced learning."

    "abstract": "Inefficient collection of the traditional waste is based on fixed routes and schedules with overflowing bins, fuel wastage and higher costs. In this paper, a proposal will be provided regarding an Internet of Things (IoT) intelligent route optimization framework that utilizes real-time sensor data, machine learning predictions, and dynamically planned routes. The system utilizes the ultrasonic and MQ-135 gas sensors to measure the fill and odor levels on waste containers that are connected to ESP32 microcontrollers. A real-time dashboard is available on a Flask basis and offers administration. A nearest-neighbor greedy algorithm is used to perform route optimization with a Haversine distance calculation and bin fill-time prediction is done with a Random Forest Regressor model using various environmental and temporal features. The finding of simulation shows that efficiency of routes can improve by 15-30 percent, using resources can be saved, and functioning can improve, which opens the way towards sustainable smart city waste management."

    "abstract": "There are more than over 23,000 cryptocurrencies” in existence which represent one of the biggest unregulated markets across the globe. Currently, each cryptocurrency utilises distinct public-private key and public address formats. This diversity complicates the investigator's task of tracing and verifying a suspect's involvement in cryptocurrency-related crimes. Moreover, law enforcement agencies such as the police frequently seize digital devices, generating digital disk images for investigation which is a time consuming process. Thus, the investigation of cryptocurrencies has emerged as a major challenge. for law enforcement agencies across the world. Our proposed solution “CryptoKalp” aims to combat cybercrimes involving cryptocurrencies. The essence of our proposed tool is encapsulated in its name: “CryptoKalp.” The name is a fusion of two significant terms - “crypto,” signifying cryptocurrency, and “kalp,” a Sanskrit word representing investigation [1]. Our proposed tool makes the investigation process quicker by taking digital images, strings, various formats of files and folders as input and utilising a comprehensive database of regular expressions covering various cryptocurrency public-private key and address formats. Currently, our tool successfully identifies Bitcoin public-private keys and addresses from text files, with future plans outlined expanding its capabilities for Ether, Tether, Monero, Dash and Dogecoin. Investigating officers can access the system's user-friendly interface and the database containing login credentials, cryptocurrency formats, and history of searched strings, which enables officers to track a specific criminal associated with a series of crypto transactions. Police can confirm whether a suspect is involved in cryptocurrency transactions and take necessary actions. Our solution will aid law enforcement authorities in combating cybercrime."

Aphasia is a language disorder that is commonly caused by stroke or brain damages, which impairs speech comprehension and production, but cognitive and motor skills are generally unaffected. As a result, there are extreme communication barriers among the affected individuals in their everyday lives. This paper introduces an AI-supported communication system that combines the real-time hand gesture recognition with the text-to-speech features to support aphasic people. The Python based system which is implemented using OpenCV library uses a web camera to record and read the hand gestures, depending on the number of extended fingers. Every gesture is associated with a prepared verbal communication, e.g. one finger means I need water and two fingers I am hungry. The identified gestures are translated into audio both with the offline (pyttsx3) and online (Google Text-to-Speech) engines to provide the flexibility when different network conditions occur. The device is affordable, portable, and very easy to use and it only needs a normal computer and a webcam. It has a modular design whereby one can easily customize gestures and message mappings to suit personal requirements. The future products are to introduce machine learning based on dynamic gesture recognition, speech support in multiple languages and the implementation of the product on the mobile platform to increase its accessibility. The suggested system demonstrates the possibilities of computer and AI. mission to create all-inclusive, low-cost technologies that will contribute much to the quality of life of people with speech and language impairments."

    "abstract": "Stereo images are widely used in many scenarios such as autonomous driving and stereoscopic display. Stereo image super-resolution is a common technique to obtain high-definition stereo images. However, existing methods are mainly designed for fixed scales and cannot smoothly support arbitrary upscaling. To address these problems, this paper proposes a Stereo ImaGe NeurAl Learner (SIGNAL) based on implicit neural representation, which consists of three parts. First, a feature extraction module leveraging the iPASSR architecture to robustly extract hierarchical features from low-resolution stereo images. Second, a novel stereo implicit representation module that explicitly models the inherent geometric consistency and contextual relationships between the two views, enhancing the latent features through view-specific and cross-view interactions. Third, a cross-view decoding module designed to fully exploit the complementary information across views during the image reconstruction process. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets demonstrate that the proposed SIGNAL framework achieves superior performance. The results underscore the effectiveness of our approach in handling arbitrary scaling factors while preserving visual fidelity in stereo image restoration."

This enables a “see-and-point” communication mode for robots: a robot can establish an immediate connection pointing to any other robot it intends to collaborate with in its visual field, without relying on a pre-existing multi-robot network. This on one hand improves the robustness and usefulness of multi-robot systems in uncertain and unstructured environments where network infrastructures are unavailable. On the other hand, it makes the robots' communication behavior tightly coupled with and more supportive of the collaboration tasks in the physical world. We build an end-to-end prototype of SPing and evaluate its performance in both static and mobile scenarios. The results show that SPing can always establish a connection precisely pointing to the target receiver with an average matching rate of 99.58%, and a spatial resolution of 0.3 m<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\sim$</tex-math></inline-formula> 0.5m."

    "abstract": "With the widespread application of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), intrusion detection based on wireless communication traffic has become increasingly critical. While deep learning (DL) models have significantly enhanced anomaly detection accuracy, recent research indicates that they remain vulnerable to adversarial sample attacks, which poses severe threats to the open communication networks used by UAV systems. To address this challenge, an enhanced UAV intrusion detection framework is proposed for defending against adversarial samples, integrating generating adversarial samples with adversarial networks (AdvGAN) and decision boundary reconstruction. Specifically, a convolutional neural network (CNN) is first developed as the baseline intrusion detection model to detect anomalous traffic in UAV wireless communication. Subsequently, to overcome the gradient-dependent perturbation limitations of traditional adversarial attack methods, AdvGAN is employed to analyze real monitored traffic data and generate semantically consistent adversarial samples that retain the intrinsic characteristics of authentic network flow. Finally, a hybrid adversarial-real data training strategy is proposed to dynamically reconstruct the model’s intrusion decision boundaries. This strategy augments the training dataset with AdvGAN-generated adversarial samples, enabling the model to adaptively adjust decision thresholds through iterative backpropagation. On a real-world dataset, the superior performance of proposed method is verified: it maintains high detection accuracy for legitimate traffic while substantially reducing the success rate of adversarial attacks. Experimental results confirm the stealthiness of generated adversarial samples and the robustness of the enhanced detection model, validating the effectiveness of the proposed framework."

    "abstract": "The recent advancement of Bird’s Eye View (BEV) perception algorithms requires extensive, high-quality annotated map data for effective training and deployment in real-world scenarios. However, existing HD map-based auto-labeling methods, like those found in public datasets, face significant issues related to efficiency and accuracy. For instance, the nuScenes dataset reveals considerable misalignment and inconsistency between images and their annotations, with an average reprojection error of approximately 8.03 pixels. Additionally, the dependence on HD maps limits the applicability of these methods for large-scale, real-world auto-labeling. To tackle these challenges, we introduce CAMAv2: a vision-centric approach for Consistent and Accurate Map Annotation. This pipeline primarily utilizes camera inputs to generate precise 3D annotations of static map elements, achieving high reprojection accuracy across all surrounding cameras and maintaining spatiotemporal consistency throughout the entire sequence. Importantly, CAMAv2 annotations show lower reprojection errors compared to the original nuScenes map elements, with errors of 4.96 pixels versus 8.03 pixels. Comprehensive evaluations across various public datasets confirm the feasibility and generalizability of our pipeline in diverse environments, as well as under different weather and lighting conditions."

However, existing studies struggle to achieve high-accuracy long-term predictions from early cycles of battery operation. To address this limitation, this study proposes a physics-informed deep learning framework called physics-controlled differential equation (CDE) for forecasting battery capacity and RUL. The proposed approach integrates a Query-Key-Value neural CDE structure to extract attention-weighted features, effectively capturing essential battery dynamics. Furthermore, a long short-term memory-embedded neural CDE models differential relationships over time, while an empirical model periodically updates physical constraints to refine degradation trends. Experimental validation across multiple datasets demonstrates that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches by accurately reconstructing the entire capacity degradation curve from only a small number of early-cycle measurements, without requiring full-lifecycle capacity labels, while also providing reliable RUL predictions from early cycles. Even when forecasting capacity degradation over the full lifecycle on various datasets, the prediction error remains below 0.04, confirming the method’s robustness and precision."

First, the relationship between the boundaries of additional collision regions arising from the manipulator's EGM and path parameters—such as corner angle, step size, and link length—is analyzed. On this basis, the existing path collision detection algorithm is enhanced to improve path reliability and expand the feasible search space. Furthermore, based on the MDA-RRT* algorithm, improvements are made in terms of constant step size and directional guidance, addressing the issues of inconsistent step sizes caused by the algorithm's pruning process and the inability to constrain the terminal orientation. Finally, simulation and physical experiments are conducted under three distinct scenarios to validate the algorithm's performance. The results demonstrate that the IMDA-RRT* effectively addresses the EGM path planning problem for TCDHMs, showing excellent adaptability in narrow and constrained environments. Compared to existing algorithms, it achieves a higher success rate and faster solving efficiency."

CRAM integrates Software-in-the-Loop (SIL) simulations to construct a performance-based database that captures the operational behavior of the ACS under both internal and external disturbances. Data-driven analysis is then applied to derive a detailed understanding of controller performance and to determine the failure rates of controller components. In addition, a Reliability Block Diagram (RBD) is developed to quantify the contribution of each controller and to estimate system-level reliability over a three-year mission duration. The proposed model identifies the most robust, accurate, and responsive controller with the highest reliability. The ACS design incorporates solar radiation pressure, gravity-gradient torque, and aerodynamic drag as external disturbances, while actuator loss of effectiveness is modeled as an internal disturbance. A tetrahedral reaction wheel configuration is employed, where three wheels provide three-axis control and a fourth wheel serves as redundancy. The evaluated control schemes include a proportional–derivative (PD) controller, an H∞ controller, and two variants of sliding-mode control."

However, in the promising field of human-plant protein comparison, the scarcity of similar protein pairs results in severely imbalanced datasets, causing models to be highly prone to overfitting and exhibiting a bias towards negative samples. Crucially, conventional computational models primarily focus on extracting features from individual proteins in isolation, lacking explicit modeling of the relational mechanisms between protein pairs, and thus fail to capture the functional synergy between paired proteins. To address these dual challenges, this study proposes a dual-pronged framework: (i) the introduction of a Cross-Attention Network (CrossNet) to learn and fuse paired feature representations, thereby enabling explicit modeling of inter-protein relationships; and (ii) the adoption of a hybrid strategy combining Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) with popularity-based dynamic negative sampling to mitigate the issue of extreme positive-negative sample imbalance."

    "abstract": "Breast cancer is the most prevalent health problem affecting women globally, and it has detrimental effects on their personal and professional life in addition to their physical health. Early illness detection can boost recovery and survival rates, reduce complexity, and enhance the efficacy of healthcare. Initial detection of breast cancer, which is the most deadly and common form of the illness, is an excellent example of the benefits of early diagnosis. The initial phase of breast cancer, which is asymptomatic and goes unreported by patients, cannot be identified by conventional analytical methods. Therefore, the adoption of advanced computational techniques and intelligent learning systems is crucial for the prompt detection of illnesses. These models can detect disease before symptoms manifest, avoiding the difficulties encountered by conventional medical diagnostic techniques. This research work creates a new model Multi-Layer Genomic Recognition System (MLGRS) that diagnoses breast cancer more effectively and with less complexity. To enhance the current model, the present study unites advanced preprocessing techniques with hybrid classification methods for gene expression data to predict breast cancer. The performance of the proposed MLGRS is found to be greater than that of the existing approaches such as Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression and Decision Tree."

    "abstract": "Group activity recognition in sports videos is challenging due to complex player interactions. This paper presents a robust framework for volleyball activity recognition using a multimodal approach. The proposed pipeline begins with refined preprocessing, utilizing median and edgepreserving filters to reduce visual noise and emphasize key motion boundaries. Subsequently, YOLOv11 is employed for efficient player localization and tracking, followed by a hybrid feature extraction module. This module integrates handcrafted visual descriptors (HOG, LBP, and SIFT) with motion and posebased cues obtained from MediaPipe and MOCON to capture both appearance and dynamics of athletes. Spatial and temporal dependencies among players are modeled using a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN), which effectively learns team coordination patterns. Furthermore, a Genetic Algorithm (GA) is employed to compress redundant features, resulting in an $80 \\%$ reduction in dimensionality and a notable improvement in recognition performance. Evaluations on a benchmark volleyball dataset demonstrate that our framework achieves a recognition accuracy of $91.8 \\%$, surpassing prior methods while maintaining a fast inference speed of 0.15 s per frame. The system offers a practical balance between computational efficiency and predictive accuracy, making it suitable for realtime sports analytics and coaching applications."

While cyberbullying has been widely studied, the phenomenon of doxing remains underexplored, despite its significant impact on individual privacy, security, and psychological well-being. The review critically highlights research gaps, notably the limited availability of observed and empirical studies addressing doxing practices and their societal outcomes. Furthermore, it investigates the role of data privacy regulations in prohibiting and mitigating doxing, considering the adequacy of existing legal frameworks across jurisdictions. A systematic tabular analysis of current literature is presented to consolidate existing knowledge, followed by a discussion of challenges such as regulatory inconsistencies, enforcement limitations, and emerging technological risks. Future directions are identified, emphasizing the need for cross-disciplinary research, stronger policy interventions, and the integration of technical safeguards within online platforms to counter doxing and its related harms."

    "abstract": "Osteoporosis is a progressive skeletal disease characterized by a steady decline in bone mineral density (BMD) and deterioration of bone microarchitecture, ultimately resulting in fragile bones, higher fracture risk, and impaired quality of life. The current clinical gold standard for diagnosis, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), provides accurate BMD measurements but remains limited by high cost, restricted accessibility, and impracticality for population-level screening. These limitations have encouraged increasing interest in computer-aided diagnostic approaches based on plain radiographs, which are inexpensive, widely available, and non-invasive. In this study, we propose a deep learning framework for stage-wise classification of osteoporosis from knee radiographs, focusing on the clinically significant distinction between Normal, Osteopenia, and Osteoporosis. The framework integrates a robust preprocessing pipeline, transfer learning across multiple state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks, and a novel ensemble strategy that fuses predictions through weighted averaging and a static deep meta-learner. Experimental evaluations on publicly available datasets demonstrate that the ensemble outperforms individual models, achieving higher accuracy and balanced precision-recall scores across all classes. Beyond performance gains, the framework presents a scalable and clinically relevant solution to the limitations of existing diagnostic methods. These findings underscore the potential of ensemble deep learning to strengthen automated osteoporosis detection and enhance clinical decision-making."

Our method introduces two key mechanisms: a computational power factor (CPF) for quantifying device capabilities, and a workload adjustment factor (WAF) for dynamic weight allocation during model aggregation. Experimental validation on real world data (UK Power Networks photovoltaic) shows improvements of 33.3% in prediction error, 5.1% in accuracy, and 58.8% in convergence speed compared to baseline methods.

The natural Aluminosilicate, High-grade zeolite was used in this because cation exchange capacity which liberates ammonium and potassium ions gradually.

Preventing these attacks is crucial for resilient digital infrastructure, a key target in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly SDG 9. This attack can result in data theft, authentication bypass, and even system takeover. SQLi attack techniques continue to evolve, requiring accurate and adaptive detection methods. One promising approach is the use of Bayesian Networks, which can model probabilistic relationships between attack patterns and normal traffic. SQL Injection attack patterns are analyzed through HTTP payloads at the application layer, resulting in two main categories: query character-based patterns and percent encoding patterns. Bayesian Networks are implemented by calculating the probability of URI character occurrence using the Python programming language. Test results demonstrate high detection performance, with a True Positive Rate (TPR) of 99.3% in optimal testing and a False Positive Rate (FPR) of $0 \\%$. The confusion matrix reveals system accuracy ranging from $82.7 \\%$ to $99.7 \\%$, with precision at $100 \\%$. However, variations in TPR occur due to differences in query complexity, such as in the seventh test ($64.4 \\%$) which included all types of attacks. This finding demonstrates the effectiveness of Bayesian Networks in detecting SQL Injection by leveraging dependencies between variables, although challenges remain with certain queries that resemble normal traffic."

This paper is dedicated towards the design of a novel embedded system structure for the secure EVM (Electronic Voting Machine) system, using a blockchain for non-repudiation of data and distributed entity verification. The design approach includes a multi-tiered security posture from hardware level tamper suppression, on the fly vote verification, and dynamic anomaly detection with embedded intelligence. At the heart of the system, a light-weight high-performance embedded controller combined with a secure element and cryptographical co-processor guarantees secure data processing, identity authentication and system integrity. Votes are tokenized and represented as transactions on a blockchain, which preserves end-to-end verification while preserving individual voter secrecy. Its underlying architecture leverages a hybrid consensus mechanism especially adjusted for private or consortium blockchain network to scale out the trustful voting recording and counting. Instant verification is secured with smart contracts and Merkle proof verification and every validated vote is consistently recorded and immutable. Moreover, the machine learning module is contained in the firmware for detecting hardness. This module observes and learns user behavior pattern, user reviewing behavior pattern and packet processing performance over time in order to raise alerts about potential threats such as hardware breakdowns, unauthorized entry attempts or nonconforming voting behaviors, etc., and take actions in order to prevent it. The in-built AI also learns and evolves with regional/ jurisdictional voting patterns, to reduce false positives and increase sensitivity to electoral irregularities. It was experimentally validated in a prototype deployed in an ARM Cortex-M7 embedded board connected with Hyperledger Fabric, displaying real-time transaction throughput fit out for medium-sized election scale."

This work investigates a practical LIS architecture where a small subset of elements is activated and linked to the baseband for sensing purposes. In contrast, most elements remain passive. A multilayer perceptron (MLP), a deep learning-based framework trained on the DeepMIMO dataset, is employed to estimate the optimal reflection beamforming vector from partial channel state information (CSI) obtained through the active elements. To analyze the impact of different optimization strategies, the performance of six optimizers—Lion, Adam, AdamW, NAdam, SGDM, and RMSprop—is examined. The overall system performance is evaluated based on the achievable rate, outage probability, and training time. The findings show that while the Lion optimizer delivers performance that nearly matches an ideal genie-aided system, it requires a longer training period. Conversely, RMSprop requires the least training time but yields the poorest results. Consequently, selecting an appropriate optimizer is crucial for enhancing system performance in wireless networks supported by LIS."

    "abstract": "Accurate diabetes prediction is essential for early intervention and preventative care. This work suggests a unique architecture for the Pima Indian Diabetes Dataset that combines advanced preprocessing, class balancing, and multilevel ensemble learning. Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR), K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), Decision Tree (DT), and Random Forest (RF) were five classifiers evaluated separately; Random Forest obtained 77.9 % accuracy. With 75.9 % accuracy, F1-score 0.615, recall 0.552, and precision 0.696, a stacking ensemble that combined all base learners with Logistic Regression as the meta-learner surpassed Bagging (71.0%) and Boosting (69.8%). These findings show how well ensemble approaches work for early diabetes prediction."

    "abstract": "Cyberbullying has become a pervasive challenge in the digital era, significantly impacting the mental health and social well-being of individuals, particularly among adolescents and young adults. While several approaches have been proposed for cyberbullying detection, existing systems are often limited by their reliance on single-language datasets, binary classification schemes, and lack of interpretability. Moreover, traditional models fail to capture the severity levels of bullying and the emotional context of abusive language. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive cyberbullying detection framework that integrates GloVe embeddings with PCA dimensionality reduction and Logistic Regression as a baseline, further enhanced with transformer-based architectures such as RoBERTa and XLMRoBERTa for multilingual detection. The framework introduces two novel components: severity scoring, which classifies abusive content into mild, moderate, and severe categories, and emotion fusion, which incorporates emotional context (e.g., anger, sadness, joy, fear) into the detection pipeline. To enhance transparency, we employ explainable AI techniques (LIME and SHAP) to highlight word-level contributions to predictions, thereby improving interpretability for end-users and moderators. A real-time Streamlit-based dashboard application is developed, supporting both single-text and bulk CSV analysis, along with visualization tools for sentiment distribution, severity levels, and emotional trends. Experimental evaluation on publicly available cyberbullying datasets demonstrates that our proposed approach achieves significant improvements in accuracy, precision, recall, and F1score compared to traditional machine learning baselines. The results indicate that combining severity analysis, emotion fusion, and explainability not only improves classification performance but also enhances the practical applicability of cyberbullying detection systems in real-world educational and social media environments"

The temporal response function of a scene encodes rich information about depth and light transport, and its accurate reconstruction is critical for various imaging applications. To enable transient recovery from a limited number of measurements, we exploit learned sparse representations in an optimized dictionary basis. We compare multiple sampling strategies in the frequency domain and show that both transient profiles and depth maps can be reconstructed under highly compressed acquisition. Notably, we achieve full transient reconstruction using only 16 modulation frequencies, based on real correlation functions, enabling practical singleshot acquisition through spatial frequency multiplexing."

Traditional mapping methods are often slow and can be biased due to their reliance on thresholds and manual input, leading to challenges like false readings caused by vegetation and active urban environments. The Rapid and Automated Flood Segmentation Through Landsat with Google Earth Engine Using Deep Learning Architecture (AFSGDL) model integrates various sources of remote sensing data, specifically utilising Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery and historical flood vectors from UNOSAT. Pre-processing steps employed radiometric calibration and cloud masking for improved dataset reliability and the Digital Elevation model (DEM). A hybrid deep learning model has been developed that integrates Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for enhanced data analysis and feature extraction performance, and a Residual Swin Transformer Block (RSTB) architecture was developed to capture both local details and broader contextual data. Specialised loss functions were created to mitigate class imbalances in flood and non- flood areas, enhancing overall segmentation accuracy. The following parameters are calculated with existing models MLRFM, INFLOS, and IOERD, compared with the AFSGDL model. Where the parameters are loss and dice, ROC curves analysis, RMSE curves analysis, water depth analysis, and velocity. The loss and dice of the AFSGDL model is 0.12 - 0.95, ROC curves analysis of 0.991, RMSE curves analysis of 0.078, water depth analysis of 13.0, and velocity analysis of 2.7."

    "abstract": "Reading comprehension is a foundation of academic achievement, but students demonstrate vast individual differences in cognitive processing and capacity during text encounters. Most adaptive learning systems are based on fixed heuristics or achievement measures (e.g., quiz performance, reading speed) that do not account for the dynamic process of cognitive load. This work proposes a hybrid deep learning framework integrating Convolutional Neural Networks, Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory, and Attention to overcome these shortcomings. Preprocessing of EEG signals is done by bandpass filtering, removal of artifacts using ICA, and segmentation through a sliding window method. FFT and PSD are utilized for feature extraction, followed by end-to-end learning by the hybrid model. The DEAP dataset, with EEG activity of 32 subjects over 40 trials, is utilized for cognitive classification based on emotions. The designed model is accurate to 92.3% and has a low inference latency, which suits deployment at the edge using TensorFlow Lite. Python-based libraries such as NumPy, SciPy, and MNE are utilized throughout the pipeline. This method extends spatial-temporal feature learning, makes the model easier to interpret, and provides a scalable solution for real-time cognitive monitoring in embedded systems."

This paper introduces QuantumFlow, a web-based platform that addresses these challenges through an accessible drag-and-drop interface for constructing and simulating quantum circuits. The platform provides realtime validation, state visualization, and interactive Bloch-sphere rendering to enable both conceptual exploration and rapid prototyping. Key features include modular subcircuit design, mid-circuit measurements, export to Qiskit, Cirq, and JSON, and hardware-aware transpilation for processors such as IBM's Falcon and Google's Sycamore. Implemented with React and Redux, the platform runs entirely client-side without installation.

    "source": "IEEE",
    "abstract": "Multidimensional array access is a primary performance bottleneck in High-Performance Computing (HPC). Modern compilers typically flatten multi-dimensional index computations into a single offset expression, thereby obscuring the hierarchical invariance inherent in the address calculation that corresponds to the loop nesting structure. This flattening prevents standard optimizations like Loop-Invariant Code Motion (LICM) from being effective. This paper proposes a Hierarchical Address Decomposition (HAD) method, which reconstructs address computations in LLVM into a chained intermediate representation that is isomorphic to the loop nest. This transformation explicitly exposes pointer-level invariants, enabling them to be automatically hoisted by the standard LICM pass. Furthermore, this paper introduces a model-guided promotion strategy that leverages a cost model to balance the benefits of optimization against the overhead of the transformation. Experimental results on SPEC CPU bench-marks (481.wrf and 621.wrf_s) demonstrate that HAD achieves up to a 1.08x speedup, validating its effectiveness and portability for multidimensional array access optimization."

Riders who fail to wear their helmets are responsible for a significant portion of injuries. Meanwhile, large cities continue to see an increase in thefts. A clever system for preventing theft and ensuring the safety of two-wheelers is presented in this work. It uses integrated sensors and computer vision to improve rider safety in advance. Facial recognition feature is integrated by a hybrid algorithm MTCNN, ArcFace, and DeepSORT. That module has a 97.5 percent accuracy rate. It also attains 95.5 percent F1-score, 96.0 percent precision, and 95.0 percent recall. These results surpass those of models that only use ArcFace, which only attain 93.2% accuracy. To identify helmets, the system uses YOLOv8. That approach yields a mean average precision of 96.4 percent at 0.5. It remains strong even when helmets are partially blocked. Rider fatigue is detected using the Eye Aspect Ratio method. This can identify drowsiness in real time with a sensitivity of 94.8%. A touch-based authentication feature provides backup verification. It gives riders safe feedback through vibrations. Vibration sensors can detect any movement without permission. They then use GPS to track the location and turn on theft alerts. Compared to standard systems that need mobile applications, this design is different. Rather, it uses computer vision, onboard controls, and smart sensors to function independently. The prevention of theft and total safety coverage are the objectives of all of this."

This paper presents a comprehensive comparative evaluation of how different optimization algorithms-Adam, RMSprop, Gradient Descent (GD), and Gradient Descent with Momentum- interact with L1 and L2 regularization in a binary classification setting. Using the Fetal Health dataset from Kaggle, the models were trained over 25 epochs with a batch size of 32, and evaluated through accuracy, precision, recall, and Fl-score metrics. The results prove that the Adam optimizer with L1 regularization achieved the highest performance, reaching 94% accuracy, 0.94 weighted precision, 0.94 recall, and 0.94 Fl-score, closely followed by Adam with L2 and RMSprop with L1, both supporting accuracies above 93%. Conversely, pure gradient descent without momentum underperformed, achieving only 58% accuracy with L1 and 77% with L2, highlighting its inefficiency in handling non-convex error landscapes. Incorporating momentum significantly improved GD's stability and performance, achieving accuracies around 89-90%. These results emphasize the constructive collaboration between adaptive optimizers and proper regularization in improving model robustness and convergence speed. Future research will extend these findings to hybrid optimizers, adaptive regularization methods, and transfer learning-based binary classifiers."

However, as light refracts through rain streaks, background information is prone to being damaged. It makes texture restoration harder. To overcome these problems, we propose a Progressive Dual Branches Guidance Network for Single Image Deraining The network consists of a dynamic texture reconstruction module and a progressive cross-guidance module. The dynamic texture reconstruction network is based on dynamic convolution and Transformer. It adopts a U-Net architecture, with dynamic convolution modules equipped in both the encoder and the decoder. This setup avoids detail loss that may occur when using fixed convolution kernels to process complex backgrounds. Meanwhile, it can adaptively adjust the shape and weights of convolution kernels according to the input image features to obtain superior feature representations. The progressive guidance network extracts background texture features from an auxiliary network to guide the backbone network in forming rich feature representations, thereby restoring more authentic background information. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques."

Conventional deep learning approaches often have difficulty in embracing the non-Euclidean structural relations and temporal dynamics inherent in this data and therefore become ineffective in dealing with large-scale activity recognition tasks. To overcome this barrier, we propose a new spatiotemporal model based on Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to particularly support big data analysis in smart cities. Compared to conventional hybrid models, our approach has a dual-layer dynamic graph building mechanism that naturally embeds the temporal dynamics of activities and spatial interactions among urban objects at the same time. Moreover, we design an adaptive attention mechanism inside the GCN to give more importance to key spatiotemporal interactions, thus enhancing the accuracy and robustness of recognition in complex urban environments. Compared with state-of-the-art approaches, experimental results over real-world smart city datasets prove better throughput, scalability, and accuracy. As such, this establishes an efficient route towards intelligent urban management and real-time decision-making for smart city systems."

One major technique used is Natural Language Processing (NLP), which is used to analyze regulatory documents, compliance reports, and updates in the law. With the financial industry one of the most regulated industries, and with ever-growing complex and shifting regulations, the traditional manual methods of compliance are no longer efficient nor scalable. By using NLP, financial institutions can automate the process of scanning and understanding large amounts of regulatory texts, which can help them to adapt to new laws and regulations faster and more accurately. The application of NLP enables relevant insights to be extracted from regulatory materials to help ensure compliance for regulatory firms whilst reducing the risk of human error. This paper explains how AI-powered NLP tools greatly increase the efficiency and reliability of compliance frameworks, eventually resulting in the more secure and well-regulated financial services operations."

Drawing from an explorative research approach and following a phenomenology research, six participants comprising educators and students were interviewed on their perceptions, experiences and challenges. A positive sentiment was observed regarding personalised learning as well as the role of technology, including AI, in the teaching and learning process, while considerable constraints including insufficient funding, support infrastructures and lack of professional development of teachers were reported. As applied and implemented approaches, thus, both integration of technology and industry partnerships were perceived as enablers."

    "abstract": "Glaucoma is still a leading cause of permanent blindness, and artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to be used to detect the disease at an early stage. Nevertheless, the current constraints of ophthalmic datasets in the development of deep learning (DL) models are devastating because they are small, unheterogeneous, and cross-sectional in nature. To address these data-centric bottlenecks, this paper suggests a new framework to be implemented with the help of generative AI. We present a procedure by which large-scale, high-fidelity syn- thetic data of color fundus photographs and optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans might be produced using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). This is not only a way of overcoming data scarcity and bias in representation, but also allows the synthesis of longitudinal data to model the progression of a disease. Such enhanced datasets will be trained on the models of advanced DLs: a Vision Transformer (ViT) to detect the early signs and a spatiotemporal Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) network to predict the progression. Such models should perform much better than models trained using real data alone especially with respect to their extrapolation to a wide range of real-world clinical environments. This framework will generate credible, precise, and fair AI tools by incorporating explainable AI (XAI) methods, which will lead to customized and predictive glaucoma care."

    "abstract": "Cyber attacks are becoming more sophisticated and happening more often. Traditional honeypot systems like rule-based methods depend on manually defined patterns requiring significant human effort for analysis and struggle to detect novel attacks thus frequently falling short in identifying sophisticated intrusion patterns and ensuring timely responses. To address these limitations, An Al-powered honeypot system is proposed to proactively detect, classify, and analyze cyber-attacks using machine learning techniques and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network algorithms. By simulating common attack vectors such as DDoS, brute-force login attempts, and malware probes, the system collects real-time data which is then analyzed using autoencoder-based feature extraction and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for multi-class classification of intrusion types. Furthermore, the system automatically sends email notifications in real time to alert relevant cybersecurity personnel upon the detection of malicious activity. All captured attack data is securely stored in a computer database for further analysis and forensic investigation. The Al-driven approach significantly enhances early threat detection, enables faster and more accurate incident response, and provides a valuable repository of attack information for modern network environments."

While in privacy zones, non-visual sensors such as PIR, ultrasonic, temperature, and sound sensors detect occupancy without visual intrusion. An LED indicator notifies on-site staff when human presence is detected, and alerts are triggered automatically during after-hours activity.

    "abstract": "With the transformation of the global energy structure, wind power—an important component of clean energy—has seen increasingly widespread development and application, particularly in cold climate regions. However, harsh winter meteorological conditions such as low temperatures and high humidity frequently lead to wind turbine icing, which severely affects wind power generation efficiency and threatens the safe and stable operation of the power grids. To address the challenge of icing state identification in mountainous wind farms, this paper proposes an innovative method based on a wind speed– temperature coupling (STC) feature and multi-model stacking ensemble learning. By constructing the STC feature in accordance with physical mechanisms, the synergistic effects of temperature and wind speed across different temperature ranges are effectively quantified. Four heterogeneous models—Random Forest, XGBoost, LSTM, and Transformer—are integrated to significantly improve identification accuracy. Validation was conducted using three winters of monitoring data from a high-altitude, cold-region wind farm in central China, and the results show that the proposed method achieved an accuracy of 90.8% and demonstrated strong generalization capability. This method not only improves the accuracy of wind turbine icing detection, but also provides effective technical support for the intelligent operation and maintenance of wind farms and the safe operation of power grids."

Among its attributes are its round-the-clock accessibility, simple backend integration, and reinforcement learning for continuous learning. Performance evaluation shows reaction times have decreased from 5 to 20 minutes to 1 to 5 seconds, resolution rates have improved by 10 to 20%, and average user satisfaction has increased from 3.2 to 4.7 out of 5.

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) is a distributed learning setting that can handle the privacy data challenge. However, FL encounters two main bottlenecks: communication cost and Non Independent and Identically Distributed (Non-IID) data. FedProto can mitigate the communication cost by exchanging the class prototypes and works very well. Conventional FedProto however uses a static hyperparameter set and pays fixed local training parameters on all clients, hence it cannot adapt to client data distributions or the states of model training, leading to the potential degradation of the global model.To cope with this bottleneck, we propose a DRL-FedProto: a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithm to adaptively tune FedProto hyperparameters. In federated training, we consider the multi-client hyperparameter configuration as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). To this end, we designed a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent that, observing the global state, receives personalized local hyperparameters for each client in each round of communications: local batch size, local epoch and loss weight. The agent's objective is to learn a valid policy that maximizes the last converged performance accuracy of the global model trained on the Non-IID dataset. We simulated the Non-IID scenario on several public datasets: Australian, Breast-Cancer and Diabetes. Experimental results show that our DRL-FedProto algorithm outperforms the FedProto baseline and achieves the largest performance improvement of up to 8.5%. However, by an in-depth ablation study, we also highlight that the elements of the reward themselves, most importantly the stability penalty, are very sensitive to dataset statistics and can only be relatively well parameterized, which is a key insight for future work."

This paper investigates frequency stability and system resilience in a photovoltaic (PV)-integrated 22 kV distribution system in Papua New Guinea (PNG), focusing on droop-based grid-forming inverter (GFMI) and enhanced grid-following inverter (EGFLI) control strategies. A 2.50 MW PV farm with a partial power converter (PPC) and perturb-and-observe maximum power point tracking (MPPT) was modeled in MATLAB/Simulink. Grid strength variation was introduced by tuning feeder resistance and reactance to emulate short-circuit ratios (SCRs) of a strong grid (SCR=15), a weak grid (SCR=5), and a very weak grid (SCR=2), including islanded scenarios. The simulation results show that droop-based GFMI consistently maintained frequency deviations within ±0.03 Hz and rapidly resynchronized under severe disturbances, while phase-locked loop (PLL)-based EGFLI exhibited oscillations and longer settling times. The PPC enhanced DC-link stability and ensured robust PV output under real irradiance and temperature data. The findings confirm that GFMI control provides superior frequency stability and system resilience for low-inertia grids, making it a promising replacement for synchronous generators in very weak and unstable distribution networks."

    "abstract": "This research addresses the growing concern related to energy consumption in robotic systems. The increasing diversity of robots and their applications across various industries requires new energy-efficient strategies to decrease operational costs and reduce environmental impact. This paper presents a linear regression-based approach to reduce energy consumption in robotics. The method is to use linear regression in the prediction of appropriate control parameters and to investigate the possibility of integrating simulation into the system to further reduce energy consumption. The challenge is the uncertain and dynamic nature of energy consumption during robotic systems operations, which limits the efficiency of standard control measures. This paper presents a linear regression model that was trained on large sets of data that contain operational parameters in robotic systems and associated energy consumption measures. This linear regression model predicts those operational parameters that would minimize energy consumption while meeting the desired performance. The primary contribution was that the linear regression generated predictive controls that could greatly reduce energy consumption compared to standard operational controls. Through our investigation, we affirm that linear regression is a practical and implementable machine learning approach for real energy optimization in robotics. Through the operational changes resulting from intelligence in altered control parameters, the potential for savings in energy consumption and improving operational efficiency is significant."

An optimization scheduling problem of a microgrid is addressed by utilizing the proposed credit score demand response in this paper. Based on price incentives and user credit, demand response is regulated, and the optimization is performed using a greedy algorithm that dispatches the power among the renewable energy, micro gas turbines, the energy storage and users. By comparing and analyzing the operation results under three typical working conditions which are summer sunny days, winter overcast days and island operation, the system operation and demand response reliability are evaluated. By updating user credit through a differentiated incentive mechanism, the participation of high-credit users can be effectively enhanced and benefited, while constraints on low-credit users are formed and default risks are accordingly reduced, thus enhancing the reliability of microgrid demand response and providing more economic benefits for high-credit."

    "abstract": "Image segmentation is a critical step in image processing and analysis, with the aim of dividing images into mutually exclusive regions in order to extract objects of interest. Conventional thresholding, region-based, and edge-driven methodologies are inherently vulnerable to noise, lighting variations, and texture complexity, resulting in suboptimal robustness. Whilst the incorporation of swarm intelligence algorithms into segmentation can enhance accuracy, such approaches frequently encounter challenges such as slow convergence and susceptibility to local optima.To address these issues, this paper proposes an image segmentation method based on the Improved Falcon Optimization (IFO)-2D Otsu algorithm. Specifically, in the exploration phase, IFO introduces random solutions to improve the global search ability and avoid falling into local optimum. During the exploitation phase, a variable-step mutation operator based on population entropy is designed to enhance the local search capabilities of IFO. The experimental findings demonstrate that, in comparison with conventional swarm intelligence methodologies such as the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Aquila Optimization (AO), this approach leads to substantial enhancements in convergence speed, accuracy, and robustness in the context of multi-threshold grayscale image segmentation."

The study proposes DAGNet-X, a generative adversarial network with dual attention together with a cross-modality transformer classifier that fulfils these requirements in cross-disease detection using noisy chest radiographs. Proposed architecture takes an initial step in using the Dual-Attention GAN to parallel reduce noise in the images and enhance features related to the disease by using channel attention and spatial attention. The denoised representations are subsequently passed into residual CNN encoder and a transformer-based classification head which allows the contextual comprehension of fine-grained lesion patterns across image patches. The model has been tested on the NIH ChestX-ray14 radiography and has performed outstandingly well, its overall accuracy is 95.1 percent, F1-score 93.5 percent, and ROC-AUC 98.1 percent. Due to the contrast of certain traditional CNN and DenseNet-based models, disease-wise, the AUC scores were better with DAGNet-X being overall better in AUC scores with values of 0.968 and 0.944 being disease-wise and cardiomegaly and atelectasis, respectively. The explainability score of the suggested model was also quite high (0.91) due to the incorporation of SHAP and Grad-CAM visualization techniques. In spite of that, DAGNet-X was only 3.3ms per image and thus has the potential to be deployed on a real-time device. This indicates that the performance of the DAGNet-X can be recommended as an effective and clear-cut approach to automated diagnosis of chest diseases. Its clean up capacity with the denoising improvement of clinically significant patterns presents an excellent progression in smart medical imaging systems."

By integrating multi-scale U-Net models with channel-attention and spatial-attention mechanisms, the system generates high-fidelity mpMRI images representing patterns of interest for prostate cancer. A two-attention discriminator and Wasserstein adversarial training ensure anatomical fidelity and diversity of the synthesized data, addressing data scarcity and enhancing segmentation model strength. In reality, a segmentation network that integrates synthetic data and attention-based subnetworks demonstrates remarkable gains in correctly delineating tumors, particularly in challenging and complex cases. Quality assurance entails detailed quantitative evaluations, radiologist-led assessments, and statistical reviews to ensure the clinical significance and reliability of the synthetic data set. The methodology involves curriculum learning, uncertainty estimations, and interpretability tools that enable reliable model predictions and expert reviews efficiently.

    "abstract": "In online trademark infringements a fundamental challenge is the heterogeneous modality of the data, involving semi-structured textual claims as well as unstructured visual features. It is challenging to treat the multimodal data in a unified way, and there is a need for methods which address and combine different kinds of data cohesively. Most of the conventional models are restricted to one-to-one pair-wise matching, which is not desirable in some real-word tasks (e.g., trademark infringement), where a single product may have multiple variations. In this study, to design a novel lightweight ensemble-framework, E-Commerce IP Shield, that incorporates RNN architecture to leverage image-based features and textual claim information for the detection of trademark-infringement pertaining to online platforms. The motivation of this work is to improve the vector representation of the utilized annotation algorithm by exploiting the complementary advantages between CNNs and RNNs (sequential text). Our suggested model obtained the total average accuracy of 99.24%, this result shows our model achieve better accuracy from other traditional Models."

The controller generates the Pulse-Width Modulation (PWM) signals used by the electronic speed controller by processing the reference speed input and providing constant voltage and current feedback. The proposed system provides improved steady-state accuracy, an improved response, and better disturbance rejection compared to the traditional methods by learning the nonlinear aspects of the motor and adapting to load, supply voltage, and other external disturbances. The inference mechanism used is lightweight and executed near the motor to minimize response time, and hybrid fallback logic helps maintain stability and safety by utilizing conventional methods as fallback in case of anomalous outputs."

    "abstract": "Large parallax images with depth variations remain a persistent challenge in image stitching. Despite numerous attempts by warping-based methods, the results often fall short of expectations. This paper presents a novel large parallax image stitching algorithm based on spatial distance-residual constrained warping. The approach begins by dividing the target image into superpixel grids and determining the optimal homography for each grid by evaluating the contribution of feature points based on their spatial distance to the grid center and homography residual consistency. Additionally, spatial gradient complexity and homography residual consistency confidence are introduced to adaptively adjust the contribution weights of local geometric distance and homography residual consistency using the softmax function. Finally, a strategy based on Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) for outlier removal is proposed. This approach refines the selection of inliers through an improved bidirectional projection error criterion, thereby enhancing the accuracy of feature matching. Experimental results demonstrate that the algorithm accurately aligns large parallax images with depth, outperforming state-of-the-art stitching methods."

The EBMs, which are a type of generalized additive models that automatically identify interactions, are most appropriate to represent non-linear relationships between monetary supply, interest rates, unemployment, and commodity prices as the independent variables and inflation as the dependent variable. The analysis also quantifies the contribution of each variable to the trends on inflation by incorporating SHAP (SHapley Additive Explanations), which makes the analysis interpretable to policy-makers and economists. These findings indicate that the EBMs perform as well as the developed black-box models in relation to forecasting; therefore, they are suitable in economic policy settings. The model emphasizes the prevalence of the impact of energy price shocks and the state of the labor market in recent increases in inflation, and finds the lagged impact of monetary tightening. This transparent method based on AI provides a strong paradigm of monitoring inflation, allowing making macroeconomic decisions based on evidence and enhancing trust in the application of machine learning to economic analysis."

The proposed model is formulated using mixed-integer secondorder cone programming, which relaxes the AC optimal power flow (ACOPF) problem considering a 24-h scheduling horizon with 5-min intervals and the operational constraints of both the distribution network and the BEBs. Numerical simulation results indicate that BEBs absorb surplus PV-generated power during the day to meet their transportation requirements and discharge the minimum amount required in the evening, which is sufficient to alleviate voltage violations and line congestion. This suggests the feasibility of an operational strategy that ensures responsiveness to grid conditions, as well as the minimization of energy losses from discharging and guaranteeing scheduled bus services."

This survey synthesizes jailbreak research from 2023–2025, covering attack methods, defense strategies, and evaluation frameworks. Jailbreak techniques are grouped into five main categories: prompt-based injections, role-play conditioning, multi-turn dialogue, multilingual or multimodal exploits, and optimization-driven pipelines. We also examine discovery methods such as human red teaming and automated attacker systems (e.g., AutoJailbreak, LLMStinger), and review defense mechanisms including supervised fine-tuning (SFT), reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), adversarial fine-tuning, and output or pipeline filtering. Standardized benchmarks—such as PromptBench, JailbreakBench, and multimodal evaluation suites—are analyzed in terms of reproducibility, coverage, and robustness testing. Persistent issues of generalization, reproducibility, and scalability are discussed, along with tradeoffs between safety alignment and model utility. This paper provides an up-to-date reference clarifying the evolving landscape of jailbreak attacks and defenses in LLMs."

Two primary factors that influence a mobile user to switch network connections are their mobility and changing network conditions. An efficient vertical handover solution can enable the seamless transfer of an ongoing user's connection to a better-suited network. This paper proposes an intelligent, optimized vertical handover decision algorithm with a two-phase approach. First, a feasible network category (i.e., small cell or macro cell) is determined based on user speed. This phase ensures fast-moving users do not experience handover abnormalities during communication. Then, an optimal target node is selected from this feasible set using a hybrid multi-criteria decision-making approach. Second, a dynamic <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\epsilon$</tex-math></inline-formula>-greedy-based Q-learning technique is employed to learn the near-optimal handover triggering point, ensuring timely and successful handover execution.

In this work, we report the fabrication of a barium titanate nanowire (BTOnws)-doped poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) composite TENG, designed to enhance mechanical robustness and electrical output. The optimized TENG exhibits stable and superior output performance including open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 280 V, short-circuit current (ISC) of 12 μA, and power density of 1.45 W/m2. The effects of device structural on output performance are systematically investigated. Environmental stability tests reveal that the TENG maintained stable voltage and current outputs across a wide temperature/humidity range and over 10,000 contact–separation cycles and that the output attenuation of this TENG is superior to that of the previously reported PVDF-based TENG. Furthermore, we verify its power supply capability by lighting up 52 LEDs and fabricated a new TENG-integrated table tennis bat for wireless position detection. The sensing system utilize a two-stage amplification circuit to overcome the high output impedance of TENGs, achieving accurate localization of ball impacts with only nine sensing units. This study not only provides insights into optimizing TENG structural and environmental resilience but also highlights their potential in electronic devices, sports analytics, and intelligent sensing networks."

    "abstract": "Optical circuit switching provides high-capacity and low-latency data transmission capabilities. A Clos network is well known as a class of non-blocking switching networks. A prior study addressed designing a three-stage twisted and folded Clos network (3TF), which has a larger switching network size, i.e., the number of terminals connected to the network, than its two-stage variants. That study used a sufficient condition for strict-sense non-blocking (SNB) in 3TF to solve an optimization design problem. However, this condition may be stricter than necessary to guarantee strict-sense non-blocking, suggesting that by using the necessary and sufficient condition, the constraints can likely be relaxed, allowing for configurations with a larger switching network size. No study has addressed the necessary and sufficient condition for SNB in the whole 3TF. A past study derived the SNB condition for the three-stage folded Clos (3F), the basis of 3TF, assuming that connections within the same first- and second-stage group loop back no further than the second stage. Its necessary and sufficient condition in the general case, however, remains unexamined, despite an initial study on the SNB condition for 3F. This paper proposes a design model of 3TF based on the necessary and sufficient condition for strict-sense non-blocking. We derive and prove the necessary and sufficient condition for strict-sense non-blocking in the whole 3TF. The proposed design model considers two cases: one where no blocking is allowed and another where the blocking probability does not exceed a given admissible threshold, based on our derived necessary and sufficient condition for strict-sense non-blocking in 3TF. We formulate the problem based on the necessary and sufficient condition to obtain the configuration of the proposed model that maximizes the switching network size. We theoretically show that the maximum switching network size obtained by solving the proposed model is always larger than or equal to that obtained by solving the existing 3TF design model. Numerical results show that the proposed model achieves a larger switching network size than the existing 3TF design model."

    "abstract": "Radiative Transfer Models (RTMs) are pivotal in remote sensing and data assimilation, providing simulations of satellite-measured radiances and corresponding Jacobians—matrices that quantify how radiative quantities change in response to variations in atmospheric or surface parameters. These Jacobians lie at the heart of variational data assimilation and drive a wide range of inverse modeling applications. Although traditional RTMs yield high-fidelity results, they are computationally intensive, which is increasingly problematic given the high spatial, temporal, and spectral resolutions measured by modern sensors. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have led to AI-derived “fast” RTMs that substantially accelerate forward predictions, (e.g., brightness temperatures). However, accurately estimating and stabilizing AI-derived Jacobians remains a key challenge. In this paper, we present a new AI-CRTM framework based on a Residual Neural Network (ResNet), augmented by physical constraints using the reference Jacobians from the traditional Community Radiative Transfer Model (CRTM). By leveraging residual connections, the proposed approach mitigates vanishing gradients and captures complex, multi-scale dependencies in radiative transfer physics. Physical constraints are applied during training to align the learned partial derivatives with trusted RTM references, thus ensuring physically consistent Jacobians. The AI_CRTM was initially trained and tested for simulated measurements from the Advanced Technology Microwave Sounder (ATMS) in global clear-sky conditions. Forward-model accuracy is accessed through comparisons with both CRTM-simulated radiances and high-spectral-resolution line-by-line simulations from the MonoRTM model. The results demonstrate that incorporating these constraints, alongside ResNet’s residual structure, significantly improves both forward prediction accuracy and Jacobian fidelity. This hybrid strategy addresses ill-posed issues in AI Jacobian inference, broadens applicability to different atmospheric scenarios, and paves the way for rapid and robust data assimilation."

    "abstract": "Deep learning models, especially hybrid models combining convolutional neural networks (CNN) and Transformer, introduce new ideas for hyperspectral image (HSI) classification. However, the complex structure and high spectral dimension of HSI data often affects classification accuracy and computational complexity. Therefore, a novel lightweight CNN-Transformer network (LCTNet) model is proposed. LCTNet consists of three core modules designed to improve HSI classification performance while maintaining a lightweight structure. The spectral extraction-dimension reduction module extracts essential spectral features from the hyperspectral data, simultaneously reducing data dimensions to decrease the computational load for subsequent processing. The spatial-spectral feature marking module then enhances crucial spatial and spectral features, facilitating the efficient fusion and utilization of spatial-spectral information. Meanwhile, the dynamic sparse transformer module dynamically adjusts the proportion of attention sparsity, which reduces redundant computation but also preserves critical spectral-spatial global dependencies. These three modules enable LCTNet to effectively improve the classification accuracy and reduce the complexity. Experiments demonstrate that LCTNet achieves overall accuracy of 99.31%±0.26, 99.42%±0.13, 98.13%±0.15, and 98.90%±0.05 on four public datasets, respectively. Compared with nine other methods, LCTNet attains almost all the highest accuracy with relatively low computational complexity. Additionally, the ablation experiment also further verified the function of each module of LCTNet."

A trilinear model of the device is then developed using basic principles of mechanics and dimensional analysis and the results of a comprehensive parametric FE simulation. The trilinear model is used to perform conductor breakage simulation of an existing 132 kV transmission line system. The results show that the proposed device can prevent damage to suspension towers and is well-suited to enhance the reliability of new and existing transmission line systems."

    "abstract": "Safety-critical cyber-physical systems require rigorously verifiable specifications, yet natural language (NL) requirements introduce ambiguity and defects. While Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) expresses complex real-time constraints, manual NL-to-MTL translation is labor-intensive and error-prone. Existing single-agent LLM approaches like TR2MTL struggle with semantic ambiguity and lack automated refinement mechanisms. This paper proposes DSVA (Deconstruct-Synthesize-Verify-Analyze), a multi-agent framework with diagnostic-driven iterative refinement. DSVA deploys specialized agents: Deconstruct parses NL into semantic sketches; Synthesize generates MTL formulae; Verify controls iteration via back-translation and similarity checking; and Analyze diagnoses failures to guide refinement. A phase-specific Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mechanism enhances contextual understanding. Evaluation on the TR2MTL dataset across four LLMs shows DSVA achieves 85.6% mean accuracy, with GPT-4 reaching 90.9%, a 17.99 percentage point improvement over the TR2MTL baseline (72.91%). Comprehensive ablation studies reveal synergistic component interactions: RAG contributes +15.1% when combined with iteration, iterative refinement contributes +14.4% when combined with RAG, yielding a +7.6pp synergy bonus beyond additive effects (14.3pp→21.9pp). Even the weakest full DSVA configuration (Gemini-2.5-flash: 75.8%) surpasses the baseline. The framework’s consistent cross-model performance gains validate its architectural benefits: specialized agent division of labor, automated iteration control, and diagnostic refinement, providing a potentially more reliable solution for automated requirements formalization in safety-critical systems."

    "abstract": "In this paper, an LCC-LCC compensated simultaneous wireless power and data transfer (SWPDT) system is proposed to realize load-independent constant voltage (CV) output and suppress the power carrier frequency and high-frequency interference of the data transfer channel. Power is transferred via a pair of DD coils while data is directly injected into and extracted from one single D-coil, and the additional trap inductor is omitted. Combined with the characteristics of conventional LCC compensation network, a specially designed LCC compensation topology is utilized on the receiving side, both for CV output regulation and high-frequency interference suppression. The single D-coil is fully compensated by the compensation capacitors at the power carrier frequency, inhibiting the power carrier interference significantly. The performance of the power is analyzed, and the condition of the CV output regulation is provided. The mechanism of the interference suppression is explored, and the influence of the circuit parameters on the noise suppression is also discussed. It is proven that the CV output with high-quality data transfer can be obtained in the proposed system. Finally, an experimental prototype with 104.5 V output voltage and 200 kbps data rate is designed to verify the feasibility of the proposed system."

Information intrusion, inefficiency, and interoperability are typically issues with traditional centralized systems. To address these problems, this article proposes a decentralized digital health passport system based on blockchain technology. The system enables patients to save their healthcare history safely on a blockchain that is accessible to the authorized healthcare providers in the country. The patients are given unique identifiers such as the passport numbers that are associated with their mobile numbers to access control through OTP. The system uses the decentralized and immutable character of blockchain in place of unauthorized access, tampering, or data leakage, as well as, guarantee data availability throughout the country. It also uses enhanced encryption technology to prevent sensitive information and multi-factor authentication to enhance security. The following paper will outline the system architecture, present the processes of its functioning, and explain how it is likely to influence healthcare data management. The suggested solution is a safe, scalable, and easy-to-use system of managing patient data within a digital healthcare environment."

To address these issues, this study develops Adaptive Energy-Efficient Communication Architecture (AE2CA) that combines 5G network slicing, edge computing, energy-aware routing, and reinforcement learning-based resource allocation and Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) and LPW A optimal planning to dynamically trade off energy efficiency and Quality of Service (QoS). The designed framework allows the IoT nodes to selectively switch to both an active and inactive state and intelligently utilize the spectrum control and reduce signalling overhead to provide a reduction in overall power consumption without compromising connectivity and throughput. The datasets that will be used to evaluate the system include the CityPulse Smart City 10 T dataset with anticipated outcomes being minimized energy use -up to 30–40 percent, increased network life and enhanced scalability of massive IoT systems in 5G and above."

    "abstract": "The surging growth of video content in education, companies and media has created the necessity of powerful instruments that can be used to analyze and gain insight into long-length video. In many cases, users lack time and/or cannot access the most important materials of video lectures, meetings, or interviews due to language barriers. Although automated transcription tools do exist in the market, they are in many cases restricted to a single language, lack the option of summarization as an option, and lack quality recordings, which means that a user uses a combination of applications. In this paper, a new integrated video-to-text multilingual summarization system is discussed. The end-to-end model involves the use of an effective pipeline to translate, summarize, and transcribe video into text. It is designed in the system to transcribe video through the Whisper automatic speech recognition model, which gives users accurate and robust transcriptions irrespective of different accents and acoustic characteristics. The BART-Large-CNN transformer model will be used to summarize the transcription into an abstract, and its definition objective was to produce an abstract that is coherent and contextually relevant. The combination of these sophisticated features in one user-friendly application is a major solution to the scalability of the system as it facilitates global usability by creating end state summaries in more than 100 languages. A web-based interface is also included in the application and provides the user with the ability to set the length of the summaries, compare the summarized output with the source text and save the output in a variety of different formats. The outcomes of the experiment demonstrate the ability of our proposed system to retrieve significant information using video data much more quickly with reduced language barrier. In general, our study confirms the combination of transformer-based models, which are efficient, scalable, inclusive, and offer a productivity increase to a global audience, and have potential opportunities to be applied in real-time meeting summaries and processing vast volumes of content."

Presently in the UK, deep social, economic, and regional inequalities intersect with the decarbonisation agenda. Achieving Net Zero requires not only technological innovation but also the transformation of social and economic systems that govern energy, housing, health, and local economies. In rising to the challenge, JUST-Systems programme applies transdisciplinary and whole-systems approaches to understand and intervene in these interconnected challenges, drawing on Critical Systems Heuristics (CSH) and participatory modelling through the MHORES platform. Working across five diverse UK case studies, the project co-develops actionable pathways with local stakeholders that link decarbonisation with social justice, fuel poverty reduction, and community wellbeing. By situating research in real-world contexts—from housing retrofit to local energy systems to social care—the project is developing evidence and methods for integrating fairness, inclusion, and capacity building into national Net Zero policy.

In this paper, a maximum spanning tree is leveraged to get an edge based encoding scheme that yields short chromosomes with reduced alphabets.

While conventional OCR systems provide reliable results for printed documents, they often struggle with handwritten scripts, degraded scans, and complex layouts. Recent advances in deep learning and hybrid recognition frameworks have addressed these challenges by integrating multiple recognition engines and contextual postprocessing. This paper proposes a dual-framework OCR system that leverages PaddleOCR for structured printed text and a hybrid EasyOCR-Tesseract pipeline for handwritten recognition. To further enhance interpretability, the extracted text is semantically processed using the Gemini 2.5 Flash API, enabling context-aware querying and interaction. The framework was evaluated using printed contracts, receipts, and handwritten samples, with accuracy assessed via Word Error Rate (WER) and Character Error Rate (CER). Results demonstrate a 10-15% improvement in handwritten recognition accuracy compared to baseline OCR systems, highlighting the effectiveness of combining OCR engines with semantic models for real-world applications."

To validate our proposed model, I run simulations for a week's worth of transactions using actual data from three popular cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Binance Smart Chain. Variables such as the memory pool's queue time, memory pool's response time, mining pool's response time, system throughput, and arrival rate are all part of the measured performance.

Traditional SGG methods rely on fully supervised training, requiring annotated datasets for new objects and predicates. They also ignore subject-object directionality, generating inappropriate predicates for the subject. In this paper, we propose a novel SGG method that combines a pretrained vision-language object detector with a lightweight relationship inference module. The detector performs object detection by leveraging knowledge from extensive image-text pairs. The inference module projects the object representations into distinct subject and object embeddings and selects relevant object candidates per subject. It then generates directional relationship representations and predicts predicates by selecting appropriate subject-object pairs and comparing them with predicate embeddings. The proposed method improves mR@20 by about 14% over the state-of-the-art methods on the Visual Genome dataset and shows qualitative results that better distinguish subject and object roles."

This paper presents a practical application of an encrypted cloud file sharing method that fuses Waters11 CP-ABE based encryption and Federated Learning based anomaly detection. Our system is based on the hybrid AES-256-GCM and CP-ABE encryption, in which only symmetric keys are encrypted using the attribute-based encryption, minimizing computational costs while maintaining fine-grained access control. We use a federated learning architecture operated by logistic regression with trimmed mean aggregation to identify abnormal access patterns according to location, device, temporal and departmental factors. The system's encryption throughput scales from 101 MB/sec to 325 MB/sec for larger files. It supports federated learning anomaly detection, processing 1.45 million requests per second with a latency of 0.69 microseconds, achieving 96.7% accuracy with a 6.1% false positive rate, and supports 20 concurrent users. We test the system with a synthetic dataset of 10,000 events and 25 simulated clients with 15 percent anomalous patterns. The implementation illustrates the practice of secure cloud sharing of files with context-aware access control and intelligent anomaly detection."

It is suggested that a supply chain predictive analytics framework based on pagewise supply chain optimisation is developed on the basis of recent paradigm-shifting machine learning models that include Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT), Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), TabNet, and NGBoost. It uses historical sales and logistics data as well as supplier networks to dynamically predict demand, highlight risks in the supply chain, and adapt inventory levels using advanced deep learning and probabilistic modeling techniques. TFT is designed for interpretable multi-horizon demand forecasting, GNNs capture relational dependencies among supply nodes, TabNet enables trustworthy decision making over structured tabular datasets, and NGBoost enables uncertaintyaware risk assessment. The part comes with a real-time dashboard visualisation and ERP connection, which means that data-driven decisions can be made at scale. The experimental evaluation demonstrates considerable improvements in prediction quality, cost and agility over the state- of-the-art approaches. This study presents a new, understandable and scalable AIbased supply chain decision support system that ushers in a new generation of predictive logistics."

    "abstract": "The paper discusses the use of smart contracts based on blockchain in the insurance sector in terms of improving transparency, security, and efficiency in the process of policy management. In the case of the automated claims processing through the application of smart contracts, the study shows how blockchain technology can simplify the claims verification and approval procedure with the involvement of humans and mistakes minimized. The presence of smart contracts with set conditions makes smart contract transparent as everyone can be able to access unchangeable terms of the contract and the blockchain is decentralized, preventing fraud and data integrity. The study utilizes the Ethereum smart contracts, which are created with the help of Solidity program language, as the main instrument of automatizing and insuring processes. It is this example of a combination of blockchain technology and automated processes that will result in faster claims processing, reduced administrative expenses, and increased customer satisfaction. Generally, and throughout the paper, the challenges that blockchain-based solutions can address have the capacity to enhance the insurance industry in the context of enhancing the efficiency of the operations, as well as increasing trust due to transparency and security of the processes involved."

However, current MTO algorithms face challenges of slow convergence and a tendency to get trapped in local optimal solutions when dealing with complex tasks. To address these issues, this paper proposes an Adaptive Multi-Task Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm based on Gene Conversion, aiming to enhance the performance of multi-task optimization. This algorithm integrates inter-task learning strategies, parameter adaptive strategies, and gene conversion strategies. By transferring search experience through difference terms, dynamically adjusting learning probabilities, and promoting positive knowledge transfer, it broadens the search scope, enhances global exploration capabilities, and effectively mitigates negative knowledge transfer. This research provides a new perspective for solving the current challenges faced by MTO algorithms and holds broad application prospects."

Therefore, this paper presents a two-stage regional reconstruction method of distribution network considering optimal operation. Firstly, based on the real-time data of distribution network equipment and lines, the index system of transformer health assessment and risk assessment is established, and the transformer operation state assessment model is constructed. Secondly, a two-stage regional reconstruction method of distribution network considering optimal operation is proposed. In the first stage, the regional reconstruction model of distribution network is constructed with the aim of the lowest risk index and the lowest line loss of each branch transformer. In the second stage, the transformer maintenance strategy based on risk index is proposed, and the regional reconstruction optimization model of distribution network under the optimal operating state is constructed. Finally, PG&E 69-node distribution lines are used for example analysis. The results show that the proposed method can effectively reduce equipment risks and line losses, and effectively improve the security and reliability of the distribution network system."

    "abstract": "\"Cloud Computing (CC)\" has become the foundation of modern digital infrastructures, offering scalable, flexible, and cost-efficient computing and storage services across multi-tenant environments. While this paradigm enables diverse applications from e-commerce and healthcare to finance, it also exposes cloud platforms to sophisticated cyber threats, including zero-day attacks, insider threats, and adversarial manipulations. Traditional \"Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)\", relying on signature-based or conventional \"Machine Learning (ML)\" techniques, often fail to detect dynamic and evolving attacks in distributed cloud ecosystems. This survey provides a comprehensive analysis of \"Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based IDS frameworks for CC, examining the progression from traditional ML to \"Deep Learning (DL)\", \"Federated Learning (FL)\", adversarially robust models, and hybrid explainable architectures. The study evaluates each paradigm in terms of detection accuracy, interpretability, scalability, robustness against adversarial attacks, and suitability for cloud deployment. Recent advancements in federated and distributed learning demonstrate the potential for privacy-preserving, multi-tenant collaboration, while adversarially aware and hybrid approaches highlight the importance of resilience, operational trust, and transparency. The survey also identifies critical research gaps, including the need for standardized cloud-specific datasets, integrated interpretability mechanisms, and efficient deployment strategies for edge-cloud environments. By synthesizing the strengths, limitations, and emerging trends of contemporary AI-driven IDS, this study provides actionable insights for researchers and practitioners aiming to design robust, adaptive, and explainable intrusion detection frameworks for next-generation cloud infrastructures. The findings serve as a foundation for future research in developing scalable, resilient, and trustworthy AI-based IDS capable of addressing the evolving threat landscape in CC."

Various EMP interaction mechanisms have been systematically analyzed, including coupling through wires near apertures, RF front-end penetration via antennas, and fixed-wire antenna interactions. The simulation framework replicates realistic EMP environments and evaluates the resulting transient responses specifically induced currents and voltages within internal aircraft circuitry. These responses are benchmarked against known susceptibility thresholds of onboard electronic systems to assess electromagnetic vulnerability. The interaction flow, guided by standard EMP coupling paths, enables the identification of critical exposure points, thereby supporting targeted electromagnetic shielding and mitigation strategies.

    "abstract": "Mobile phone reviews often consist of domainspecific terminology whose sentiment is complicated to retrieve using traditional sentiment analysis methods. In such scenarios, simple models like Naïve Bayes, SVM, and Bagged Random Forests do not interpret the context well, whereas CNNs and RNNs are limited in modeling long-term dependencies. This study creates a domain-specific, technical-term-based BERT sentiment classifier, with technical terms like “heat dissipation”, “fast charging”, etc., to specify the domain. Data collection sources are the terms from reviews, after which they undergo several preprocessing steps before being assigned a positive, negative, or neutral sentiment label. Experiments have been conducted, revealing that the fine-tuned BERT model produces $91.2 \\%$ accuracy and an F1-score of 0.90, while the accuracy of the baseline models Bagged Random Forests and SVM only reach $78.5 \\%$ and $79.1 \\%$, respectively. This suggests that the BERT is able to grasp subtle, context-based sentiment in technical domains. Future work will explore lighter transformer variants and aspect-based sentiment analysis for real-time applications."

A new IoT-guided MPPT framework with HBAO algorithm is designed in this paper to make solar PV systems work more effectively. The suggested approach joins the international discovery power of the Beetle Antennae Search (BAS) algorithm with the local accuracy of Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), guaranteeing that the maximum power point is always located steadily no matter the fluctuating illumination and temperature. With the help of IoT sensors, PV voltage, current, and irradiance are acquired in real time and promptly sent to the algorithm for feedback. The duty cycle of a boost converter is adjusted through the control signal to get the best output power. Simulations carried out with MATLAB/Simulink have proven that the HBAO approach is 98.7% efficient in tracking, and causes fewer oscillations and faster convergence than popular conventional approaches including P&O and PSO. Because the IoT is integrated, it provides constant monitoring, easy scalability, and access to controls remotely, making the proposed system well-equipped for smart solar energy technology."

    "abstract": "Accurate weather information is crucial for agricultural planning, yet farmers in developing regions often face limitations due to the lack of localized and reliable forecasting tools. Existing forecasts are typically broad in scale and short-term in nature, making them less effective for guiding crop management decisions at the farm level. In citrus farming, where productivity is highly dependent on microclimatic factors, the lack of precise predictive systems increases the risk of yield reduction and inefficient resource allocation. To overcome these challenges, this study developed a weather prediction and classification system that integrates machine learning techniques with historical meteorological data from the Indonesian Meteorological, Climatological, and Geophysical Agency (BMKG). Support Vector Regression (SVR) was applied to predict four essential weather parameters, including relative humidity, average temperature, rainfall, and sunshine duration, while Classification and Regression Tree (CART) was employed to classify conditions into “favorable” and “unfavorable.” The methodology involved systematic data preprocessing, including parameter selection, imputation of missing values, augmentation via smoothing, normalization, and hyperparameter optimization, followed by functional testing to ensure usability. The experimental evaluation showed that SVR achieved strong predictive performance with RMSE values of 2.06 (RH_avg), 0.27 (Tavg), 4.53 (RR), and 0.68 (ss). CART provided excellent classification results with an accuracy of 0.9854, precision of 0.9855, recall of 0.9911, and an F1-score of 0.9882. These results demonstrate that the proposed system is both accurate and reliable, offering a practical decision-support tool to help farmers optimize citrus crop management under varying weather conditions."

In this article, all developments of the YOLO model, from their seminal formulation to the current state-of-the-art in 2018–2025 publications by colleagues in areas such as aerial imagery, infrared/low illumination scenarios, underwater detection applications, agriculture and medical imaging applications, and safety/surveillance applications are critically surveyed. Instead of submitting the results in the results, performance measures such as mAP, FPS, number of parameters, and FLOPs are critically reasoned using comparative lenses. We exhibit trends such as lightweight network architecture, anchor-free detection, and preprocessing-directed variations as well as identify open challenges, including heterogeneity of the datasets, absence of reproducibility, and lack of generalization of the domain.

The existing data processing applications are not scalable and fault tolerant. Hence, this research aims to provide an adaptive workflow orchestration framework that can manage the entire workflow automatically, with improved scalability, and handle a large volume of data using a directed acyclic graph available in Apache Airflow. The proposed framework can handle multidimensional and multilevel data processing flow in any distributed environment. The framework monitors continuously in a real-time environment, and it uses effective and dynamic scheduling, dynamic prioritization, and confirms the data flow even in inconsistent workloads. To do this, a machine learning algorithm is implemented to predict the availability of requested resources, bottlenecks in resource allocation, and the execution path to ensure automatic data processing in the cloud. It also reduces the overall execution time and functional overhead problems. The machine learning algorithm learns the historical data efficiently to make accurate decisions to reduce pipeline letdowns. To demonstrate the overall process and performance of the framework, the Kubernetes, BigQuery, Amazon S3, and native services are integrated to provide improved reliability and scalability when deploying the framework processes in multi- and hybridcloud architectures. It also includes the checkpoints and recovery points that provide robust fault management in the entire architecture. From the experimental outputs, the proposed orchestration frameworks outperform the others in terms of throughput, latency reduction, scheduling, fault-tolerance, and cost. This research also highlights that the integration of automations, intelligence, and adaptability in the cloud workflow framework and its potential value can be used in the next generation of cloud data processing applications."

Conventional land registry systems face critical challenges such as limited transparency and traceability, legitimate ownership verification, and susceptibility to fraudulent activities. Traditional land registry systems are primarily centralized and lack comprehensive digitization, which increases the risk of forgery, data manipulation, and disputes over ownership. To address these challenges, this study proposes a blockchainenabled land registry system framework, named LRS-Chain. This proposed LRS-Chain employs the SHA-256 hashing algorithm for cryptographic security, utilizes the Interplanetary File System (IPFS) for decentralized storage of land transaction records, and adopts the Raft consensus algorithm to validate and authenticate transactions within the LRS-Chain. The proposed work has been implemented using Hyperledger Fabric version 2.5.4. The performance of the proposed work is evaluated using Hyperledger Caliper, a benchmarking tool that generates dummy workloads to analyze the throughput and latency of write and query operations. Transactions ranging from 50 to 2000 are considered for testing. Additionally, CPU utilization percentages of different peer nodes are analyzed as key performance indicators. This initiative aims to effectively address and mitigate the challenges faced in land registry systems."

While our prior work introduced MR-Gov, a closed-loop coexistence governor validated via large-scale simulation, its real-world feasibility remained unexplored. In this paper, we present the first experimental testbed validation of MR-Gov on commodity tri-radio gateways. Our implementation leverages Raspberry Pi 5 platforms with Wi-Fi 7 (802.11be), BLE 5.3, and OpenThread border routers to execute multi-radio coexistence policies under Matter workloads. MR-Gov dynamically adjusts channel assignments, airtime usage, and duty-cycling based on cross-radio telemetry (RSSI, packet error rate, airtime utilization). Evaluation across 30+ devices and mixed workloads (video streaming, command/control, BLE advertisements) demonstrates that MR-Gov reduces Wi-Fi PER by 40%, lowers Matter command latency by 28%, and improves BLE advertisement delivery by 32% compared to baseline coexistence. Energy profiling of Thread sensors further shows up to 18% improvement in battery longevity. These results confirm that MR-Gov is deployable in real-world IoT environments and provides a practical foundation for robust multi-radio Matter ecosystems."

    "abstract": "Software-Defined Networks (SDNs) have transformed traditional network management by offering significantly improved flexibility. This shift in network architecture introduces new security challenge in the detection of abnormal encrypted activities. Accurately identifying such anomalies in SDN environments is critical for effective mitigation of various network threats. This paper presents an in-depth investigation of malicious encrypted traffic identification in SDN networks using a variety of machine learning algorithms. We compare the efficacy of these algorithms in detecting encrypted malicious traffic, specifically for implementation within an SDN environment. The methodology involves deploying different machine learning algorithms within the SDN architecture for malicious traffic detection. We utilize two publicly available network traffic databases for testing, with Python used for programming the machine learning algorithms. This paper authenticates the usefulness of the proposed method through complete experiments conducted on real-world network traffic databases. Experimental findings specify that deep learning models, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) display the best performance for different types of encrypted traffic. We conclude that CNN is highly effective for accurate network traffic classification within an SDN environment."

    "abstract": "Malaria, mainly caused by Plasmodium parasites which is transmitted by the bite of infected mosquitoes, is considered one of the most life-threatening illnesses in the tropical and sub-tropical areas. The mortality rates can be reduced through early and precise detection of malaria by facilitating timely treatment. The proposed study is an effective deep learning model that makes use of a MobileNetV2-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to identify malaria using image-based microscopic blood smears. Extracted data comes in the form of 550 images in two classes; Parasitized (311 images) and Uninfected (239 images) and is sourced out of Kaggle. The series of observation is found to classify with an overall accuracy of 94% which showed a high generalization and reliability of the proposed model. The Parasitized group attained a precision of 0.93 and a recall of 0.99 whereas the Uninfected group obtained a precision of 0.97 and recall of 0.84. The convergence of the training and validation curves is good and there is no overfitting as evidenced by the confusion matrix which indicate that the prediction is correct with a limited number of misclassifications. The combination of lightweight architecture and transfer learning greatly streamlined the level of computation and is thus applicable in the resource constrained healthcare setup. This model contributes to the sustainable development by facilitating high standards of medical diagnostics, enhancing better health results, healthcare advancement, and enhancing international collaboration in combating contagious diseases."

By embedding electrochemical mechanisms into graph neural networks (GNN) combined with reinforcement learning, our system achieves precise state-of-health prediction and dynamic control. Validation results show a 1.2% MAE in SOH prediction—20% lower than traditional methods—with exceptional generalization in late aging stages, alongside <1.8% SOC deviation in multiphysics simulations and accurate thermal runaway forecasting.

Experiments on the California Hospital Inpatient Mortality and Quality Ratings dataset with geospatial data report an overall accuracy of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$99.00 \\%(0.990017)$</tex> and fewer false negatives compared to existing methods, while aligning hospital referrals with outcome-based rankings.

    "abstract": "Quantum computing advancements are a significant threat to Electronic Health Record (EHR) security, posing a “harvest now, decrypt later” threat that exposes patient data to being compromised for decades. Guaranteeing the integrity of this lifetime medical data is therefore essential because their unauthorized disclosure can expose patients to severe risks, from insurance discrimination to social stigma and professional reprisal. In addition, traditional access control frameworks fall short of offering actual data sovereignty and lack verifiable accountability mechanisms. In this paper, we introduce a new framework that couples quantum-safe cryptography with patient-driven control to address both concerns at hand. Our solution is based on a post-quantum Module-Learning with Errors (M-LWE) lattice-based Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE) scheme, hence, sensitive health data is securely and forever shielded. The framework has two fundamental contributions. First one is an access model controlled by biometrics where patients themselves manage and withdraw access to their information from user devices via secure off-chain authentication. This implies that no sophisticated key management systems are required and control is in the hands of the user. Second, a blockchain-audited ledger that securely stores every access event, such as grants and revocations, with an immutable trail for regulatory compliance and trust. In addition to this our architecture is also able to handle a decentralized multi-authority model for scalability across diverse healthcare institutions. The outcome is a holistic framework that ensures data confidentiality against future attack while establishing a new standard for auditable, patient-initiated health information exchange."

This study evaluates the effectiveness of augmentation strategies on cervical pre-cancerous lesion segmentation using SegFormer, a Vision Transformer (ViT) model. The dataset comprises 645 cervical images from Visual Inspection with Acetic Acid (IVA) tests, captured via mobile phone cameras under real-world clinical conditions, split into 521 training images and 124 testing images. Augmentation techniques were selected based on previous CNN-based segmentation studies and included rotation, flipping, elastic transformation, perspective transformation, gamma contrast adjustment, shear, sharpening, shift, and brightness adjustment. Intersection over Union (IoU), Recall, and F1-Score were used as the primary evaluation metrics. Experimental results show that geometric augmentations, particularly rotation (IoU: 0.8030, F1-Score: 0.9636), significantly improved segmentation performance compared to the non-augmented baseline (IoU: 0.7627, F1-Score: 0.9184). Flip, elastic, and perspective transformations also contributed positively. In contrast, brightness adjustment reduced performance (IoU: 0.6875, F1-Score: 0.8148), indicating its unsuitability for datasets with subtle lesion features. This study confirms that augmentation strategies originally recommended for CNNs remain effective when adapted for transformer-based models. Carefully selected geometric augmentations enhance SegFormer’s ability to segment cervical lesions captured under non-standardized clinical conditions"

Comparative analysis with the existing algorithms such as Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) demonstrates the superior performance of the proposed approach. Experimental results reveal that BKA achieves a 17.6 % reduction in VM failure rate, a 14.2 % increase in task success rate, and a 19.4% improvement in throughput compared to the best-performing baseline methods.

    "abstract": "The paradigm of \"thinking with images\", where Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) act as visual agents, has shown remarkable promise in tackling complex visual reasoning tasks. This approach leverages Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), enabling models to make multi-round function calls to refine their visual input. However, current RLVR implementations only consider the correctness of the final answers, neglecting the validity of the reasoning process. This can lead to \"reward hacking\", where models receive high rewards for correct answers despite wrong Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning processes. In this paper, Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Process-supervised Rewards (RLVPR) is proposed to mitigate reward hacking in \"thinking with images\" MLLMs. RLVPR incorporates a verifiable process-supervised reward system that provides process-level supervision for the model’s actions throughout multi-round rollouts. Furthermore, a \"function call balance\" mechanism is introduced to penalize superfluous function calls, ensuring that the model only takes actions that are instrumental in solving the task. The experimental results show that this fine-grained process supervision leads to substantial performance gains on high-resolution visual-search benchmarks, offering a more robust and reliable path for multimodal reasoning."

    "abstract": "The challenge of meeting infrastructure requirements for large-scale training of artificial intelligence (AI) models has created immense pressure on data centers. This, in turn, has led to increased energy usage and carbon emissions. The scheduling mechanisms in data centers are rudimentarily in place to focus on performance or save energy, without any focus on the carbon intensity of the energy powering the systems. This research tries to propose a carbon intensity-aware scheduling system that tries to schedule AI workloads in sync with renewable availability in electricity markets. The system utilizes carbon intensity signals from the power grid and adjusts the scheduling of AI training and inference tasks to reduce emissions and still meet performance goals. The rest of the systems only try to reduce total energy or operational cost, but this system tries to propose a new multi-objective optimization strategy that tries to optimize job deadlines, costs, and carbon footprint. Furthermore, the model enables geodistributed scheduling by moving workloads to other regions with better renewable energy utilization. Testing in simulated data center contexts shows that the proposed approach can reduce carbon emissions by as much as 30 % with very little impact on job completion times. To our knowledge, this paper is the first to propose a solution that offers environmental and economic benefits for future sustainable cloud infrastructures, bringing us closer to the goal of net-zero AI computing."

    "abstract": "Decarbonising domestic heating remains a major challenge, particularly in gas-dependent and fuel-poor regions. This paper investigates hydrogen-based and alternative decarbonisation pathways for residential heating in the North of Tyne (NoT) region, UK. A multi-system perspective (MSP) framework—combining qualitative scenario analysis with quantitative energy system modelling—evaluates the effects of socio-technical interventions (STIs), technology adoption (heat pumps and hydrogen boilers), and hydrogen blending on energy demand, CO<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</inf> emissions, and system costs to 2050. Monte Carlo simulations capture behavioural uncertainties, while a game-theoretic investment model supports long-term planning. Results show that while STIs significantly reduce demand, they cannot alone achieve net zero. Hydrogen blending offers limited short-term benefits, whereas heat pumps deliver the lowest operational costs and emissions, representing the most efficient pathway under full electrification. Hydrogen boilers, though cost-intensive and less efficient operationally, show high long-term net present value (NPV £318–624 million), suggesting potential economic payoff over time. By 2050, with full CCS deployment and high renewable penetration, operational emissions are nearly eliminated across all scenarios. The findings highlight the importance of integrated planning, investment coordination, and social engagement to deliver a resilient and cost-effective low-carbon heating transition."

    "abstract": "Accurate classification of pollen grains is crucial in various fields such as biology, medicine, and environmental monitoring. Even though deep learning methods have improved performance over traditional hand-crafted approaches, existing models often do not take into account the taxonomic hierarchy information of pollen species. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical training framework that jointly optimizes at the family, genus, and species levels using a shared feature extractor and parallel classifier heads. We evaluate our methods using a newly created dataset of 1,787 microscopic pollen images from 274 species, belonging to 145 genera, or 47 families. Experimental results, using two different backbones, demonstrate that the hierarchical training setup improves consistency on the family level while maintaining comparable classification performance at the species level. These findings highlight the value of incorporating biological taxonomy into model training for fine-grained image classification tasks."

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of information technologies in construction projects, image data has become increasingly essential for construction planning and documentation. However, the recall rate of image retrieval in construction plan preparation remains relatively low due to the weak semantic alignment between images and textual descriptions. To address this issue, this paper proposes a multimodal semantic enhancement image retrieval method tailored for construction project planning. The method employs a multimodal large language model to jointly encode construction images and their contextual text, leveraging a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mechanism to achieve semantic segmentation and unified vector representation. By storing both visual and contextual embeddings in a shared semantic space, the proposed method enables high-recall, cross-modal retrieval. Experimental results on real-world construction datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms traditional models in Recall@3 and Precision@3, providing a practical and intelligent solution for image retrieval in construction plan generation."

    "abstract": "International English language proficiency exams such as IELTS, TOEFL, and PTE assess candidates across four key skills: speaking, listening, reading, and writing. Many learners struggle to find a single platform that provides integrated, automated, and detailed feedback across all these components, particularly in real-time and without human intervention. Existing tools often address only one skill at a time or lack advanced AI-driven analytics, leading to fragmented preparation, slower improvement, and difficulty in tracking progress over time. This work presents an AI-enhanced web-based application designed to provide end-to-end training for all four IELTS modules. The system incorporates a custom Speech Recognition Neural Network for precise spoken input analysis, a Fluency Score Algorithm for real-time oral proficiency assessment, and a fine-tuned BERT model for deep grammatical and coherence evaluation in writing tasks. Listening and reading modules feature comprehension passages, adaptive difficulty, and performance-driven question sets to strengthen auditory and textual understanding. A unified feedback and reporting mechanism consolidates results from all modules, generating a single Grammar/Coherence Score and personalized improvement suggestions. The data-driven approach ensures that the difficulty and focus areas evolve with the learner’s performance, making it suitable for exam aspirants, professionals, and language enthusiasts alike."

This paper proposes an AI-based model that forecasts efficiency loss based on regularly measured operational variables in order to determine efficiency loss at an early stage and decide on maintenance scheduling. The preprocessing of a harmonized dataset that is composed of load, vibration, temperature, and operating hours are processed through imputation, outlier control, and normalization. We compare the performance of the three models (Random Forest Regressor, multilayer perceptron (MLP) and support vector regression with an RBF kernel) on an 80/20 split, 10-fold cross-validation, and hyperparameters that are grid-searched. Findings indicate that the suggested method has continuously obtained lower mean squared error and greater R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> than baseline options, with the MLP having the most suitable and consistent forecasts on test cases. The analysis also indicates how the operation variables impact on predictive performance in support of interpretable decision-making. The method allows scheduling condition-based maintenance and enhancing the utilization of assets by giving credible predictions of efficiency degradation in the short term. The model is extremely model-agnostic and can be easily expanded to larger data regimes and generators."

The paper presents the new early-stage Lupus detection algorithm, which is founded on the Learning Enabled Structural Optimization (LESO) approach and a combination of a hybrid CNN-MLP network. The data includes multimodal clinical inputs, such as genetic profiles, serological indicators, histories of symptoms, and demographics of patients. Premedical techniques, including anonymization, multimodal alignment, and missing values, were used to improve the integrity of the data. Dense embeddings and composite biomarker extraction were applied to achieve feature encoding, and a hybrid GWO-statistical feature selection model was used to remove noisy and redundant variables. The adaptive learning model dynamically optimized the neural architecture by using reinforcement-based topology tuning, meta-learning-based allocation of neurons, and hierarchical attention to supervision. An early-stage detection module further reduced false-negatives by using a focal loss-based sensitivity enhancement module. The proposed system had a peak classification accuracy of 96.56 with a sensitivity of 95.88, specificity of 97.11 and AUC of 0.964 during experimentation. The relative analysis to the baseline models showed that the detection performance improved by between 4 and 7 %. The findings verify that both structural optimization and selective attention processes have a significant positive contribution to diagnostic accuracy at an early stage. The methodology provides an intelligent autoimmune diseases screening framework that is scalable and interpretable."

Addressing the limitations of existing methods that rely on golden chips and complex testing environments, this paper proposes two image processing-based algorithms for comparing layout and SEM images. The first method uses connected region feature extraction with Hungarian algorithm matching to identify structural anomalies. The second method applies iterative morphological erosion to difference images to expose suspicious regions. Experiments on 20,000 image pairs from the REFICS dataset (90nm node) demonstrate that both algorithms achieve high detection accuracy (96.85% and 94.2%) with strong batch processing capabilities. The feature extraction method offers superior accuracy and speed, while the erosion-based method provides better noise resistance. This work enables practical, large-scale hardware Trojan screening for engineering applications."

Data usage principles, such as GDPR and RBI regulations, are very strict. This paper aims to present a totally innovative and extensive framework that can be utilised for fraud detection.. We propose an unified ensemble model that employs soft-voting fusion mechanism, where we take the average of predicted probabilities of each base model that features Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Safe Neural Networks. We integrated important techniques like SMOTE to generate additional unusual fraud case examples. We used SHAP & LIME to provide insights into model functionality, and a reliable technique like Safe SGD. Our experiments were conducted on a comprehensive Kaggle dataset (284,807 transactions, 492 fraud cases), which displays that our model attained an F1-score of 0.68, a Recall of 0.95 and a PR AUC exceeding 0.96, along with secure, powerful privacy protections."

However, existing methods primarily focus on optimizing the reconstruction error of normal samples during training, neglecting the core goal of anomaly detection, namely, enhancing the reconstruction error separability between normal and anomalous samples. This limitation often results in an increased false detection rate, particularly when detecting subtle anomalies. To relieve this issue, we introduce a novel ranked pairwise reconstruction error comparison method, Ra-PIR, which begins by introducing noise at varying levels into normal samples to generate a set of samples with different levels of deviation. It then adopts a triplet structure to input paired samples into the reconstruction network for error computation. Building on this, we propose a ranking-constrained loss function minimizes reconstruction error and ensuring that the error ranking aligns with the deviation level, thereby improving the model’s sensitivity to anomalous patterns. Experimental results conducted on public datasets show that compared with four existing anomaly detection methods, Ra-PIR improves the average detection accuracy."

Preprocessing steps included categorical encoding, random oversampling to address class imbalance, and min-max normalization. The model was trained and evaluated using ten-fold cross-validation while comparing five activation functions across varying hidden neuron counts. Results showed that the model achieved its highest accuracy of $74.5 \\%$ using the rectified linear unit (ReLU) function with 16 neurons, while the hyperbolic tangent ($\\tanh$) function with only 2 neurons offered comparable accuracy with higher stability. However, no statistical significance tests were conducted, and thus performance differences should be interpreted cautiously. The findings suggest that ELM performance is influenced by activation function and neuron configuration. Despite dataset limitations, this pilot study highlights the potential of behaviorbased questionnaires as a scalable alternative to physiological data in psychological prediction tasks. Future work with larger and independent datasets is needed to validate these findings."

CNNs, due to their capacity to learn and generalize complex patterns, can analyze multivariate meteorological data and enhance the functionality of solar panels. Training a CNN on historical and real-time meteorological data enables the model to forecast solar panel efficiency and modify system settings for maximal energy extraction.

The proposed model is evaluated using a real-world solar energy dataset, which shows improvements in efficiency and flexibility compared to the traditional optimization methods. The results highlight the capability of CNNs to improve the efficacy of solar energy systems, making them more robust against the challenges presented by fluctuating weather conditions.

Decision trees are widely used classification methods for kidney patient data, consisting of decision nodes and leaves, starting with a root tree with no inputs. EDA is crucial for comprehending kidney cancer datasets, identifying patterns in patient hypothesis data, and analyzing sympathetic data distribution, outliers, and significant features. A one-tailed test is a statistical method used to test a statical hypothesis, such as comparing the survival rate of a group of people with a specific cancer.

This study proposes an optimized deep learning approach leveraging Genetic Algorithms (GA) to enhance the performance of the VGG16 model for pneumonia detection. By replacing traditional backpropagation with GA- based optimization, we aim to mitigate overfitting and improve classification metrics. The methodology involves fine-tuning the final layer of a pretrained VGG16 model using GA, where candidate models undergo crossover, mutation and selection based on fitness criteria such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Comparative analysis with other optimizers, including Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), and Bayesian Optimization, demonstrates the efficacy of GA in achieving robust performance. Experimental results on a publicly available dataset reveal that the GA-optimized model achieves competitive accuracy while maintaining generalizability, highlighting its potential for real-world clinical applications. This research underscores the significance of metaheuristic optimization in advancing deep learning models for medical image analysis. The proposed PSO-optimized VGG16 model achieved an accuracy of 97.43% on the Chest X-Ray dataset."

Field measurements were conducted at $\\mathbf{4 3 3 ~ M H z}$ using ESP32-LoRa transceivers in Sebatik, North Kalimantan, Indonesia, across line-of-sight (LOS), non-line-of-sight (NLOS), and partial-LOS scenarios. Received signal strength indicator (RSSI) data were collected over distances from 10 m to 800 m, with antennas mounted at 1.5 m to reflect realistic WSN node placement. A modified log-distance model and two polynomial models (quadratic and cubic) were proposed and validated against standard empirical models (ITU, Weissberger, FITU-R, COST-235). The results show high pathloss exponents of 2.45 (LOS) and 3.72 (NLOS), indicating severe signal attenuation caused by trunk and foliage blockage. Standard models exhibited poor accuracy with RMSE values ranging from 56.35 dB to 148.82 dB, while the proposed quadratic polynomial model achieved the lowest RMSE of 2.35 dB (LOS) and 1.43 dB (NLOS), with $\\boldsymbol{R}^{2}\\gt0.95$. The practical communication range was found to be approximately 600 m in LOS and 400 m in NLOS for reliable LoRa transmission (SF12). These findings provide a site-specific, high-accuracy pathloss model essential for optimizing WSN design, node placement, and energy efficiency in tropical plantation environments."

    "abstract": "In this paper, the authors introduce a Cloud Computing-Aided Serverless Optimization Framework of Real Time Workload Management based on Reinforcement Learning (RL)-Driven Predictive Resource Scaling. To achieve improved performance and costeffectiveness, the proposed model implements TensorFlow and Tensorflow Agents to dynamically scale the resources based on the dynamically varied workloads. With RL, the system is able to learn to predict resource needs and adjust allocation to minimize resource waste and reduce latency. It has been experimentally determined to conserve as much as 30 percent of resources and 25 percent of latency over traditional methods of assigning resources in a non-dynamic manner. The framework is also more adaptable and cost effective than heuristicbased load balancing and genetic algorithm optimizations. Although slight delays were noticed under the peak demand conditions, the RL-based strategy was found to be very efficient in real-world conditions. This contribution can lead to the development of serverless computing by offering scalable and smart serverless system workload management."

Standardized recognition systems fail to include all populations because they operate with tight limitations aimed at Indian Sign Language (ISL) and similar widespread forms. A complete systematic approach introduces a real-time artificial intelligence system that learns five Indian sign language varieties and other regional variants. The system presents a monolithic architecture inside Jupyter Notebook which combines MediaPipe keypoint extraction with an LSTM-based deep learning model for temporal sequence classification. Through its operation the model transforms real-time sign language gestures directly to English text with precise accuracy thus enhancing accessibility among users. Real-time prediction and model interpretability along with feedback visualization depend on our solution which utilizes OpenCV, NumPy, TensorFlow/Keras and cvzone. We accessed publicly accessible video material which included various linguistic territory representations for our study. The article presents performance evaluations while making comparisons to existing solutions specifically designed for ISL applications. The proposed framework integrates regional sign system recognition to establish multilingual assistive technologies which can benefit educational, healthcare and public service functions."

We present an efficient graph representation learning solution by sufficiently training the proposed GARNETT using a custom features-assisted graph neural network (GNN) architecture on the unbiased distribution of logic cells in translated technology-independent (TTI) netlist, achieved by bypassing technology-dependent logic synthesis and placement. This unbiased training ensures GARNETT’s efficient learning to propagate the toggle rates with our GNN by effectively embedding the feature values as vectors on each logic cell, unlike the biased training with post-synthesized netlist files in state-of-the-art (SoA) architectures, GRANNITE, Method, and GRIPT. The proposed GARNETT achieves a mean improvement in accuracy of 23.31%, 4.47%, 2.1% and 2.74% higher than the commercial RTL toggle rate estimation tool, GRANNITE, SoA Method, and GRIPT in predicting the average toggle rate, respectively. The proposed GARNETT is faster than the commercial placement-level toggle rate estimation tool, GRANNITE, SoA Method, and GRIPT, in inference latency, with a mean improvement of 6.08X, 4.05X, 4.09X, and 4.03X, respectively."

    "abstract": "Deep learning has rapidly progressed in Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) image object detection. However, complex noise, intricate backgrounds, and multiscale objects impact the performance of SAR image object detection. To solve these problems, in this paper, we propose a Feature Separation and Integration Network (FSINet) to mitigate noise interference and improve the accuracy of multiscale objects for SAR images. FSINet is constructed in three steps. First, we construct the Feature Separation Module (FSM) as a preprocessing unit that decouples input images into distinct components, enabling collaboration with the downstream backbone to separate noise and enhance critical information. Subsequently, we propose an Adaptive Feature Integration Module (AFIM) designed to fuse cross-layer multiscale features, generating precise feature representations. Additionally, a new regression loss called Shape Normalized Wasserstein Distance (SNWD) is used to enhance the detection performance for multiscale objects. To validate the superiority of the proposed FSINet, a series of comparative experiments are conducted on three public SAR image object detection datasets, that is the High-Resolution SAR Image Dataset (HRSID), SAR-AIRCraft dataset, and MSAR dataset. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method, revealing that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in SAR image object detection."

    "abstract": "Search and rescue operations save thousands of lives yearly, and robotics can further improve survival rates in hazardous, partially observable environments. This article introduces a trustworthy human-autonomy teaming (HAT) navigation framework that fuses human situational awareness with algorithmic planning across both global and local layers. At the global level, a hybrid graph integrates generalized Voronoi diagrams (GVDs), for high-clearance, topology-preserving roadmaps interpretable to operators, with a spatiotemporal graph that dynamically updates edges and node salience as obstacles and mission priorities evolve. Human input is incorporated through a node optimization protocol that prioritizes access nodes, adjusts waypoint sequences, and invokes RRT*-informative path planning when jump-search shortcuts become unreliable, thereby aligning exploration with operator-defined areas of interest and mission constraints. At the local level, a bioinspired neural network (BNN) with an adaptive window strategy provides reactive obstacle avoidance and target tracking, ensuring smooth and safe motion in cluttered, dynamic scenes. Simulation results across indoor and urban-like environments demonstrate that the proposed framework enhances path efficiency, robustness to environmental change, and responsiveness while reducing unnecessary re-planning. By unifying GVD-based global structure, human-guided decision-making, and BNN-based local reactivity, the HAT framework advances autonomous navigation toward greater safety, adaptability, and effectiveness in real-world search and rescue operations."

    "abstract": "Fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) encounter difficulties in minimizing running costs and prolonging fuel cell lifespan, and current energy management strategies fail to reconcile real-time performance with global optimization. This study proposed a framework integrating model predictive control (MPC) and dynamic programming (DP) to reduce the running cost of the FCEVs' powertrain system. A bidirectional long short term memory (BiLSTM) network optimized via the dung beetle optimizer (DBO) algorithm enabled high-accuracy velocity forecasting, and a multi-objective cost function incorporating equivalent hydrogen cost, lithium battery pack loss, and fuel cell loss was established. Leveraging the state of charge (SOC) of the lithium battery, the DP algorithm determined the best power distribution within the control horizon, and energy utilization was optimized through the rolling optimization of MPC. The findings indicate that the suggested DP-MPC strategy markedly diminishes fuel cell power fluctuations and loss costs, lowering the overall running cost of the FCEVs powertrain system throughout four driving cycles: the Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure (WLTP), the Supplemental Federal Test Procedure (US06), the Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule (UDDS), and the China Light-Duty Vehicle Test Cycle (CLTC). Compared to DP, sequential quadratic programming MPC (MPC-SQP), Pontryagin's Minimum Principle minimizing equivalent hydrogen consumption (PMP-H2-min), DP minimizing equivalent hydrogen consumption (DP-H2-min), and rule-based strategies, DP-MPC achieves average fuel cell loss reductions of 26.4%, 22.0%, 67.0%, 60.5%, and 71.9%, respectively, and reduces the total running cost of the FCEV by 10.6%, 21.2%, 16.9%, and 41.7% compared to MPC-SQP, PMP H2-min, DP-H2-min, and rule-based strategies. The numerical and hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) experimental results show that the proposed strategy offers excellent direction for decreasing FCEVs' running costs and alleviating fuel cells' degradation."

In this work, we report the fabrication of a barium titanate nanowire (BTOnws)-doped poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) composite TENG, designed to enhance mechanical robustness and electrical output. The optimized TENG exhibits stable and superior output performance including open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 280 V, short-circuit current (ISC) of 12 μA, and power density of 1.45 W/m2. The effects of device structural on output performance are systematically investigated. Environmental stability tests reveal that the TENG maintained stable voltage and current outputs across a wide temperature/humidity range and over 10,000 contact–separation cycles and that the output attenuation of this TENG is superior to that of the previously reported PVDF-based TENG. Furthermore, we verify its power supply capability by lighting up 52 LEDs and fabricated a new TENG-integrated table tennis bat for wireless position detection. The sensing system utilize a two-stage amplification circuit to overcome the high output impedance of TENGs, achieving accurate localization of ball impacts with only nine sensing units. This study not only provides insights into optimizing TENG structural and environmental resilience but also highlights their potential in electronic devices, sports analytics, and intelligent sensing networks."

A decoupled geometric control scheme is further employed to regulate the attitude loop independently, significantly improving the planning success rate. The stability of the closed-loop system is established via Lyapunov analysis. Finally, real-time flight experiments validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed framework in complex environments."

It has a simple chat interface that is designed with React.js and background services that are written in FastAPI and use advanced AI models, including LangChain, OpenAI GPT, and Sentence-Transformers to produce embeddings that assist with effective semantic understanding. FAISS vector search technology is applied to allow effective memory retrieval, and the profiles of all the patients and chat histories are safely stored in a PostgreSQL database, with the supplementary backup of the information being stored in cloud storage systems, such as AWS S3 and the Azure Blob. The memory impairments faced by the patients of amnesia pose significant issues to both patient autonomy and the assistance of the caregiver. The latest progress in AI and NLP will provide context-specific memory support, which will address the conventional drawbacks in reactivity and flexibility. The recommended system offers real-time, context-driven dialogues that are aimed at memory retrieval, emotional assistance, and monitoring caregivers based on notifications and dashboards, and it aims to improve the quality of life of these patients and maximize the process of care coordination. The architecture combines different multimodal interfaces, high-quality NLP, and transformer models, including GPT-3.5, to produce an interesting and intelligent conversation, which is optimized by FAISS-based vector databases and enables the capability to learn dynamically. There is a harmonious functioning of all the system elements with the help of LangChain, and cloud integration that provides the safe data management and takes care of caregivers. The assessments indicate that the system is capable of producing the high-quality, individualized interactions and effective memory support, as well as promote active participation of the caregivers. This architecture advances the scalable memory support and there are chances that it can significantly enhance clinical results of individuals with memory impairments."

By integrating quantum frequency standard technology with classical electronic engineering principles, a remote transfer model centered around a rubidium clock as the quantum time excitation source and an AD650 frequency-to-voltage conversion chip is constructed, achieving collaborative optimization of voltage benchmark stability, calibration efficiency, and remote operation compatibility. Experimental verification shows that within the 10-400 kHz frequency band, the model exhibits good output linearity. Compared to traditional on-site calibration methods, measurement errors are effectively reduced, and the calibration device volume is compressed to 1/100 of that of traditional systems. Through the pioneering \"key-calibration board\" dual-module architecture, the quantum extension of the measurement traceability chain is realized, laying the foundation for the subsequent remote intelligent upgrade of IC test systems."

Compared to the existing label classification, our system offers a plug-and-play approach to utilizing the prompt words with rules and the experimental results verify that not only the single-level occasions can the system attain the high correct and stable answers, but also the multi-level occasions our system can precisely offer the answer with consistency. The key trick for system orchestration is to use the rule that decomposes the sentences by the property of words and matches the labels according to the meaning of keywords. This trick ensures that LLM generates the expected answers for the single-level label classification whenever it is called, as for the hierarchical multi-label text classification, our system extends the trick to the multi-level occasion and combines it with the dictionary for the hierarchical multi-label text classification."

    "abstract": "Reversible Data Hiding (RDH) in information security entails the basic capability of embedding data into a host signal with the ability to retrieve it completely restore the original signal. Prediction Error Expansion (PEE)-based techniques are often the most well-known class of RDH methods, as they often boast good embedding capacity with modest distortion. One of the most well-known PEE-based methods is Pixel Value Ordering (PVO), that exploits the spatial redundancy of digital images, utilizes the spatial redundancy in digital images by ordering pixel values in local blocks to impose a predictable structure to the embedding process. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the literature related to prediction-based reversible data hiding (RDH) that follows the trajectory from early ideas to recent models. The review looks at the original PVO design and its modifications, which achieved large values of improvement in prediction and embedding. The review also includes sophisticated methods using adaptive embedding, dynamic partitioning, and multi-layered methods. The review even discusses using PVO in challenging contexts, such as in the context of encrypted images (RDH-EI), dual-image methods, video data, and 3D models. One focus; though, is the collection hybrid methods, in which PVO is incorporated with other approaches stemming from histogram shifting and machine learning. There also is a comparison of selected PVO methods in terms of capacity and fidelity."

    "abstract": "Access to safe drinking water remains a critical issue in developing countries despite its importance for human survival. In regions across the Philippines and India-particularly Odisha, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan, and the southern states—water scarcity has severe economic and social impacts. Saline groundwater, droughts, and poor infrastructure force reliance on contaminated sources. Similar challenges exist in Bangladesh, Indonesia, Kenya, and Ethiopia, where contamination and inadequate distribution systems worsen health and sanitation conditions. To address this, a Low-Cost Dispenser-Type Water Filtration System (LCDTWFS) was developed to provide clean water without electricity. The 10-liter system, primarily made of natural clay, was tested over six weeks, and the filtered water met national and international quality standards, confirming its portability and safety. The LCDTWFS is affordable, eco-friendly, and locally manufacturable by rural artisans, supporting both community health and livelihoods. Integrating data science enables performance optimization, predictive maintenance, and real-time monitoring, enhancing efficiency and reliability. Overall, this study presents a sustainable, community-driven, and scalable solution to improve access to potable water, particularly in rural and coastal regions of developing nations."

    "abstract": "As artificial intelligence rapidly transforms educational landscapes, pre-service teachers’ perceptions and preparedness become pivotal for successful technology integration. While existing research has examined broad attitudes toward AI in education, a significant gap exists in understanding the nuanced linguistic, thematic, and emotional dimensions of how future educators conceptualize AI. This study employed textmining techniques, using topic modeling and sentiment analysis to examine pre-service teachers’ AI perceptions in Hong Kong. Participants provided five adjectives in Hong Kong Chinese to describe AI, yielding 258 responses. Data underwent frequency analysis, BERTopic modeling for thematic clustering, and AIassisted sentiment classification. Frequency analysis revealed “convenient” (13.2 %) and “expedient” (8.1 %) as dominant descriptors. Topic modeling identified 15 themes, with “Usability and Every day Convenience” (14.75%) and “Technology’s Societal Impact and Debate” (14.34 %) as the most significant clusters. Sentiment analysis showed 73.3 % positive responses, with all 10 participants reporting previous AI experiences classified as having positive perceptions, while none of the neutral/negative participants reported previous AI experiences. The findings reveal predominantly positive but potentially surface-level AI perceptions among pre-service teachers, with a strong relationship between experience and positive sentiment. These insights inform evidence-based approaches to teacher preparation programs, emphasizing hands-on AI experiences and deeper pedagogical understanding beyond convenience-focused perceptions."

    "abstract": "Effective livestock management requires continuous monitoring of the health and mobility of vulnerable animals, such as downer and pregnant cattle, to prevent injuries, economic loss, and animal suffering. This paper presents a Smart IoT-Based Framework for Livestock Mobility Monitoring and Support, designed to provide real-time health tracking and automated assistance for at-risk animals. The proposed system integrates a network of physiological and behavioral sensors that capture key parameters including body temperature, posture, and activity level. These data streams are processed by an intelligent control unit equipped with decision-making algorithms capable of detecting anomalies at an early stage. Upon detection, the system automatically triggers a relay-driven actuation mechanism that initiates timely support actions, such as mobility assistance or alert notifications to farmers and veterinarians via a mobile application. The novelty of this work lies in the seamless integration of IoT-based sensing, intelligent analytics, and automated actuation into a unified platform, enabling proactive and autonomous livestock care. Experimental results demonstrate that the framework enhances mobility detection accuracy and reduces the response time compared to conventional manual monitoring systems. Overall, the proposed solution promotes animal welfare, operational efficiency, and sustainable livestock management through intelligent and data-driven intervention."

The conventional approaches to the detection of plant diseases are constrained by dependency on man, high time, and poor capacity to handle extensive use. This research proposes VIT-GWO, a hybrid approach with Vision Transformer (ViT) as a feature extractor and Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) as a model optimizer to eliminate the disadvantage of previous approaches. The new method encourages the accuracy of models, generalization, and effectiveness of computing based on the deep feature learning mechanism of ViT and optimization of the capabilities of GWO. The PlantVillage data has been used for model testing, and the performance has improved phenomenally over the current models in terms of the measures such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F 1 measure. The precision rate is even higher in the New VIT-GWO model at $99.21 \\%$ when compared to the existing models. This model has outstanding scaling, robustness, and realtime usage in large agricultural environments compared to the traditional methods. Finally, VIT-GWO is a very efficient process of leaf disease detection on crops with the possibility of improvement through hyperparameter optimization, transfer learning, or effective monitoring capabilities with drone cameras or smartphones, which makes it applicable to real-world and large-scale usage in precision agriculture."

By constructing an FG with observation factors, prior factors, and process factors, this method establishes constraints between the phases of unwrapped pixels and those to be unwrapped within a processing window. To enhance computational efficiency for large-scale interferograms, the implementation combines a sliding window mechanism with parallel computing, leveraging multi-threading to accelerate the iterative solution.

To address these issues, we constructed a dataset containing 14 representative forage species and proposed an improved detection model named YOLOv7-CEA.The model enhances the original YOLOv7 architecture through two attention-based improvements. The Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) is embedded into the last three ELAN modules to strengthen the model’s focus on important spatial and channel features. Meanwhile, the Efficient Channel Attention (ECA) module is integrated into the SPPCSPC structure to refine multi-scale feature fusion and improve the detection of small or occluded plants. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the YOLOv7-CEA model. For detecting 14 forage species, the model achieved a precision of 98.85%, a recall of 96.65%, and a mean average precision (mAP) of 98.86%, improving over the original YOLOv7 by 5.3%, 3.4%, and 5.0%, respectively. Visualization results show that the model accurately identifies multiple species even in dense quadrats with overlapping plants and complex backgrounds, significantly reducing missed and false detections."

This paper presents DriveSure, an innovative machine learning predictive analytics system that can be used to forecast truck failures, plan maintenance, and enhance overall fleet efficiency. Leveraging multiple datasets like transportation tracking, logistics activity, and large truck fleet data, the system integrates vehicle parameters, maintenance history, and working habits in an attempt to forecast potential failures. The proposed framework employs machine learning algorithms such as random forest, XGBoost, and LSTM networks for encoding structured and time-series relationships in fleet data. The framework addresses three prediction targets: binary classification for probabilities of breakdown in 30 days, regression-based prediction of days to next required maintenance, and multi-class prediction of specific maintenance needs. Experiment results indicate potential business value in the form of 30-50% reduction in unplanned downtime, year-end savings $100K-$500K per fleet, and 5-15% fuel efficiency improvement. Proactive maintenance also makes fleets safer through reduced mechanical failures that would otherwise result in accidents. A frontend that is easy to use is created with streamlit that allows for interactive visualization and decision-making by fleet operators. This work focuses on the integration of advanced analytics and real-world logistics data to enable scalable data-driven maintenance strategies that increase operational robustness, safety, and cost-effectiveness in modern-day transportation networks."

    "abstract": "Ultrasound-based breast cancer detection presents unique challenges due to the inherent variability in tissue texture, image quality, and tumor boundary definitions. We introduce a new dual-stage deep learning model with autoencoder and Convolutional Neural Network, termed AECNN (AutoEncoder-Convolutional Neural Network), and investigate the potentials of the newly presented architecture in terms of accurate and consistent breast cancer diagnosis on grayscale ultrasound images. The framework utilizes a compressed latent representation achieved by a high-dimensional input through an unsupervised autoencoder into compact, informative latent information to the supervised 1D convolutional neural network to perform classification. This decoupling of feature extraction and classification can be used to enable the model to remove meaningless noise and concentrate on clinically important patterns. The ultrasound dataset used in this study contains images labeled as benign, malignant, and normal, collected from a publicly available Kaggle repository. Generalization was increased by performing such preprocessing as normalization, grayscale enhancement, and augmentation. After the classification, the AECNN model gained an outstanding result of 98.97, which exceeded several classic CNNs and pre-trained networks, such as VGG16, ResNet50, and DenseNet121. The model showed very high precision (99.10), recall (98.80), and F1-score (98.95) besides the accuracy. It is also advantageous of the framework since the inference is faster than in a deeper network and this allows deployment in real time to clinical decision-support systems. These findings reveal that the AECNN model is very effective to separate between malignant cases and benign and normal cases which makes it a probable source of contention in the use of ultrasound in the diagnosis of breast cancer."

Research on benchmark datasets indicates that deep learning-based IDSs (DL-based IDSs) applications exceed predictive accuracy of 95% and detection rates considerably exceed traditional machine learning methods. CNNs identify and locate attack patterns, LSTM networks identify and exploit dependencies in stream sequences and Transformer-based networks facilitate and control higher levels of stream processing for complex, multi-part attacks. GANs and Autoencoders improve robustness through anomaly detection. Hybrid frameworks, and particularly, CNN-BiLSTM-Attention models, achieve exceptional detection accuracy by exceeding 99% on standard web attack datasets. The survey is correct in stating that systems based on deep learning approaches (DL approaches) do not address challenges such as adversarial evasion and attack vectors, class imbalance, false positives and model explainability.

To address these limitations, we propose a novel inpainting framework specifically adapted for 3D virtual environments. Our approach builds upon conventional inpainting architectures but introduces domain-specific enhancements to better capture the structural and semantic characteristics of virtual scenes. We evaluate our method across multiple widely-used 3D virtual environment datasets and additional in-the-wild virtual samples to assess its generalizability. Experimental results demonstrate that our model not only achieves competitive performance in filling missing regions but also enables practical applications such as scene editing and content creation, thereby validating the effectiveness and utility of the proposed framework."

Animation of these graphics, driven by the motion of their elements, offers enhanced comprehensibility and controllability but often requires substantial manual effort. To automate this process, we propose a novel method that integrates implicit neural representations with text-to-video diffusion models for vector graphic animation. Our approach employs layered implicit neural representations to reconstruct vector graphics, preserving their inherent properties such as infinite resolution and precise color and shape constraints, which effectively bridges the large domain gap between vector graphics and diffusion models. The neural representations are then optimized using video score distillation sampling, which leverages motion priors from pretrained text-to-video diffusion models. Finally, the vector graphics are warped to match the representations resulting in smooth animation. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our method in generating vivid and natural vector graphic animations, demonstrating significant improvement over existing techniques that suffer from limitations in flexibility and animation quality."

    "abstract": "Optimizing distributed storage, particularly with Content Addressed Storage (CAS) like InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), faces challenges with data redundancy and update efficiency. Traditional replication offers simplicity. However, this comes at the cost of high storage and bandwidth overhead. Erasures coding offers better space efficiency but incurs re-encoding and re-upload costs for update. Traditional storage systems modify data in place. In contrast, content-addressable immutable storage systems employ content identifiers (CID), such as cryptographic hashes. Consequently, any update to a file generates an entirely new and immutable object with a unique CID. This paper proposes an IPFS-based erasure coded file storage update system; EC-CID which optimizes updates by reencoding and re-uploading only modified segments. Our simulation results showed that, EC-CID offer superior storage efficiency but with higher update latency over various modification percentages. The EC-CID reduces average update cost by 64.89 % compared to replication. Simulation analysis demonstrates the efficacy of the EC-CID as a novel and efficient solution for file updates using erasure codes over CAS, balancing efficiency, resilience, and adaptability."

    "abstract": "Federated learning addresses the issue of data silos by allowing clients to share only locally trained model parameters. However, studies have shown that even without directly exposing raw data, attackers can still infer sensitive private information by analyzing parameters such as the weights of deep learning models. To address this challenge, differential privacy techniques have been integrated into federated learning frameworks to enhance privacy protection. Nevertheless, the noise typically added in traditional methods often leads to significant degradation in model performance. Most existing approaches adopt uniform gradient clipping and noise injection strategies, failing to adequately account for the heterogeneity of training parameters across different clients and the dynamic characteristics of the model convergence process. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes an adaptive gradient selection and noise injection mechanism, named ASUR-DPFL. Specifically, to avoid wasting privacy budget on ineffective gradient updates, we introduce a gradient selective update strategy during the central server aggregation process. Additionally, we employ the more compact Gaussian Differential Privacy (GDP) framework for privacy accounting to improve the precision of privacy analysis. Experimental results on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed ASUR-DPFL method not only effectively protects data privacy but also significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches in terms of performance."

This is because sensitive data requires strong and future-proof security EHRs require strong, future- proof security that traditional encryption methods, which do not have temporal privacy or post-quantum resilience, cannot provide. In this paper, a unified framework that protects EHR data from classical and quantum threats is proposed and named TDP-QIMLE (Temporal Differential Privacy with Quantum- Inspired Multi-Layer Encryption). It combines temporal privacy with time-decay sensitivity vectors, quantum-inspired encryption mapped to lattice transformations, lattice-based obfuscation, adaptive noise injection, partially homomorphic encryption, blockchainstyle integrity verification, and biologically evolving master keys. This multi-tiered defense enables analytics that are privacy-preserving to be conducted on longitudinal records, it ensures secure computation, and maintains auditability. Evaluation on synthetic EHR data demonstrates that TDP- QIMLE can provide strong privacy with minor utility degradation and is applicable for edge-cloud deployment. Moreover, ethical and bias considerations, and in particular the one related to adaptive noise, have been explicitly discussed, bringing the field one step closer to secure, compliant and explainable healthcare data infrastructure in the postquantum era."

    "abstract": "The rapid adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) is expected to substantially reduce emissions in the transportation sector of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). However, a large-scale transition toward EVs also introduces challenges related to vehicle ownership costs. This study develops a Monte Carlo-based techno-economic model to evaluate the total cost of ownership (TCO) for representative EVs and internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs) under KSA conditions. The model incorporates vehicle cost, insurance, maintenance, registration, fuel and electricity price, and Vehicle Kilometres Travelled (VKT) - based depreciation. Results show that under the Baseline scenario, EVs are marginally cheaper at low mileage (10,000 km) but lose this advantage as ICEVs become progressively more cost-efficient at higher distances. In the City scenario, EVs also record an early cost advantage up to 20,000 km, after which ICEVs surpass them. Under the Highway scenario, EVs are consistently more expensive across all mileage levels, with the disadvantage widening significantly at higher VKT. These findings highlight that EVs can be cost-competitive in baseline and city scenarios at low mileage, but ICEVs remain more economical for longer-distance use, especially under highway conditions in hot climates. The results provide evidence-based insights into the economic viability of EV adoption in KSA and the potential requirements for supporting policy interventions such as residual value guarantees, electricity price stability, and investment in charging infrastructure to ensure competitiveness with ICEVs across diverse driving conditions."

    "abstract": "Modern video codecs have been extensively optimized to preserve perceptual quality, leveraging models of the human visual system. However, in split inference systems—where intermediate features from neural network are transmitted instead of pixel data—these assumptions no longer apply. Intermediate features are abstract, sparse, and task-specific, making perceptual fidelity irrelevant. In this paper, we investigate the use of Versatile Video Coding (VVC) for compressing such features under the MPEG-AI Feature Coding for Machines (FCM) standard. We perform a tool-level analysis to understand the impact of individual coding components on compression efficiency and downstream vision task accuracy. Based on these insights, we propose three lightweight essential VVC profiles-Fast, Faster, and Fastest. The Fast profile provides 2.96% BD-Rate gain while reducing encoding time by 21.8%. Faster achieves a 1.85% BD-Rate gain with a 51.5% speedup. Fastest reduces encoding time by 95.6% with only a 1.71% loss in BD-Rate."

In total, 10,240 lung CT images for the study dataset, 5,000 samples were taken for benign and 5,240 malignant cases, with support proportions of 0.49 and 0.51 for these two subclasses, respectively. The proposed model clearly shows that it can effectively classify the dataset considered, with an overall accuracy of 98.53% for both classes. The model would show, about the benign class, precision as 98.99%, recall as 98.000%, and F1 score as 98.49% indicating the model's efficacy in identifying non-cancer cases. It has achieved a precision of 98.11%, a recall of 99.05%, and an F1 score of 98.58% for the malignant class, showing that it is very sensitive to detecting cancerous cases. These results suggest that the model is robust and reliable, proving it as a very effective computer-aided diagnosis tool for early and timely detection of lung cancer. Being artificially balanced is accessible to most real medical environments, enhancing diagnostic decision-making and patient care."

This research proposes a novel Edge-Intelligent Blockchain Framework (EIBF) that integrates federated learning (FL) with edge computing and permissioned blockchain to enable privacy-preserving, decentralized medical diagnostics. In the proposed system, hospital edge nodes collaboratively train AI models on local electronic health records without transferring sensitive data to the cloud. Model updates are securely recorded and verified through smart contracts on a blockchain ledger, ensuring immutability, auditability, and transparent contribution tracking among participants. A dynamic trust-aware aggregation algorithm, inspired by reinforcement learning and hybrid metaheuristics, assigns adaptive weights to model updates based on data quality, accuracy, and node reliability, mitigating poisoning and inference attacks. The framework also employs an energy-optimized consensus mechanism using adaptive Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) to improve transaction throughput and scalability in edge environments. Experimental evaluation using the MIMIC-III and PhysioNet clinical datasets demonstrates a 96.4% diagnostic accuracy, a 35% reduction in model convergence time, and a 40% improvement in energy efficiency compared to the conventional federated learning systems. The proposed EIBF framework ensures data sovereignty, low-latency inference, and verifiable trust across distributed healthcare ecosystems, establishing a foundation for next-generation secure and intelligent medical networks."

To ensure robust evaluation, both models were optimized using Grid Search and Random Search hyperparameter tuning, rather than relying solely on default configurations. The results show that RF significantly outperforms LR across all metrics, achieving an accuracy of $95.4 \\%$ and F1-score of 0.959 compared to LR’s $85.4 \\%$ accuracy and 0.874 F1-score. The findings confirm that RF provides superior predictive power and generalization capability, while hyperparameter tuning enhances the reliability of comparative analysis.

An SDN/Mininet hierarchy with programmable switches creates reproducible bottlenecks, while QUIC transports (NewReno, BBRv2) carry constant-frame-rate streams. The path is instrumented to build a sequence feature vector—active flows, pre-ACK transmissions, utilization, effective window, decrement events, and session wait time—and detection is formulated as supervised sequence modeling with stacked LSTMs. The model anticipates congestion from ACK timing and flow dynamics, outperforming SVM, DT, DA, and KNN (accuracy 0.96, specificity 1.00). A complementary PSNR study on standard YUV clips shows that under 1-2% loss, QUIC-BBRv2 sustains higher fidelity than QUIC-NewReno and a TCP-CUBIC reference, whereas NewReno matches BBRv2 at 0% loss. Findings support cross-layer control coupling sequence-aware prediction with QUIC pacing to stabilize queues and protect QoE. Deployment paths include MPQUIC integration, online adaptation via reinforcement learning, and evaluation across cellular, Wi-Fi, and satellite links."

    "abstract": "The threat of cyberattacks such as replay attacks, phishing, and credential theft has made classic authentication methods such as passwords and OTPs more vulnerable. Biometric authentication then became a safer alternative to these. Despite their uniqueness, physiological biometrics (e.g., fingerprint and face recognition) are static and susceptible to deepfake attacks, spoofing, and man-in-the-middle attacks. These weaknesses bring into focus the need for behavioral biometrics, including active user interaction for enhanced security. For corporate environments, our recommended method constructs a multifactor adaptive continuous authentication system through the fusion of keystroke dynamics, mouse movements, and touchpad usage. As opposed to traditional static authentication, our method is constantly monitoring user activity for inconsistencies and unauthorized access in real time. AI models such as Random Forest, One-Class SVM, Reinforcement Learning, and LSTM are applied within the system in order to improve detection precision and adapt to patterns of user behavior. In order to enhance company security without compromising ease of use, this ensures a safe, seamless, and non-intrusive authentication experience. This process is well-suited for modern company authentication because it provides robust protection against impersonation and cyberattacks."

An ensemble approach combines three advanced supervised learning models (TabNet, DynaBoost, LightGBM) was developed to discover more accurate predictive model and used majority voting mechanism to improve prediction performance. The dataset was prepared by using a variety of methodologies relating to the treatment of missing values, categorical encoding, and feature reducing methodologies to improve the quality of the model. Model assessment was guided by classification's common metrics like MSE, R2 Scores. The study indicates the relatively new area of data-driven methodologies can provide a collaborative approach to enhancing employee's quality of work life through early detection and intervention strategies."

Carry out a systematically constructed CNN architecture evaluation of benchmark data of diseased and healthy leaves of crops. The structure of the methodology comprises data preprocessing and transfer learning training of the model, optimization of hyperparameters and strict validation of performance with the assistance of cross-validation and the confusion matrix analysis. Comparative analyses are done with respect to accuracy, sensitivity to change with respect to variations in lighting and occlusion, and computational efficiency on different crops. Results indicate that deeper CNNs are more effective at the extraction of complex disease patterns, and they are better than shallow models in generalization, but can be practically deployed. Primarily, this analysis finds that a well-informed choice of ready-made CNN models can allow highly efficient and scalable crop disease detection systems to be built that allow farmers with timely interventions to reduce the economic and environmental ramifications without requiring new algorithmic work."

Sixth-generation (6G) wireless systems are envisioned as the first AI-native generation, embedding artificial intelligence as a core component of network architecture rather than a peripheral optimization tool. This paper explores the key enabling technologies that will underpin AI-native 6G, including Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS), Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTN), Joint Communication and Sensing (JCAS), Semantic Communications, and next-generation AI hardware accelerators. By integrating these pillars, 6G aims to deliver autonomous, adaptive, and service-oriented connectivity capable of meeting unprecedented performance and intelligence requirements.

A custom dataset of authentic fraudulent and legitimate messages was compiled, preprocessed, and tokenized using the DziriBERT tokenizer. The model was trained and evaluated with HuggingFace’s Trainer API, using accuracy and weighted F1-score as performance indicators. Experimental results from 5-fold cross-validation demonstrate that the fine-tuned DziriBERT model achieves exceptional performance with a mean accuracy of 99.0% ± 1.2% and weighted F1-score of 98.8% ± 1.3%, significantly outperforming AraBERT (95.24% accuracy) on the same task.

    "abstract": "Sentiment analysis remains a fundamental component of contemporary news environments, since tracking underlying public attitudes allows journals to recalibrate their strategies against accelerating information flows. Existing models, however, remain discreetly deficient; they neglect cadence cues, overlook temporal-narrative motifs, and silence dynamics in affective scale. To remediate these vulnerabilities, a two-tiered architecture anchored in complex artificial intelligence is advanced, whereby the second-tier algorithm directly inherits and amplifies tutorship from the first. The first module, Neuro- Helical Sentiment Tensorization (NHST), executes a hierarchical tensor factorization of dense semantic embeddings, extracting isotropic sub-manifolds whose affective delta enlightens a sample of minimally-annotated, dense news corpora. Aggrieved tensors are thus calibrated, denoised, and transformed to serve as precursor variables for the second leg, Chrono-Gradient Harmony Mapping (CGHM), a hybrid matrix of temporal harmonic gradients and spatiotemporal graph embeddings that concurrently realigns semantic flow over emergent network -line explosions. Graphical embeddings and tensors of time-scale and net affect carry parametrically healed norms. Reference signals are harvested at scale from the open-access Global Database of Events, Language, and Tone (GDELT), whose intra-dataset recalibrated sentiment tensors are overlaid against target periodicals to surface public affect intersections moment to moment, permitting cognitive and dialectical shifts to be retrospectively, thereby prospectively subjected to temporal echo and amplitude gauging. The present investigation furnishes a more vivid instance of allowing empirical phenomena to develop on their own terms than is evident in Barthet's earlier work. In this context, “to set” is synonymous with the agronomic act of scattering seeds across cultivated soil in order to germinate a communal expectation. This new analytic pipeline not only achieves higher granular fidelity in sentiment metric computations but simultaneously supplies profound illumination into the mutative capacity of contemporary journalism as a constructor of public judgment."

Data augmentation techniques such as sliding windows, Gaussian noise injections, and seasonal encoding are applied to enhance temporal pattern learning and model generalization. The framework evaluates multiple combinations of imputation, scaling, and augmentation strategies to identify optimal pipelines for each weather parameter. Results show that the best scenario, which combines Median imputation, Min-Max scaling, and Seasonal augmentation with a window size of 7, achieves the lowest RMSE of 0.0833 for temperature and an $\\mathbf{R}^{\\mathbf{2}}$ of 0.5151, indicating substantial variance explained. Wind speed also shows robust performance under similar preprocessing, whereas rainfall and relative humidity remain challenging to forecast due to high variability. The findings highlight the importance of systematic preprocessing and augmentation for improving predictive accuracy. This framework provides a robust and adaptive tool for supporting precision agriculture, enabling more informed management decisions amid varying weather conditions."

    "abstract": "Machine type communication (MTC) has become the main force of 5G communication and is the basic technology for the Internet of Things to achieve the \"Internet of Everything\". The traffic model for MTC is completely different from the traffic model for human-type communication, which not only needs to process a large number of devices, but also needs to consider the correlation between a large number of devices in time and space. In this paper, based on traditional Coupled Markov Modulated Poisson Process (CMMPP) a low-complexity source traffic model for MTC is constructed in the time-varying dynamic scenes of emergencies. The proposed model not only considers the impact of the speed of the emergency on the source traffic model, which meets the actual application scene, but also adopts the piecewise function to calculate the random variable, which reduces the computational complexity and has more application value. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed model."

The analysis employs Naïve Bayes (NB), CART, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) classifiers for predictions and important feature selection. The sample consists of 123 students enrolled in English preparation courses during Semester 2 of the 2021/2022 academic year. The input features included scores for 18 listening and 22 reading practice tests provided in these preparation courses. The output feature was students’ success or unsuccess in the final authentic English listening and reading exams. For listening exams, the NB model outperformed both CART and SVM, achieving an accuracy of 95.2% and an F1 score of 93.2%. Among all input features, scores from practice tests 18 and 5 emerged as the most influential factors in determining whether students passed or failed the listening exams. For reading exams, the NB and SVM models surpassed CART, each recording an accuracy of 93.6% and an F1 score of 93.4%. Similarly, practice tests 18 and 8 were identified as the most significant contributors to students’ success in the reading exam. These findings are expected to assist educational managers and course designers in enhancing exam preparation strategies, ultimately improving student performance through targeted practice content."

    "abstract": "Current high-precision object recognition algorithms in X-ray security inspection struggle with excessive parameters and computation, limiting deployment on mobile embedded devices. Lightweight models, however, often fail in complex scenarios. To strike a balance, this paper proposes YOLO-Light, an enhanced YOLOv11 detection model with four improvements. First, the backbone is replaced with RepHGNetv2, using depthwise and reparameterized light convolution to lower complexity while boosting speed. Second, a Lightweight Local Attention Convolutional Network (LLACN) is added to the feature pyramid to reduce high-frequency loss and improve downsampling. Third, an Efficient Single Branch Detection Head (ESBDH) employs group convolution and sharing to minimize resource use. Finally, a Contour Detail Enhancement Fusion CSPNetwork (CSP_CDEFN) suppresses noise and alleviates occlusion. YOLO-Light decreases parameters and computation by 30% and 27%, and achieves 88.8%, 69.8%, and 65.6% mAP@0.5 on OPIXray, CLCXray, and PIDray, slightly surpassing YOLOv11n. Experiments confirm higher efficiency and smaller model size than mainstream lightweight detectors."

    "abstract": "As the core high-temperature component of aero-engines, accurate surface temperature monitoring of turbine blades is essential for ensuring engine performance and reliability. With the continuous increase in turbine inlet temperature, traditional contact measurement methods (e.g., thermocouples and thermal paints) suffer from drawbacks such as temperature field disturbance and insufficient dynamic response. Meanwhile, non-contact multispectral radiation thermometry is severely limited by errors introduced from emissivity model assumptions, which constrain its measurement accuracy. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a dual-population hybrid optimization method that combines an Adaptive Differential Evolution (ADE) algorithm with a Fast Gradient Projection (FGP) algorithm for improving temperature and emissivity inversion accuracy and efficiency. Specifically, ADE dynamically adjusts the mutation factor and crossover rate to enhance global search ability and maintain population diversity, thus avoiding local optima, while FGP employs projection gradient descent with an adaptive step-size mechanism to achieve fast convergence within the feasible domain. The cooperative optimization effectively integrates global exploration and local acceleration. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves an average relative temperature error of only 1.1% across six typical emissivity models (decreasing, increasing, W-type, M-type, etc.), outperforming the conventional genetic algorithm (1.92%) and reducing inversion time by 37.5%. These results confirm the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed hybrid optimization method in multispectral temperature measurement, providing a promising approach for accurate thermometry of high-temperature components."

Companies that want to exploit the use of unstructured data in their decisionmaking processes find it a great challenge to exploit them due to the large amounts and forms that such form of data takes. This study presents a novel integration framework combining Optical Character Recognition (OCR) with advanced deep learning models-specifically Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-to facilitate the incorporation of unstructured data into Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS). Unstructured data, due to its diverse formats and volume, poses challenges for traditional RDBMS, which are optimized for structured inputs. To address these limitations, this research develops a classification-driven model capable of automatically extracting and structuring data from scanned documents such as receipts and invoices. The hybrid CRNN-BiLSTM architecture significantly enhances recognition accuracy, increasing performance from 83.2 % to 94.6 %, with corresponding gains in precision, recall, and F1-Score. The model was validated through a rigorous data science methodology encompassing data collection, model training, testing, and evaluation. These results demonstrate the model's effectiveness in transforming unstructured documents into structured formats, enabling improved decision-making and database performance. The study encourages future exploration into additional deep learning enhancements, model scalability, and cross-domain applicability."

Using recent developments in low-latency on-device neural models like Whisper.cpp, this framework applies speech recognition and pronunciation analysis on edge devices, which provides privacy in addition to real-time transcription and pronunciation analysis. The presented system combines acoustic modeling with feedback on a phoneme level and applies natural language processing (NLP) to evaluate prosody, tonal and articulation patterns. The edge deployment has been observed to respond faster compared to the cloud-based alternatives, minimize the cost of transmitting the data, and improve the autonomy of the learner.

Grounded in human-centered design principles, our solution adopts a Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) architecture that strategically positions AI as a cognitive augmentation tool while preserving administrative professionals’ decision-making authority. The system design emerges from a comprehensive ethnographic study of current practices at Khon Kaen University, employing formal workflow analysis methodologies. Our mixed-methods evaluation protocol, theoretically anchored in the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), incorporates a longitudinal four-week deployment study with ten participating executive secretaries. The paper makes three significant contributions to the field of intelligent administrative systems: a systematic identification and characterization of inefficiencies in traditional executive scheduling practices, An innovative HITL interaction paradigm for AI-assisted calendar management, an empirically-validated evaluation framework for assessing such systems in organizational contexts The implemented prototype demonstrates both practical efficacy and theoretical significance, offering a generalizable model for enhancing operational efficiency in complex institutional settings through human-AI collaboration."

Bearing faults in machines can have a catastrophic effect on system performance during operation, leading to significant risk to human life. Therefore, early fault prediction plays a vital role in averting accidents and unexpected failures, minimizing safety hazards and ensuring secure working environment. This study introduces a novel approach for detection of 4 types of machine faults (inner race, outer race, cage and ball) in addition to healthy condition. The process begins by segmenting the acoustic signals into total of 40 segments for each class. Next, we extracted Linear Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (LFCCs) from these segmented signals. To address class imbalance problem in real-world datasets, Adaptive Synthetic Sampling (ADASYN) was applied to generate synthetic samples for minority classes. Then, we classified the faults using these cepstral domain features as input to different classifiers. Among different classifiers, Fine KNN (FKNN) provided the highest accuracy of $99.5 \\backslash \\%$, demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying various bearing faults."

This study presents an AI-driven framework for detecting and explaining inattention in virtual classrooms by leveraging multimodal computer vision features, including face detection, pose estimation, hand tracking, and mobile phone detection. A dataset of 4,000 frame-level observations was used to evaluate three classification models-XGBoost, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression-across Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1score, and ROC-AUC metrics. XGBoost achieved the highest accuracy (99.49%), followed closely by Random Forest (99.15%), while Logistic Regression provided a strong baseline (95.00%). Model interpretability was addressed using SHAP, permutation importance, and a consensus ranking, which consistently identified forward head orientation (pose_forward) and mobile phone presence as primary indicators of distraction, head rotation angles and phone detection. These findings support earlier studies examining the relationship between engagement (posture and device); by using a model that is both predictive of student engagement and provides transparency into how those predictions are made, the proposed method combines technical credibility with practical knowledge for educators to develop specific methods to keep their students engaged over time in an online environment."

This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a science e-module incorporating the Mega Mendung batik-making tradition in enhancing students’ critical thinking and cultural awareness. The study employed a quasi-experimental design with a pretest-posttest control group, involving 61 eighth-grade students (30 in the experimental group and 31 in the control group) selected through random sampling. Data were collected using critical thinking and cultural awareness tests and analyzed using paired and independent sample t-tests, along with effect size calculations. The results showed a very large effect size for critical thinking (d=3.14) and cultural awareness (d=2.31) in the experimental group. These findings suggest that integrating local cultural heritage into digital science modules within an IBL framework significantly promotes both cognitive and affective development. This approach offers a contextualized and culturally responsive model for 21st-century science education, bridging scientific literacy with cultural identity."

An information fusion technique, which was designed for low-power operation, incorporated brain signals of 17 subjects (8 were autistic) recorded through a simple four-channel system for alpha band filtering. The initial trial employed straightforward computations such as power spectral density and Hjorth, which resulted in about 64% energy saving. ASD was instrumental in categorizing ASD cases, and by using simple math, the performance was enhanced further. We got MRI scans of the inner ear through fixed angles and principal component analysis to build a model for comparing the shapes. The metrics of evaluation are comparing our model with the others, CLEWE, GCMEP, and MSGSE. We relied on the ROC curve of (1.0), CMRR of (10 Hz to 31.6 kHz), noise cancellation of (0.65 μVrms), variable gain of (80 dB near 316 Hz), comparative ROC curve of (1.0), and precision & recall of (1.0) to validate our findings."

    "abstract": "The rapid expansion of social media platforms has made multi-label emotion classification an essential task for applications such as sentiment analysis, conversational agents, and mental health monitoring. However, the highly imbalanced distribution of emotions in datasets like GoEmotions creates a trade-off between global accuracy and fairness across classes. This paper investigates the comparative performance of Focal Loss and Asymmetric Loss (ASL) when applied to RoBERTaLarge. Theoretical formulations of Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE), Focal Loss, and ASL are presented to explain their optimization mechanisms under imbalance conditions. Empirical experiments on the GoEmotions dataset demonstrate that Focal Loss achieves superior Micro-F1 (0.602), reflecting higher global accuracy, while ASL attains superior Macro-F1 (0.502), emphasizing fairness across rare and minority emotions. These findings highlight that no single loss function is universally optimal, and the choice should align with application requirements global accuracy for large-scale sentiment tasks versus fairness for socially sensitive systems like mental health monitoring. The study further discusses implications for responsible AI and alignment with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs 3 and 9), while suggesting future directions such as exploring ensemble methods and adaptive loss parameter tuning."

    "abstract": "This research introduces a framework for comparative evaluation of human-curated versus AI-generated affective images using a multimodal AI agent. The dataset (N=80 pictures) includes a selection of 40 human-curated images from the Open Affective Standardized Image Set (OASIS), and a set of 40 synthetic images generated specifically for this study. The synthetic dataset was created by prompting the “GPT Image 1” model, a specialized image generation model built on GPT-4o, with the goal to represent four target emotional states—Excitement, Frustration, Boredom, and Relaxation. A custom AI agent was deployed to rate all images along the valence and arousal dimensions of the affective circumplex model. Statistical analyses were performed to compare: (1) human vs agent image ratings for OASIS and (2) the agent’s ratings of the AI-generated image set and OASIS. The findings indicate that the AI agent reliably aligned with the human ratings and that GPT-4o can serve as both a generator and evaluator of affective content, thus supporting scalable, human-free validation pipelines. This approach contributes to the field of affective computing by enabling rapid generation and analysis of emotionevoking stimuli, with potential applications in experimental psychology and mental health."

    "abstract": "Retinoblastoma is a pediatric eye cancer that is rare and life-threatening, but must be diagnosed correctly and at the correct time to save a child vision and increase survival rates. Older screening techniques are based on manual analysis of RetCam and fundus images which tend to be subjective and liable to variation between different observers. Current deep learning models are high-performing in terms of classification but are black-box models, which cannot be interpreted and identify lesions precisely. This paper addresses these shortcomings by introducing an Rb-AttnX which is based on EfficientNet- B4 feature extraction, Convolutional Block Attention Modules, and hybrid Grad-CAM++ visualizations. The structure uses the dual-task learning to classify and localize lesions simultaneously, which guarantees the accuracy of diagnosis and clinical interpretation. Rb-AttnX was found to perform better than its baseline models with 98.9% accuracy, 99.1% sensitivity, and 99.3% ROC-AUC on multi-source datasets. The system enables ophthalmologists to interpret model predictions and make sound decisions by giving them visual attention maps, which are consistent with expert annotations. This renders Rb-AttnX an applicable instrument in pediatric oncology in the real-world, to assist in the accurate, interpretable, and timely diagnosis of retinoblastoma."

This paper proposes a unified framework that systematically examines model blind spots by constructing a counterfactual vision-language evaluation benchmark. It designs a dynamic, adaptively weighted fusion mechanism for input-level modal weight allocation and introduces a decision chain evaluation protocol to trace and quantify the logical consistency of specialised decisions. Experiments on medical imaging diagnosis and autonomous driving safety tasks demonstrate that this approach significantly enhances model robustness against out-of-distribution and adversarial samples, optimises multimodal fusion efficiency, and generates decision evidence comprehensible to human experts. This work provides systematic support for the evaluation, optimisation, and trustworthy certification of multimodal large models in professional domains."

This study introduces an advanced SegNet-based architecture tailored for skin lesion segmentation, aiming to overcome issues like image variability, noise interference, and overfitting. The model incorporates deeper convolutional layers, employs dropout regularization at varying rates, and adopts a comprehensive evaluation approach using metrics such as Intersection over Union (IoU) and Dice Coefficient to enhance segmentation performance and generalization. The model is tested on the PH2_resized dataset and outperforms traditional models like U-Net and ResNet50, with an IoU of 97.02% and an accuracy of 96.83%. The novelty of this approach lies in the combination of regularization techniques, advanced feature extraction, and comprehensive evaluation metrics, which enhance robustness and performance of the segmentation process.

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the state estimation problem for a class of nonlinear stochastic systems that switch among multiple models. The system under consideration has the following characteristics: the dynamic characteristics of each subsystem are unknown and the Markov transition probabilities are imprecise. To achieve precise and low-latency state estimation, the proposed algorithm trains on the pre-prepared offline dataset through Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), thereby obtaining the unknown sub-pattern dynamic model. And combine it with the interacting multiple model particle filtering (IMMPF) and the adaptive transition probability matrix (TPM) to quickly adjust the estimation structure during model switching. The GPR has implemented a fully data-driven framework, enabling it to predict different update patterns of the target. A correction function is added to adaptively adjust the TPM by using variations in model probabilities. It can enhance the probability convergence trend of the correct model to improve the overall accuracy of the estimation. Finally, the overall algorithm is implemented through simulation software and our proposed method is compared with traditional IMMPF. The IMMPF is divided into two cases. In one case, only a ground-truth dynamic system is used to update the statement but the TPM is inaccurate. In the other case, both an adaptive TPM and a ground-truth dynamic system are present. The results show that, even in the absence of a known system dynamic model and precise TPM, this method still achieves quite good estimation performance."

Traditional time series analysis approaches, such as the Transformer model and its variants, rely on the self-attention mechanism to capture long-range dependency. However, as time series grow in length and complexity, these models often suffer from decreased learning efficiency, trend prediction delays, and the failure to capture trend mutations and local features. To address these challenges, this study constructs a dual-branch forecasting network model, termed DBTF, to extract high-frequency details and abrupt local trend changes that traditional models often overlook. The model also provides stable compensation in scenarios with blurred data boundaries or pronounced noise to alleviate forecast biases. Experiments performed on several datasets that cover domains like energy, transport, and weather forecasting have confirmed the superior performance of our new model in long-sequence time series forecasting over other methods."

Existing studies suggest that writing behavior, as a form of information expression and cognitive practice, may partially reflect an individual’s creative thinking traits. This study employed the iBCM framework to model learners’ writing processes, extract sequence-based features, and construct regression models to explore the intrinsic relationship between writing behavior patterns and scientific creativity. The results indicate that iBCM effectively identifies behavioral sequence features that can be used to predict scientific creativity levels. Among the tested models, the stacking model achieved the best predictive performance (MAE =2.84, R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>= 0.735), using ridge regression, XGBoost, and GradientBoosting as base learners and Lasso regression as the meta-learner. Further analysis ranked the importance of writing behavior features and aggregated them by their corresponding scientific creativity dimensions, revealing that the “Elaboration” dimension contributed the most. This study demonstrates the potential of writing behaviors in the assessment of scientific creativity and offers a novel methodological approach for process-oriented evaluation."

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of the offshore wind power industry in recent years, its effects on local social, economic and ecological environments have attracted widespread attention. Therefore, a timely understanding of the development status of offshore wind power, specifically, offshore wind turbines (OWTs) is crucial for the healthy and sustainable development of the offshore wind power industry. However, existing OWT detection methods often struggle to achieve timely, high-precision end-to-end detection of OWTs. To address this, in this study, an OWT detection network (OWT-DNet) based on multimodal remote sensing data is proposed. This network integrates Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery and Sentinel-2 optical imagery, effectively addressing the insufficient semantic information inherent in single-modal data for OWT detection. Experiments across five global test regions demonstrate that OWT-DNet achieves detection accuracy, recall, and comprehensive evaluation metrics that exceed 99.9%. Furthermore, OWT-DNet demonstrates outstanding detection performance under complex weather conditions. Comparative and ablation experiments validate the network's superior capability in OWT detection tasks. Overall, timely, high-precision end-to-end OWT detection is achieved for the first time on the basis of multimodal remote sensing data. Furthermore, an inaugural multimodal OWT sample dataset is established, laying a solid foundation for future OWT detection research."

    "abstract": "Serverless platforms are widely adopted for deploying applications due to their autoscaling capabilities and pay-asyou- go billing models. These platforms execute an application's functions inside ephemeral containers and scale the number of containers based on incoming request rates. To meet service level objectives (SLOs), they often over-provision resources by maintaining warm containers or rapidly spawning new ones during traffic bursts. However, this strategy frequently leads to inefficient resource utilization, especially during periods of low activity. Prior research addresses this issue through intelligent scheduling, lightweight virtualization, and containersharing mechanisms. More recent work aims to improve resource utilization by remodeling the execution of a function within a container to better separate compute and I/O stages. Despite these improvements, existing approaches often introduce delays during execution and induce memory pressure under traffic bursts. In this paper, we present Styx, a novel workflow engine that enhances resource utilization by intelligently decoupling compute and I/O stages. Styx employs a fetch latency predictor that uses real-time system metrics from both the serverless node and the remote storage server to accurately estimate prefetch operations, ensuring input data is available exactly when needed. Furthermore, it offloads the output data upload operation from a container to a host-side data service, thereby efficiently managing provisioned memory. Our approach improves the overall memory allocation by 32.6% when running all the serverless workflows simultaneously when compared to Dataflower + Truffle. Additionally, this method improves the tail latency and the mean latency of a workflow by an average of 26.3% and 21%, respectively."

    "abstract": "A key challenge in designing medium-frequency transformers (MFTs) is determining adequate insulation distances, especially as the insulation occupies a substantial fraction of the overall transformer volume. To ensure both efficient thermal management and high gravimetric and volumetric power density, these distances must be carefully optimized to be just sufficient for reliable operation. This paper presents a generalized framework to obtain such distances, suitable for integration into transformer design optimization routines. The framework employs a two-step procedure to compute universal design curves, enabling straightforward selection of the required insulation distance for a given design voltage. Using a foil-wound, air-insulated MFT as a case study and a physics-based model for discharge inception in air, a prototype is designed with a discharge level well below 10 pC at a design voltage of 8.5 kV. Compared to conventional design methods, the proposed approach permits up to six times higher design voltage while maintaining a safety margin exceeding 100% relative to the maximum one-minute withstand voltage."

    "abstract": "The investigation looks at how deep learning models can be used to guess what the air quality will be like. PM2.5, PM10, NOx, SO2, and CO are the five key things that affect air quality control. If we want to keep people healthy and informed, as well as make progress in controlling air pollution, especially in cities, we need to be able to correctly predict the air quality. Traditional machine learning methods can't correctly guess the quality of the air because they can't deal with the complex nonlinearities in environmental data. Different types of deep learning, such as CNNs, RNNs, and LSTMs (Long Short Term Memory networks), can help solve these issues. To make models for predicting air quality, this study looked at past data on air quality, weather, and place. There were factors for both shortterm and long-term air quality in these models. We also used a mix of well-known machine learning models, like CNN-LSTM, to include connections between places and times. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) helped us add more data because we were having trouble because we didn't have enough of it. Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) were used to check how well the models worked. The Bidirectional Stacked LSTM model worked the best out of all of them. Really good at guessing what the air quality will be like, and it can be used to guess the air quality almost in real time. We thought that models could be better if they had more factors, were kept up to date, and were easier for people making decisions to understand. Some of us think that our research shows that deep learning is a good way to help keep the air clean."

    "abstract": "Widespread adoption of Blockchain Technology has emphasized smart contracts as vital units of digital transactions. In the brief history of smart contracts, significant losses have occurred owing to unexplained vulnerabilities in blockchain-loaded contracts. Smart contract vulnerabilities endanger blockchain technology's viability and confidence. Blockchain-based applications rely on smart contracts to automate and trustlessly execute agreements. Their immutable and self-executing nature leaves them vulnerable to security vulnerabilities, which have caused major financial losses in decentralized platforms. Traditional static and symbolic analysis tools often miss sophisticated or obfuscated vulnerabilities, resulting in insufficient coverage or excessive false positives. These restrictions led the investigation of Deep Learning (DL) algorithms for detecting vulnerabilities in smart contract crucial since they can learn complicated patterns from code representations without manual feature engineering. Deep learning based methods for detecting vulnerabilities in smart contracts are thoroughly evaluated. We rigorously assess state-of-the-art DL models including BiLSTM, BiGRU, CNNLSTM, GCN, and CodeBERT using publicly available dataset. We provide a taxonomy of DL-based detection techniques and standardize performance criteria including accuracy, F1-score, and detection latency. Experimental results show model architecture trade-offs in detection, computational efficiency, and generalization."

To overcome the shortcomings of X-ray detection by a human radiologist, we therefore developed a more sophisticated deep learning approach to automatically identify features of rheumatoid arthritis in hand radiographs. Preprocessing consisted of standardizing all 480 images to 512512 pixels, and contrast enhancement, from a total of 4812 images from 1130 patients. A residual network with a channel-spatial attention mechanism was trained with 3300 images, validated with 812 images, and tested with 700 images. The model achieved a sensitivity of 93.41%, specificity of 92.08% and accuracy of 93.02% outperforming a baseline residual network by 5.17%. These results provide a dependable radiographic inference to guide the initial clinical decision."

    "abstract": "In the field of computer vision, accurate estimation of 3D human poses and shapes plays a vital role in applications such as motion analysis, virtual try-on, and human-computer interaction. While most existing methods rely on monocular RGB images and deep learning regression networks, they often suffer from ambiguities caused by occlusions, self-similasrity, and missing visual cues. Leveraging publicly available multi-view image datasets offers an effective way to mitigate these limitations and improve reconstruction accuracy.In this work, we propose a novel framework for 3D human reconstruction that jointly lever-ages multi-view consistency and iterative refinement of SMPL parameters. Specifically, our method takes images from multiple viewpoints as input, extracts SMPL pose and shape parameters from each view using a CNN-based regressor, and integrates them through a multi-view parameter fusion strategy. To further refine the fused parameters, we introduce an Online Evolutive Learning(OEL) mechanism, which applies a SMPLify-inspired optimization process to iteratively minimize a reprojection-based evaluation loss without requiring ground-truth 3D annotations. This iterative optimization loop progressively enhances structural plausibility and alignment consistency across views. The im-proved parameters are then used to optimize the CNN regressor in an online evolutive manner, forming a feedback loop that continuously improves the model generalization ability."

Meanwhile, Reinforcement Learning (RL), as an important branch of machine learning, learns optimal decision making strategies through continuous interaction between an intelligent and its environment to maximize long-term returns. Integrating LSTM into a reinforcement learning framework not only enhances the performance of intelligences in complex sequential decision-making tasks, but also significantly improves their decision-making ability in scenarios requiring long-term memory and strategic planning. In this study, based on the MAPPO algorithm, we use LSTM networks to simultaneously learn both strategy and value functions, which not only helps intelligences make more rational decisions, but also can more accurately assess the expected value of future rewards, thus guiding the learning of intelligences. We train and test in a multi-intelligent body environment MPE (multi-agent particle environment), and the final experimental results show that compared with the MAPPO algorithm, the LSTM-MAPPO algorithm improves on the final reward."

Centering on the four core functional requirements of cognitive rehabilitation for autistic children, the system is designed with eight training programs categorized into four modules: computational ability training, focused ability training, recognition ability training, and memory ability training. The system adopts a gaze estimation model based on Vision Transformer (ViT) and Context Broadcasting. By introducing a context broadcasting mechanism to enhance the global correlation of features, and integrating a mixed-scale guidance module to optimize the extraction accuracy of local eye features, the system effectively improves gaze localization precision in complex training scenarios, providing objective data support for training effect evaluation.The game-based training process enhances children’s initiative in communication. After each training session, an automatic training report is generated to support historical data review; based on actual training progress, pie charts and line graphs are generated to track rehabilitation trends, facilitating clinicians’ analysis and interpretation. This system represents an AI-driven exploration of innovative rehabilitation approaches for autism. It not only meets the usability requirements of both hospital-based and home-based rehabilitation but also eliminates the need for continuous involvement of specialized clinicians, effectively alleviating the shortage of psychiatric medical resources. It serves as a novel AI-based exploration of autism rehabilitation strategies, providing a practical solution to the limitations of traditional rehabilitation models."

However, for complex products such as electronic control units (ECUs), simulation times can extend from several hours to days, diminishing the advantages of simulation. A significant bottleneck arises from dielectric formulation when using the Method of Moments (MoM) for electromagnetic solvers. This study addresses the challenge of lengthy simulation times by employing multi-fidelity modeling. We propose a low-fidelity model that conducts simulations without dielectric materials to generate data sets, while a high-fidelity model incorporates dielectric effects. This dual approach enables a substantial reduction in simulation time, achieving speed improvements of 5 to 10 times, thereby enhancing the efficiency of the EMC simulation process. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach through a patch antenna simulation, showcasing its practical application and benefits in real-world scenarios."

    "abstract": "One of the main problems facing players in the present retail business is product counterfeiting. Products that are Counterfeit products are low-quality copies of authentic goods. Currently, because counterfeit goods can fit in with the market, it is difficult to tell them apart. Some unaffiliated parties attempt to take advantage of a legitimate business by creating inferior replicas in order to increase their revenue. The market is impacted by counterfeiting, as are the company's reputation, revenue, and earnings. To stop and deal with product counterfeiting, a variety of techniques have been used, including machine learning, artificial intelligence, RFID (Radio-Frequency Identification) tags, QR code-based approaches, etc. However, each of them has drawbacks of its own. For example, QR codes can be used to convert authentic products into counterfeit ones, and artificial intelligence and machine learning require a significant amount of processing power to operate. There isn't a workable solution for this problem as of now. We are experimenting with a method in this project by using Blockchain technology. Blockchain technology notifies the user about the product's legitimacy and can be used to distinguish between real and phony goods. With the use of QR codes, we intend to retain product supply chain data at every level of a product's transaction with a new party. With its many benefits, including its decentralized nature and lack of a single point of failure, blockchain technology is a useful tool for preventing counterfeiting. Blocks of immutable information are used to store it. Ethereum was chosen because it allows smart contracts, which are required for automated product verification. Furthermore, it is widely used, and it is accompanied by powerful developer tools such as Hardhat, MetaMask, and Ethers.js, which facilitate development and integration. Furthermore, Ethereum ensures immutability, decentralization, and transparency, all of which are crucial in counterfeit detection."

This paper presents a complete VHDL-based implementation of an STM-1 multiplexer and demultiplexer fully compliant with ITU-T G.707. The design introduces a hierarchical coding methodology to improve portability across FPGA/ASIC platforms and integrates faultresilient synchronization to enhance reliability. Functional verification is performed using a pseudo-random binary sequence (PRBS) testbench, enabling end-to-end bit error monitoring across regenerator, multiplex, and path layers. The architecture was synthesized on an Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA, achieving the ITU-T line rate of 155.52 Mbps while utilizing only 25.03% LUTs and 16.48% FFs. Comparative benchmarking against state-of-the-art designs demonstrates superior logic efficiency, competitive throughput, and robust error detection. Although FPGA-based power estimation was higher than ASIC counterparts, this is attributed to prototyping artifacts and can be mitigated through low-power design techniques in future hardware migrations."

Simulation results demonstrate that the system delivers a rated power of 3.036 MW under standard irradiance and 1.54 MW under partial irradiance, with the MPPT achieving 99.6% tracking efficiency in both conditions. The total harmonic distortion (THD) of grid current remains below 1%, confirming compliance with IEEE 519 standards. The proposed configuration offers a reliable and efficient approach for large-scale PV integration with robust operation under variable solar conditions."

    "abstract": "The continuous growth of extensive network infrastructures and cloud computing platforms has resulted in a quick rise in both the number and complexity of cyber-attacks. With data that comes from many sources increasing at an exponential rate, conventional centralized Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) run into difficulties surrounding communication latency, privacy leakage, and scalability issues inherent in big data. This work presents a Multi-Cloud Federated Learning Architecture with Homomorphic Encryption (HE) and Differential Privacy (DP) for secure and adaptive cyber-attack detection. In the proposed architecture, each cloud node performs local training independently using the Improved Recursive Feature Elimination (IRFE) technique for effective feature selection and an ensemble Deep Belief Network-Recurrent Neural Network (DBN-RNN) for effective intrusion classification. Encrypted model parameters are simply accumulated at a global server using an adaptive synchronization strategy which minimizes communication delay while status of convergence is preserved. The experiments on three benchmark datasets, namely_CSE-CIC-IDS2018, UNSW-NB15, and TON IoT, validated that the proposed framework has 98.2% accuracy, 0.985 F1-score, and 93% decreased privacy leakage when compared to the conventional centralized deep learning-based IDSs. The incorporation of HE and DP improves the confidentiality of shared model parameters, while ensuring strong robustness against adversarial inference. Therefore, this framework presents a scalable, high secure, privacy ticketed, and high-performance model for the detection of cyber-attacks in multi-cloud environments."

This paper investigates the roles of individual joints in resisting impacts and the overall anti-disturbance capability of the human body through multiple balancing strategies. We first describe the PD controllers. Subsequently, various simplified multistage inverted pendulum models are established, and corresponding balancing strategy controllers are designed. Genetic Algorithm (GA) is utilized to optimize the controller parameters. Simulation results demonstrate that: (1) The balance ability would be stronger with more joint involved; (2) The knee joint enhances resistance to sustained external forces by lowering the center of mass; (3) The shoulder joint significantly shortens balance adjustment time by 4-50%. These findings provide insights for improving the balance control of bipedal robots under external disturbances."

To overcome such constraints, this paper presents an AI-based customer preference analysis framework that incorporates dynamically scored preference scoring, hybrid recommendation modeling, and real-time transportation simulation. The system relies on machine learning and reinforcement learning algorithms to process booking history, behavioral attributes, and user feedback, and perform adaptive personalization. Experimental analysis shows high performance: the preference scoring model scored above 92% in a variety of booking situations, and the real-time simulation layer claimed a booking efficiency ratio of 0.94, seat utilization of 85% and revenue increase of 21.4%. Also, customer satisfaction rose to 90.3% relative to baseline systems. These findings confirm that the offered AI-based solution can significantly improve personalization, the efficiency of operations, and decision-making in online bus ticket booking systems."

Results indicate strong reported accuracies on datasets such as BoT-IoT and CICDDoS2019; however, critical gaps remain, including dataset imbalance, lack of reproducibility, limited reporting of system-level metrics, and under-explored adversarial robustness. To address these limitations, we propose an evaluation framework integrating both classification (Precision, Recall, F1, ROC-AUC) and system-level measures (latency, memory, energy efficiency). The review concludes by highlighting proposed research priorities, including lightweight edge-compatible models, federated privacy-preserving learning, adaptive detection under concept drift, and robustness against adversarial manipulation"

    "abstract": "Wireless sensor networks(WSN) are widely used in various fields, and the battery energy of WSN nodes is limited, which limits the lifetime of WSN. Therefore, it is important to reduce node's energy consumption and prolong the lifetime of WSN. Therefore, this paper proposes a clustering routing algorithm (PSO-EHO), which take advantages of PSO algorithm with EHO algorithm in cluster head's selection. It strengthens the ability of global optimization and local development, improves the accuracy of cluster head (CH) selection, avoids the PSO algorithm falling into local optimums, and prevents the slow convergence speed of EHO algorithm. In the routing phase, our algorithm designs an optimal relay strategy, which is triggered when the residual energy of nodes was low or the distance between the cluster head and the base station exceeded the threshold. This strategy constructs the graph structure and considers the residual energy of nodes and other factors, to calculate the weight of edges. The data transmission path between the node and the base station was selected according to the principle of weight minimization. The simulation results show that compared with LEACH, PSO_Kmeans and ICSSA, our algorithm significantly prolongs the network lifetime, reduces the network energy consumption."

Today, due to the invention of artificial intelligence, artificial intelligence has been integrated with medical imaging and biosignals to predict diseases reliably. The proposed project will create a multimodal deep learning model that will integrate retinal fundus imaging and electrocardiogram (ECG) data to identify the risk of cardiovascular disease. The aim of the current study was to obtain the structural and vascular characteristics of cardiovascular risk by deriving the image characteristics through a high-resolution version of the fundus image with the convolutional neural network (CNN). At the same time, the ECG signals are analyzed with the help of a 1D convolutional neural network (CNN) based on long short-term memory (LSTM) network blocks to locate the spatial and morphological alterations which are connected to the cardiac abnormality. Results of both modalities are normalized into certain probability scores and weighted averaging technique makes one prediction. The model does not only give a binary present/absent CVD, but it also gives scores that can be interpreted individually to each modality to improve the level of transparency. Performance is evaluated with the help of accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC to ensure that it is appropriately evaluated on a range of levels. Using the option of visualizing various ophthalmic imaging and cardiac signal analysis, the current paper will prove that a scalable and efficient solution to non-invasive screening of cardiovascular diseases can be utilized to assist clinicians in their diagnosis and intervention on time."

    "abstract": "Knowledge graph completion (KGC) plays a pivotal role in addressing data incompleteness and inconsistency in domain-specific knowledge representations, particularly in safety-critical fields such as electrical power systems. This paper presents a novel hybrid model, termed EntityFusion-KGC (Entity Description Fusion–Knowledge Graph Completion), which integrates both textual semantic information and graph structural features to enhance KGC performance within the context of electrical safety applications. The proposed architecture encompasses four core components. First, an improved BERT-based encoding mechanism is developed to extract domain-specific semantic representations from unstructured entity descriptions. Second, graph topology is modeled using the TransE algorithm to capture latent relational features among entities. Third, a weighted fusion module, incorporating a graph attention network (GAT), adaptively aggregates semantic and structural embeddings by assigning dynamic importance weights. This fusion mechanism facilitates effective multi-source representation learning. Finally, the ENTITYFUSION-KGC model is empirically evaluated on a domain-curated electrical safety knowledge graph through comprehensive link prediction and entity classification experiments. Experimental results indicate that the model outperforms several benchmark methods in terms of Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) and Hits@K metrics. The integration of enriched textual semantics and attention-guided structural features demonstrates a significant improvement in reasoning accuracy and robustness. The proposed model contributes a scalable and interpretable solution to enhance knowledge completion in electrical safety domains, with potential applicability in broader safety-critical knowledge systems."

This survey synthesizes research developments from 2019 through 2025, examining peer-reviewed literature across architectural frameworks, hardware deployment scenarios, and algorithmic optimization techniques. This study establishes a comprehensive taxonomy encompassing five distinct architectural paradigms-namely client-server, peer-to-peer, hierarchical, hybrid, and split learning configurations-while systematically evaluating their respective trade-offs regarding scalability, computational efficiency, and operational robustness under resource constraints. The analysis reveals that communication and computation optimization approaches yield substantial resource reductions, though maintaining accuracy under nonIID data distributions remains challenging. Privacy and security frameworks demonstrate theoretical soundness yet impose computational burdens that constrain practical implementation on battery-operated devices. Domain-specific applications exhibit varying maturity trajectories, with healthcare and smart city deployments advancing while autonomous vehicle integration faces regulatory and certification barriers. Persistent gaps are identified in standardized evaluation frameworks, longitudinal stability assessment, and seamless integration with legacy edge infrastructure."

A mathematical optimization framework is developed to minimize both operational costs and frequency deviations in the interconnected AC grids. The model incorporates multiple types of balancing resources, including contract-based reserves, market-based reserves, and local converter adjustments, each with distinct cost and capacity limits. Converter trip events are modeled using redistribution coefficients $\\omega _{ter,i}^m$, and power assurance coefficients ω<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">ass,i</inf> , enabling flexible allocation of surplus or deficit power among remaining converter stations. All monetary values in this study are expressed in JPY. Simulation results demonstrate that, for representative operating points, the total adjustment cost can be reduced from 21.166 million JPY at a frequency-minimization case to 18.438 million JPY at a cost-minimization case, while maintaining AC frequency deviations. Specifically, the frequency-minimization case reduces the maximum frequency deviation from 14.9545 Hz to 8.9500 Hz.

These modern threats utilize stealthy, dispersed actions that readily evade single-point detection, making effective correlation essential. Traditional correlation approaches, relying on rule-based or knowledge-driven systems, suffer from inherent limitations in adaptability, flexibility, and scalability against the rapidly evolving threat landscape. Machine Learning (ML) offers a powerful alternative, providing adaptive, data-driven solutions capable of learning novel attack patterns without the need for extensive, explicit expert rules. This paper provides review of the state-of-the-art ML-based alert correlation approaches. We critically analyse the methodologies based on their input encoding and features, underlying model architectures, use of key benchmark datasets, and established evaluation strategies. Finally, we identify emerging trends and highlight significant open issues to guide future research in developing next-generation alert correlation systems."

Therefore, a new linear-sigmoid attention is proposed and introduced into the PaiNN(Polarizable Atom Interaction Neural Network) model to deal with the non neutral singlet structure particles and correct the long-range interaction force. Moreover, the linear attention takes into account both computational efficiency and feature diversity. In addition, from the point of view of physical chemistry, this paper also enhanced the expression ability of atomic local charge in the model, that is, the electronegativity of atoms was introduced as a priori knowledge to modulate the expression of atomic local charge, so as to further improve the expression ability of the model. The experimental results show that on the carbene and Ag3 datasets, the accuracy of the new linear attention is similar to that of softmax attention with high computational complexity, and the electronegativity correction further improves the performance of the model; On the carbon chain and Ag clusters datasets, compared with the existing machine learning force field, the proposed machine learning force field combining linear attention and electronegativity correction reduces the root mean square error (RMSE) of force by 6.27% and 64.2%, respectively."

Using a high-fidelity “Digital Twin of Failure” approach, a synthetic dataset was generated for a SiC-based inverter under normal operation and six distinct, physically-grounded fault modes, including critical thermo-mechanical and semiconductor degradation effects. The trained HDF, enhanced with an attention mechanism for inherent explainability, demonstrated a macro-averaged F1-Score of 0.98 on an unseen test set. The framework provides not only a direct, actionable link between an observed EMI failure and its physical source but also offers a pathway to model transparency through Explainable AI (XAI). This work further proposes a concrete strategy to bridge the sim-to-real gap, significantly accelerating the automotive EMC debugging and qualification process."

    "abstract": "The recognition of keratoconus is emerging as a focus of interest in contemporary Ophthalmology, which is important because a timely identification of the disease can prevent severe vision loss and intervene in the disease process, long before it reaches an advanced stage of risk to vision. This study assesses the role of artificial intelligence, namely modern deep learning algorithms, in the development of systems for automated clinician-based classification of corneal disease based on topography images. After precisely labelling a corpus of corneal topography scans, a number of processing techniques, normalization, and augmentation are employed to improve the quality of the topography scans and therefore enhance the efficacy and robustness of the deep learning models. Novel Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures are evaluated, that recognized subtle changes in the shape and curvature of the cornea, which traditional diagnostic techniques may not recognize. The importance of preparation steps which are supported by data preparation, preprocessing and feature extraction phases to identify clinically-relevant features/patterns in the corneal maps, is emphasized. A process for selecting and tuning high performing models: ResNet, EfficientNet and Dense Net, models which can be used on many other medical imaging classification and diagnostic tasks, has been outlined. Validation methods against frameworks with full training and testing of the models have also been provided."

    "abstract": "Real-time video manipulation detection and content authentication have emerged as critical challenges in the era of AI-generated media. The proliferation of deepfakes, adversarial attacks, and synthetic video content threatens information integrity and digital trust. In this paper, we propose VIDSEC-Net, a novel hybrid AI framework that integrates transformer-based vision encoders, adversarially trained classifiers, and spatiotemporal consistency models to detect manipulations in compressed, streamed, and archived video data. Unlike existing solutions, VIDSEC-Net is optimized for edge deployment and supports zero-trust environments through embedded cryptographic watermark validation and federated update mechanisms. We begin by formulating the mathematical problem of video tampering as a dynamic multivariate anomaly detection task across temporal frames and motion vectors. Our architecture leverages hierarchical attention across frame sequences, coupled with frequency-domain residual analysis, enabling high-precision detection even under post-processing or compression. The system is validated on multiple benchmark datasets (FaceForensics++, DeepfakeTIMIT, DFDC, and YouTube-Forensics) and demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in accuracy, F1-score, and adversarial robustness. In addition to performance metrics, we analyze VID-SEC-Net's real-time throughput on edge platforms (NVIDIA Jetson, Apple M1, Intel Movidius) and benchmark against transformer-lite and CNN baselines. Ethical implications, including potential misuse and dataset bias, are discussed, and we propose a set of deployment guidelines for privacy-preserving and trustworthy media verification. Our contributions offer a secure, scalable, and explainable AI-based solution for video forensics, setting the foundation for future research in trustaware media processing."

In this paper, an artificial intelligence (AI)-aided design and optimization methodology of epoxy composites reinforced with a hybrid blend of graphene oxide (GO) and magnesium oxide (MgO) nanoparticles has been introduced. Surface-functionalized hybrid fillers were incorporated into a bisphenol-A epoxy resin through a controlled dispersion test based on mechanical stirring and ultrasonication. It was found that the ratio of a GO:MgO of 1.5:0.5 and a total filler content of 2wt% yielded the best results in terms of giving significant changes in thermal and electrical properties. Thermal conductivity was 1.25 W/m K, which was 78% better than plain epoxy, and still a high-volume resistivity of 8.5 x 10<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">s</sup>0·cm upheld great insulation abilities. The ANN and SVM AI models have been trained using experimental data when the filler ratio, sonication time, and curing temperature are used as inputs. The most successful AI model (GA-ANN) had R2=0.971, and MAPE= 2.7, which confirmed the precision in its predictions and the application in the real-time formulation tuning. The paper shows how material science and data-driven modelling can successfully meet in intelligent material design. The proposed hybrid composite can be used in other areas such as electronics packaging, energy systems and sophisticated thermal interface materials. Future research and development will involve expanding this type of AI-driven method to other polymer-based matrices and the study of the future of self-healing, dynamic composites based on next-generation smart materials."

The proposed framework employs a Multi-Task Learning (MTL) model built on a convolutional neural network (CNN) to simultaneously predict disease severity and generate lesion segmentation from retinal fundus photographs. To enhance transparency, Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is integrated through Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM), highlights the image regions which is most influential in the model's decisions. Furthermore, Monte Carlo (MC) Dropout is applied during inference to estimate prediction uncertainty and provide confidence scores along with classifications. High-confidence predictions can be adopted directly by ophthalmologists, while low-confidence cases are flagged for further review, supporting safer clinical decision-making. By jointly performing classification, segmentation, and uncertainty estimation, the system improves diagnostic accuracy, minimizes misclassification, and produces interpretable lesion maps with confidence-aware outputs. Experiments on benchmark datasets-APTOS 2019 for severity grading and IDRiD for lesion segmentation-show that the proposed method consistently outperforms single-task approaches. The combined use of XAI and uncertainty estimation delivers trustworthy and clinically relevant results, offering clear advantages over traditional DR detection methods and demonstrating strong potential for tele-ophthalmology screening programs."

By applying a series of signal processing techniques and deep learning models, StructureID effectively eliminates interference from direct airborne signals and multipath noise. It then extracts distinctive acoustic features from structure-borne signals within the device to enable secure user authentication. Experimental results demonstrate that StructureID achieves an authentication accuracy of nearly 90% and maintains a false acceptance rate below 8%."

    "abstract": "In cloud environments, where data encryption is fixed and the keys are centrally managed, the security and limited data sharing are still major issues due to the statistical attack and key compromise vulnerability. In this paper, we present a multi-branch blockchain framework with dynamic AES keying and ECC-based encryption to achieve decentralized and tamper-resistant and fine-grained data protection in the cloud. Each file is given a unique key of AES based on a hash of the file and the most recent block in the blockchain, making the keys non-reusable and very unpredictable. These keys are strongly packed into the blockchain blocks and encrypted to ECC to ensure that they are not accessed in an unauthorized way during storage and transmission. It is also suggested that a multi-branch blockchain mechanism can facilitate the mechanism of verifiable and revocable file sharing between users without altering the main chain. The experimental efficiency proves a high cryptographic security: the proposed dynamic keys can reach a high sensitivity of 59.04, which is higher than previous dynamic AES methods (51.46) and the established benchmark systems (42.5%). Encrypted images can be analyzed using the histogram to determine that the pixel distributions are uniform, which implies that they are more resistant to statistical attacks. Also, values of ciphertext entropy are close to the theoretical 8 bits/byte, which assures excellent randomness and resistance to brute-force and data-analysis attacks. The findings confirm that the offered architecture creates a significant positive effect on the level of confidentiality, integrity, and safe collaboration in the cloud computing environment."

Through multi-sensor fusion, long-distance dynamic recognition of electric shovels, accurate obstacle detection in complex backgrounds, and rapid calculation of spatial positions are realized. A hierarchical architecture including global path planning, local dynamic obstacle avoidance, and multi-machine conflict resolution is constructed. Combined with adaptive cable tension constraints and a dynamic obstacle prediction model, conflict-free cooperative operations are achieved.

Modern power grids require simultaneous optimization at different time scales – day ahead planning, real-time adjustments, and fast regulation. This paper proposes a novel three layer hierarchical coordinated control architecture with three control layers working at different timescales - (i) Tertiary layer: Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) based layer for day-ahead planning, (ii) Secondary Layer: Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) based Distributive Model Predictive Control (DMPC) for real-time coordination, and (iii) Primary Layer: PI control with droop mechanisms for rapid local regulation. This framework was tested for a microgrid with four heterogenous ESS units and demonstrated exceptional performance. A net revenue of $4273.78 was obtained through energy arbitrage along with zero tracking error. Frequency regulation was within 0.071 Hz and there was no voltage deviation, henceforth assuring the robustness and grid stability. The core control execution time was just 1.64 seconds, giving a testimony of computational efficiency. The proposed framework, therefore, provides an efficient solution for coordinated ESS management under uncertainity while maintaining superior grid stability and power quality."

    "abstract": "The rapid increase in brain tumor cases has made it essential for researchers to develop automated methods for their detection and diagnosis. Given the diverse nature of each tumor, multi brain tumor image classification has emerged as a current research endeavor. Even though numerous classification methods have been developed in recent years, these methods rely on time-consuming and error-prone manual segmentation and feature extraction prior to classification. An automated approach for multiclass tumor classification is required in order to correctly extract features, identify and classify the tumor. This research proposes an optimization enabled deep learning for the brain tumor classification. Here, the Magnetic Resonance Image (MRI) input is preprocessed utilizing anisotropic filtering. The image, which is preprocessed, is then passed to the brain tumor segmentation process that relies on the 3DU-Net. Then, features including tumor size, mean, variance, etc., are extracted and then utilized in the brain tumor classification phase. In this phase, two level classification, such as 1<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">st</sup> stage and 2<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">nd</sup> stage classification, is used.

Furthermore, the proposed STBO-based Le-Net has achieved superior results with accuracy of 0.945, TPR of 0.938 and TNR of 0.955."

This paper presents an integrated mitigation approach that couples a magnet-hinged, tiltable self-deploying anti-bird spike with a Transformer-enhanced multimodal recognition framework and a vision-guided UAV installation protocol. The recognition pipeline fuses RGB imagery with hyperspectral and LiDAR-derived features to detect hazardous bird species, compute tower-level risk, and classify cross-arm geometries for hardware selection. In a pilot evaluation using 800 labeled images and field mock-ups, the multimodal detector achieved an F1 score of approximately 0.91 for species detection and 95.2% accuracy for cross-arm classification. UAV installation trials yielded an autonomous installation success rate exceeding 90% and an average installation time of 4.3 minutes per tower. Results indicate the proposed system is feasible for targeted, scalable bird-fault mitigation; future work will address IoT-enabled monitoring, further multimodal robustness, and coordinated UAV deployment."

    "abstract": "The emerging issues in power systems demand the use of very effective and reliable allocation of force. The introduction of renewables adds variability on the energy input and output. Old methods of load-forecasting can be obsolete, excessively projecting the ability of the system and output. This consumes power and increases the cost of operation. In this paper, a connected load controller framework in a distributed energy resource micro grid is presented. In harsh conditions, there is attention to the minimization of the load and energy input-output at the cross-SVW microgrids. Developed power-prediction models optimize the model of microgrid control of the closed-loop structure. The model relies on real-time power data streams, preconfigured control, and planned feedback of the IoT data controllers. It seeks to implement and optimize cross-standard smart-grid case studies in the Southeast Asian region and microgrids with smart are nervous installed. The results of the case-study are positive showing that there is a strong synthesis in the case of traditional forecasting based on MAPE and RMSE. Adaptive system optimizes the distributed resources among related microgrids, both integrated and meshed, and it is proving to be realistic in smart-grid application in real life through adaptive forecasting. It facilitates energy distribution in a sustainable and resilient environment through the Internet of Things."

A significant challenge faced by many AI models is the difficulty in concurrently analyzing broad contextual patterns and fine-grained pathological details. This study proposes a framework that enhances the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) backbone using a hierarchical attention strategy designed to capture pathologies of varying scales. The proposed approach integrates parallel multiscale attention modules for comprehensive feature analysis with a final spatial attention layer to localize abnormalities precisely. The proposed approach is evaluated on two public datasets, which achieve accuracies of 96.47% and 96.84% for pediatric pneumonia and multiclass abnormality classification, respectively.

    "abstract": "The hands-free Media Playback Control is applicable in the Snap Detection system. The paper proposes a multimodal solution that has visual and audio snap detection. The simplest solution relies on an Enhanced BiLSTM model, that is conditioned to MFCC and Melspectrograms to provide high-confidence audio snap classification. A Mediapipe pipeline is a snapping gestures detector in live video streams to aid in visual detection. The media processes and monitors gestures in real time and therefore, there is never a time where the conversion of snap gestures into media commands can be made impossible e.g. play/pause, rewind and fast-forward. This multimodal acquires power in the diverse environment through audio based detection giving a play/ pause control and visual based detection which gives directional media navigation. It is constructed on top of an audio-video processing system with an OpenCV interface. It executes system media keys through the assistance of PyAutoGui that enables it to be easily integrated with most of the media players. The system provides an interactive non contact control system which is natural and thus fits well in regards to accessibility enhancement, presentation control and entertainment. The Enhanced BiLSTM comprises a temporal Conv1D pre-net, a 2-way LSTM (two layers), and a slim additive attention head, and generalized with layer normalization and dropout. The general system is very assured and controllable real-time, demonstrating its reliability as well as a potential chance of hands-free and intuitive interaction in diverse user conditions."

However, existing soft-decision decoders often suffer from high complexity, large area overhead, and limited throughput, making them less suitable for high-speed applications. This paper proposes a high-throughput VLSI architecture for soft-decision decoding based on the Ordered Reliability Bits Guessing Random Additive Noise Decoding (ORBGRAND) algorithm. The novelty of the proposed approach lies in its pipelined and parallelized noise-guessing engine, lightweight reliability sorting mechanism, and optimized memory hierarchy, which collectively minimize latency and improve energy efficiency. The overall methodology involves algorithmic optimization, architecture design in HDL, simulation under AWGN channels, FPGA synthesis, and benchmarking against existing GRAND-based decoders. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed architecture achieves multi -Gbps throughput, lower decoding latency, and superior error-correction performance with reduced area and power consumption. These results highlight its potential as an efficient solution for next-generation high-speed communication systems."

The framework will block errant or malicious users, and subsequently identify and counter opposing inputs, such that only harmless prompts are passed through the chatbot. The SACD framework performed well with using the LLM Jailbreak + Safety Data on Kaggle as the program provided a high-level of robustness, scoring 98% and decreasing the number of unsafe outputs and attack success rates significantly.

Although recent studies have extended multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to these tasks, they still face significant challenges in fine-grained multi-target scenarios. To address this, we propose MTRAG, a pixel-level multi-target referring and grounding framework that leverages semantic-spatial collaboration. Specifically, we introduce a Channel Extension Mechanism (CEM) that enables a global image encoder to extract global semantics and multi-region representations while retaining background context, without extra region feature extractors. Moreover, we introduce a grounding branch for pixel-level grounding and design a Hybrid Adapter (HA) to fuse semantic features from the MLLM branch with spatial information from the grounding branch, thereby enhancing the semantic-spatial alignment. For training, we meticulously curate MTRAG-D, a dataset comprising single-and multi-target referring and grounding samples derived from existing datasets and newly synthesized free-form multi-target referring instruction-following data. We also present MTR-Bench, a benchmark for systematic evaluation of multi-target referring. Extensive experiments across five core task, including single- and multi-target referring and grounding as well as image-level captioning, show that MTRAG consistently outperforms strong baselines on both multi- and single-target tasks, while maintaining competitive image-level understanding.

However, existing CSI feedback models struggle to adapt to dynamic environments caused by user mobility, requiring retraining when encountering new CSI distributions. Moreover, returning to previously encountered environments often leads to performance degradation due to catastrophic forgetting. Continual learning involves enabling models to incorporate new information while maintaining performance on previously learned tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a generative adversarial network (GAN)-based learning approach for CSI feedback. By using a GAN generator as a memory unit, our method preserves knowledge from past environments and ensures consistently high performance across diverse scenarios without forgetting. Simulation results show that the proposed approach enhances the generalization capability of the DAE framework while maintaining low memory overhead. Furthermore, it can be seamlessly integrated with other advanced CSI feedback models, highlighting its robustness and adaptability."

    "abstract": "Live video streaming has grown significantly, especially on networks with limited bandwidth. Traditional video streaming methods, which drop less important frames, often struggle with high latency. We propose ReparoV2, a novel approach designed specifically for live streaming environments. On the client side, ReparoV2 selectively omits video frames at the source, which substantially reduces bandwidth usage without significantly degrading the QoE. ReparoV2 implements a real time Video Frame Discarding (VFD) algorithm, which categorizes even-indexed frames into three types: preserving, recovering using neural networks and substituting with the previous frame, which is corresponding to the high, medium and low degree of difference between two adjacent frames. Additionally, to gain a better QoE, ReparoV2 integrates an adaptive bitrate strategy and introduces multiple discrete low-frame-rate encoding modes, balancing video quality and bandwidth reduction when the network bandwidth is limited. On the server side, ReparoV2 uses a Video Frame Interpolation Deep Neural Network (VFI-DNN) and frame-copying to reconstruct dropped frames, ensuring a smooth viewing experience. It updates the VFD model based on received video chunks and sends the updated model back to the client. ReparoV2 outperforms conventional Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH), achieving higher Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) (+0.024), lower bandwidth usage (-23.19%), and improved QoE (+26.66%) on 25fps videos under 0.974Mbps average bandwidth."

    "abstract": "Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures, while computationally efficient, suffer from a critical memory–latency bottleneck. The need to store all experts in GPU memory or to incur high I/O latency when offloading them to CPU severely hinders their practical deployment. To address this, we propose ADEPT (Adaptive Domain-aware Expert Prefetching Technique), a framework designed to optimize expert management during LLM inference under memory-constrained GPU environments. ADEPT employs a two-stage strategy. First, during the prefill phase, it analyzes the input’s semantic domain to selectively preload only relevant experts, minimizing peak memory usage. Second, during token-by-token decoding, a locality-aware mechanism predicts and preemptively loads upcoming experts into the GPU cache, effectively hiding I/O latency. Evaluated across diverse domains, ADEPT demonstrates significant efficiency gains in two key aspects: (1) in terms of latency, simulation results show a 50% reduction in I/O wait time, while real-world validation confirms a 3.45× speedup over standard offloading baselines by mitigating system overheads and (2) in terms of memory, it yields a 33% decrease in peak usage compared to a full-loading approach. Our findings demonstrate that this principled approach significantly improves the practical deployability of MoE models on cost-effective hardware, making them a more viable option for latency-sensitive applications."

    "abstract": "The generalized modeling of core loss aims to predict the power loss of magnetic components, which is crucial in fields such as electronic industry design. However, the influence relationships of operating condition variables are complex. Empirical models, such as the Steinmetz Equation, cannot fully characterise such nonlinear relationships, because the used priori equation has insufficient variables and their coefficients are all fixed. Although deep learning alleviates this issue, most existing methods still only consider limited variables and are not applicable to cross-material modeling. Therefore, we combine the prior knowledge of empirical models and the powerful fitting ability of deep learning, and propose a Deep Self-Representation (DSR) module that can either function as an independent model or be integrated into existing empirical formulas. Specifically, the integrated model can dynamically adjust the coefficients according to the input variables, resulting in better accuracy and generalization. In addition, based on the log-linear property provided by Steinmetz, we propose a flexible approach that can conveniently add more variables. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conducted a series of comparative and simulation experiments on the open-source dataset MagNet. The experimental results show that DSR, used alone as the core loss model, outperforms baseline methods in accuracy, with 0.875% and 1.229% errors in single-material and multi-material cases, respectively. Furthermore, the integrated model has even lower errors of 0.657% and 1.01% and better robustness. Moreover, our model can perform training and prediction on an inexpensive GPUor CPU, providing an efficient solution. We release our code online: https://github.com/."

Traditional farmers generally depend on personal experience and visual judgment, which may lead to incorrect decisions and lower yields. The proposed system addresses these limitations by using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for soil image classification and an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for optimal crop recommendations. The dataset contains soil samples and environmental parameters collected from multiple regions. The models are trained and evaluated with labeled data to ensure high accuracy and strong generalization capability. The CNN achieves a soil classification accuracy of over 97.58%, while the ANN delivers precise and dependable crop suggestions. These intelligent techniques help farmers make data-driven decisions, reduce losses, and improve productivity. The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning (DL) demonstrates a promising and sustainable solution for modern precision agriculture."

    "abstract": "This is the first study to systematically evaluate AIcontent detectors using dual-direction adversarial edits across multiple genres while simultaneously addressing the ethical gray zone of human-AI collaboration. Nevertheless, there is a critical research gap, as the current literature fails to cover the Gray Zone of the human-AI collaborative authorship and does not have dual-sided adversarial appraisal methods. This study addresses the question raised in the current literature Should the text be considered AI-generated if the AI is used for minor edits. Our two-way evaluation simultaneously evaluates AI-to-human and human-to-AI adversarial changes, applying targeted and strategic changes in order to make human text look like it was produced by AI and the reverse as well with existing commercial AIDetectors as a representative system. The outcomes demonstrate how challenging it is to spot instances of collaborative authorship because even minor typographical adjustments or paraphrases reveal serious flaws in the detection techniques currently in use. Additional algorithmic constraints can be seen in the systemic variation in performance between content types as further shown by genre-specific analysis. The study shows that authorship problems continue even after grammar and style corrections, suggesting that the binary classification method is not effective to capture the complexity of modern human–AI collaboration. Apart from technical criticisms, we also draw focus on practical consequences like academic sanctions for valid work and concerns brought up by institutional policies. It is confirmed by statistical validation that these are systematic limitations rather than problems with implementation. The findings indicate that binary classification is inadequate and that detection tools ought to be reconceptualized as interpretive instruments requiring spectrumbased classifications and human oversight."

    "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases, particularly heart disease, remain the leading cause of global mortality. The combination of Machine Learning (ML) techniques into healthcare diagnostics offerings a hopeful solution for timely and precise disease prediction. This study recommends a complete ML framework for heart disease classification using two real world clinical datasets. The methodology includes data preprocessing, multi-model evaluation including SVM, Logistic Regression (LR), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), and K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) and overfitting detection over practical threshold analysis. Highlighting recall as a critical performance metric, the framework prioritizes minimizing false negatives, which is crucial in life threatening conditions. The novelty of this work lies in the integration of Shapely Additive explanations (SHAP) for post-model feature importance analysis and optimization, enhancing model interpretability and efficiency. Models showing high recall and no signs of overfitting undergo SHAP-based feature refinement evaluation metrics can significantly improve clinical trust and deployment readiness of AI models for heart disease prediction."

    "abstract": "Modern digital ecosystems rely heavily on Open Source Software (OSS), but maintaining license compliance is still a major and unsolved problem. Current approaches rely on either manual audits, which are expensive, sluggish, and prone to error, or automatic scanners, which frequently fail with dual or bespoke licenses. Businesses, entrepreneurs, and academic institutions are exposed to serious legal, financial, and reputational concerns as a result of this divide. This project suggests a multi-layered OSS License Verification Framework that incorporates human-in-the-loop learning, logical reasoning, evidence-based validation, provenance tracking, and cryptographic assurance in order to overcome these constraints. To establish technical ground truth, the system starts with SBOM and SPDX provenance data, builds an attestation graph, and uses binary inference and differential tracing. License requirements are represented as vectors of obligations, assessed using a constraint solver and validated using zero-knowledge proofs (zk-proofs) to give auditors reliable proof of compliance. A human oracle ensures adaptation to changing license ecosystems by resolving ambiguities and continuously enhancing the knowledge base. The suggested framework seeks to provide an end-to-end, intelligent, and auditable solution for OSS licensing compliance by fusing automation with verifiability and adaptability. The results will help a variety of stakeholders, such as businesses looking to reduce risk, startups seeking quicker innovation, and academic institutions using OSS responsibly, all of which will contribute to a more secure and reliable opensource ecosystem."

    "abstract": "Cloud-based e-Health systems have transformed modern healthcare by offering scalable access to electronic health records (EHR), medical imaging, and remote diagnostics. These systems are however becoming more susceptible to side-channel attacks, which are based on micro architectural leakages including cache timing, memory access patterns and electromagnetic emanations. Conventional cryptographic protection and access control systems do not have the capacity to ward off these covert data exfiltration channels. This research proposes an effective multi-layered defense system that is specifically designed to curb the threats posed by side-channels in cloud-based healthcare systems. The proposed system will combine dynamic runtime obfuscation, deep learning-based anomaly detection and blockchain-based audit trails with federated learning of adaptive response to threats. A hybrid LSTM-CNN autoencoder is used to make predictions on normal system behavior using side-channel telemetry allowing the identification of subtle deviations with a high sensitivity. Obfuscation mechanisms like cache flushing, noise inj ection and randomized scheduling are activated when they are identified, to tamper with attack vectors on-the-fly. Lightweight blockchain records all security events in a way that enables forensic traceability, and federated learning ascertains that defense models are developed without centralizing the sensitive data. The framework proves to be effective in an experimental setting of simulated e-health cloud environment. The system proposed has a detection accuracy of 97.66, which is higher than base formulations of CNN, LSTM, and classical classifiers. The design is operationally efficient and has low overhead resources. These results lay the groundwork of proving the feasibility of AI-based, privacy-sensitive security architectures in the future e-health ecosystems. The framework has a potential in its implementation in telemedicine, PACS, and real-time applications of clinical-monitoring with the help of IoT."

However, this approach lacks the expansion of interest diversity, leading to the echo chamber effect where users struggle to access new, potentially interesting content. To address the balance between accuracy and diversity in recommendation systems, we propose the NC2R algorithm (Negative Correlation Re-ranking Recommendation System). This algorithm optimizes the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) model with a negative correlation mechanism, encouraging the model to focus on dissimilar items, thereby enhancing recommendation diversity. Additionally, a re-ranking mechanism is applied to prioritize recommending items that are less similar to users' historical preferences, further boosting recommendation diversity. Furthermore, local sensitive hashing and the Mamba algorithm are employed to accelerate the computation of item similarities and dissimilarities, ensuring efficiency on large-scale datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that NC2R significantly improves recommendation diversity while maintaining high accuracy across multiple real-world datasets."

    "abstract": "Accurate and reliable tracking of on-orbit spacecraft is very important for the safety of space assets. However, space-based observation often faces challenges such as complex backgrounds, changing target poses, and long periods of occlusion. These conditions can cause traditional algorithms to fail because of model contamination. To solve these problems, this study presents a robust tracking algorithm that combines motion estimation with a re-detection mechanism. The process starts with target detection, using a dynamic frame differencing algorithm that mixes adaptive background registration with temporal voting. In the tracking phase, based on the hand-crafted feature version of Efficient Convolution Operators (ECO-HC) tracker, we use a dual-metric online evaluation method. This method is based on Peak to Sidelobe Ratio (PSR) and feature similarity, and it is closely integrated with a Kalman Filter.When the tracking confidence is high, the tracking model is updated and the filter is corrected. When the confidence is low, we stop updating the model to avoid contamination. Instead, the target’s trajectory is determined by the filter’s predictions. If the target is lost for a long time, the re-detection module starts automatically.To test how well the algorithm works, we created the \"Space Object Tracking Dataset\". Experimental results show that our algorithm is much better than baseline methods in both precision (82.6%) and success rate (72.9%). It has strong robustness, especially when there is total occlusion of the target. Besides, the algorithm can achieve real-time tracking speeds (65.6 FPS) on both our own dataset and the public UAV123 dataset. This proves that it exhibits significant potential for practical application in space missions."

    "abstract": "The convective heat transfer from hot smoke in tunnel fires poses a significant threat to the structural integrity of tunnel linings and internal components, representing a major concern for thermal safety in underground spaces. To address this issue, a finite difference method (FDM)-based algorithm is designed to accurately resolve the temperature gradient within the smoke boundary layer adjacent to tunnel walls during fires in this paper, thereby enabling precise analysis of convective heat transfer intensity. The challenges associated with conventional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods are circumvented effectively in this approach, such as mesh generation difficulties and high computational costs when resolving thin boundary layers. The proposed FDM algorithm couples and solves the Navier-Stokes equations and the energy conservation equation within the boundary layer. A novel wall function is introduced, which incorporates an additional wall cell influenced by both the near-wall fluid temperature matrix and the internal solid wall temperature matrix. This formulation allows for a more accurate prediction of the wall temperature gradient. Comparative validation against results from the Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS) demonstrates that the proposed algorithm achieves high accuracy in predicting temperature gradients while significantly reducing computational cost. The feasibility of the FDM approach is confirmed as an effective supplementary tool for addressing small-scale boundary layer problems by these findings."

    "abstract": "Autonomous vehicle navigation requires finely calibrated environmental awareness, resilient onboard deliberation, and continual, near-instantaneous adaptation to evolving roadway behaviours. Current deep learning frameworks achieve strong scores on perception benchmarks, yet their propensity to overlook nonlinear spatial–temporal couplings—coupled with mandated low-latency constraints—remains a fundamental safety liability in actual driving contexts. To mitigate this gap, the present work introduces a hybrid architecture that overlays a Quantum Simplicial Classical Attention Convolutional Network (QSCACN2Net) with a Brown Bear Optimization Algorithm (BBOA), thereby achieving dual improvements in navigational efficacy and reliability. The QSCACN2Net component leverages quantum-classical hybrid propagation and simplicial attention blocks to isolate multidimensional environmental couplings. By combining sub-millisecond feature resolution with coherent ingestion of panoramic vehicular and atmospheric context, the architecture assimilates relevant information across disparate magnitudes of environmental structure. Simultaneously, the BBOA mimics seasonal hibernation metabolic patterns to design hyperparameter search; this biologically inspired mechanism secures accelerated convergence and pronounced robustness with minimal expansion of the hyperparameter search space. Validate the proposed architecture on the benchmarking KITTI dataset, reporting statistically relevant improvements in absolute error, quantifiable reductions in mean pixel perturbation measurements, and tightened end-to-end latency regimes that exceed existing state-of-the-art solutions. Combinatorial analysis of the experimental results substantiates scalable deployment, illustrating that the architecture satisfies the stringent maintainability, safety, and resource operability criteria demanded by future production-grade autonomous driving frameworks."

Drug-gene expression profiles can be mapped to curated biological pathway graphs (i.e., Reactome) which illustrates the propagation of gene perturbation through regulatory circuitry to generate initial dynamic, context-aware representations of drugs. For multi-label classification, the predictive module predicts the likelihood probabilities of side effects emerging.

    "abstract": "Online courses, ranging from fully online degrees to Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), have expanded access to higher education but continue to suffer from extreme dropout rates. Accurate and timely prediction of disengagement is crucial for enabling targeted interventions, yet most existing student dropout prediction (SDP) systems rely on domain-specific models trained on individual course datasets, with limited generalisability across platforms and content types. This paper investigates whether UniTS, a domainagnostic Transformer for time-series data, can be effectively transferred to the task of dropout prediction in sparse, imbalanced educational logs. UniTS was originally designed to handle diverse time-series problems through a unified architecture and dynamic attention mechanisms, without taskspecific engineering. We evaluate multiple adaptation strategies, from supervised training from scratch, to full fine-tuning, to prompt-tuning, and inference-only. Three public datasets of markedly different scale, semantic richness, and class imbalance are considered: XuetangX, KDDCup15, and Unitelma. Results show that a five-epoch fine-tuning of the supervised UniTS checkpoint achieves a mean AUC of 0.944 and F1 of 0.753, outperforming both classical machine learning baselines (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest) and deep sequence models (e.g., GRU-AE) across all datasets. Prompt-tuning retains much of the predictive power while reducing computational cost, highlighting the model’s flexibility for resource-constrained deployments. These findings demonstrate that temporal representations learned in unrelated domains can transfer effectively to educational settings, offering a reusable, high-performance foundation model for dropout prediction."

This paper presents a comparative study of three representative topologies—Radial, DSR, and SG-Star for a 200 MW offshore wind farm composed of forty 5 MW turbines connected via 33 kV submarine cables. Time- and frequency-domain simulations were carried out to evaluate post-fault dynamics, fault ride-through performance, and resonance behavior of offshore wind farm collector topologies. The results show that under a three-phase fault at the terminal node, both radial and SG-star topologies disconnect the affected feeder, leading to similar power losses. In contrast, DSR sustains higher post-fault power through its dual evacuation paths. Dynamic analysis reveals that the SG-star provides faster recovery and stronger damping, while DSR enables smoother reactive current redistribution and reduced converter stress; radial exhibits weaker damping and higher oscillatory distortion. Frequency sweep and R–X analyses confirm that radial is most resonance-prone, with impedance peaks exceeding 3.64 kΩ in the 0.8–2.0 kHz band, DSR redistributes resonance energy but retains a sharp peak at 3.40 kΩ, and SG-star provides the lowest impedance amplification, 1.28 kΩ with compact resonance loops, although with vulnerability to low-frequency mode (0.47 kHz). Overall, the results highlight topology-dependent trade-offs, DSR offers resilience and reliability for medium-to-large projects, and SG-star topologies achieve superior damping for compact layouts, though requiring mitigation of low-frequency harmonics."

This leads to the radicalization and divergence in social values, exacerbating the \"echo chamber\" effect. In this paper, we adopt Transformer to optimize the existing information recommendation mechanism, With the focus on the comprehensive weights of information, we have improved the self-attention and cross-attention mechanism, thereby significantly increasing the information entropy.

The input data, sourced from the Beyond Visible Spectrum: AI for Agriculture 2024 dataset, is first preprocessed using the BitonicX Filtering (BXF) technique. Following preprocessing, feature extraction is performed through the Second-Order Synchroextracting Transform combined with Empirical Wavelet Transform (SSTC-EWT). The Crop Disease Detection is performed using Multilayer Global Dense Spiking Neural Network (MGDSN3Nets) architecture, which is further optimized using the Mycorrhized Tree Optimization Algorithm (MTOA). The proposed MGDSN3Nets+MTOA framework demonstrates outstanding performance, achieving 99.9% accuracy and a 99.8% specificity when evaluated on the Beyond Visible Spectrum: AI for Agriculture 2024 dataset. The entire model is implemented using the Python programming language and significantly enhances CDD capabilities using advanced remote sensing techniques.

Internet, Cloud, Smart phone, Big Data, Internet of Things and Artificial Intelligence, contribute towards this exponential growth of cyber assaults. The tools of a cybersecurity professional also have to be sharpened to solve the issues related to this new generation cyber threat. Conventional tools can prevent already known attacks, but are not very successful in the case of unknown or innovative attacks. New tools integrated with emerging technologies have been proposed to solve this problem. Developments in Artificial Intelligence have attracted various domains towards it. Security professionals and researchers have also begun to use AI to sharpen their weapons. Research on AI for Cyber defense has succeeded in setting up a systematic approach to develop machine learning models that can predict attacks. However, a question arises about the efficiency and practical implementation of such models. This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of advanced AI approaches utilized within the field of cybersecurity. It also highlights emerging directions for research in this domain and explores the existing challenges in improving these techniques to strengthen the robustness of cybersecurity systems."

    "abstract": "Flying Ad Hoc Networks (FANETs) have recently become a critical paradigm to support autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) cooperation in various applications. However, their high mobility and dynamic topology pose persistent challenges for reliable routing. This paper presents a structured classification of routing protocols based on their primary design objectives, emphasizing the emerging role of AI in adaptive decision-making. Within this framework, we conduct a comparative performance analysis of AODV, OLSR, and an enhanced hybrid OLSR+K-means protocol implemented in ns-3. The hybrid maintains OLSR’s proactive nature while improving stability through local features. Each protocol was tested under identical UAV network settings to ensure fair comparison and consistency. Simulations show about 23% lower delay, smoother jitter, and stable throughput with negligible overhead. These findings indicate that simple unsupervised clustering can provide a practical foundation for future intelligent and adaptive FANET routing protocols."

    "abstract": "Criminal investigations often involve sifting through large amounts of structured and unstructured data, such as case files, criminal profiles, accomplice connections, and behavioral patterns. Analyzing these records manually takes a lot of time, is prone to mistakes, and can be inefficient, especially in places with limited digital resources. To tackle these issues, we introduce COPS (Criminal Operandi Prediction System), a web application powered by AI. It allows law enforcement personnel to retrieve and analyze criminal data using just one input in natural lan- guage. COPS can extract important details like suspect names, 10- cations, crime descriptions, and partner information. It connects them to existing records through fuzzy matching and semantic analysis. The system shows relevant criminal history, methods of operation, relationships, and predicts likely behaviors based on past data. It is built with modern technologies, including React for the frontend, FastAPI and Python for backend logic, and MongoDB for flexible data storage. Designed to be deployed on- premise, COPS ensures complete data privacy while remaining usable without an internet connection. This paper discusses the architecture, workflow, and implementation of COPS, showing how it can speed up investigations, improve decision-making, and boost public safety through smart crime analysis."

    "abstract": "Energy aware communication in Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs) is essential to enhance the smart city’s sustainability. Conventional routing and resource allocation methods are not able to deal with highly dynamic and resource constrained characteristics of vehicular networks. This work proposes a reinforcement learning based Double Deep Q Networks (DDQN) with Prioritized Experience Replay (PER) approach for sustainable energy management in VANETs. The proposed system treats each vehicle as an independent agent that learns to optimally take various actions, such as tuning transmission power, choosing energy efficient routes, and offloading content to roadside units, according to the observed network state including battery levels, vehicle locations, and channel conditions. The structure is comprised of state encoder, DDQN+PER agent for stable and prioritized training and action executor. Simulation results for multiple traffic densities reveal the substantial performance advantages over traditional schemes like AODV, standard DQN, and greedy heuristics. The DDQN+PER model reduces the average energy consumption by 23.5%, enhances the packet delivery ratio by 14.2%, and decreases the communication delay by 17.8%. These results support the effectiveness of the proposed approach to facilitate adaptive and energy aware communication strategies, and its promising perspective to contribute to the establishment of smart sustainable vehicular networks in the smart cities of the future."

However, this shift has also made it harder to keep remote exams fair and secure. Old-fashioned proctoring methods just don't work as well in a virtual setting, and as more assessments move online, there's a real need for security solutions that are both reliable and easy for students to use. That's why we created SecuCode-a system designed to help maintain academic honesty during online exams without adding unnecessary stress or complexity for students. SecuCode starts with a simple PIN login, making it easy for students to get started while still confirming their identity. Once the exam begins, the system uses real-time facial recognition to make sure the same person stays present throughout the test. What really makes SecuCode different is its strike-based monitoring approach: if a student's face disappears from the camera too many times, the exam is automatically submitted. This way, the system discourages cheating but also understands that honest mistakes can happen. Our goal with SecuCode is to create a secure, respectful online exam experience that supports both students and educators as online learning continues to grow."

In BNN-FourierNet, node-level temporal profiles of prosumers, storage units, and loads are transformed into spectral representations through Fourier decomposition, capturing both structural and frequency-domain correlations. A spectral community detection module then identifies self-sufficient energy clusters using an energy-aware modularity criterion, while the Bayesian neural layer quantifies epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties in load and generation forecasting within each detected community. The inferred uncertainty distributions guide a downstream optimization engine for demand scheduling and renewable integration, achieving energy balance with minimal transmission losses."

    "abstract": "Vocabulary plays an important role in language acquisition, yet it is often a significant challenge for learners of English as a foreign language, especially when traditional methods do not successfully engage students or support long-term retention. To address these challenges, this study explores the potential of Digital Game-Based Learning (DGBL) as an innovative approach to enhance vocabulary development among junior high school students in an EFL context in Indonesia. Using a pre-experimental, one-group pretest-posttest design, the study was conducted with 27 eighth-grade students at SMP Negeri 13 Yogyakarta. The participants underwent a series of DGBL sessions over four class meetings, where vocabulary games such as Kahoot, Baamboozle, and Wordwall were integrated into the teaching. Pre-test and post-test scores were analyzed using SPSS to measure the impact of the intervention. The results showed a marked improvement in students’ vocabulary acquisition, with the mean score increasing from 68.6 to 87.7 and a significant decrease in score variation. T-tests confirmed that the difference between pre- and post-test results was statistically significant, underscoring the effectiveness of DGBL. The findings suggest that incorporating digital games into vocabulary instruction not only increases student engagement but also yields measurable academic gains. This study contributes empirical evidence to the growing body of research on technology-enhanced language learning and provides practical insights for educators seeking to foster more interactive and effective vocabulary instruction in EFL classrooms."

    "abstract": "In edge computing contexts, precise and effective vehicle identification is essential for the development of autonomous driving and intelligent transportation systems. However, the strict processing limitations of edge devices, data privacy issues, and optical occlusions continue to pose a hurdle to this endeavour. In this research, NeuroFed- ResBiLSTM is presented as a novel system that addresses these issues by combining the fundamentals of neural computing, Federated Learning (FL), and a hybrid deep learning architecture. The suggested methodology improves occlusion resistance by using a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) framework to model temporal interactions and contextual details after a ResNet-powered encoder extracts strong spatial features from graphic information. Data privacy is maintained at dispersed edge nodes through the use of a centralised learning framework in the decentralised training procedure. Additionally, neuromorphic awareness is integrated by refining the model for energy-efficient deployment on neuromorphic hardware and event-based visual processing. NeuroFedResBiLSTM outperforms a number of centralised and federated baselines, achieving a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 89.7% under strong occlusion conditions, according to extensive assessments on the KAIST and BDD100K datasets. Importantly, this methodology sets a new standard for robust, economical, and privacy-preserving vehicle perception at the edge by reducing energy usage by $4.7 \\times$ and data traffic by $3.8 \\times$ when compared to the conventional federated learning approaches."

Inaccurate risk analysis normally results from the traditional credit scoring approaches' ongoing inability to properly capture advanced borrower behaviour. This paper presents an integrated approach to improve forecast accuracy and reliability in assessing personal loan defaults through the combination of innovative Machine Learning (ML) algorithms with the Six Sigma DMAIC process. To reduce class imbalance, an extensive preprocessing of a dataset of more than 838,000 loan requests was performed, involving feature engineering, resampling, and careful data cleaning. Through model testing of various classification models, XGBoost emerged to outperform all the rest by attaining an accuracy rate of 88.19 %. An ensemble model of Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and XGBoost was constructed to further improve predictive performance, attaining equivalent levels of performance for defaulters and non-defaulters. Six Sigma measures such as Defects Per Million Opportunities (DPMO) and Sigma Level registered impressive process improvements from 2.5 to 3.96 and down to 7,000, respectively. In addition to enabling improved decision-making speed and accuracy, the proposed approach guarantees process stability, transparency, and flexibility through real-time monitoring and retraining. The proposed hybrid approach encourages risk mitigation, operational excellence, and enhanced customer confidence in financial lending operations by providing an extendable and highly reliable framework."

A zero-summation event-driven perception attained an average of 96.24% accuracy in the negative encounters of ten events that are at the verge of 1.60ms mean latency, 1.30 W power and 1.32% of the false alarms; at daytime, scanning kept a maximum of 98.6% and that at the starlight was 94.1 %. RF -assisted SLAM improved the average drift by 2.96% or to 1.54% with 1-2.4o heading error. The opportunistic offloading of the bursty and low-signature links produced an average 1.84% increase in accuracy (to 3.2%) on the challenging vignettes at an incremental offloaded subset latency of 57. 9ms. Federated few-shot adaptation increased both top-1 accuracy (90.1 up to 96.4) and new-class F1 (46.6 up to 94.3) and reduced expected calibration error (4.7 down to 1.3). The GAN-spectrum-transfer achieved a mean accuracy of 96.29% on dichotomous camouflage varieties, the highest being a result of 98.1 % on ghillie suits. Acute stability of the stack was maintained through fast performances of aggressive maneuvers that facilitated performance of strong perception-navigation coupling in microsecond time scales. Analysis demonstrated that combining neuromorphic sparseness with privacy-preserving adaptability and low-likelihood radiations furnished a low-signature system primarily able to discover its target reliably and navigate within bounds of drift in GPS-denied, nondescript visual, and electro-magnetically-contested environments"

    "abstract": "In this paper, an optimal trajectory tracking control approach combining particle swarm optimization neural network and adaptive critic learning is proposed for unmanned surface vehicles with uncertainties and disturbances. The control law of the proposed method consists of feedforward control input and optimal feedback control input. Firstly, the feedforward controller is derived by using the sliding mode control based on saturation function to deal with the uncertain nonlinear dynamics and disturbances in the unmanned surface vehicle system. Subsequently, the optimal feedback control strategy is constructed using the critic-only adaptive dynamic programming, which reduces the computational complexity. To approximately solve the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, the critic learning network based on particle swarm optimization algorithm is constructed to approximate the optimal value function. Finally, the simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method."

    "abstract": "The dynamic nature of smart grids requires more advanced maintenance techniques in addition to traditional reactive and time-based preventive techniques, which are frequently to blame for inefficient resource use, unnecessary downtime, and delayed problem discovery. Existing platforms are not particularly dependable these lack real-time analytical and forecasting capabilities. A predictive maintenance framework built on the Internet of Things (IoT) and Machine Learning (ML) is provided as a solution to the preceding issues. The proposed system uses a combination of real-time sensor data, aLong Short-Term Memory (LSTM)network for Remaining Useful Life (RUL) prediction, Isolation Forest for anomaly detection, and Random Forest for fault categorization. In these ways, it facilitates condition-based maintenance, intelligent decision-making, and early fault detection. Compared with existing systems, detective accuracy, precision, and recall improved to 92.6%, 90.8%, and 91.2%, respectively, with ephemeral recordings. When the average downtime was lowered from 6 hours to just 1.9 hours, it demonstrated that smart grid maintenance was more responsive, efficient, and reliable."

    "abstract": "Tomato Mosaic Virus (ToMV) which is caused by the Tobamovirus pathogen severely impacts the plant health and also leads to the significant yield losses. The disease initially appears as the light and dark green mosaic patterns and leaf curling and the blister-like deformations on the leaves. In the advanced stages the infected plants exhibit the stunted growth, the fruit discoloration and the malformation reducing both the quality and the marketability. ToMV spreads rapidly through the mechanical transmission, the contaminated tools and even the seeds making it highly persistent in the agricultural environments. The farmers manage the ToMV through the resistant cultivars and strict sanitation practices for removal of infected plants to prevent spread. Since there is no chemical cure for viral infections, prevention through vector control (e.g., managing aphids) and the use of virus-free seeds are critical strategies. This study proposes a deep learning-based classifier to automatically distinguish between healthy tomato leaves and those infected with Tomato Mosaic Virus. Input images undergo preprocessing to enhance contrast and highlight key disease features. A fine-tuned GoogLeNet architecture is trained on an augmented dataset and effectively identifies disease markers such as mosaic patterning, leaf distortion, and chlorotic spots. The model achieves a classification accuracy of 100%, demonstrating its potential for early virus detection. The results highlight the viability of deep learning in precision agriculture, providing farmers with a tool for timely intervention and improved crop monitoring. Future work includes deploying this model in mobile and drone-based systems for real-time field diagnostics and integrating it with IoT-based farm management tools for automated disease surveillance."

    "abstract": "Computer-vision methods for identifying Holstein cattle based on their appearance depend on the correct distinction of the black and white regions on their coats. Bright specular highlights on black regions of cows could be registered as white regions, confusing the identification algorithm and leading to misidentifications. As a solution, we develop a per-pixel specular highlight removal method designed to handle non-uniform lighting from multiple illuminants on a per-scene basis. It is fast as it does not compute image statistics or use neural-network inference. It first segments and tracks a black, mirror-like object - a fully black cow - in a video of the scene, and then uses it as a light probe to map the scene illumination at the pixel level. This illumination map is then used to remove specular highlights on black regions of cows appearing at other times in the scene. Following this, we binarize the cow-pixels using a low threshold to separate the white regions from the black ones. When coupled with an available cattle recognition system, our method outperforms both the traditional and the recent deep-learning color-constancy methods, in improving recognition performance. Our method improves the performance of this cattle recognition system by almost 7%."

    "abstract": "The intensive development of social media has increased the cases of cyber bullying, hate speech, and offensive material, posing a great challenge to the safety and welfare of the online community. Conventional automated detection systems are usually very accurate but are black boxes where there is little information on how they made their decisions. Such is the absence of transparency, which kills trust and accountability in content moderation. To overcome this shortcoming, DeepExplain-CB, which is an explainable AI model that aims to detect multi-dimensional cyberbullying has been presented in this research. DeepExplain-CB uses a BERTbased model to predict hate, offensive or neutral social media posts, and produces an interpretable explanation that identifies important linguistic features and contextual features that can drive that particular prediction. The framework is trained using a human annotated dataset which uses target groups as well as natural language rationale to make it both interpretable and inclusive. Through a combination of deep learning and explainable AI methods, DeepExplain-CB not only can keep the pace in detection performance, but also provides moderators, policymakers and researchers with the capability to interpret the logic behind model responses. The experiments conducted with real-world social media data show that the proposed method has a high degree of accuracy and produces humanreadable explanations, which allow conducting content moderation in a responsible and ethical manner. DeepExplainCB can be used as a starting point of further studies on creating reliable cyberbullying detection models, and underline the need to be transparent about AI-assisted social media analytics usage."

    "abstract": "Problematic social media use (PSMU) in adolescents has become a cause of increasing concern due to its possible negative impacts on the mental state, social interactions, and school performance. Parenting is the issue explored in this paper to discuss how parenting can reduce the risks linked to PSMU. Authoritative, authoritarian, permissive, and neglectful parenting styles are analyzed on the basis of their effects on the social media users of adolescents. The most effective among all forms of parenting in the prevention of PSMU is authoritative parenting that implies balanced incorporation of warmth and structure, and the authoritarian, permissive, and neglectful parenting styles affect high risks of problematic use. As well, the parental mediation techniques used are restricted mediation, active mediation, and co-viewing based on their effectiveness in regulating the social media consumption of adolescents. The result shows that active mediation characterized by unrestricted communication and direction has a significant negative impact on PSMU, whereas restrictive and co-viewing techniques lead to different results depending on whether they are carried out. The paper will conclude by emphasizing the need to adopt a holistic interdisciplinary approach that will involve positive parenting practices alongside digital literacy and emotional regulation educational programs. Parents can be key figures in reducing the risk of PSMU and developing more healthy digital habits because they can create a positive environment in the family and provide teenagers with the resources necessary to use media responsibly. The paper will be relevant to the academic knowledge of parenting as a determinant of social media consumption and formulate new interventions to mitigate the adverse impact of digital addiction among adolescents."

Extensive experiments conducted on wind turbine SCADA data, power grid PMU data, and nuclear plant operational data demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms PCA, CNN, and standard VAE baselines in terms of AUC, F1-score, and Recall. Specifically, in early gearbox fault detection of wind turbines, the method achieved a Recall of 0.92 with up to 48 hours lead time; in grid short-circuit event detection, it provided warnings 3–5 seconds in advance; and in nuclear cooling pump anomaly detection, it achieved a Recall of 0.95. These results highlight the framework’s high accuracy, robustness, and strong early warning capability."

    "abstract": "The accuracy of First Information Reports (FIRs) is crucial to ensuring effective investigation and fair judicial outcomes in the Indian legal system. However, due to the absence of legal experts at police stations and the complexity of evolving legal frameworks, FIRs are often drafted with incorrect or missing legal sections. This challenge is further amplified by the recent introduction of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), which replaces the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and remains largely unexplored in computational legal research. This study presents VeriFIR, an AI-powered legal assistant that automates the identification of relevant legal sections from the BNS based on natural language complaint inputs. The system supports multilingual inputs, applies translation and NLP techniques for preprocessing, and leverages fine-tuned transformer models such as MiniLM and LegalBERT to compute semantic embeddings. These embeddings are then compared against vectorized BNS section representations using cosine similarity, returning a ranked list of the most contextually appropriate legal provisions. Experimental results demonstrate the system’s ability to retrieve semantically aligned legal sections with high relevance and interpretability. VeriFIR offers a scalable, modular solution for enhancing the quality and consistency of FIR drafting, with potential applications across diverse Indian law enforcement contexts."

    "abstract": "One of the most serious neurological conditions is brain tumors, and early and precise identification is essential to increasing patient survival. Although magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offers comprehensive structural information, radiologists must manually interpret the results, which takes time and can be subjective. An enhanced multi-task deep learning system for brain tumor analysis is presented in this research. It uses a single architecture to conduct both tumor segmentation and multi-class subtype classification (glioma, meningioma, pituitary, and no-tumor). By integrating an EfficientNet-B0 encoder with a U-Net-based segmentation decoder and a classification head, the suggested model allows the network to concentrate on tumor-relevant regions while preserving interpretability through Grad-CAM visuals. To improve generalization and lessen overfitting, extensive preprocessing was used, including normalization, scaling, and data augmentation. According to experimental results, the model outperforms traditional single-task methods with a 96.2% classification accuracy and a Dice similarity coefficient of 0.91. The study demonstrates the potential of multi-task deep learning frameworks as trustworthy decision-support tools for radiologists, enabling quicker and more accurate MRI-based brain tumor identification in clinical situations."

    "abstract": "The explosion of Internet of Things (IoT) solutions in the smart home applications has transformed home appliance device management and made it energy-conserving, smart, and people-concentrated. Among the latter, the phenomenon of smart refrigerators as solutions to the problem of food preservation and lowering waste is gaining momentum in this regard. The paper proposes an IoT -based smart refrigerator monitoring framework that is integrated with a predictive spoilage alarm solution based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and an alarm generation feature. The system is integrated with environmental sensors that monitor the temperature, humidity, and gases (ethylene and ammonia) and a door activity sensor, thus capturing real-time storage conditions. The use of RFID and computer vision (YOLOv5) provides complete merchandise tracking with packaged and unpackaged food items. A combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long short-term memory (LSTM) networks was constructed as a hybrid AI model and fed on multimodal datasets to make accurate predictions regarding spoilage. Overall, the proposed model resulted in a spoilage prediction accuracy of 92.9%, expiry detection accuracy of 95.0% and an energy optimization savings average of 22.9%. Local inference with low-latency and low power via ESP32-CAM, and cloud synchronization enabled enhanced analytics and long-term storage of data. The automated alert system combined with smartphone apps and smart speakers reduced the average user response time to less than 15 minutes, and that resulted in corrective measures in more than 80% of the cases. These findings indicate the possibility of using IoT -enabled AI systems to minimize food waste, improve the efficiency of households, and achieve sustainability. In addition to adding value in domestic food management, the system also creates a platform that can be used on a larger scale and industrial level of monitoring the cold-chain processes."

    "abstract": "In this paper, A hybrid intelligent swarm intelligence-federated learning is proposed for the decentralized smart grid anomaly detection. The approach directly applies the federated learning into the communication-efficient aggregation and therefore achieves the adaptively learned aggregation weights which contribute to accelerate the convergence rate and enhancing the performance on detection. Smart grid nodes train local models independently on non-IID, noisy data, with swarm algorithms providing guidance for global model updates according to client contribution quality. The scheme is capable of detecting standard cyberattacks, e.g., false data injection, denial-of-service attacks, and is also scalable over hundreds of clients, even with node dropouts and limited communication. Numerical results suggest faster convergence, fewer communication rounds and better anomaly detection performance than FedAvg. Visualisation of feature embedding using t-SNE2 (Maaten & Hinton, 2008) shows good separation between the benign and anomalous data. We show that swarmenhanced federated learning is a scalable, privacy-preserving and energy-efficient method for resilient smart grid security, which represents a huge leap in biological inspired cyber security for critical infrastructure networks."

This combined approach is engineered to capture the intricate dance of semantics and syntax that defines toxic communication. Through rigorous evaluation on a multi-label toxicity benchmark, our hybrid model markedly outperforms traditional machine learning baselines. Crucially, our analysis uncovers a significant performance gap: the model confidently identifies explicit threats but falters when faced with subtle insults that depend on sarcasm and subtext.

    "abstract": "Concentrating solar power plants (CSP) utilize sophisticated technologies to convert solar thermal power into electricity. Particularly, solar power tower plants (SPT) are very promising due to the high concentration ratio and the ability to deliver heat transfer fluid (HTF) at high temperatures. However, solar irradiance fluctuates during the daytime due to various atmospheric effects. That directly affects the thermal performance of the solar receiver, as well as the electric power produced and dispatched to the grid. Additionally, fluctuations in solar irradiance can lead to overheating issues in solar receiver tubes. To address the latter issue, this research proposes a solution by introducing a temperature control valve (TCV) that balances the steam flow distribution across superheater panels based on their respective tube wall temperatures. To guarantee operational safety and reliability, a series of optimization processes has been conducted to identify the optimal circulation factors (CF) between each opposing pair of superheater panels. The results show that the optimum circulation factors from the south to north panels, and between the east and west panels, are 0.25 and 0.1375, respectively. Such an approach contributes not only to decreasing the tube wall temperature below the maximum allowable limit but also slightly improves energy consumption and conservation. Hence, the optimized operation offers a reduction in the net power required to meet the turbine inlet conditions by 0.7731% and in the makeup ratio by 0.782%. Furthermore, the optimization approach ensures that the electricity production remains unchanged compared to the production without optimization, while improving the thermal efficiency of the solar receivers."

Trained on the HAM10000 and ISIC 2019 datasets, the models achieved accuracies of 89% (EfficientNet), 89% (DenseNet), and 88% (ResNet), demonstrating stable and high-quality performance. To promote transparency, Grad-CAM visualization highlights the key lesion regions influencing decisions, while a Dialogflow-powered chatbot delivers interactive explanations, possible causes, and suggested actions. By merging automated image analysis with human-like interaction, SkiDi-X provides an interpretable, accessible, and user-friendly platform that enhances the reach and impact of teledermatology in early skin disease assessment."

However, existing methods suffer from insufficient cross-modal interaction and difficulties in aligning heterogeneous features. To address these challenges, we propose an Adaptive Fusion and Contrastive Enhancement Network (AFCEN). The framework integrates a Cross-modal Gated Attention Fusion (CGAF) module to capture fine-grained dependencies between aspect terms and multimodal sentiment cues, and a Graph-aware Heterogeneous Contrastive Module (GHCM) to enhance feature discrimination through graph-based semantic fusion and contrastive learning.

    "abstract": "As the core facility of coal mine production systems, coal bunkers play vital roles in coal transfer and buffer storage operations. Underground raw coal bunkers in particular serve as critical hubs for transporting coal from mining faces to surface facilities. During operation, the high-speed impact of coal chunks and hard materials like gangue against bunker walls creates significant safety hazards. The intense collision and friction not only risks structural integrity but also induces concrete wall damage including cracks and spalling, accelerating fatigue degradation and deformation instability of the bunker structure. To overcome the safety limitations and real-time deficiencies of traditional manual inspections, coal bunker inspection robots have developed an intelligent monitoring system integrating 3D point cloud modeling with thermal analysis: Equipped with high-precision LiDAR and infrared thermal imaging, the system enables millimeter-level crack detection through 3D reconstruction while identifying stress concentration zones via temperature field variations. This dual-mode data fusion technology significantly improves detection rates and positioning accuracy for hidden defects, providing an intelligent structural health monitoring solution that ensures inherent safety and continuous efficient operation of coal storage systems."

    "abstract": "Satellite imagery has become a vital data source for a wide range of Earth observation applications, including land cover classification, disaster monitoring, and agricultural assessment. Satellite data is a useful tool for comprehending and controlling both natural and man-made ecosystems because of its capacity to collect comprehensive, large-scale photographs of the Earth's surface throughout time. Raw images collected from different sensors of satellites often contain distortion and inconsistency due to various factors, including atmospheric disruption, absorption, scene illumination, satellite orbit motion and geometrical distribution. An effective preprocessing technique is required to remove distortions from satellite images and enhance image quality, ensuring accurate analysis. This study proposes a comprehensive preprocessing algorithm aimed at enhancing the quality of satellite imagery databases by integrating data augmentation techniques and Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA). The augmentation phase improves dataset diversity and model robustness by applying geometric adjustments like rotation, flipping, and scaling. KPCA is then used to reduce nonlinear dimensionality, keeping crucial spatial-spectral information while minimizing noise and redundancy. The combined technique improves model generality and efficiency, making it an effective strategy for satellite-based image analysis. This study also underlines the importance of secure IoT-based sensor networks in providing accurate real-time landslide monitoring."

    "abstract": "Intelligent Internet of Things applications must seamlessly combine established software engineering practices with various machine learning (ML) and time series forecasting techniques. However, most pipelines today rely on handwritten code, which is error-prone and imposes a steep barrier for domain specialists. Domain-specific modeling languages (DSMLs), the backbone of model-driven engineering (MDE), address this complexity by allowing developers to describe systems at a high level, while tooling generates the executable code. To this end, we introduce the ML2 family of DSML frameworks. ML2 converts concise Textula models into complete Python pipelines for classification and regression ML models, autogenerating every preprocessing, training, and prediction script. Building on that foundation, ML2+ adds declarative, end-to-end support for time series forecasting: users can select any statistical (e.g., ARIMA or ETS), machine learning (e.g., SVR or XGBoost), deep learning (e.g., LSTM or Transformer), or hybrid (e.g., Prophet) algorithms and specify key settings, such as lag length or seasonality, without writing a single line of code. In addition, ML2++ enhances both textual and graphical workflows by providing an improved Textula editor alongside Sirius Web, an IDE drag-and-drop graphical modeling environment, and realtime dashboards; ML2++ automatically generates all relevant plots, including loss curves, autocorrelation functions, and forecast versus actual charts during preprocessing, training, and prediction for both ML models and time series forecasters. We validated the framework on two real-world cases, river flow forecasting and server crash prediction, showing faster development, fewer errors, and interpretable results compared to hand-coded workflows."

To overcome this shortcoming, this letter proposes a data–model co-driven denoising approach, termed neural network aided joint time-vertex fractional Fourier filtering (JFRFFNet), which embeds the JFRFT domain filtering model into the neural network and updates the transform order pair and filter coefficients through data-driven approach.

Experiments demonstrate that JFRFFNet achieves significant improvements in output signal-to-noise ratio compared with some state-of-the-arts."

    "abstract": "Cooperative searching for unknown targets is a significant challenge for multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (multi-AUV) in uncertain regions. While many existing studies discretize the searching space into small grids to accelerate planning, continuous space-based algorithms generate more adaptive searching strategies in dynamic environments. However, the complexity of the underwater environment and the need for multi-AUV coordination lead to inaccurate spatial modeling and exponential growth in computation time. To address these issues, this paper proposes a multi-agent continuous soft actor-critic (MACSAC) algorithm for underwater cooperative searching, employing a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) framework based on the soft actor-critic (SAC) algorithm. The multi-sensor cooperative detection model uses a probabilistic target representation based on Gaussian distributions, with Bayesian updating dynamically guiding the searching process. A dynamic dual-agent switching mechanism, which incorporates the MADRL framework, is designed with detection agents and detection-free agents. Moreover, the SAC algorithm is improved for continuous space to enhance cooperative searching efficiency. Simulations are conducted with four AUVs searching for an unknown target region in the underwater environment containing static obstacles. Results show that the proposed method produces smoother paths than discrete grid-based MADRL, and compared to existing continuous MADRL algorithms, reduces the average search steps by 50.70% and the sailing distance by 41.36%. These findings indicate that MACSAC enables efficient, collision-free path planning for multi-AUV systems operating in continuous, uncertain underwater environments."

    "abstract": "The continual updating of data renders the design of model architectures time-consuming and energy-intensive when tackling diverse tasks, and it quite commonly confronts weak generalization performance, even leveraging fine-tuning or transfer learning. Furthermore, the model tends to be well adapted for the current task, whereas suffering performance degradation on previous tasks, namely, the catastrophic forgetting problem, whereas suffering performance degradation on previous tasks. Hence, there is an urgent demand to maintain models to learn new knowledge and alleviate knowledge forgetting, specifically, balancing the plasticity as well as the stability of the model during the continual learning process. To address the aforementioned challenges, we propose a dynamic visual description and playback mechanism that leverages deep feature clustering and memory across diverse tasks. The former extracts stable, invariant features by clustering typical visual characteristics of scenes, accounting for spatial patterns, seasonal variations, and lighting conditions, thereby enhancing the model’s comprehension of continuously evolving remote sensing scenes. The latter selectively memorizes features from specific samples to preserve historical model knowledge. This approach significantly strengthens the model’s capabilities, deepening its understanding of scene imagery while mitigating the forgetting of historical knowledge. We generate several sequence tasks on AID, RSI, NWPU, SEASONET and different scaled merged datasets to simulate the continual learning process across different resolution, seasonal variations and illumination change. Compared to the classical continual learning methods, we demonstrate the superior performance of our model in dealing with continually updated remote sensing data."

    "abstract": "In recent years, Radar-based human action recognition has recently gained attention due to its high precision and robustness, making it well-suited for Internet of Things (IoT) applications. However, radar spectrograms often contain noise and redundant information, while conventional classification models exhibit limitations in capturing complex nonlinear patterns, which hinders recognition performance. To address these challenges, we propose EViMNet, an efficient vision-based model for robust Radar-based human behavior recognition. EViMNet integrates two core components. The first is a Stem Filtering Block (SFB) that applies Gaussian filtering to enhance target features and suppress source noise. The second is an improved Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) architecture, where traditional linear layers are replaced by Kolmogorov–Arnold Networks (KANs). These KANs utilize B-spline basis functions to enable flexible nonlinear modeling and increase sensitivity to subtle signal variations. Experimental results show that EViMNet achieves 95.20% accuracy on the Glasgow dataset. For generalization evaluation, it further attains 99.18% cross-validation accuracy on the Doppler Gesture dataset and achieves the best cross-dataset performance when trained on Glasgow and tested on the corresponding actions in CI4R-MIX77. These results verify the strong generalization and practical applicability of the proposed model in IoT scenarios."

    "abstract": "Single-cell microgels, engineered to replicate complex 3-D in vivo niches, have shown tremendous potential for advancing biomedical research. Studies have demonstrated that microgels recapitulating tissues’ stiffness facilitate the observation of cellular behavior in vitro. However, encapsulating single cells in microgels with composable stiffness gradients to understand cellular responses at microscale interfaces remains challenging. Here, we propose a versatile fabrication method that integrates an enhanced vision model with time-discrete bioprinting to encapsulate single cells in microgels featuring composable stiffness. An enhanced deep learning algorithm was developed to localize single cells in microscopic images, integrating traditional image processing algorithms for improved precision. By combining single-cell positioning data with a time-discrete array based on a digital micromirror device, dynamic digital masks can be generated to control each micromirror in real time. Using these masks, MDA-MB-231 cells were encapsulated in Gelatin methacrylate microgels with tunable stiffness ranging from 1.42 to 11.42 kPa. Experimental results indicated that when the microgel stiffness gradient exceeded 2 kPa, MDA-MB-231 cells exhibited a significant response, extending toward the softer regions of the microgels. These findings illustrate that our approach provides a valuable biofabrication strategy for investigating single-cell behaviors in microgels, showing great potential for applications in 3-D single-cell research."

    "abstract": "This study evaluates the technical and economic viability of integrating wind turbines into naval microgrids at six geographically diverse bases. Eight turbine models from 7 kW to 2MWare analyzed using hub height wind speed distributions from NASA MERRA-2 and manufacturer power curves. Annual capacity factors are computed and used to derive turbine equivalent counts, integer procurement counts, and capital costs required to sustain a 1 MW average load. Results show pronounced site effects. High resource locations such as Souda Bay and Guam achieve capacity factor values around 0.5 for mid and utility scale machines, whereas low resource sites such as San Diego seldom exceed 0.2. Where siting allows, utility-scale machines minimize unit counts and often total cost. In some contexts, mid-scale designs yield the lowest procurement cost because integer counts remain modest. Small wind requires hundreds to thousands of units at weak sites, which drives prohibitive first costs and added balance of system complexity, and it is generally noncompetitive except under severe height or airspace constraints. The modeling framework links hub height wind distributions to performance data and explicitly accounts for integer procurement effects, and the method is transferable for preliminary wind integration decisions in naval and civilian microgrids. Estimates reflect simplified power curve representations and exclude balance of system and O&M costs."

    "abstract": "The effective operation of AC/DC hybrid distribution networks (HDNs) is paramount to maximising the efficiency, reliability and economic benefits of modern electricity grids. This paper presents a totally new approach of combining demand response (DR) based on electric pricing and power electronic transformers (PET) to optimize the performance of the hybrid network. A new Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework is presented that identifies the complexity of topological interdependencies and the dynamic interactions of the hybrid grid and provides an accurate representation of both power flow and voltage stability. The proposed framework optimizes the operating parameters of the hybrid grid including power dispatch, PET control strategies, and DR scheduling to minimize operational costs and maintain grid stability. The execution of PET optimization produces a remarkable improvement in voltage stability whereby voltage levels increased from an unstable region of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$0.90-0.94$</tex> p.u.

Moreover, the electricity price-based demand response approach is highly efficient in saving operation costs, reducing the cost from <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">${\\unicode{x0024}} 1200 / \\text{MWh}$</tex> to <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\unicode{x0024} 1200 / \\text{MWh}\\unicode{x0024} 950 / \\text{MWh}$</tex>, corresponding to a 20.8% increase. Comparative evaluations with conventional optimization techniques show that the proposed GNN-based framework provides faster convergence speed, reduced energy expenditure, and enhanced voltage regulation. Simulation outputs on a benchmark AC/DC HDN demonstrate the applicability of our solution to real-time demand variability management and achieving optimal grid operation under changing electricity prices. Our research demonstrates the promise of combining artificial intelligence with advanced control methods for efficient and cost-saving management of contemporary hybrid distribution networks."

The traditional Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) algorithms are effective at localizing spatial spatial features and they are unlikely to learn global contextual features with and they need large datasets and can be readily overfitted on small medical imaging data. ViT models require large datasets, and will overfit to small medically relevant datasets. To overcome these disadvantages, we introduce NeuroScan that is a hybrid deep learning model that integrates CNNs with ViTs to automatically identify brain tumors based on MRI images. Such mechanisms of the framework include an Attention-Enhanced U-Net that is used to effectively segment tumors, two-stream feature extraction that learns local and global features, and a new Cross-Modal Fusion Layer (CMFL) that fuses multi-scale embeddings in an adaptive way. The merged representation is classified with the help of fully connected ensemble layer, and the visual interpretability of the merged representation is provided with the help of Grad-CAM and attention maps. Comprehensive analysis of BraTS 2021, Figshare Brain MRI and Kaggle datasets shows that NeuroScan has an accuracy of 99.2%, sensitivity of 98.7 percent, and specificity of 99.0 %, which is higher than state-of-the-art approaches without clinical explanation.

Diabetes is a chronic condition and it ranks among top ten causes of disease- related deaths in India. Although, Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning have been applied to detect patterns but they remain as black-box models, making it difficult to analyze the trustworthiness and interpretability of these models. In order to address this issue, we have conducted fidelity with permutations-based testing on Explainable AI (XAI) techniques for diabetes prediction. This Study involves four algorithms SHAP, LIME, EBM and Counterfactual Explanations that were implemented on three different datasets, including two balanced and one highly imbalanced data distribution. Furthermore, their results were analyzed using fidelity as the primary metric. Results revealed that EBM outperformed others on imbalanced data, while SHAP and EBM achieved the highest fidelity overall. Furthermore, LIME generated decently accurate explanations but was sensitive to dataset complexity, while CFEs offered specific insights based on patient-specific data. Additionally, evaluation using accuracy, area under the curve (AUC), computational cost in terms of training time, and interpretability showed that SHAP and LIME performed well on balanced datasets, CFEs showed results by generating explanations I contrast to the exiting class, and EBM balanced predictive accuracy with interpretability, although with longer training time.

Recognizing the rapid channel variations inherent to aircraft mobility, the analysis models outdated channel state information (CSI) and adopts Nakagami-m fading to capture line-of-sight and scattering effects typical of aeronautical links. The work formulates SU operation subject to simultaneous constraints on peak interference at the PU and reliability at the SU receiver, and derives closed-form expressions for the SU outage probability. The impact of CSI and fading severity on performance is characterized analytically and corroborated by Monte Carlo simulations, showing close agreement between theory and experiment. The results provide tractable performance benchmarks and design guidance for interference-aware SU power control in rapidly time-varying aeronautical environments, and clarify the conditions under which coexistence between primary and secondary systems remains feasible without compromising PU protection."

By combining the HMAC algorithm with timestamps, dynamic tokens with uniqueness and timeliness are generated, effectively preventing replay and brute-force attacks. In high- concurrency environments, the forward validation cache mechanism introduced in this paper significantly optimizes authentication performance, reduces computational load, and improves authentication speed. Experimental results show that the system achieved a 100% success rate in 30,000 authentication requests, with an average authentication delay of 1.8 milliseconds and 99% of requests having delays below 3 milliseconds. Additionally, under stress testing, the system can run stably for 72 hours with memory usage ranging from 14.5MB to 15MB, and CPU utilization remains within a reasonable range. Compared to traditional static password and SMS-based authentication schemes, dynamic token authentication offers significant advantages in resistance to brute-force attacks, authentication delay, and reliability, particularly in high-concurrency environments. Through formal security verification, the proposed solution effectively defends against replay attacks and ensures the security of key storage. The experimental results validate the efficiency and application prospects of this authentication technology in modern boundary defense."

    "abstract": "Epileptic seizures arise from abnormal electrical discharges in the brain and significantly impact patient safety and independence. Accurate and timely prediction of seizures is vital for enabling preventive care and improving quality of life. This study proposes a hybrid deep learning model for reliable seizure prediction using electroencephalogram (EEG) spectrogram data. Continuous wavelet transformation (CWT) was applied to raw EEG signals to generate spectrograms that capture both frequency and temporal characteristics. Wavelet transformation was preferred over the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) because of its superior ability to represent non-stationary EEG variations, providing improved temporal resolution during seizure onset. Although EEG signals contain spatial information, a convolutional neural network (CNN) was employed to extract localized spatial–frequency features from wavelet spectrograms, enhancing sensitivity to subtle regional variations. These spatial features were processed by a bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) network with an attention mechanism to model temporal dependencies and emphasize seizure-relevant patterns. The hybrid model integrates a three-layer CNN with batch normalization and max pooling, followed by a two-layer BiLSTM with an attention block to enhance interpretability. The framework was trained and evaluated on the CHB-MIT Scalp EEG database using 10-fold GroupKFold cross-validation to ensure subject-level independence. Comparative analysis with baseline CNN, LSTM, and STFT-based models demonstrated superior performance, achieving an average accuracy of 85% and an ROC-AUC above 0.90. The use of explainable artificial intelligence techniques further improved model transparency and trust, establishing a foundation for real-time seizure forecasting and future integration into wearable EEG monitoring systems."

To address this issue, a voltage regulation approach based on the proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm is proposed. By utilizing historical active power outputs from PV farms, along with system voltage data, a reinforcement learning agent is trained to learn an optimal control policy for reactive power regulation and voltage optimization. Then, the reactive power optimization model in the PV farm is introduced to address the voltage issue caused by variability of PV generation. Subsequently, a two-stage voltage control strategy based on PPO for power system with PV is introduced. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through simulations on a modified WSCC 9-bus system, demonstrating its capability to control the voltage."

To address the high cost and installation complexity of conventional temperature-monitoring techniques, passive wireless schemes combining surface acoustic wave (SAW) sensors with radio-frequency identification (RFID) offer clear advantages; however, electromagnetic-wave propagation in the cable’s multilayer shielding and composite dielectrics remains insufficiently characterized. In this study, we developed a high-fidelity finite-element model of a YJ-series 64 kV cable and its intermediate joint and analyzed RFID-band wave propagation systematically. The results showed that, in the presence of a joint, abrupt material and geometric transitions introduced impedance mismatches that caused strong reflections/refractions and superposition, severely distorting the waveform. When the operating frequency exceeded the cable’s cutoff (735.1 MHz), higher-order modes—TM and TE, in addition to TEM—were excited, further aggravating signal distortion; consequently, compared with 433 MHz, waves at 915 MHz exhibited markedly more severe waveform distortion within the cable and at the joint."

We study a unified framework for maximizing the sum spectral efficiency of the system. In this framework, we optimize the azimuth and elevation angles of the IOS, the reflection and transmission coefficients of the IOS, and the base station beamforming. To that end, we propose a novel meta-heuristic approach to optimizing the orientation angles of the IOS using a particle swarm algorithm. Furthermore, we employ WMMSE and alternating optimization to adjust the hybrid beamforming and energy-splitting factor. Our numerical results show significant gains over conventional MIMO and IRS-assisted networks. The results show a gain of 2.5 b/s/Hz over the IOS-based system with a fixed orientation."

However, this requirement undermines the inherent characteristic of laser tracking which is to consistently track a single point. In order to simplify the target structure by leveraging this characteristic, this paper investigates a visual measurement method for determining the roll of a cooperative target based on laser tracking. Firstly, this paper describes the characteristics of visual target detection for laser-tracked cooperative targets using active infrared detection and analyses the principles behind visual measurements based on distributed feature points in laser-tracked cooperative targets. Secondly, this paper constructs a measurement model for determining the roll of a cooperative target using active infrared detection and features, and establishes a corresponding measurement system. Finally, experiments are conducted and accuracy is analysed. The result demonstrates that this proposed method only requires a simple structure and achieves an error better than ±0.08° when only one active infrared feature point is present, thereby meeting medium- to high-precision application requirements."

    "abstract": "The rapid proliferation of Android malware poses a serious threat to the platform’s ecosystem. Machine-learning–based classification is an effective defense, yet real-world datasets are typically imbalanced, which severely degrades a model’s ability to recognize minority classes. We propose a method combining random oversampling with LightGBM to address this challenge. At the data level, we balance the training set via oversampling; at the model level, we employ LightGBM with L1/L2 regularization for robust optimization. Evaluated with comprehensive metrics, our approach achieves 99.23% accuracy and 98.6% macro-F1 score, with Banking malware recall improving by 14.1% due to oversampling. The confusion matrix reveals that most errors occur between behaviorally similar classes, indicating the limitations of frequency-based features. Our work demonstrates that a lightweight approach can effectively handle class imbalance while providing practical Android malware detection."

In this study, we examine the effect of segmentation-assisted annotation on object detection performance by comparing YOLOv8 trained with and without Attention U-Net-assisted labeling, as well as Faster R-CNN, under identical training parameters and dataset splits. Experimental results show that YOLOv8 trained without segmentation assistance achieves a mean Average Precision (mAP) of $\\mathbf{9 2. 3 \\%}$ on the training set and $\\mathbf{8 1. 2 \\%}$ on the testing set, with an F1-Score of 98%. Incorporating Attention U-Net-assisted annotation improves generalization, yielding $93.2 \\% \\mathrm{mAP}$ on training and $89.8 \\%$ on testing, with the same F1-Score of $98 \\%$. In contrast, Faster R-CNN achieves a slightly higher training mAP ($92.8 \\%$) but a significantly lower testing mAP ($76.8 \\%$), indicating weaker generalization. These findings demonstrate that YOLOv8, when combined with Attention U-Net-assisted labeling, provides a more robust and generalizable solution for object detection in transventricular fetal head ultrasound images. This work presents a hybrid Attention U-Net + YOLOv8 framework that enhances detection accuracy and reliability in ultrasound imaging scenarios."

A dual performance monitor mechanism with enforced boundary constraints and minimum dwell-time conditions is integrated to ensure approximation optimal and safe operation. Distinct from prior approaches, the monitoring mechanism directs the system to stabilized optimal mode with suspended actor-critic (AC) updates, restarting learning only if necessary. A coefficient-enhanced Gaussian learning rate is developed for AC weight updates, ensuring persistent excitation of tracking error signals without performance degradation. The framework is validated using operational data from the Beijing South to Jinan West railway station, where reinforcement relearning under stabilization-triggered conditions is successfully demonstrated. Rigorous validation is performed through error-convergence analysis and computational resource savings quantification."

The antenna features a microstrip-fed semicircular monopole configuration, integrated with a metamaterial-inspired split-ring resonator (SRR) slot etched into the radiating patch, and a semicircular ground plane on the backside. In its basic form-without the SRR-the antenna supports wideband operation across 3 to 1 2 GHz, effectively encompassing the entire UWB range defined by the FCC (3. 1 - 1 0. 6 GHz). The introduction of the SRR slot enables the antenna to generate two distinct bandnotches at 3.3 GHz and 5.6 GHz, effectively mitigating potential interference from co-existing systems such as WLAN, C-band, and WiMAX. Comprehensive performance evaluations, including reflection coefficient analysis, radiation pattern measurements, and assessments of gain and efficiency, confirm the antenna's capability to deliver the desired behavior with satisfactory performance across the UWB frequency range."

As expected, it is shown that the anchor and fairlead loads for the 15 MW semi-submersible type are higher than for the 5 MW spar type. However, the difference is substantial, and therefore the loads are not proportional to the output power of the turbine. It can be concluded that spar-type floating platforms are more suitable than semi-submersible ones because they experience lower forces on their anchors and fairleads."

Yet, traditional centralized databases remain vulnerable to data manipulation, cyberattacks, and systemic inefficiencies that can compromise sensitive legal documents and undermine judicial processes. Blockchain technology offers a paradigm shift toward decentralized trust and cryptographic assurance. This paper presents a robust framework designed using Hyperledger Fabric to secure government legal records and enhance law enforcement procedures. We focus on the practical application of a permissioned blockchain, which is better suited for government use than public, cryptocurrency-based models. The architecture integrates smart contracts to automate legal documentation workflows and employs a hybrid on-chain/off-chain storage model to ensure scalability. Our results demonstrate a functionally complete, tamper-proof system that improves efficiency and provides a fully auditable trail for all record interactions. This work validates the feasibility of blockchain as a foundational technology for next-generation digital governance."

These complex interconnected systems require sophisticated routing mechanisms to orchestrate optimal power flow control and ensure seamless energy delivery across heterogeneous network topologies. However, conventional path-finding mechanisms exhibit limitations such as excessive processing demands, suboptimal load distribution, and inflexible response capabilities, leading to elevated power losses and degraded performance. This work introduces a dual-phase adaptive routing framework that employs predictive scheduling algorithms for initial path determination, coupled with dynamic IoT-driven reconfiguration for responsive energy management. The proposed approach utilizes distributed edge computing nodes and impedance-based network analysis to achieve superior power flow optimization with reduced transmission losses. Experimental validation using cloud-based monitoring platforms confirms that adaptive routing mechanisms minimize supply-demand misalignments, strengthen grid stability, and enhance operational efficiency, highlighting IoT's transformative impact on contemporary energy infrastructure."

A new cost-efficient tracking system based on IoT and AI, utilizing GPS, infrared, and weight sensors plus LSTM and XGBoost models for bus arrival predictions and passenger flow monitoring in real-time has been introduced in this research. During the six-month experiment in Surat, Lucknow, and Coimbatore the results were quite encouraging. The forecasting system for buses was accurate with an average of just 1.4 minutes error. It also achieved 94% accuracy in passenger counting and the hardware was functioning 98.7% of the time. The tracking system that was put in place not only improved or made it more efficient but also cut down waiting times by 35%, raised on-time rate from 68% to 84%, reduced delays during peak hours by 42%, and eliminated 67% of passenger complaints, all with an initial investment of around INR 12,500 per bus and a payback period of only eight months. Besides, the passengers’ happiness rating went up from 3.2 to 4.1 out of 5 and there was a 23% increase in bus ridership. All these results show that a chip, equipped with sensors, powered by AI system could remarkably improve the level of service in poor-resource areas. However, it should still be emphasized that growing this system to more extensive areas and making it work that way for a long time would be very hard."

The proposed FreeDrape synthesizes realistic try-on results without requiring ground-truth supervision. FreeDrape leverages pose-aware bidirectional warping and appearance flow estimation to model how clothing deforms across varied human poses. Additional modules for shape adjustment and pattern restoration further improve realism. These components help preserve fine clothing details and structural consistency. Experimental results demonstrate that FreeDrape outperforms existing approaches, particularly in retaining intricate textures and adapting to diverse body poses, making it a robust solution for free-form garment transfer in real-world applications."

    "abstract": "There is a growing necessity for establishing a fair and reliable research evaluation metric given that these assessments directly influence academic promotions and the allocation of research funds towards the most deserving projects with a significant societal and environmental impact. Currently, the h-index is the most widely used metric by academic institutions to evaluate the academic performance of researchers. It is claimed that the h-index is designed to quantify both the quantity and the quality of a scholar's publications by measuring the number of papers that have received enough citations. Such a claim is not true as it favours quantity over quality. In effect, the h-index is defined as follows: a researcher has an index of h if h of their papers has at least h citations each, and the rest of their papers have fewer than h citations. This means that if a researcher has only one paper with 1 million citations, then his h-index will still be equal to 1. On the other hand, if a researcher aspires to achieve an h-index of 100, then he/she must publish at least 100 papers. To address this issue, we propose a new fairer metric called the k-index to evaluate the academic performance of researchers. The k-index is defined as the sum of the h-index and the q-index; whereby the q-index is a term that is proportional to the total number of citations, accounting for the quality and impact of the publications. We highlight authors who have made highly influential contributions in renewable energy, often through a few seminal works, but may not have the long, continuous publication record that builds a high h-index. We show that their corresponding k-indexes reflect their academic records in a much fairer way."

The hybrid intrusion detection system, which was proposed by this paper, helps in enhancing security within Internet of Things (IoT). The proposed framework applies both signature-based and anomaly-based approaches to AI -driven threat mitigation and incorporates machine learning in monitoring network traffic, suspicious activities, and the reaction in response to real-time dangers. The system detects known and zero-day threats with low false positive rates by integrating the strengths of conventional detection approaches with powerful artificial intelligence. To protect IoT ecosystems, a reinforcement learning agent optimizes methods in real time to ensure an adaptable and efficient reaction to threats. The framework's scalability, low latency, and excellent detection accuracy across varied IoT installations are shown experimentally using benchmark datasets. A key requirement in today's digital ecosystems is the security of IoT networks against growing cyber-attacks. This hybrid approach offers a robust, adaptive, and efficient solution to this problem."

One of the main shortcomings of most traditional solar panels is that they remain stuck in the same position, hence fail to take full advantage of the sun's movement throughout the day. In this project, we designed a smart solar tracking system that automatically follows the sun from sunrise to sunset, allowing the panels to catch more sunlight and generate more power. Our system uses simple sensors and a microcontroller to determine the position of the sun and adjusts the panel angle in real time, sidewise and up and down. We also implemented an intelligent feature that enables users to monitor how the system is performing from anywhere in the world using the internet. During the test run, this setup generated approximately 25-35% more energy when compared to regular fixed panels. It's a relatively inexpensive solution that can be highly beneficial for homes, businesses, and other standalone off- grid areas to make full use of their installed solar facilities."

    "abstract": "In an increasingly unpredictable and data-driven business landscape, ensuring seamless continuity during disruptions has become vital. Traditional Business Continuity Planning (BCP) methods are often static, expert-dependent, and incapable of responding to real-time changes in risk environments. These limitations lead to delayed scenario updates, poor scalability, and limited interpretability. To overcome these challenges, this study introduces an Adaptive BCP framework that combines Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) for pattern recognition with Scenario-Based Generative AI (GAI) for dynamic scenario generation. The core aim is to enable automated detection of anomalous risk clusters and generate realistic continuity responses based on real-time data. A multi-agent system feeds live data—news feeds, logs, and alerts—into the model, enabling adaptive retraining and scenario regeneration. The proposed SOM-GAI-BCP model achieves superior performance with a clustering accuracy of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\text{9 5. 6 \\%}$</tex>, scenario relevance of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\text{8 9. 2 \\%}$</tex>, and update latency under 3 seconds, supported by high interpretability through U-Matrix visualizations and expert review. Tools such as Python, TensorFlow, and Matplotlib are employed for implementation and evaluation. This hybrid, cognitive computing approach ensures timely, intelligent decision-making and paves the way for next-generation business continuity solutions that are scalable, interpretable, and aligned with modern risk dynamics."

This personalization motivates marketing effectiveness but at the same time it has also raised concerns over privacy, data misuse, and consumer autonomy. The General Data Protection (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act(CCPA) an existing privacy regulations have attempted to reinforce consumer rights, still they often fall short in delivering real-time transparency and granular consent management. Through this paper a block chain-enabled architecture is proposed which integrates decentralized identity management and smart contracts to create a consent-driven, transparent data-sharing model. This proposed model empowers a granular control to users over their personal data by enabling them to explicitly grant or deny access to all marketing platforms. The approach of immutability of blockchain and the decentralization of Interplanetary File System (IPFS) addresses user privacy, trust and compliance requirements. System's functionality is demonstrated by implementing a prototype using Ethereum and MetaMask which results as an improvement in data control, transparency and regulatory alignment."

To overcome this, we offer AI Fiesta, a model comparison platform, which aims to offer an interactive dashboard that facilitates a systematic analysis. The platform encompasses the combination of various AI models through a single interface with the visualization of performance, ranking based on metrics, and comparative insights. To guarantee the consistency of data processing, deep learning (DL) algorithm was used to provide data persistence, which would make the storage, retrieval, and dynamic update of experimental outcomes effective. The integration helps in a smooth interaction and durability of the platform. Through both transparent benchmarking and continuous data management, AI Fiesta will enable researchers and practitioners to make faster and better-informed model choice, which will eventually lead to the better deployment strategies in the real world."

    "abstract": "Image-based analysis is crucial for enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of rice grain evaluation, utilizing computer vision and image processing techniques. This methodology involves capturing rice grain images and applying various techniques to classify and assess their quality. This concept utilizes OpenCV to implement a real-time system, processing images from a camera to provide insights into grain size, shape, and quality. Classification is based on size, determined through contour analysis and area calculation, with contour detection, filtering, and ellipse fitting identifying rice grains. A novel approach detects broken grains by analyzing sharp edges within contours, improving rice quality assessment. The code offers visual representations of the process, displaying original images and various processing stages. This approach provides a practical solution for real-time rice evaluation, contributing to streamlining quality control processes in agriculture and food industries. By combining contour analysis, ellipse fitting, and innovative edge detection techniques, the system achieves accurate classification and quality assessment, holding significant potential for enhancing production and distribution practices."

    "abstract": "The need to have real-time, accurate, and low-resource medical imaging diagnostic systems has necessitated the inclusion of deep learning and edge computing. The new Edge-AI framework that is proposed in this paper ensures the low-latency inference on resource-constrained edge devices and enhances the accuracy of diagnostic through the exploitation of optimized Residual Neural Networks (ResNet). Compared to the majority of cloud-based solutions, the proposed structure has a light version of ResNet that can be trained with adaptive feature pruning and quantization aware. This capability allows for efficient deployment without a loss in diagnostic accuracy. Furthermore, the framework has a cross-layer residual attention mechanism to protect clinically relevant fine-grained features that are often lost during compressed architectures. Adaptive balancing of computation between central nodes and edge devices would be adopted through a distributed inference pipeline, allowing to save bandwidth and preserve privacy of patient data. Benchmark testing of medical imaging Experimental comparison shows that its energy efficiency improves by many times, reduces inference time by orders of magnitude, and its diagnostic accuracy exceeds the state-of-theart methods. This article sheds light on how edge-resilient ResNet models have the potential to make medical diagnosis intimate to real-time, scalable, privacy-sensitive, and correct."

To address these issues, we propose PLM-Net: Physics and Large-Model Guided Network for Single Image Dehazing, a novel framework that unifies generative semantic knowledge and physical constraints in a synergistic dual-path design. The Multimodal Diffusion Feature Adapter (MDFA) injects semantic priors from Stable Diffusion into the dehazing pipeline in a scale-aware manner, enhancing the network's understanding of haze distribution and scene structure. Simultaneously, the Multi-scale Physics-Driven Block (MPB) embeds the physical dehazing process into the network via differentiable transmission and atmospheric light estimation, improving interpretability and performance. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that PLM-Net achieves state-of-the-art results while maintaining clear physical meaning in its predictions."

The study aims to investigate DOA estimation under impulsive noise and small snapshot conditions. Traditional MUSIC algorithms typically require a large number of snapshots and high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) to achieve accurate direction finding. Although the maximum likelihood algorithm can handle coherent sources under low SNR and strong impulsive noise conditions, it still suffers from high computational complexity, excessive computational load, and poor convergence. Therefore, this paper proposes a single-snapshot direction-finding method based on a quantum artificial hummingbird mechanism, specifically the quantum artificial hummingbird algorithm under a uniform linear array, where the low-order moments are replaced with a cosine kernel function. This method can improve both the accuracy of direction finding and the robustness of DOA estimation."

However, traditional application integration methodologies are slow, brittle, and expensive, acting as a systemic bottleneck rather than an intelligent facilitator. This paper introduces Project Synapse, a self-service, low-code integration platform designed from the ground up to function as the neural network of the enterprise. The architecture is explicitly bio-inspired, comprising a central management service, the Nucleus (analogous to the cell body), and a high-performance, distributed execution engine, the Axon (the signal transmission pathway). By abstracting profound technical complexity behind a simple user interface and leveraging a powerful embedded rule engine for synaptic logic, the platform empowers non-technical product owners to forge new connections between applications dynamically.

Logistic regression was employed for estimating binary probabilities, along with Gradient Boosting and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) for higher accuracy and reduced overfitting risk.

In an attempt to resolve the above challenges, the research paper presents a hybrid cryptographic framework between the AES and RSA schemes combined with the Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in ensuring safe multi-tier cloud storage. AES is used to efficiently encrypt files whereas RSA is used to secure AES session keys. RBAC correlates user roles (Admin, Manager, Staff, Guest) with file sensitivity levels (Public, Restricted, Confidential, Highly Sensitive), and allows the implementation of access control with accuracy. Forensic preparedness is achieved through wholesome logging and auditing. The system was developed in python and tested on a Kaggle-based cloud data. Findings indicate that the framework encrypts and decrypts data at very high rates, access controls at 99 % accuracy and high resistance to brute force and unauthorized access, better than AES-only and RSA-only frameworks. This validates the idea that hybrid cryptography and RBAC are effective in ensuring the scalability in terms of security, efficiency, and usability in the multi-tenant cloud settings."

Despite advances, managing and analyzing images from construction sites remains a significant challenge in construction projects. Daily site monitoring ensures safety, maintains quality, and meets regulatory requirements. Traditionally, this process relies on-site managers manually capturing photos and writing daily reports, a time-consuming and labor-intensive task. To address this challenge, we proposed CSMMP-Dr (Construction Safety Multimodal Monitoring with Prompts for Daily Reporting), a novel multimodal framework designed to automatically generate comprehensive daily safety reports from construction site images. Using the capabilities of large multimodal models, CSMMP-Dr combines image understanding with textual generation to detect and describe safety conditions on construction sites. The framework uses real-world data from CECI Engineering Consultants, Inc., Taiwan. CSMMP-Dr processes input images through a dual-branch architecture: one for scene understanding using a multimodal SafeSceneView module and another for deep visual feature extraction via a Vision Transformer. Retrieved contextual information from a visual-textual database enhances the prompt and produces textual summaries and annotated images. Experimental results demonstrate that CSMMP-Dr significantly reduces reporting workload and improves clarity in safety monitoring, offering a practical solution for construction site management. We processed 1,409 images, achieving an average inference time of 12 seconds per task."

This study presents a rigorous comparative analysis of three established deep learning mod-els-Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and the Transformer-based BERT-applied to a multitask classification problem combining six fine-grained emotions and binary sentiment. Experiments are conducted on a focused subset of the GoEmotions dataset. The methodology includes essential techniques such as synonym-based data augmentation to expand the training set and weighted random sampling to mitigate class imbalance. To enhance rigor, ablation studies on data augmentation and statistical significance tests on performance differences are included. The results demonstrate that the Transformer model significantly surpasses the RNN baselines, achieving a macro-averaged emotion F1-score of 0.729 and a sentiment $\\mathbf{F 1}$-score of 0.943. An in-depth confusion analysis is provided, showing that while the Transformer excels, subtle semantic distinctions, particularly between admiration and approval, remain a primary source of misclassification. This work affirms the superiority of attention-based architectures for complex, fine- grained multi-task NLP, provides empirical evidence on the impact of preprocessing techniques, and establishes a foundation for future improvements in multi-label and hierarchical emotion modeling."

The model is solved by using a genetic algorithm with an improved mutation operator to dynamically adjust the mutation rate and enhance the global optimization ability. The case study analysis, based on typical daily data, compared the optimization results under the scenarios of fixed electricity prices and time-of-use electricity prices, verifying the effectiveness of the proposed model in reducing the total system cost, optimizing energy storage configuration, and enhancing operational economy.

Diverse Driving Restriction Zone (DRZ) scenarios were simulated in the Paris region to capture mobility and environmental impacts, and multiple machine learning models were trained on the MATSim outputs. Initial results show that while methods such as KNN, Gradient Boosted Trees, and multi-output Neural Networks struggle with high errors, separating models by policy outcome - especially at the regional level - improves accuracy, with Neural Networks and Linear Regression achieving RMSEs below 2%. Overall, aggregated, region-wide impacts appear more predictable than localized effects.

    "abstract": "The sensitive sector like medical care are growing rapidly, it is critical to maintain data confidentiality and integrity when using artificial intelligence (AI) in computing. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs), a piece of deep learning model, have shown impressive results in applications like image classification. However, there are significant risks associated with exposing raw data to central servers when using traditional centralized model training techniques. In highly regulated spaces such as healthcare, this model of computation is no longer an option due to data privacy issues and legislation such as GDPR and HIPAA. To overcome this vulnerability, we propose an end-to-end image classification system computed in an encrypted environment based on Homomorphic Encryption. It helps in computation on encrypted data without decrypting it, hence maintaining privacy even at inference and training phases. The implementation relies on the Cheon-Kim-Kim-Song (CKKS) encryption scheme implemented by the TenSEAL library, enabling approximate arithmetic on real numbers. A ResNet18 deep learning model pretrained on ImageN et and fine-tuned on a chest X-ray dataset is used as the base classifier. The model is adapted to run on encrypted feature vectors, allowing inference in an encrypted environment. Chest X-ray images from four classes-COVID-19, pneumonia, tuberculosis, and normal-make up the dataset used. This experiment demonstrates that homomorphically encrypted image classification is feasible with negligible performance and latency trade-offs. The model's classification accuracy is about 88%, and data confidentiality is 100% guaranteed. The deployment of secure AI models to privacy-critical applications, where data leakage can be catastrophic, like AI-aided radiology, smart diagnostics, and remote health care, is made possible by this work."

Cybercriminals are adopting ever sophisticated methods to capitalise on the vulnerabilities in systems of online financial systems. The velocity and multidimensionality of the present-day financial transactions indicate that the conventional fraud detection strategies, which tend to be inert and rule-intensive are no longer effective. Such systems lack real-time fraud prevention capability because they have very high false positive rates, cannot easily scale up, and have long reaction times.

    "abstract": "MerkleDoc is a hybrid, privacy-preserving document verification system that anchors cryptographic fingerprints of documents on a public blockchain while keeping document contents off-chain. The system divides documents into page-level SHA-256 hashes, constructs a Merkle tree, and stores only the Merkle root on-chain together with an EIP-712 issuer signature that cryptographically binds issuance to an owner's address. Verifiers can confirm the authenticity and ownership of any page using a compact Merkle inclusion proof without accessing the full document or a centralized backend. We describe the system design, security assumptions, smart-contract interface, and implementation choices, and we evaluate latency, gas consumption, and scalability on an Ethereum testnet. The code and evaluation scripts are available at: https://github.com/pieakshat/merkleAuthenticate.git."

    "abstract": "In contemporary smart grids, effective energy management is necessary to meet the balance between electricity consumption, cost, and sustainability. Traditional home energy systems are not adaptable and intelligent enough to manage the dynamic nature of renewables and variable pricing. To overcome these difficulties, the present system presents a Multi- Objective Improved Differential Evolution (MO-IDE) algorithm-based Smart Home Energy Management System (SHEMS) with photovoltaic (PV) generation, energy storage systems (ESS), and electric vehicles (EVs). The system maximizes power distribution by reducing energy cost, minimizing the peak-to-average ratio, and maximizing the usage of renewable energy. The MO-IDE algorithm utilizes adaptive mutation and control parameters for quicker convergence and optimization accuracy, and decision-tree-based scheduling ensures real-time execution with efficient load shifting, ESS management, and EV coordination. The goal is to maximize energy efficiency, cost savings, and grid stability through smart decision-making. The innovation is in the integration of state-of- the-art optimization with scheduling based on machine learning, which gives a robust, scalable, and sustainable solution for the next-generation smart home."

    "abstract": "Deep learning provides a powerful method for modeling the dynamics of soft robots, offering advantages over traditional analytical approaches that require precise knowledge of the robot's structure, material properties, and other physical characteristics. Given the inherent complexity and non-linearity of these systems, extracting such details can be challenging. The mappings learned in one domain cannot be directly transferred to another domain with different physical properties. This challenge is particularly relevant for soft robots, as their materials gradually degrade over time. In this paper, we introduce a domain translation framework based on a conditional cycle generative adversarial network (CCGAN) to enable knowledge transfer from a source domain to a target domain. Specifically, we employ a dynamic learning approach to adapt a pose controller trained in a standard simulation environment to a domain with tenfold increased viscosity. Our model learns from input pressure signals conditioned on corresponding end-effector positions and orientations in both domains. We evaluate our approach through trajectory-tracking experiments across five distinct shapes and further assess its robustness under noise perturbations and periodicity tests. The results demonstrate that CCGAN-GP effectively facilitates cross-domain skill transfer, paving the way for more adaptable and generalizable soft robotic controllers."

However, predicting their performance prior to real-world deployment remains challenging, often leading to costly experimental setups and uncertain outcomes. In this paper, we present Build-A-Volcap, an automated synthetic validation environment designed to predict the quality of real-world volumetric capture systems. Our solution constructs comprehensive synthetic datasets and environments that faithfully simulate practical capture conditions. This enables rigorous testing and benchmarking of volumetric methods such as photogrammetry, NeRF, Gaussian Splatting and Radiant Foam without the need for physical setups. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate how Build-A-Volcap effectively identifies methodological strengths and limitations, significantly reducing the synthetic-to-real gap.

Thus, researchers are exploring a new way, such as machine learning (ML), to automate the assessment. Recent research on visual artistic creativity assessment has demonstrated that ML methods are effective but constrained by their reliance on visual data alone. This study integrates textual descriptions alongside visual data for a more holistic assessment of paintings’ creativity, which is more sophisticated to measure than simple sketches. The multimodal model was fine-tuned and leveraged both visual and textual inputs. It achieved approximately 95.3% accuracy in predicting the painting creativity scores, demonstrating a strong positive correlation (Pearson r = 0.96) with expert ratings. The study allows a text-image evaluation of paintings’ creativity to better align with human interpretations."

The research first establishes a mathematical model based on the temporal sensitivity characteristics of the pathological slide staining process, defines an optimization function with the goal of minimizing the total staining time, and quantifies the risk of staining time fluctuations by introducing a fuzzy membership function. Around the non-waiting scheduling characteristic of pathological slide staining, the non-waiting constraint model is further designed in collaboration with the EAX genetic algorithm.

This research proposes a novel transformer-based multimodal deep learning architecture that integrates heterogeneous data sources—ECG signals, clinical parameters, demographic attributes, and lifestyle habits (e.g., smoking, alcohol consumption, and dietary behavior)—to enhance prediction accuracy. Unlike traditional CNN-LSTM or ensemble models, the proposed framework employs a Vision Transformer (ViT) for ECG signal analysis, BERT-like encoder blocks for textual and tabular clinical data, and a self-attention-based fusion module to capture cross-modal interactions. The fusion network efficiently combines the temporal dynamics of ECG with structured lifestyle and clinical features. Experimental results on publicly available datasets show the proposed model achieves an accuracy of 94.6%, precision of 93.8%, recall of 92.7%, F1-score of 93.2%, and AUC-ROC of 95.1%, outperforming CNN-LSTM and Random Forest baselines. This approach demonstrates the power of transformer architectures in modeling multimodal biomedical data and offers a reliable, scalable solution for intelligent cardiovascular health assessment and prevention."

In order to investigate the possibility of using a MCEC directly coupled to solar electric power, it is crucial to study the MCEC’s transient behaviour. In this context, this study proposes the development of a dynamic and multiphysics 2D model of a MCEC single cell. Step-change current profiles were applied to analyse the system’s dynamic responses in terms of charge, mass, and heat transfer. Simulation results revealed that electrical voltage reacts quickly to sudden changes, with a response time of only a few milliseconds (0.4-0.6 s). Mass transfer responds more slowly than charge transfer, with gas molar fractions requiring around 1 s to reach a new steady state. In the MCEC, heat transfer, particularly temperature, is the slowest dynamic phenomenon, taking approximately 1.5 hours to reach a new steady state. These results highlight that temperature, identified as the most critical dynamic parameter of the cell, requires an adapted control strategy when coupled with a highly fluctuating electrical power supply to ensure efficient MCEC operation and optimal hydrogen/syngas production."

This paper proposed an algorithm for performance evaluation of prediction models (PEPM) based on performance scores for the different sizes of data. It provides the categorization of prediction models based on the mean performance score evaluation over the different sizes of temporal datasets. An illustration of the proposed algorithm has been done experimentally.

    "abstract": "Pointer analysis is a static code analysis technique that derives points-to information of the pointers used in a program. This information can be used to enhance the precision and reasoning capability of LLMs when dealing with program semantics, to detect bugs in the program, identify security vulnerabilities, program verification, etc. LLVM (Low-Level Virtual Machine) is a widely used compiler framework that has gained significant popularity in industry as well as in academia for the ease of adding passes to it due to its well-designed IR. However, it is observed that program analysts when performing pointer analysis often encounter significant challenges in understanding the LLVM IR because (a) it employs a low-level, load-storebased memory abstraction instead of the higher-level, namebased abstraction used in three-address code (b) and includes numerous low-level details within its instructions. Hence, there exists a pressing demand, particularly for pointer analysis for an abstraction layer over the LLVM IR that will extract only the relevant information from the IR while ignoring the rest. To address this, we present SLIM (Simplified LLVM IR Modelling), an open-source tool engineered as a high-level abstraction over LLVM IR. SLIM employs a name-based memory abstraction and conceals low-level details, producing a clean intermediate representation that is ideal for pointer analysis. We observe that (a) With SLIM there is a reduction in the instruction count for performing pointer analysis as compared to LLVM IR by an average reduction of 52% on the programs analyzed from SPEC CPU 2017 benchmark suite. (b) SLIM provides an easy framework for implementing an analysis as per the scaffolded study conducted at IIT Bombay and VNIT, Nagpur."

The dataset, downloaded from a publicly owned Kaggle repository, was split into 75 % training, 15 % validation, and 15 % test sets, with the latter two sets maintaining a balanced representation between OSCC and normal cases. Here are the models considered along with their accuracies on the test set: Basic CNN: 84.34%; ResNet50: 93.20%; DenseNet121: 84.72%; EfficientNetB3: 94.74%; EfficientNetB3 with FineTuning & Data Augmentation: 97.18%; MobileNetV2 with Fine-Tuning & Data Augmentation: 89.70%; and the proposed custom InceptionResNetV2(90%) variants with data normalization and augmentation. EfficientNetB3 set the record, with ResNet50 and the fine-tuned EfficientNetB3 keeping close behind.

In this study, a new method based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is proposed to accelerate the calculation of statistical descriptors. We designed a CNN model that takes a two-dimensional binarized material microstructure image as input and predicts the key points of its two-point correlation function and pore size distribution. Experimental results on Fontainebleau sandstone(FS) materials show that the prediction accuracy of the CNN model is almost the same as that calculated by traditional methods, and the calculation speed is increased by 20 times. Therefore, this study provides an effective way to quickly and accurately calculate the statistical descriptors of material microstructure, which has important theoretical significance and practical application value."

    "abstract": "Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are essential in the scope of Internet of Things (IoT) mainly environmental monitoring, industrial automation, and smart city projects. However, in practice, large-scale WSNs have a series of problems such as node failure, energy imbalance and environment uncertain. Hotspot and traffic congestion affects the network lifetime and reliability in case of static sink-based data collection. To address these, in this paper we present FAIRM-WSN an intelligent and comprehensive solution to the problem of fault-tolerance, energy efficiency, and data collection performance. The system contains three main parts: fault detection, clustering-based data collection and adaptive mobile sink path planning. For fault detection, a hybrid scheme is employed including the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) dimension reduction for data feature extraction and Deep Neural Network (DNN) whose parameters are fine-tuned by Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm (GOA) for high accuracy component localization when one fails. As a result, the healthy nodes are collected by DBSCAN to obtain energy and fault-conscious visiting points for the mobile sink. An agent based on Deep Q-Network (DQN) adaptively changes the trajectory of the sink according to network status. Experimental results on UNC WSN benchmark dataset show that FAIRM-WSN obtains the fault detection accuracy at about 99.72%, and energy saving of 22.3%, as well as better data delivery than some state-of-the-art algorithms. The results demonstrate the capabilities of FAIRM-WSN as a powerful and scalable approach for intelligent, fault-tolerant and energy-efficient WSN management over real world IoT systems."

    "abstract": "This paper proposes hybrid Neural Network-based Model Predictive Control (NN-MPC) architectures for real-time autonomous vehicle path tracking. To compensate for their individual drawbacks, we integrate supervised learning directly into the optimization process to accelerate solver convergence. Specifically, Multilayer perceptrons are trained to learn a constraint-correction term added to the closedform unconstrained MPC solution, and to provide learning-assisted warm starts for an active-set QP solver by predicting the Lagrange multiplier vector and the active-constraint pattern. The first solution avoids online quadratic programming (QP) and achieves an approximately two orders of magnitude reduction in computation time, at the cost of approximate constraint enforcement in highly transient conditions, whereas the latter two solutions retain the original constrained optimization problem. The learning components are trained on a simplified design model and evaluated in the high-fidelity CarMaker environment to assess robustness under unmodeled dynamics and modeling errors. In CarMaker validation, the classificationbased warm start reduces the number of QP iterations by approximately 30% and computation time by 23% relative to a classical shift-initialization warm start, supporting more predictable real-time operation in representative driving scenarios."

    "abstract": "In multi-robot coverage control, ground robots aim to cover and monitor a domain optimally. However, when covering an extensive domain like a densely forested potential fire site, the sensing capabilities of ground robots are limited, resulting in poor coverage. Leveraging the aerial robots’ ability to expand sensing ranges through high-altitude flight, this paper proposes a fully distributed, air-ground coverage control scheme to address this challenge. First, aerial robots provide a low-resolution coverage of the domain. Then, they use coarse but broad sensing information to guide ground robots, with short-range but high-resolution sensing, to achieve a high-resolution coverage. Simultaneously, each aerial robot dynamically adjusts its cell size to match its load, enhancing the coverage performance. The convergence of the control scheme is proved and its performance is evaluated through simulations and experiments."

    "abstract": "Advances in multi-robot technology have accelerated the development of smart agriculture, enabling tasks to be executed collaboratively with higher efficiency. In heterogeneous agricultural robots collaborative operation scheduling, fuzzy time window and matching constraints significantly increase the problem complexity. This paper proposes a multi-objective heterogeneous agricultural robot operation scheduling model with fuzzy service time window and matching constraints (MHROS_FT&M), aiming to optimize the total operation cost and service level. Given the NP-hard property of MHROS_FT&M, the hierarchical learning large neighborhood search algorithm (HLLNS) is developed. HLLNS incorporates the hierarchical reinforcement learning to enhance adaptability, a dynamic programming-based approach to improve service levels, and a sub-problem collaboration and mutation strategy to escape local optimum. By employing automated algorithm design technique to optimize 12 key parameters, the automated HLLNS (AHLLNS) is realized. In practical smart-farming scenarios, AHLLNS supports the joint scheduling of heterogeneous robots such as spraying drones, weeding robots, and seeding drones under uncertain service times, and explicitly balances operation cost against farmer satisfaction. The obtained schedules reduce unnecessary travel and resource consumption while keeping service times within acceptable ranges for farmers. Through automatic parameter tuning and the use of problem-specific operators, AHLLNS effectively addresses fuzzy time windows and matching constraints, achieving better performance across different problem scales. Experimental comparisons with Gurobi and state-of-the-art algorithms demonstrate AHLLNS superior computational efficiency and solution quality, validating its effectiveness for MHROS_FT&M."

    "abstract": "The vibrating sample magnetometer is one of the most popular choices for measuring magnetic moment. The detection coil array determines the performance of a vibrating sample magnetometer to a great extent. In the past decades, researches have been striving to finely adjust the dimensions and spatial location of the circular coils to obtain a uniform zone of sensitivity. Here, we found that reshaping the traditional circular coils can be a simple but quite effective solution. Two noncircular coil designs: semicircular and oblong coils were proposed based on the distribution of magnetic flux density variation induced by the vibrating sample on the electromagnet pole plane via finite element analysis. Compared with the conventional circular coils, the proposed semicircular/oblong coils exhibited larger uniform zone by about 18%/20% and significantly enhanced sensitivity by about 47%/49% at the center of the coil array, respectively, under the limited circular area on the pole plane. Furthermore, by appropriately enlarging the semicircular and oblong coils while maintaining the distance between the left and right coil pairs unchanged, a uniform zone expansion of about 53%/35% and a sensitivity increase of about 9%/11% over the circular coils were obtained. The simultaneous improvement in both the uniform zone and sensitivity via detection coil reshaping is advantageous for enhancing the repeatability and accuracy of the vibrating sample magnetometer."

    "abstract": "With increasingly complex tasks, cooperation among multiple unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) groups has become more significant. However, in complex operational environments, UAVs may operate outside the communication coverage of the trusted authority (TA), making continuous online TA services unavailable. Under such circumstances, most existing group management methods have difficulty achieving group fusion and cannot flexibly update post-fusion member certificates. Therefore, we propose an autonomous UAV group management scheme based on mobile proactive secret sharing. First, the scheme achieves autonomous group fusion by updating the subsecrets of UAVs. Second, without the participation of a TA, the scheme supports the dynamic self-updating of certificates, ensuring secure communication in the new group and continuous availability of certificates. Security proofs and analyses show that the proposed scheme is secure under the random oracle model and can resist several common attacks. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms related schemes in computational performance and is suitable for secure and efficient UAV group management scenarios."

    "abstract": "Tidal flats, located between the highest and lowest tidal levels, have topography that directly determines habitat patterns and plays a critical role in ecological security and sustainable management. Existing satellite remote sensing–based elevation inversion methods primarily include the waterline method and the inundation frequency method. However, both approaches exhibit limitations in accuracy and in capturing fine-scale tidal flat topographic features. Additionally, single-temporal optical imagery–based sediment moisture content (SMC) models, while physically capable of representing elevation differences, are highly susceptible to slope effects and residual water interference, which hampers their large-scale applicability. To address these challenges, this study proposes a novel tidal flat elevation inversion method (TFEIM-MSF) based on optical imagery and inundation frequency information. The method constructs pixel-scale cumulative moisture-sensitive features to enhance spectral information utilization. Combined with inundation frequency features, a deep learning network is designed to fuse detailed and trend information at the output stage, using ICESat-2 LiDAR elevation data as control points to achieve high-precision tidal flat elevation inversion. Experimental results from three typical tidal flat regions in England show that TFEIM-MSF maintains high accuracy under complex environmental conditions, achieving RMSE values of 0.30–0.33 m and R² values of 0.91–0.95, demonstrating consistent improvements over the existing Tide2Topo method. This method overcomes the limitations of information utilization and fitting capability inherent in inundation frequency and waterline-based approaches, offering an efficient and low-cost technical solution for global tidal flat elevation monitoring."

Dynamic Capabilities theory extends the static resource-based view of the firm by incorporating learning and innovation in evolving environments. Its collaborative extension has recently been introduced to analyze the behavior of corporate dynamics within evolving ecosystems shaped by Information and Communication Technologies and firms' digitalization strategies. However, empirical evaluations of how digital value chains influence firm level productivity and innovation remain limited, relying on static efficiency evaluation frameworks. We apply a dynamic Slacks-Based Data Envelopment Analysis model to a panel of 1,369 Spanish manufacturing firms progressing through the emergence and consolidation phases of digitalization that have characterized the early decades of the twenty-first century. We examine how efficiency and competitiveness evolve, finding that larger firms and those in more complex technological sectors show more varied behavior but lower inefficiency. The findings offer implications for theory, best practices, and digitalization policies. The robustness of our analysis has been validated by demonstrating substantial differences between the patterns obtained under the standard static and our dynamic evaluation environments."

A novel concept of covert sensing, preventing adversarial observers from detecting our sensing action or sensing intentions, is proposed, and a new metric named covert sensing distance (CSD) is established to evaluate the corresponding performance. Specifically, we develop a two-stage scheme. The first stage is to minimize the multi-user interference (MUI) while designing an omnidirectional transmit beampattern by constraining the CSD, to guarantee both reliable communications and covert sensing. Leveraging receiver design flexibility, the second stage formulates a trade-off optimization problem by maximizing the sensing signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and imposing a similarity constraint to obtain a directional receive beampattern to improve the sensing performance. To solve the formulated nonconvex problem, we propose an efficient alternating optimization algorithm aided by the gradient-projection framework. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed scheme is validated by simulation results."

    "abstract": "Mobile metaverses are envisioned as a transformative digital ecosystem that delivers immersive, intelligent, and ubiquitous services through mobile devices. Driven by Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents hold the potential to empower the creation, maintenance, and evolution of mobile metaverses, enabling seamless human-machine interaction and dynamic service adaptation. Currently, AI agents are primarily built upon cloud-based LLMs and VLMs. However, several challenges hinder their efficient deployment, including high service latency and a risk of sensitive data leakage during perception and processing. In this paper, we develop an edge-cloud collaboration-based federated AI agent construction framework in mobile metaverses. Specifically, Edge Servers (ESs), as agent infrastructures, first create agent modules in a distributed manner. The cloud server then integrates these modules into AI agents and deploys them at the edge, thereby enabling low-latency AI agent services for users. Considering that ESs may exhibit dynamic levels of willingness to participate in federated AI agent construction, we design a two-period dynamic contract model to continuously incentivize ESs to participate in agent module creation, effectively addressing the dynamic information asymmetry between the cloud server and ESs. Furthermore, we propose an Enhanced Diffusion Model-based Soft Actor-Critic (EDMSAC) algorithm to effectively generate optimal dynamic contracts. In the algorithm, we apply dynamic structured pruning to DM-based actor networks to enhance denoising efficiency and policy learning performance. Simulation results demonstrate that the EDMSAC algorithm outperforms the DMSAC algorithm by up to 23% in optimal dynamic contract generation."

    "abstract": "Stable and effective communication is a fundamental prerequisite for power electronic converters (PECs) to facilitate critical functions such as condition monitoring, fault detection, and power flow management. Existing switching frequency modulation methods employ switching ripples as data carriers. Their demodulation relies on a spectral analysis of the ripple signal, which suffers from limited spectral resolution. This limitation thus constrains the achievable data rate and increases system disturbances. To address this limitation, this paper proposes a novel switching event-triggered communication method that leverages high-frequency (HF) switching oscillations as data carriers. Based on an analysis of the causal relationship between power device switching actions and HF switching oscillations, a HF oscillation current sensor and a signal processing circuit were designed to extract the switching oscillation current and convert it into discrete switching events. Theoretical and experimental investigations demonstrate that the proposed method achieves a demodulation period of just two switching cycles and a switching frequency resolution of 0.2%, while maintaining robust performance under dynamic operating conditions."

    "abstract": "This study investigates the electromagnetic shielding effectiveness (SE) of ventilation structures based on the waveguide-below-cutoff principle using a combined full-wave numerical and full-scale experimental approach. Although waveguide-below-cutoff ventilation designs are widely adopted for electromagnetic pulse (EMP) protection, existing standards, such as MIL-STD-188-125, prescribe conservative waveguide length guidelines that are often impractical for space- and weight-constrained naval platforms. Full-wave simulations were conducted using the Method of Moments accelerated by the Multilevel Fast Multipole Method (MoM–MLFMM), and broadband experimental measurements were performed in accordance with MIL-STD-188-125. The shielding performance was characterized using transmission coefficient (<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">S</i><sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">21</sub>) measurements over a frequency range of 10 kHz–1 GHz using loop, biconical, and log-periodic antennas. The test specimens consisted of full-scale 20 × 30 waveguide-below-cutoff ventilation arrays with 50×50mmsquare apertures and waveguide depths of 140 mm, 175 mm, and 210 mm. The close agreement between the simulations and measurements validates the full-wave modeling framework and enables quantitative evaluation of the shielding performance for electrically large configurations. For all tested cases, the measured SE exceeded 80 dB across the entire frequency band, satisfying the MIL-STD-188-125 requirement. The results further demonstrate that compliant shielding performance can be achieved with waveguide depths that are approximately two to three times the aperture diagonal, with an enhanced attenuation observed at higher frequencies. These findings provide full-scale experimental evidence that the conservative waveguide length guideline in MIL-STD-188-125 can be satisfied with a substantially reduced waveguide depth, thereby establishing experimentally validated design flexibility for compact EMP-compliant naval ventilation structures."

This paper develops a hybrid IoT/ML model to identify and characterize harmful gases released by car silencers. The system air quality sensors will be a MQ-series and NDIR sensors installed at the silencer to extract the content of carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx), hydrocarbons (HC) and carbon dioxide (CO2). To decrease noise and normalize the signal, preprocessing is conducted through Butterworth low-pass filters and Z-score normalization. An ESP32 microcontroller records and transmits data via MQTT data over Wi-Fi/LoRa to a cloud server. A Random Forest classifier is trained with supervised learning to classify emission level into the Safe, Warning, and Critical zones. Further, a dynamic Emission Severity Score (ESS) is generated on weighted gas concentrations to allow higher interpretability and alerting. Test results on 100 vehicles showed a classification accuracy of 92.3%, and a low transmission latency of data in real-time of less than 250 milliseconds with stable dashboard data display. Flexibility of the model was determined using iterative steps of retraining the model, increasing the F1-score to 90.8%. The analytics dashboard uses a web-based application, which provides real-time heatmaps of the emissions, historical comparisons, regulatory alerts. The proposed system proves to be quite effective in assessing environmental risk, quick decision-making, and scalability to smart cities and regulatory networks. The incorporation of real-time IoT sensing and adaptive machine learning makes it a scalable and sustainable methodology in the modern control of emissions.

This model first utilizes CNN to extract local spatial features from load data, then employs GRU to capture temporal dependencies, and finally introduces a KAN layer to achieve fine-grained mapping and decision-making for complex high-order nonlinear relationships among features. The unique learnable activation function structure of the KAN network enhances the model's fitting capability while potentially offering advantages in interpretability.

    "abstract": "The increasing adoption of DC microgrids (MGs) in data centres demands high-efficiency, reduce electromagnetic interference (EMI), stable power conversion systems, stable operation with wide voltage range and load variation. The Dual Active Bridge (DAB) resonant converter is a promising solution due to its high-power density and bidirectional power flow capability. However, ensuring robust stability and dynamic performance under varying load conditions remains a challenge, especially in the presence of data centres as load. This paper proposes a Super Twisting Sliding Mode Control Observer (STSMO) approach to enhance the regulation performance and robustness of a DAB resonant converter while reducing chattering and voltage regulation. The proposed control strategy is validated through MATLAB/Simulink with a Software-in-the-Loop (SIL) experiments, demonstrating its effectiveness in maintaining stable operation, fast transient response, and improved voltage regulation. The results confirm that the proposed STSMO based DAB resonant converter achieves enhanced stability, even when supplying data centres, making it a viable solution for next-generation data centres and power flow in DC MGs"

We begin by identifying key distinctions between PnP and diffusion models—particularly in their denoising mechanisms and sampling procedures. By decoupling the diffusion process into three interpretable stages: denoising, data consistency enforcement, and sampling, we provide a unified framework that integrates learned priors with physical forward models in a principled manner. Building upon this insight, we propose a hybrid data-consistency module that linearly combines multiple PnP-style fidelity terms. This hybrid correction is applied directly to the denoised estimate, improving measurement consistency without disrupting the diffusion sampling trajectory. Experimental results on single-pixel imaging tasks demonstrate that our method achieves better reconstruction quality."

Our method leverages the AOM drive signal as a phase reference to directly estimate and suppress drift components. Experimental validation with piezoelectric standards demonstrates near-complete drift elimination and reveals the dominant influence of sampling clock instability. The solution maintains sub-nanometer accuracy under thermal variations, enables substantial yield improvement in semiconductor manufacturing, and dramatically reduces implementation costs compared to hardware-based approaches.

The WCS mechanism incorporates classbased weighting and contextual information from preceding dialogue turns to improve both predictive reliability and interpretability.

However, most existing approaches rely on centralized computing, which struggles to address the challenges posed by massive traffic data. Edge computing provides a promising solution to this issue. In this paper, we propose a Spatio-Temporal Graph Temporal Convolutional Network for traffic forecasting under the Edge Computing paradigm (STGTCN-EC). To adapt to edge environments, we first partition the large-scale traffic network into multiple subgraphs by jointly considering computational load balance and communication cost. This decomposition transforms the global forecasting problem into distributed tasks executed on edge computing units. Then, the model employs a gated temporal convolutional network (Gated TCN) to capture temporal dependencies and integrates a graph convolutional network (GCN) to extract spatial topological features, enabling accurate traffic flow prediction. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed model improves both prediction accuracy and training efficiency in traffic forecasting."

The parallel dual straight-tube adopts a \"splitter-parallel-combiner\" flow channel design, which minimizes flow resistance to avoid solid deposition and bubble stagnation, while suppressing environmental common-mode interference through symmetric anti-phase vibration. The DSP-based digital driving system integrates three key signal processing algorithms: adaptive lattice notch filter for fundamental frequency extraction, zero-crossing detection combined with autocorrelation analysis for amplitude calculation, and Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) for drive-sensor phase difference estimation. A dual closed-loop control strategy, consisting of adaptive PI amplitude control with parameter switching and phase difference compensation control, is implemented to ensure stable resonance. Experimental verification under ambient temperature and pressure using six media shows that the system achieves rapid resonant frequency locking, stable phase difference control, and precise amplitude regulation. The calibrated quadratic density-frequency model realizes high-precision density inversion with an absolute error ≤±0.002 g/cm<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup>.

This paper introduces DeepLSTMDefense, a recurrent sequence-classification pipeline. Network flows are grouped into time-ordered sequences, normalized, and windowed to keep temporal dependencies. Then, stacked Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers are used to model traffic dynamics more accurately than static feature learners. We trained and tested the system using CICDDoS2019 and custom Portmap traces. Compared to classical baselines (Naïve Bayes, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest), consistent gains were made: on CICDDoS2019, the accuracy was 97.9%, the precision was 98.1%, the recall was 97.8%, and the false-alarm rate was 4.3%. This cut the overall error rate from 7.517% to 2.103% (≈72.0% relative reduction). When there was only a small amount of Portmap traffic, the error rate dropped by 39.69%, showing that it works with more than one dataset. These findings were validated by an AUC exceeding 0.98 and by confusion matrices demonstrating elevated sensitivity and specificity across various attack vectors. By framing DDoS detection as sequence classification, it became possible to establish earlier and more dependable trigger points for mitigation without compromising generalization. The stacked-LSTM design was put to use for practical, almost real-time defense."

However, the incorporation of LiDAR—a key modality for spatial and geometric comprehension—into multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) remains underdeveloped. In this work, we devise a novel framework that enhances MLLMs with object-level LiDAR comprehension by jointly aligning both scene-level and region-of-interest (ROI) LiDAR features with natural language. Our method includes three components: scene-level LiDAR compression, ROI-based extraction of object-level features, and multimodal alignment with language. To support accurate object-level understanding, we propose two complementary tasks: LiDAR-to-Class (predicting object classes from LiDAR features) and Class-to-LiDAR (identifying LiDAR objects from natural language descriptions). Leveraging the large-scale NuScenes dataset with over one million annotated objects, our model achieves strong performance, including 95% accuracy on the Class-to-LiDAR task. Leveraging LiDAR data, this work advances precise object-level semantic understanding in 3D environments and underscores the potential of MLLMs in safety-critical and interactive scenarios such as autonomous driving and robotics."

We tested three models: a custom CNN, Xception, and EfficientNetB0 on the HAM10000 dataset, which has <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\text{1 0, 0 1 5}$</tex> dermatoscopic images from ISIC 2018. We compared the masked and unmasked versions of each image. EfficientNetB0 showed the best improvement, with accuracy rising from 68.43 percent to 78.02 percent and macro-F1 increasing from 0.48 to 0.73. In contrast, the custom CNN and Xception, which already had high accuracy (98.58 percent and 97.61 percent), saw small drops in performance after applying masks. Their macro-F1 scores remained nearly unchanged (custom CNN: 0.98 to 0.98; Xception: 0.98 to 0.97). This effect is likely due to the removal of background information that would have otherwise been useful. Statistical analysis showed no significant difference between automated masks and manually refined ones. Overall, automated lesion masking can enhance diagnostic performance in mid-range deep learning models and may support computer-aided skin cancer detection, particularly for clinicians with less experience."

    "abstract": "Accurate and timely evaluation of handwritten exam answer sheets remains a major challenge in educational institutions, especially for large-scale assessments. Manual grading is time-consuming, prone to inconsistencies, and often leads to delayed feedback for students. Although OCR-based grading systems exist, their accuracy is often insufficient for realworld deployment due to handwritten script variability. Recent advances in artificial intelligence, particularly large language models (LLMs), offer promising solutions to this problem. This paper presents an automated grading system that combines image preprocessing, advanced OCR, and LLM-based evaluation. Gemini Flash Thinking is employed for OCR, achieving up to 98% character-level accuracy on a benchmark of 100 answer scripts. Each extracted answer block is mapped to its respective question using a likelihood-based merge sort prompt augmented with semantic entailment scoring. This ensures contextual accuracy in matching even for incomplete or misaligned responses. Following mapping, a multi-agentic evaluation strategy is introduced using simulated professor agents for collaborative grading. These agents assess content relevance, coverage, and structure, while providing constructive feedback and rubricbased scoring. The proposed pipeline significantly reduces human intervention while maintaining grading consistency and fairness. It offers a scalable, explainable, and institution-ready solution for automated subjective answer evaluation."

    "abstract": "Enterprises face an existential threat from ransomware that encrypts important data with no warning; therefore, early and automated detection tools are required. Zero-day versions have a high possibility of success compared to conventional signaturebased and computational approaches, which generate many false negatives. Although these methods use deep learning techniques to achieve good detection results, the existing algorithms are not trained to handle ransomware, which leads to more false positives because of enterprise and sporadic contexts. The proposed system provides a hybrid supervised machine learning architecture that combines incremental updates, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks with attention for temporal behavior modeling, and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for spatial feature extraction to close these inefficiencies. With an accuracy of 99.75%, an F1 score of 99.51%, an F2 score of 99.61%, an FPR of 0.17%, and a mean time to detect (MTTD) of 4.8 seconds, the results show significant improvements and provide a strong early-warning framework for businesses’ security operations."

This paper presents a TinyML-based monitoring system that enables real-time battery parameters estimation to support digital passport requirements using voltage (V), current (I), and temperature (T) measurements. Two neural network architectures were evaluated: an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) with 6.5K parameters and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with 24.5K parameters. Both models were quantized to 8-bit precision and deployed on an STM32F413ZHT6 microcontroller with ESP32-WROOM-32E for cloud connectivity. Experimental validation was performed using a case study of State of Charge estimation for a 20 Ah Lithium Iron Phosphate battery. The ANN model achieved superior performance with a Mean Absolute Error below 5.3% and a Root Mean Square Error below 6.7%, while consuming only 6.36 kB of flash memory and 0.35 kB of scratch memory. The quantized models showed minimal accuracy degradation compared to full-precision versions. The proposed system provides a cost-effective solution for continuous battery monitoring, supporting regulatory compliance while enabling predictive diagnostics and enhanced safety management throughout the battery lifecycle."

This work introduces an automated UTI detection system that uses Multi-Task Cascaded Convolutional Neural Networks (MTCNN) for analyzing the urine color images provided by the users. The severity of the infection is classified into three categories, namely, normal, mild and severe according to color intensity and visual characteristics. Preprocessing methods including color correction and histogram normalization were employed to ensure that the data are normalized. The MTCNN framework is able to extract texture, hue and spatial features efficiently with the help of its multi-stage cascaded design and outperforms traditional color-threshold and rule-based classification methods in accuracy and stability. Experimental results show that MTCNN can learn the correlation between urine color characteristics and the level of infection well. The proposed approach provides a fast, cheap and non-invasive diagnostic solution for remote monitoring of patients and mobile health applications. Future work has the purpose of improving clinical reliability by combining multimodal parameters such as odor, pH, and chemical indicators in order to advance intelligent and accessible healthcare diagnostics through deep learning-based color images analysis."

    "abstract": "As the number of internet-enabled tools grows exponentially, contemporary networks are experiencing more advanced cyber threats, such as unauthorized access, data breaches, and the so-called zero-day attacks. The problem with the traditional Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and its use of signature-based or conventional machine learning methods is that they tend to miss unknown or rare intrusions because of the imbalanced datasets and because the network traffic is dynamic. A new IDS architecture based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and the ability to detect it, has been suggested in this research. GAN model produces realistically synthesized intrusion traffic which complements the existing datasets and solves the problem of class imbalance. The discriminator, which is trained together with the generator is an efficient anomaly-detecting model since it is trained to be aware of the underlying distributions of typical network behavior and to identify malicious activity. Experimental analyses on popular benchmark datasets, such as NSL-KDD and CICIDS2017, show that the proposed GAN-based IDS shows a markedly better level of detection accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score than the traditional models. The findings are that the system is especially efficient in recognizing unprecedented attacks and resisting against changing network environments. This study presents the opportunity of adversarial learning as a data augmentation approach as well as a solid machine to detect anomalies, which opens the door to smarter, adaptive, and resilient IDS solutions. The given approach is useful in the practical application of network administrators and cybersecurity specialists trying to enhance the security against the new threats in the modern network settings."

Along with the integration of AI into digital learning transformation, knowing aspects that its application critically affects the enhancement of learning experiences. By using quantitative approach, with a survey of 209 higher education students in Indonesia that experienced in using AI chatbots, this research evaluates five main variables: technology characteristics, task-technology fit, perceived usefulness, expectation confirmation, and intention to use. SEM (Structured Equation Modeling) analysis shows that technology characteristics significantly influence task-technology fit, followed by positive impact over perceived usefulness as well as intention to use. Expectation confirmation also boosts perceived usefulness, meanwhile perceived usefulness along with task-technology fit directly strengthen students’ intention to use. Unexpectedly, task-technology fit appears as strongest predictor of intention to use, indicating the importance of aligning between chatbot capabilities with academic tasks. This finding suggests that educators and developers must prioritize in optimizing AI chatbots functional alignment with learning environment, also ensuring that educative values are implemented to encourage adoption.

    "abstract": "This paper proposes an optimal design method for a 100% renewables-based off-grid power system in rural Japan that considers the production and external sale of green hydrogen. While prior work has largely treated hydrogen as seasonal storage, the economics of selling surplus hydrogen under realistic logistics constraints remain underexplored. We develop a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model that co-optimizes the capacities of photovoltaic panels, wind turbines, batteries, and hydrogen equipment (electrolyzer, fuel cell, and storage tank). A key contribution is the inclusion of periodic sales constraints to represent vehicle-based transport of hydrogen. A case study of a rural town in Hokkaido, Japan, shows that allowing green hydrogen sales substantially reduces the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) relative to self-consumption-only designs. Sensitivity analyses indicate that viability is maintained even at low selling prices; notably, selling surplus hydrogen at a zero price remains beneficial because it reduces the required storage capacity. Moreover, cost-saving effects persist with infrequent sales (e.g., once every 2 weeks). These findings offer practical guidance for policymakers and communities seeking to improve the economics of energy-independent, carbon-neutral off-grid systems."

IoMT-enabled wearables and bedside sensors are used to gather multimodal physiological data, including blood pressure, temperature, oxygen saturation, heart rate, and ECG signals. The hybrid AI approach uses Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for temporal sequence prediction and machine learning methods for trend-based anomaly detection to find early indicators of patient decline. Reducing false alarms and increasing diagnostic accuracy, an adaptive alert mechanism constantly modifies threshold values according to clinical risk categories and patient-specific health profiles. Computational efficiency is increased through cloud-edge integration, which guarantees scalability and low-latency analytics across hospital networks. According to experimental data, the framework outperforms conventional EWS techniques in terms of accuracy, precision, and sensitivity. By improving clinical decision-making, speeding up reaction times, and fortifying the digital infrastructure of smart hospitals, this research helps create proactive, intelligent, and patient centred healthcare systems."

    "abstract": "The integration of renewable energy sources (RES) such as solar, wind, wave, and tidal power through microgrids is gaining interest globally, particularly for offshore applications. In these circumstances, DC microgrids are preferred over AC counterparts due to their suitability for islanded operation and their ability to simplify the integration of RES and energy storage systems (ESS). DC systems also mitigate common AC challenges such as frequency deviations, harmonic distortion, and voltage imbalance. Despite these advantages, DC microgrids face significant protection challenges, primarily due to the absence of natural zero-crossing, rapid fault current rise, and limited availability of standardized DC protection devices and schemes. To address the need for more responsive protection mechanisms that can accommodate varying RES, ESS, and load conditions, this paper proposes an adaptive overcurrent protection approach based on artificial intelligence (AI). The adaptive scheme employs an Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), trained on data from diverse operating scenarios including normal loading, fault events, and renewable intermittency. The model enables real-time adjustment of relay settings on the load side, ensuring accurate fault detection and improving system reliability. A DC microgrid protection model is developed in MATLAB/Simulink, in which current measurements obtained under different operating conditions are used for training and validation. The ANFIS-based method achieved 99.41% prediction accuracy over 1.35 million samples, and the Opal-RT real-time simulation confirmed its effectiveness with circuit breaker tripping times of 130 milliseconds for overcurrent faults and 20 milliseconds for short-circuit faults."

Experimentation with multi-regional open-source datasets shows that the proposed ensemble model offers significant improvement against other single model baselines.

To achieve high performance beam steering with setting limits of quantization and phase resolution we employ Improved Particle Swarm Optimization (IPSO) algorithm. The IPSO algorithm search dynamically within the solution space of optimal combinations of analog and digital beamforming weights to reduce beamforming error subject to IC-level constraints like phase-shifter granularity and discrete multi-level digital processing. The recommended structure will include a hybrid beamforming engine, which has quantized, phase control, reconfigurability baseband processing modules, and a lightweight optimization controller embedded in the digital signal path.

Finally, by controlling the power ration of the artificial noise and the wireless covert pulse waveform signal of the own party, the detection probability of the wireless covert pulse waveform signal by the third party receiver can be effectively reduced; by designing and optimising the parameters of the time-domain artificial noise and the random overlap of the wireless covert pulse waveform signal, the reconnaissance receiver can be perturbed to form the correct pulse descriptor word PDW, so as to achieve the effect of interfering with radar binning at the lowest cost-effectiveness ratio. Experimental results show that the proposed technique can effectively improve the anti-detection and anti-sorting capabilities of wireless covert pulse waveform signal."

    "abstract": "Delays in emergency vehicle (EV) movement within congested cities present a critical safety challenge. Current systems, which rely on single-mode visual or acoustic detection, are unreliable under poor visibility or high ambient noise. To address this, we propose a novel smart traffic solution that fuses visual and auditory data for robust, real-time EV recognition. The primary novelty of our work is the optimized integration of a YOLOv9 object detector with a CBAM-enhanced ResNet18 audio classifier, fused at the decision level. This architecture is specifically designed to suppress background clutter and acoustic interference, a significant challenge where prior intelligent transport systems have struggled. Our model achieved a mean Average Precision (mAP@0.5) of over 99% for visual detection and near-perfect scores (Precision: 0.994, Recall: 0.991, F1-Score: 0.992) for audio classification, operating at real-time speeds of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\sim 33$</tex> FPS. Comparative results demonstrate superior recall and precision over unimodal approaches. This system reduces emergency response delays by dynamically controlling traffic signals, thereby enhancing intersection safety and contributing to a smarter urban traffic network."

    "abstract": "Accurate prediction of the disease state and identification of candidate biomarkers from high-dimensional RNA sequence (RNA-seq) data is a major challenge in precision medicine. Conventional Machine Learning (ML) pipelines for transcriptomic analysis typically involve sequential steps of preprocessing, feature selection, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation. These pipelines often rely on either manual trial-and-error or exhaustive grid searches, which are time-consuming and may overlook the optimal configurations. In this study, we benchmarked a standard ML workflow against an agentic AI framework for RNA-seq based disease prediction and candidate biomarker identification. The ML baseline includes classifiers such as Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest optimized via conventional grid search. In contrast, agentic AI workflow employs Large Language Model (LLM) agents to autonomously orchestrate a cascade of downstream steps- preprocessing, class balancing, model selection, parameter optimization, and feature interpretation. Across multiple experimental setups, the agentic approach achieved a consistent 2–5% improvement in predictive accuracy, with notable gains in precision and recall even under class imbalance. A novel algorithm is proposed to identify candidate biomarkers by systematically ranking the top-contributing RNA features and then cross-referencing them with two public biomarker repositories. Our findings demonstrate that agentic AI not only improves model's prediction performance but also streamlines RNA-centric transcriptomic analysis, offering adaptability and actionable insights for RNA-based biomarker studies."

    "abstract": "Traditional multi-sensor fusion methods face challenges in perimeter intrusion detection under complex environmental conditions (rain, smog, nighttime), exhibiting high false alarm rates and limited robustness. This primarily stems from fixed weighting strategies that fail to dynamically assess sensor reliability. This study proposes an Attention-GRU multimodal fusion algorithm to enhance environmental adaptability and decision accuracy in transmission and transformation substation construction scenarios. The method integrates millimeter-wave radar and infrared thermal imaging through a collaborative perception architecture, employing parallel convolutional neural networks and gated recurrent unit modules to extract deep spatio-temporal dynamic features. The core innovation lies in introducing an attention mechanism to perform real-time reliability assessment and adaptive weighting of multimodal feature streams under varying environmental interference conditions. Experimental validation using a 110kV substation dataset demonstrates that the proposed algorithm achieves an F1 score of 98.2%, a false alarm rate of 1.3%, and a Mean Time Between False Alarms (MTBFA) of 76.8 hours, significantly outperforming Kalman fusion and single-sensor baselines. The proposed environment-aware attention-weighted temporal fusion paradigm provides an effective technical solution for high-reliability perimeter security."

A machine learning pipeline is created to classify four important PC molecular subtypes: Progenitor, ADEX, Squamous, and Immunogenic. The pipeline used high-throughput gene expression data from 150 matched samples. After reducing dimensions with L1 Regularization (LASSO), identification of molecular signature of 89 highly predictive genes has been conducted. Comparison of four different classification models: Random Forest (RF), XGBoost, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Logistic Regression (LR) is presented in the research.

Although it has enhanced connectedness and interpersonal communication, it has its disadvantages including sharing of fake information and the effects of the same on mental health. With the current influence of social media in our lives, it is important to thoughtfully weigh the benefits that it has brought to us against the potential harm that it can cause. This research undertaking attempts to examine the sentiment aroused by fake news shared in leading global social media sites like Twitter (X). A hard voting ensemble classifier was used, and it was able to classify tweets into phony and authentic with a remarkable 94.21% accuracy rate. Moreover, sentiment analysis with the same classifier resulted in an accuracy rate of 84.11%. The psychological implications of sharing misinformation with the general population were then examined using these models. The research also considers the significant correlation between fake news and emotions and depicts that misleading information is directly associated with negative mental health conditions. This establishes a strong relationship between the false news and attitudes. The results of the proposed approach were compared to the traditional machine learning algorithms. A larger multilingual dataset could justifiably be considered an improvement of the future study to test false tweets and real-time human emotions. As generative AI and large language models (LLMs) that can create highly realistic and misleading content, such as deepfakes; grow more popular, the issue of emotional reactions to false information has gained even greater significance."

    "abstract": "Accurate short-term electricity load forecasting is a critical computational task for optimizing power system dispatch and energy management algorithms. To address the inherent computational challenges posed by the nonlinearity, non-stationarity, and high-frequency noise in load time series, this paper proposes an integrated computational framework: the STL-WD-Informer model. The framework employs a multi-stage algorithmic pipeline: Firstly, Seasonal-Trend decomposition using Loess (STL) decomposes the raw load sequence into computationally distinct components, effectively decoupling multi-scale temporal features through non-parametric smoothing. Secondly, Wavelet Threshold Denoising is algorithmically applied to the residual component, utilizing discrete wavelet transforms and adaptive thresholding to suppress high-frequency noise interference. Finally, an enhanced Informer architecture is developed for sequence prediction. Significantly, the model integrates the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) within its encoder-decoder structure. CBAM leverages both channel and spatial attention to dynamically focus on salient spatio-temporal patterns, significantly enhancing the model's ability to capture complex, high-dimensional load dynamics. Experimental results on electricity load datasets demonstrate that the proposed method significantly reduces prediction error compared to baseline models and exhibits more stable forecasting performance, validating its efficacy as a robust computational solution."

It also demonstrates how green big data analytics can be used in smart cities, healthcare, agriculture, climate modelling, and disaster management to show how environmentally friendly strategies can maximize the use of resources and reduce ecological footprints. Other significant issues that have been explored in the paper include the tradeoff between performance and energy efficiency, data privacy and governance, cost verses environmental benefits, and the non-standardization of green measures. Possible future research directions are also discussed, such as green AI, edge and fog computing, blockchain integration, and policies of sustainability in terms of cultivating data ecosystems that are environmentally responsible.

This study aims at developing a machine learning model to predict which drug would be more suitable for each patient based on demographic features and clinical measurements. The dataset consisted of records of 14,500 patients, captured by 42 clinical variables and 8 common drug categories. The gradient-boosted decision tree model achieved an excellent agreement with actual prescribing, where it was able to successfully predict the clinically administered drug for 11,236 patients at the time of evaluation. The model produced interpretability scores as well, allowing for thresholds of determinants, including age, renal function values, patterns of comorbidity, and documented adverse reactions to be ranked in support of an understandable clinical rationale. Such results indicate that standardized clinical and demographic information can be translated into specific treatment recommendations and have the potential to minimize trial-and-error prescribing for difficult to treat patients."

The proposed method first employs VMD to decompose the original load sequences into intrinsic mode functions, thereby reducing non-stationarity. It then constructs a GRU-based forecasting model by integrating multi-energy load features to explore their coupling relationships. Furthermore, an online error evaluation and iterative training mechanism is introduced to enhance prediction stability. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly improves the forecasting accuracy for multi-energy loads."

Existing methods lack fine-grained semantic control over image-conditioning signals. Moreover, generating editing masks from cross-attention maps often leads to irrelevant regions in the masks. In this paper, we propose a training-free, dual-branch diffusion-control framework that improves object removal performance by decomposing the image-conditioning signals and optimizing the editing mask. Specifically, we introduce a semantics-aware IP-Adapter attention modulation strategy that leverages the decomposability of image-conditioning embeddings. This strategy dynamically rescales cross-attention maps throughout multi-scale denoising to attenuate target features and strengthen background consistency. In parallel, we design a noun-aware mask optimization mechanism that parses non-target nouns in the prompt to locate distractor regions and progressively suppresses their spurious responses, producing precise editing masks. Experiments show that the framework improves object-removal stability and controllability, and outperforms existing methods in mask purity, semantic alignment, and background integration."

To address the aforementioned issues, this paper proposes a power grid fault diagnosis method based on wavelet entropy weight and an improved hybrid kernel extreme learning machine. Firstly, this method performs multi-resolution analysis wavelet transform on fault currents based on wavelet basis functions. To better represent the characteristics of different short-circuit types, the sum of wavelet entropy weights of each phase current, the sum of wavelet entropy weight distribution distances, and the quantified zero-sequence current are obtained based on the wavelet entropy weight method, addressing the weak problem in fault feature extraction. Secondly, through adaptive optimization of the hybrid kernel function and key parameters of the hybrid kernel extreme learning machine using an optimization algorithm, a high-performance fault classifier is constructed. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified through fault simulation data validation and actual measured data from a power grid in Liaoning."

This paper presents an integrated Near Field Communication (NFC) – based food ordering ecosystem that fixes these constraints through three different innovations into a single unit: First, a dual-mode NFC communication framework enables quick order retrieval through Host Card Emulation for NFC-enabled smartphones and physical NFC cards for non-NFC devices, removing Camera Reliance Operations. Second, a health scoring engine powered by Deep Reinforcement Learning induces real-time nutrition recommendations and implements strategies to modify dietary behaviors through a dynamic credit point system by nutritional analysis. Third, an automated preplanned meal subscription module to include all types of nutrition dietary with flexibility to change the meal before the threshold time. The security protocol, based on Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman key exchange with pseudonym-based authentication, proves resistance against impersonation, replay, and man-in-the-middle attacks. Data driven investigation has been done using PN 532 NFC modules interfaced with ESP 32 microcontrollers results 39.6% reduction in transactional time compared to QR code systems. Live implementation in an institutional cafeteria serving 500 daily customers achieved 42% improvement in service time, 87.3% accuracy in identifying unbalanced diet patterns, 23% reduction in preorder meals wastage and 98.7% transaction success rate.

This system uses existing surveillance cameras and a custom-trained Roboflow object detection model (mAP@50 $=99.5 \\%$) to provide vehicle counts, allowing for lane priority reordering, rather than routine signal timing changes. A dedicated mobile app allows only the emergency vehicle’s to pre-declare its route, and the backend system looks for green-signal precedents when the emergency vehicle is within a 500 meters distance approach window.

With the ease of access to credit cards, the withdrawal of funds through credit cards has exponentially increased. This also paves the way to serious fraud, resulting in losses to users and financial institutions. Data imbalance causes a major challenge in the identification of fraud. To address this, a framework is proposed that utilizes multiple machine learning algorithms, such as Logistic Regression, Naïve Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, AdaBoost, and Gradient Boosting, along with the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) to balance the datasets. This enhances the capability of models to learn significant fraud patterns. Furthermore, the prediction can be interpreted with Explainable AI (XAI) algorithms like SHAP and LIME that provide insight into the most important elements and contribute to identifying fraudulent activity. Experimental assessment of a real-world Kaggle dataset shows that Gradient Boosting and Random Forest demonstrate the best performance. Together with data balancing through SMOTE and interpretability through XAI, the proposed system is effective and usable in real-life finance fraud prevention."

    "abstract": "This accurate forecasting is essential for public safety, agriculture, transportation. Traditional weather forecasting methods mostly depend on physical simulations and mathematical models. These methods need considerable computing power and can sometimes give less accurate results, mainly for short-term or very local predictions. In recent years, machine learning has brought a new approach to forecasting. It uses methods that can learn and understand complex weather patterns. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model is used for visual weather classification. Basically, model studies about weather images to predict five conditions: fog, smog, lightning, rain and sandstorms. For this a data set of more than 3000 images was prepared. The images were processed using steps like changing, converting to grayscale, normalization and edge detection. In the construction of the CN model many convolutional and max-pooling were developed. For efficient model training data set was divided into 80% for training and 20% for validation to train the model effectively. The model achieved a validation accuracy of over 85%, with strong performance in distinguishing visually distinctive conditions like lightning and sandstorms. Early stopping was employed to prevent excessive fitting. The model demonstrates the ability to extract spatial features from weather images effectively, enabling real-time predictions with reduced computational costs. This approach offers a promising alternative to conventional techniques. This system can classify real-time weather using live images feeds and has been integrated into a stream-lit based web application that allows the user to interact and for practical use. The project works in identifying clear weather patterns. It follows a common method of forecasting and also can be used in smart weather monitoring systems. In future, it can also be improved by adding satellite images and sensor data."

    "abstract": "The paper reports the performance analysis of an inter-satellite optical wireless communication (IsOWC) system using 16-phase shift keying (16-PSK) modulation with 112 Gbps capacity. It examines the effect of the distance of transmission, efficiency of the transmitter and receiver, laser power, and pointing accuracy on the system's performance. To evaluate the system's performance, we focus on crucial metrics including bit error rate (BER), error vector magnitude (EVM), received optical power (ROP), and constellation diagrams. The problem of signal degradation, and consequently the decrease of the accuracy of the received data, is compensated on the receiver side by employing complex signal processing techniques such as signal adaptive equalization, frequency offset estimation, and carrier phase estimation on coherent optical communication. The system can transmit 16-PSK signals within the range of 10000 km under the conditions that 90 % of the optics efficiency is maintained and 30 dBm is the laser power, with permissive error levels, and EVM lower than 10 %."

    "abstract": "Activity recognition of the students in both offline online classes has become important constraint in the educational industries to enhance learning outcomes and its student wellbeing on basis of their behavior to facilitate timely interventions to enhance learning experiences and outcomes. In recent years, huge advancements in technologies such as artificial intelligence, cloud computing and internet of things many computer vision approaches has been employed to perform aforementioned task. Despite of several advantages of those advantages approaches, still many challenges exhibited in terms of the generalization and outlier detection. To mitigate those challenges, an innovative deep learning architecture along metaheursitic technique has been designed to accurately recognize the activity of the students through real time data in form of the video on wide range of academic and non-academic activities. In this paper, a Grassman Optimized Convolution Neural Network is designed and implemented for facial emotion recognition at various key focal points along integrating the contextual information of the student. Initially acquired video is transformed into individual frames to specified time intervals. Each frame is processed using convolution layer of the convolution neural network to extract student emotion using kernel function and activation function as facial features of the image. Those extracted facial features are processed in the pooling layer using grassman metaheursitic technique represented as grassman technique. Here, the Grassmann optimization improves the CNN by representing the extracted facial features as subspaces on a Grassmann manifold rather than as individual Euclidean vectors. This preserves the geometric relationships between emotional patterns and enables more robust and generalized feature selection, making the model more resistant to noise, variations, and outliers compared to conventional pooling methods. It is used as attention mechanism to the pooling layer to extract high level facial feature of the each frame and it is modeled as feature map on representation of happiness, sadness, anger, and surprise. Obtained feature map is processed finally in the fully connected layer of the network through activation function, normalization function and softmax function to classify feature map of the emotion as student activity classes as engaged, attentive, confused, or disinterested. On specified emotion state of the student, various insight of the students can be provides to provide personalized educational support and the development of intelligent learning systems. Experimental analysis of the proposed model towards student activity recognition and classification has been performed using training data DIPSER dataset in the python environment. On performance analysis of the model using test data through confusion matrix, its provides parameter to the performance metric such as precision, recall and f measure. It is proved that model accuracy of the proposed model is found to be outperforming compared to conventional approaches."

    "abstract": "The ever-increasing threat of the climate crisis poses significant risks to countries worldwide, particularly to Small Island Developing States (SIDS) such as Barbados. SIDS are especially vulnerable due to their small size and relative isolation. As a result, green and reliable energy systems that harness renewable energy sources are crucial for sustainable development and energy security. The Barbados National Energy Policy aims for the island to achieve 100% renewable energy generation and carbon neutrality by 2030. In this study, a three-point energy transition scenario is defined, with the corresponding optimal hybrid renewable energy system determined for each transition point using the multi-objective design optimisation software tool MOHRES. The optimisation problem formulation considers system cost, reliability, and net emissions. The transition scenario accounts for the planned phase-out of existing fossil-fuel power plants, aiming to reduce current emissions by 50%, 65% and 99% by 2025, 2027 and 2030 respectively. This reduction is achieved through the integration of renewable energy, battery/hydrogen storage systems, and green hydrogen production to offset emissions. Optimal solutions with minimal investment costs were found, satisfying constraints on system reliability and net emissions. The results show that as renewable energy is integrated during the transition, grid carbon content decreases from 456 g/MWh in 2024 to 7 g/MWh in 2030, with 171% renewable penetration. This leads to annual fuel savings of approximately $200 million and net green hydrogen production of around 860 tons per year."

    "abstract": "The traditional way of assessing research, which heavily relies on citation data, offers a strong but delayed and limited view of how scholarly work affects society. This method is unable to capture the immediate relevance of research or clearly explain the patterns it observes. Although altmetrics, which come from social media, news sites, policy documents, and other online sources, offer real-time views of public and professional interest, they are often studied separately, creating the sense of being fragmented. The main challenge is integrating these current and historical measures into a single, clear model that can represent the complex and varied nature of research impact. This paper introduces a new framework that addresses this problem by combining spectral graph theory with explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). Our aim is to create a reliable and understandable way to group research papers based on their scholarly background and public engagement. Our method follows a structured process. First, we build a large citation net- work using data from sources like OpenCitations and Microsoft Academic Graph, with each paper as a node and citations as directional links. Each node is then enriched with altmetric data, such as Twitter mentions, Mendeley saves, and news citations, from providers like Altmetric.com, transforming the network into a detailed and informative graph. The main analysis uses spectral clustering on this graph. By computing the normalized graph Laplacian and performing eigen-decomposition, we convert the nodes into a lower- dimensional space that reflects the graph's structure. Applying clustering methods like k-means to this space reveals hidden thematic communities that are influenced not only by internal citation patterns but also by altmetric signals of public attention. This helps identify research groups that may be both intellectually consistent and socially significant. A major innovation of our system is incorporating XAI methods after clustering to reveal the findings. We use techniques like SHAP and LIME, which are suitable for any model, to determine the importance of different features. This gives both overall and detailed explanations, answering questions such as: Which factors-like specific citations, high news coverage, or policy mentions-were most important in shaping a cluster? Why was a paper associated with one cluster and not another? This transforms the model from a “black box” to a “glass box,” offering unprecedented transparency. The outcome of this system includes a multi-faceted analysis of research influence, specifically: 1. Thematic clusters of articles grouped by both structural and societal similarities. 2. An interpretability report that outlines the key attributes driving each cluster and highlights important papers. 3. Interactive visualizations of the clustered citation network using tools like NetworkX and Gephi. 4. Impact profiles for notable papers, detailing their significance through both citations and altmetrics. This system offers valuable insights to stakeholders such as funding bodies, research institutions, and policymakers, providing a clear and transparent means to understand the scientific landscape, identify emerging fields, and assess impact in a multi- dimensional way. By effectively combining the structural strength of spectral graph theory with the societal reach of altmetrics and the transparency of XAI, this study establishes a new standard for explainable scientometric analysis."

The clothes are self-sufficient because they incorporate energy-gathering technologies such as solar, thermoelectric and kinetic in order to integrate into the fabric. They also control the power consumption to make the battery have a longer life. With this new technology, there is less need to utilize old forms of power sources, and this minimizes its effects on the environment by a large margin. The user-centred design ensures that the daily use is convenient and helpful. This research paper discusses the uses of smart clothing that is energy efficient in areas like health, fitness, environmental and communication. Energy efficiency and wearables can transform most industries positively and form a more sustainable and integrated connection between technology and society. The accessibility of the energy-efficient system in the form of the sophisticated power management methods and energy harvesting technologies allows making smart clothing with realistic ideas.

Existing approaches using federated learning, differential privacy, and explainable AI address parts of these issues but face challenges such as accuracy degradation, communication overhead, inconsistent explanations, and limited real-world validation. The proposed FedAvg-CNN-DPXAI framework uniquely integrates decentralized CNN training, differential privacy, and dual explainability (GradCAM and SHAP) to ensure secure, interpretable diagnostics without raw data sharing. Histopathologic Cancer Detection dataset images are preprocessed, locally trained at client sites, and aggregated via FedAvg, with model compression reducing communication costs. The framework achieves 98.2 % accuracy, 98.6 % precision, 97.5 % recall, and 97.1 % F1-score, outperforming existing models. Deployment through Docker ensures scalability and integration with hospital systems while maintaining compliance. The approach enhances diagnostic trust, preserves privacy, and supports continuous federated updates for adaptive, regulation-aligned clinical decisionmaking."

    "abstract": "The development of Internet of vehicle (IoV) enables vehicles to share road condition data, while the honesty and anonymity of vehicles have become the core issues. The effective solutions to these two issues involving reputation and pseudonym management engender a dilemma. On the one hand, the reputation values bound to pseudonyms may cause pseudonym to be re-linked. On the other hand, the use of pseudonyms may make reputation evaluation schemes less effective. What is more, existing solutions have a single point of failure problem in pseudonym generation and lose a lot of reputation value. To this end, we propose a blockchain-based transparent and decentralized management of reputation and pseudonym (referred to as TDMRP), which can reduce the reputation loss caused by the conventional cloak mechanism and protect privacy of identity. Specifically, for the reputation management, a reputation evaluation scheme is designed with no need of additional characteristic values, which can maintain the unlinkability of pseudonym. To reduce the reputation loss, we propose a dynamic cloak algorithm, which is proved to achieve the theoretically minimal reputation loss. For the pseudonym management, we present an innovative shuffling architecture called fusion shuffling incorporating the strengths of traditional shuffling, Shamir secret sharing, and verifiable random functions (VRF), which not only enhances computational speed, security, and memory efficiency, but also addresses the single point of failure inherent in traditional shuffling architectures. Through extensive experiments compared with the state-of-the-art work, we have demonstrated that the reputation evaluation scheme is relatively stable under various malicious environments, and the proposed cloak mechanism reduces reputation loss of 37.06% averagely, and the proposed shuffling is 53.76% averagely faster."

However, most existing approaches adopt a single lookup range strategy, which encounters difficulties when handling ill-posed regions, particularly in occluded areas where matching cues are insufficient. In this paper, a Multi-range Lookup for Stereo Matching (ML-Stereo) is proposed, an iteratively optimized architecture incorporating a multi-range lookup mechanism. It employs lookup operators with varying lookup radii at different stages of the iteration process, thereby enhancing both the efficiency of the iterative refinement and the accuracy of disparity estimation. Furthermore, a Multi-scale Attention ConvGRU (MAC-GRU) is designed to adaptively exploit informative features beneficial for stereo matching, thereby further improving efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms existing methods in disparity estimation for ill-posed regions such as occlusions, while exhibiting strong generalization capability in real-world scenarios."

    "abstract": "The fast-paced digitalization of the healthcare sector (Electronic Health Records (EHRs), Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) devices, medical imaging, and telemedicine) has enabled more efficient patient care but has also increased the attack surface of sophisticated threats. These security concerns are emerging in consumer electronics within smart healthcare ecosystems, which rely on image-based analytics and edge-enabled intelligence. In this study, we propose an edge-enabled cybersecurity framework that integrates deep ensemble learning and edge analytics to preemptively identify image-based malware in healthcare networks and provide low-latency inference at the data source. We introduce VGDense-DeepEnsemble (VGGDenseNet-DeepEnsemble), a novel stacked deep learning model that combines VGG16, VGG19, DenseNet121, and DenseNet169 through ensemble learning with a meta-model to enhance detection performance. Explainable AI (XAI) using Grad-CAM was applied to sample images to interpret the decision-making process. We evaluated the proposed model on the Blended Malware Image Dataset, which comprises 31 malware families with a separate test dataset for final assessment. The proposed model attains 96% overall accuracy with macro precision of 97%, macro recall of 96%, and macro F1 score of 96%. These results exceed the performance of the individual backbones (VGG16: 88%, VGG19: 94%, DenseNet121: 93%, DenseNet169: 94%). As revealed through the ROC and precision-recall analysis, separability and robustness are high across all the classes, and confusion matrices reveal significant decreases in misclassifications in challenging families (e.g., Neshta, Sality, Agent, Injector). Grad-CAM explanations indicate that the predictions are informed by discriminative, malware-relevant structures and not background artifacts. These findings show that transparent edge-based deep ensemble models can be an effective, accurate, explainable defense against image-based malware in healthcare networks."

    "abstract": "Stance detection is the measure of detecting the point of view about a target. The task has become significant due to an increase in the application of social media discourse and the dissemination of fake information. This paper suggests a hybrid deep learning model, which combines a pre-trained T5 transformer encoder, a BiLSTM and an attention mechanism. The framework is able to encompass contextual semantics and sequential dependencies in textual data. The T5 model can give rich contextualised embeddings encoding subtle patterns in language, and the BiLSTM gives bidirectional dependencies needed to interpret the underlying stance. An attention layer is incorporated to dynamically weigh the most informative tokens, enabling the model to concentrate on the part that is essential for stance detection. This architecture is designed to be target-aware, robust to linguistic noise, and suitable for both high and low-resource datasets. We assess our framework on benchmark datasets, including P-STANCE, SRQ, SemEval2016, and AMUSED, achieving competitive performance and demonstrating its effectiveness in various social media and political discourse settings. The results indicate that combining pretrained language models with sequence-aware attention-based architectures represents a promising direction for advancing stance detection, particularly in noisy and informal text environments such as Roman Urdu."

    "abstract": "As organisations continue to depend more on SAP systems to host its mission-critical enterprise processes, disaster recovery procedures are emerging as an essential element, especially adopted in cloud environments including Microsoft Azure. Conventional disaster recovery strategies might not take into consideration the technical complexity of incorporating SAP disaster resiliency with the cloud-native disaster resiliency offered by Azure, therefore, posing a risk to multi-sector applications in which the impacts of downtime can be catastrophic economically, regulatory, and societal. The research is aimed at developing a complete disaster recover framework of SAP systems on the Microsoft Azure, assuming a multi-industry analysis of healthcare, finance, manufacturing and government sectors. The framework is achieved by synthesizing research on systematic literature review and sector-based survey findings with the community of practices associated with system replication, and compliance models driven by governance. The analysis explains how requirements specific to the sector (Recovery Time Objectives or RTO, Recovery Point Objectives or RPO, requirement to be compliant with regulations), influence the protection strategy of disaster recovery. Additionally, the paper also assesses case deployments in order to identify the comparative effectiveness of on-premises, cloud based and hybrid disaster recovery solutions. The proposed framework is a theoretical and practical contribution as the result that can arrange the enterprise continuity goals in the correspondence with the resilience capabilities of Azure taking into consideration the sector-specific governance limitations into consideration."

    "abstract": "A great imperative to develop healthcare monitoring systems that are real-time, accurate and lowlatency has emerged since the COVID-19 pandemic. Traditional cloud-based solutions and machine learning methods face problems of latency, poor flexibility and inferior feature representation which hinder significantly their utilization in IoT- and IoMT-powered healthcare systems. To solve these problems, a Perfumer Optimization- Attentionbased Dynamic Multilayer Graph Neural Network (POADMGNN) for COVID-19 risk prediction over fog-assisted healthcare systems has been presented in this research. The platform provides secure citizen registration, ongoing data collection from wearables and the environment through IoT sensors, and effective preprocessing at the fog layer, in which the Superb Fairy-Wren Optimization Algorithm makes choice of the most important features. The features are then differentiated via ADMGNN which is designed based on multilayer graph, temporal dynamics and attention mechanism to capture complicated health issues. In addition, the Perfumer Optimization Algorithm adjusts hyperparameters to improve model performance, which includes real-time decision support and alert modules for instant notification, personalized guidance and facility navigation as well as synchronized storage which translates to quick local data access, and secure cloud-based epidemic surveillance. Experiment results prove that PO-ADMGNN achieves better performance with almost 98% classification precision, an F measure of 0.978 for the negative class, a $7.6 \\times$ response time reduction (380 ms in the cloud vs. 50 ms in the fog), and a 54% latency reduction with an optimum peak accuracy of 0.9777. These results validate that PO-ADMGNN provides accurate, adaptive, and efficient healthcare monitoring with effective COVID-19 control."

    "abstract": "Recent volatility and data heterogeneity have renewed interest in hybrid deep-learning (DL) pipelines for stock forecasting. Unlike prior surveys that treat data preparation, modelling, and deployment in isolation, this work reviews the end-to-end architecture shown in the accompanying figure. The pipeline begins with real-time ingestion of market and alternative data streams via Kafka/Pulsar, funneling into a cloud time-series lake for loss-less archival and replay. A feature layer then merges technical indicators, macroeconomic parsers, and BERT -based sentiment embeddings inside a unified online/offline feature store. Within the modelling core, classical ARIMA / GARCH blocks are stacked with CNN patch encoders, temporal transformers, and graph neural networks, capturing local dynamics, long horizons, and inter-asset relations. An attention-based residual fusion module blends these heterogeneous encoders, while an XGBoost meta-learner arbitrates the final forecast, enhancing robustness to regime shifts. Forecasts feed an actor-critic reinforcement-learning policy that translates signals into order-routing decisions, closing the loop between prediction and execution. A rigorous back-tester computes Sharpe, max drawdown, and VaR under walk-forward splits, supplying a consistent yard-stick for the 25 state-of-the-art hybrids examined. Experiment tracking, CI/CD model registries, and ADWIN-based drift monitors anchor reproducibility and continuous delivery-capabilities rarely detailed in earlier reviews. The survey distils best practices at each stage and highlights open challenges for scalable, risk-sensitive deployment of hybrid DL forecasters across global markets."

Research on these topics is still fragmented across different data sets, tasks, and devices. Results for latency, energy, and longitudinal usability are also limited, with diverse measurement criteria. A complete end-to-end synthesis of the pipeline-capture, enhancement, layout analysis, recognition, semantics, and feedback, optimized for access, safety, and deployment -is systematically examined in this review. The study outlines open questions regarding multilingual scripts, curved or reflective text, and cluttered scenes. Functionalities are related to actual needs such as hands-free operation, offline service, ambiguity handling, and privacy protection. To enable fair comparison and reproducibility, evaluation practices are considered. Task-level metrics (time to first utterance, task success) and model-level metrics (precision-recall, character and word error rates) have been proposed. Clear guidelines for reporting datasets, protocols, error taxonomies, and user studies have also been provided. The review also links algorithmic efficiency techniques achieving low-latency, on-device operation to hardware constraints, e.g., NPUs, DSPs, thermal envelopes, and battery constraints. To understand the key issues and identify priority needs, this study presents shared definitions, minimum expectations, and practical checklists for researchers, clinicians, and developers by synthesising evidence across phones, wearables, and dedicated devices. The result is a framework and roadmap for sustainable and scalable reading support that describes what works, for whom, when, and why, with measurable benefits for real-world settings across countries."

    "abstract": "The growth of artificial intelligence technology has made it easy to produce very realistic synthetic media, which have posed great problems in the authentication of the authenticity of digital contents. Deepfake media, produced in the advanced form of generative algorithms, allows to play with the features of faces, voice, and appearances with the level of realism never seen before, which is causing alarm over the privacy invasion, breach of security, and the loss of trust in the population. This paper presents a detailed deep learning system that detects manipulated visual images in video and image formats using the pool of convolutional and recurrent neural networks. The detection system makes use of transfer learning methodology, with the use of InceptionV3 and Xception models to examine static images, and a ResNet50-LM hybrid structure to examine video images to acquire spatial features and temporal variations. The performance analysis of the Deepfake and the Real Images data set showed that Xception, InceptionV3, and the ResNet50-LSTM combination achieved a classification accuracy of 93.24, 92.19, and 91.5 respectively. These results highlight the relevance of the suggested architectures in distinguishing genuine content and counterfeit media. The study makes a contribution to the multimedia forensics field, as it offers a complex detection mechanism that can be used in social media content control, digital authentication, and cybersecurity software."

    "abstract": "In modern storage systems, I/O interference under mixed read–write workloads poses a critical performance bottleneck. Zoned Namespace (ZNS) SSDs, constrained by sequential write requirements, deliver significantly lower write through-put than read throughput. Additionally, concurrent writes can severely interfere with read processing, leading to notable degradation in read performance. To address this challenge, we propose ZNS-RPS, a read-priority scheduling framework tailored for ZNS SSDs. The design strictly enforces sequential write ordering while separating reads and writes into dedicated queues, with higher priority assigned to reads to mitigate I/O interference in mixed workloads. Furthermore, ZNS-RPS integrates a queue-length-based adaptive scheduling mechanism (QLB-ASM), which dynamically adjusts read–write priorities based on write queue occupancy, thereby reducing read latency while preventing write starvation. Experimental results on the FEMU emulator show that ZNS-RPS achieves up to an 8× increase in read bandwidth and a 34% reduction in tail latency compared with conventional scheduling, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing read performance and overall Quality of Service under mixed workloads."

This study conducts a comparative evaluation of various text classification methods for automated bug report triage in an industrial context, integrating large language models into the classification pipeline. FastText serves as the baseline when compared with large language enhanced models across accuracy metric.

To attain fixed-time (FxT) convergence, an event-driven control approach is created, which guarantees that all agents in each subgroup synchronise their states while preserving the required phase relationships between groups. Both intra-group coordination and inter-group phase coupling are captured by the complex-weighted interaction topology integrated into the suggested framework. The control protocol ensures fixed-time stability under non-linear agent dynamics and bounded external disturbances by building a distributed sliding manifold and an event-triggered (ET) updating rule. The multi-group consensus error’s FxT convergence is established using rigorous Lyapunov analysis. The suggested method considerably lowers communication load while maintaining robustness and convergence precision, according to theoretical results. The effectiveness and superiority of the developed event-driven FxT control scheme are illustrated through numerical simulations."

Similar challenges exist in Bangladesh, Indonesia, Kenya, and Ethiopia, where contamination and inadequate distribution systems worsen health and sanitation conditions. To address this, a Low-Cost Dispenser-Type Water Filtration System (LCDTWFS) was developed to provide clean water without electricity. The 10liter system, primarily made of natural clay, was tested over six weeks, and the filtered water met national and international quality standards, confirming its portability and safety. The LCDTWFS is affordable, eco-friendly, and locally manufacturable by rural artisans, supporting both community health and livelihoods. Integrating data science enables performance optimization, predictive maintenance, and real-time monitoring, enhancing efficiency and reliability.

First, the transient characteristics of wind turbine-to-bus and turbine-to-turbine collection lines under different fault types are analyzed. The monotonic variation patterns of positive and negative pole currents in the early fault stage are revealed. Then, based on the differences in current variation trends at the bus-side of each turbine group, CDA is used to characterize fault features, enabling fast fault section and line identification. Finally, simulation results show that the proposed protection scheme can accurately identify fault locations and types using a 1ms data window, demonstrating fast response and strong anti-interference capability. It is suitable for fully DC collection networks with multiple or weak boundary conditions, providing an effective technical support for building a highly reliable protection system for offshore wind power."

    "abstract": "The major challenge that recommender systems are continually struggling with, is striking a balance between predictive and interpretable in sequential, context-sensitive situations. To solve this trade-off, this research suggests a hybrid model which uses a combination of Matrix Factorization (MF) and Neural Networks (NN). The model takes advantage of MF in capturing latent interactions between users and items and NN in capturing non-linear and contextual dependencies fused together through a mathematically defined feature integration pipeline. A Kaggle dataset of about 100,000 user-item interactions with numerical and categorical attributes is used in experiments with the help of Google Colab with Google-TPU acceleration. The hybrid model is assessed on criteria such as accuracy, F1-score, MAE and RMSE with an accuracy of 94.5, F1-score of 0.945, MAE of 0.087 and RMSE of 0.112, which are better than baseline models of MF and NN. The findings prove that the suggested hybrid architecture does not only increase the predictive performance but also offers explainable explanation to the recommendation decisions. The framework presents meaningful implication on the implementation of interpretable and high-performance recommender systems in actual practices to make more informed and context-aware decisions."

We evaluate their efficacy in three core areas: generating high-quality synthetic medical images (X-rays/CT) for data augmentation, creating molecular structures for accelerated drug discovery, and improving epidemiological prediction models. Furthermore, we explore optimization techniques like WGAN-GP used to stabilize training and enhance data fidelity. The paper concludes by detailing the strengths, limitations, and future research directions for GAN-based methodologies in infectious disease preparedness. Systematic Review: Analyze and compare the implementation and performance of major GAN variants (cGAN, CycleGAN, StyleGAN) across diverse healthcare applications. Problem-Solution Mapping: Detail how GANs directly solve critical data challenges, including scarcity, imbalance, and privacy in clinical and epidemiological datasets. Performance Benchmark: Review and synthesize reported performance metrics (e.g., FID, PSNR, diagnostic accuracy) to establish a benchmark for GAN-based COVID-19 solutions."

    "abstract": "The integrity of temperature-sensitive goods during transportation remains a critical challenge in modern cold-chain management. Variations in temperature and humidity can compromise product quality, particularly in pharmaceuticals, vaccines, and perishable goods. This paper presents a secure and transparent cold chain monitoring system that integrates Internet of Things (IoT) and blockchain technologies. The proposed system employs a master–slave network architecture, where Arduino-based slave nodes collect environmental data and a Raspberry Pi-based master node aggregates and transmits it to the blockchain server via GSM communication. Hyperledger Fabric is used to ensure secure, immutable, and auditable record keeping, while a web-based interface allows warehouses and logistics providers to initiate, monitor, and approve shipments collaboratively. Implementation results indicate enhanced reliability and transparency in monitoring cold chain shipping conditions. Data sampling occurs every 5 seconds at the slave nodes, with an average data rate of 21 bps between master and slave. Experimental results show a blockchain upload latency of 2.394 seconds for a 1000-byte payload, approximately 50 times faster than Filecoin, supporting high-frequency, synchronous data updates, significantly reducing the risk of data congestion. This solution addresses the need for reliable and transparent documentation of environmental conditions during transport in the industry."

However, the implementation of a MG in purposeful islanding comes with its requirements and may give rise to additional concerns that must be addressed. This study employs N-2 contingency analysis to identify the vulnerable lines to be severed for partitioning and to determine the most effective approach for isolating the power system. To mitigate the challenges of islanding and post-islanded difficulties, a battery energy storage system (BESS) is utilized. The IEEE 43 bus distribution network serves as a test system. The results indicate that N-2 analysis not only provides insight into the lines that should be severed for islanding but also identifies potential buses for BESS installation."

    "abstract": "In flood-prone areas of India, traditional disaster management approaches that rely on human surveys, satellite images, and ground assessments to provide decision makers with basic real-time information frequently lag and need a lot of resources. Delays in evaluating the damage, identifying survivors, and allocating resources lead to an increase in the death toll and a decline in effectiveness. To address these issues, suggest a drone-based artificial intelligence (AI) system that combines AI-powered computer vision with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for quick flood assessment, survivor location, and resource allocation optimization. For instance, the proposed system reduces the amount of obtaining data to 5 minutes, damage assessment to 10 minutes, survivor recognition to 8 minutes, and resource allocation to 6 minutes, allowing for extensive analysis. By managing resources for disaster response, which will ultimately help save lives and resources, and by analyzing images of the disaster with greater accuracy (95% for damage assessment, 92% for survivor recognition), the proposed system speeds up, improves, and reduces the cost of decision-making."

    "abstract": "Image dehazing is a critical task for enhancing the robustness and perceptual quality of vision systems, particularly in applications such as intelligent maritime navigation and autonomous driving. Existing single-image dehazing methods often struggle to achieve a satisfactory balance between global context modeling and local detail restoration. CNN-based approaches are inherently limited by their local receptive fields, whereas pure Transformer models are computationally expensive and insufficiently sensitive to fine-grained features. To address these challenges, we propose TransStar, a novel network architecture that integrates global-local information modeling with a multi-input degradation-aware mechanism. At the heart of TransStar is the TransXBlock, which adaptively models global context and local details in parallel, enabling a balanced representation of global semantics and local textures. Furthermore, the use of multi-scale downsampled degraded images as auxiliary inputs allows the model to better handle non-uniform haze and varying degrees of blur. In addition, the Star operation is employed to perform high-dimensional nonlinear feature mapping, enhancing the model's ability to capture richer detail information with minimal computational overhead. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world hazy images demonstrate that TransStar consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative metrics and visual quality."

Any of the proposed architectures combine the hierarchical capabilities of feature extractions of the VGG19 and the residual learning process of ResNet50 to deliver a more discriminative and generalized description of tumor features. Further, to boost the clinical reliability of the classifier, apply medicine techniques, mitigate the problem of class imbalances by implementing focal loss and the methods of artificial analyzing based on synthetic data augmentation by the SMOTE and GAN methods. Wide-ranging testing on benchmark medical imaging datasets attests to massive boosts in both accuracy of classification, a sensitivity, and an F1-score, especially in classes of minorities of tumors. The findings indicate that the hybrid VGG19-ResNet50 architecture and novel fusion and imbalance-aware learning have the potential to provide the robust and clinically feasible method of tumor classification in real-life diagnostic conditions."

    "abstract": "Indonesia's seismic monitoring stations mostly depend on stand-alone photovoltaic (SAPV) systems for power sources, as they are situated in rural locations and far from the grid. However, the reliability of these stations is often compromised due to power interruptions caused by the degradation of solar panels and batteries. This research proposes the development of a predictive maintenance system using machine learning models to forecast the remaining useful life (RUL) of solar panels and the State of Health (SoH) of batteries. MATLAB/Simulink created synthetic datasets simulating PV degradation at a rate of 1.6% annually and battery discharge behavior over a range of SoH values. Three machine learning algorithms, namely, Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM, were trained and assessed. With R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> values of 0.9612 for PV RUL and 0.9662 for battery SoH, Random Forest consistently exceeded the other algorithms. The study shows that, given simulated data, machine learning models can efficiently learn degradation patterns, therefore providing a workable alternative in situations when actual operating data is limited. Combining simulation-based data with data-driven modeling presents an alternative way to improve system reliability and enable proactive maintenance plans in distant infrastructure applications."

Nevertheless, commercial AGV systems are too expensive and not very flexible, even when considering small and middle-sized enterprises. This research paper designs a cost-effective, mini miniaturized AGV with artificial intelligence (AI)-based multicolor line tracking and real-time slot detection to fill the affordability-performance gap. The robot uses an ESP32 microcontroller, L298N motor driver, ultrasonic and IR sensors and OV7670 vision modules installed on a lightweight 3D-printed chassis. The bottom point camera reads the multicolored routes with the OpenCV program using the HSV segmentation, which makes it applicable to adjust to various industrial paths. The optimal values of slot occupancy are computed as the prediction output of a lightweight model YOLOv5 processed through TensorRT, providing the average success detection of 94.9% and F1-scores of 95.0. Line tracking precision was 1.49 cm-average deviation across paths of many colors, and obstacle avoidance was 100% hit-rate at less than 2.3% distance estimation error. Inference speed with quantized weights was decreased to the ~75ms range, allowing FPS of 13+ on Raspberry Pi hardware. Power tests run time of more than 2.4 hours under full load. The proposed AGV architecture shows high accuracy, speed of inference, and adaptability in different environments at a low cost design footprint. This allows providing a simple, scalable approach to decentralized automation, typically in small factories, educational labs and warehouses. Future research will focus on collaboration between swarms of vehicles, dynamic path-re-routing, and integration with IIoT -based fleet orchestration and predictive maintenance analytics."

Recognizing the limitations of traditional cost estimation methods that often overlook indirect costs such as land acquisition, the model integrates both engineering building parameters and locational attributes using actual project data from 2016 to 2025. Categorical inputs include district location and type of finishes, while numerical variables encompass building dimensions, soil bearing capacity, and distances to essential amenities. The ANN model was built and trained using Python, employing Min-Max Normalization, a hyperbolic tangent activation function, and RMSPROP optimizer. Model performance was evaluated using MAE and MSE metrics and applied for forecasting to support early-stage planning and risk mitigation. The model addresses the persistent challenge of underestimations in project feasibility by offering a more comprehensive and localized approach to cost prediction. Though effective, the model does not account for sudden economic shifts or policy changes, which may influence future construction costs. This research offers significant value to stakeholders, including developers, engineers, government agencies, and researchers, by enhancing cost accuracy, transparency, and planning reliability in the residential construction sector of Quezon City."

Accurate verification is essential since the signature of each person is unique, and this can help stop fraud. Nonetheless, the loss of human verification is usually susceptible to mistakes and irregularity. A hybrid solution to the offline signature verification through Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) that integrates with Autoencoder-based data augmentation to enhance the detection of fake signatures is presented in this paper. A Writer-Dependent model is applied in which random distortions are produced on authentic signatures with the help of an autoencoder to produce counterfeit signatures. The CNN classifier is then trained using them. The paper describes the pre-processing procedures applied to the signature images, and gives experimental results under different conditions of varying the number of training samples. In the Persian signature dataset, the model was trained on 22 genuine images per user and its average test accuracy was 83%. At the lower reduction in the number of real training samples (9), accuracy was decreased by 9.4 percent, which indicates that the amount of training data does affect verification performance."

In individuals with motor speech disorder, precise assessment of misarticulation is critical for early diagnosis and effective intervention. Traditional evaluation methods depend heavily on subjective auditoryperceptual judgement, which lacks consistency and scalability. In this paper, a data-driven approach to identify and classify the most influential acoustic features for the quantification of misarticulation using the UASpeech Dysarthric Speech Database is discussed. A complete set of audio features including Mel-frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs), spectral and prosodic features was extracted from the speech samples. Machine learning models such as LightGBM, KNearest Neighbor (KNN), Decision Tree (DT) and Random Forest Classifier (RF) were employed to predict misarticulation severity with the help of classification metrics such as Precision, Recall, F1-Score and Unweighted Average Recall (UAR). SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanation) values were used for model interpretation and feature ranking, enabling transparent identification of the most influential features. Experimental results reveal the MFCC-13 among the top ranked features contributing significantly to the quantification of misarticulation. The proposed framework enhances the objectivity of speech disorder assessment and provides interpretable insights into the acoustic correlates of misarticulated speech, supporting the development of clinical tools for automatic evaluation of speech disorder."

Such attacks have become a major threat cloud computing, where scalability and resource sharing expose services to large-scale disruptions. DDoS incidents can severely degrade performance, limit availability, and cause significant economic and operational losses for cloud providers and users. Traditional defense mechanisms, including filtering and anomaly-based detection, struggle to address the dynamic and high-volume nature of cloud traffic, often resulting in delayed detection or high false positive rates. To address these challenges, this work proposes an architecture and tool for DDoS protection in cloud environments. The system simulates botnet-driven traffic to create realistic attack scenarios and employs machine learning models to detect anomalies and mitigate attacks in real time. The proposed framework integrates traffic monitoring, classification, and automated response modules, ensuring improved resilience and reduced downtime during large-scale attacks. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that the approach can detect high-volume DDoS activity with improved accuracy and minimal false positives.

The presented architecture combines various streams of sensory data, like a camera, IMU, and GPS allowing them to detect obstacles, plan the path, and present AR path navigation on top of it. Having harnessed an appropriately optimized YOLOv8 backbone, the framework balances the levels of high accuracy in detection and a low level of computational latency that renders the framework suited to implementation on an edge-based wearable platform. Pose estimation and path acing modules are used to achieve precise tracking of the movement with an augmented reality (AR) overlay used to give users feedback on how to correct the movement in time. The suggested system shows an experimental outcome of detection accuracy of 96.4 % and an average response of feedback latency of 210 ms which makes its performance close to instant analysis of the performance. Ablation studies indicate the relevant and proliferative roles of the path guidance and AR components cases in enhancing accuracy and speed of reaction. The framework will provide an effective, flexible solution for the monitoring of the performances, coaching assistance, and injury prevention in competitive sport and fill the gap between the success of data-driven knowledge and the training on the field."

However, VLMs for 3D coordinates detection tasks are rare. In this work, we investigate interactive abilities of VLMs by returning 3D object positions given a monocular RGB image from a wrist-mounted camera, natural language input, and robot states. We collected and curated a heterogeneous dataset of more than 100,000 images and finetuned a VLM using QLoRA with a custom regression head. By implementing conditional routing, our model maintains its ability to process general visual queries while adding specialized 3D position estimation capabilities. Our results demonstrate robust predictive performance with a median MAE of 13 mm on the test set and a five-fold improvement over a simpler baseline without finetuning. In about 25% of the cases, predictions are within a range considered acceptable for the robot to interact with objects."

    "abstract": "Dyslexia is a prevalent learning disorder that impairs reading fluency and comprehension, often remaining undetected during the critical years of a child's education. Early screening is essential to initiate timely support and reduce long-term academic difficulties, yet conventional diagnostic approaches are costly, language-specific, and dependent on expert evaluation. This paper presents a full-stack web-based dyslexia screening system designed for children aged 8-12 years. The platform provides two independent assessments- a parental screener test comprising ten diagnostic questions and a child eye-tracking test that uses WebGazer.js with a standard webcam to capture fixation patterns, regression frequency, and reading speed. Each test produces its own outcome, while an integrated dashboard consolidates the findings by displaying the detected indicators, the number of completed tests, and the average confidence of dyslexia risk. The backend employs a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) model to analyze eye-tracking metrics, with performance validated against the publicly available Zenodo eye-tracking dataset. The system further offers automated report generation and doctor recommendations based on location to guide next steps. By combining accessibility, scalability, and interpretability, the proposed system provides a practical tool for early dyslexia screening in both school and home environments."

Maintaining very low latency in such critical situations becomes significant and challenging because of dynamic network environment and imbalance load. To address this, this work proposes a Latency Aware Prediction for IIoT (LAP - IIoT) a framework that leverages Long - Term Short Memory (LSTM), a Machine Learning (ML) model to predict network latency to optimize the performances of the network as well as fog-edge task offloading in real- time scenarios. The proposed methodology LAP -IIoT leverages real-time network parameters to predict network latency. The obtained results demonstrate that this ML-driven approach effectively identifies 'warning' and 'failure' states. By anticipating both performance deprivation and identification of states, this proposed model allows for intelligent fog- edge task offloading in IIoT systems."

    "abstract": "Batik, a traditional textile art recognized by UNESCO as an Intangible Cultural Heritage, holds profound cultural and aesthetic values across Indonesia. To support cultural preservation through digital recognition, this study proposes a classification approach for Malang batik motifs using a parallel Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture. A dataset of 622 images across 31 motif classes was collected directly from three Malang batik production centers and enriched using various augmentation techniques to overcome data scarcity. The proposed model employs two parallel convolutional branches with different kernel sizes to capture multi-scale visual features, followed by concatenation, global average pooling, and fully connected layers for final classification. Model training was performed using a $\\mathbf{5}$-fold cross-validation scheme with the Adam optimizer and ELU activation function. The proposed parallel CNN architecture was designed to extract richer and more diverse feature representations, improving classification accuracy compared to conventional sequential CNN models. Experimental results demonstrated that augmentation significantly influenced performance, where geometric transformations such as rotation achieved stable accuracy above 90%. The highest performance was obtained using a combination of all augmentations, achieving 99.59% accuracy, 99.60% precision, 99.50% recall, and 99.50% F-measure. However, this improvement came with higher computational costs, as runtime and memory consumption were substantially increased compared to simpler augmentation strategies. These findings highlight a clear trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency. Overall, the proposed method demonstrates the potential of parallel CNNs and augmentation in enhancing batik motif recognition."

However, adoption within higher education lags behind industry. This study looks at the factors that affect XR adoption at Nile University through a UTAUT based survey that targeted second to fifth years students. Comparisons of students with XR experience and those without show significant, medium-to-large differences in Experience, Performance Expectancy, Effort Expectancy, Social Influence, and Facilitating Conditions. Those with prior exposure reported greater perceived usefulness, ease of use, social support, and resource readiness. Five main barriers were identified through qualitative analysis: limited training and awareness, infrastructure limitations, high costs, and challenges in curriculum integration. This paper suggests targeted pilots, faculty training, shared XR labs, and structured curriculum modules to support a broader adoption of XR in design programs."

    "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) has transformed healthcare with wearable devices, data collection and analytics as well the continuous monitoring of patients. However, when applied to IoT-based healthcare systems, such advancements can be dangerous, especially in devices with limited power capacity. In order to make the system more stable and better at detecting threats, this project aims to build a healthcare IoT platform that is secure and uses deep learning and machine learning. The initial layer of the suggested two-layer security system provides the sink and source nodes with two-way mutual authentication. Layer 2 contains a lightweight intrusion detection system (G-IDS) that can detect both RPL and conventional network threats using a game-theoretic methodology. This approach compares itself to state-of-the-art ML and DL models like CNN, LSTM, and hybrid DNNs by combining data collection with modeling of IoT architecture. Results from experiments show that the proposed G-IDS achieves better performance than IDS models based on deep learning. These models usually achieve 92.4% accuracy, 96.8% detection accuracy, 94.3% precision, 95.6% recall, and an F1-score of 0.95. There is a 21% reduction in energy consumption and a 3.2% decrease in the false-positive rate when compared to conventional ML algorithms. The proposed approach also successfully detects attacks that are unique to RPL, such as Rank, Version Number, and Hello Flood. Based on its guarantees of robust protection, low computing cost, and high detection accuracy, the study concludes that the two-layer IoT healthcare security framework is ideal for healthcare IoT environments with limited resources and for fostering safe digital healthcare transition."

    "abstract": "Unmanned Aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly being used in various fields like agriculture, military, construction surveys and other surveillance purposes, etc. Due to increasing dependency, UAVs have become more prone to various types of cyber attacks. This increasing dependence on UAVs has significantly increased the probability of cyber attacks. Although ML algorithms have enabled the development of intrusion detection systems (IDSs), modren IDSs do not work effectively to identify an attack. Several different ML techniques are studied in this work to compare the IDS detection capabilities of different models on the basis of which the probability of an attack is determined. Different ML/ DL based IDSs are analyzed that are trained to detect cyber attacks using seven models by using a publicly available dataset that includes different types of cyber and physical features related to UAVs. Models are developed for both binary and multiclass classification to identify attacks, and performance of different models are compared to find accuracy of detecting an attack. The work done in this paper will help in studying and determining the best model for predicting attacks on a UAV system based on different cyber and physical features."

In this study, a crypto-agile zero-trust access architecture for multi-cloud environments is presented, utilizing software-defined networking (SDN) to coordinate quantum key distribution (QKD) and post-quantum cryptography (PQC) for session security. The architecture incorporates a policy-driven controller that uses programmable data planes for micro-segmentation and continuous verification to dynamically choose ML-KEM or QKD-derived keys for each transaction. The system includes automated failover between PQC and QKD to guarantee resilience, preserving secure connectivity in the event of link failure or resource exhaustion. QKD-PQC failover under adversarial stress, flow-level path enforcement via P4, and TLS 1.3 handshakes with PQC are all demonstrated using a simulation prototype. The results demonstrate that SDN-based orchestration can maintain performance and uphold zero-trust principles, while also highlighting the viability of quantifying PQC overhead in real-time cloud scenarios. This establishes the framework as a workable route to multi-cloud security that is quantum robust."

By leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, particularly BERT -based sentiment analysis, alongside computer vision-based visual feature recognition and SCT behavioral scoring, the study quantifies key psychological constructs such as attention, retention, reproduction, and motivation. Ten iconic stories from Andersen's canon-including The Little Mermaid and The Ugly Duckling-are examined alongside corresponding Disney animations. SCT -based influence scores were computed for each character, yielding a higher average score for Disney protagonists (mean score: 0.81) compared to their Andersen counterparts (mean score: 0.66), suggesting enhanced character modeling through animation. Sentiment analysis also revealed a 78.3% net positivity in Disney narratives compared to 52.4% in the original texts. Structural similarity analysis yielded an average narrative similarity index of 0.78 across the corpus. AI-driven K-means clustering of child audience responses further validated the dominance of prosocial traits like empathy, independence, and bravery among viewers influenced by high-scoring Disney characters. Overall, the model demonstrated a comparative accuracy of 94.61 % in classifying characters' SCT influence levels and behavioral impact. This study not only bridges literary analysis with AI but also sets a methodological precedent for evaluating moral education tools in children's media using quantitative behavioral science frameworks."

These challenges are often amplified by traditional fixed-time traffic signal systems that lack the ability to adapt to real-time traffic variations. This paper presents a realtime adaptive traffic signal controller implemented on an FPGA using Verilog. The system employs a deterministic, rule-based algorithm to dynamically tune green light durations based on live traffic density obtained from lane-based sensors. Each lane is monitored by three sensors that classify traffic as low, moderate, or high, enabling the FPGA to allocate green times accordingly. Leveraging the parallel processing capabilities and low latency of FPGAs, the proposed system ensures rapid decision-making, reduced vehicle idle time, and enhanced traffic throughput. The design is lightweight, scalable, hardware-efficient, and suitable for modern intelligent transportation systems. In addition to improving traffic flow, the system contributes to lower fuel wastage and reduced emissions by minimizing unnecessary idling."

Most existing works focus on object detection, which is insufficient for identifying malicious intent. Furthermore, a comprehensive benchmark for the latest object detectors on specialized UAV datasets is notably absent. To address these gaps, we propose a novel cascaded pipeline for real-time drone behavior anomaly detection. First, we establish a rigorous benchmark evaluating YOLOv7 and YOLOv8 variants on the visible-spectrum subset of the Anti-UAV 300 dataset. Our results demonstrate that YOLOv8m provides an optimal trade-off between high accuracy (68.7% mAP50-95) and real-time performance (132 FPS). Second, we use this optimal detector to power a cascaded analysis pipeline that employs a spatio-temporal ConvLSTM Autoencoder to learn normal drone motion from motion-saliency maps. By analyzing reconstruction error, our system effectively distinguishes normal flight from anomalous behaviors, achieving an AUROC of 0.944. This work provides two key contributions: a valuable benchmark for the research community and a complete, effective framework for advancing drone surveillance to nuanced behavior analysis."

To complement AI agents like Copilot in heterogeneous systems such as Electronic Health Records (EHRs), enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems, and Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) devices, the Bring-Your-Own-Agent (BYOA) framework is proposed. The BYOA framework uses AI to solve the problems impacting agent orchestration. It includes real-time data, automatic work processes and compliant data governance. The modular design and standard APIs of this system allow non-communicating objects to communicate. The standard API ensures all data remains safe and secure 100 % of the time. It also has built-in compliance features for HIPAA and GDPR that protect sensitive data from collection to deletion. According to a paper that sets out a conceptual framework and applies real tests and case studies, expanding Copilot functionality can significantly improve operational efficiency, decision-making and resource usage in enterprises and healthcare. The BYOA foundation will enable industries to do effective AI agent integrations and improve security and compliance.

    "abstract": "The operational efficacy of micro-sized search-and-rescue robots in post-disaster environments, such as collapsed buildings, is critically dependent on robust and efficient communication. Traditional Mobile Ad-hoc Network (MANET) routing protocols often falter in these challenging scenarios due to dynamic topologies, severe signal attenuation, and stringent energy constraints, primarily because they treat network reliability as a passive constraint rather than an integral optimization variable. This paper introduces a novel multi-objective nonlinear programming model for mesh network routing that deeply couples reliability dynamics with routing decisions. We model the network as a time-varying graph where link and node reliabilities are not static parameters but dynamic state variables co-evolving with traffic load, interference, and energy consumption. Our framework simultaneously optimizes four conflicting objectives: reliability-weighted delay, load balancing, network survivability, and energy efficiency. The model's core innovation lies in its bidirectional feedback mechanism: routing decisions directly influence reliability degradation rates, while instantaneous reliability values actively reshape network performance metrics and constraints. A detailed case study of a building collapse scenario demonstrates that our model achieves a superior trade-off. This work provides a rigorous mathematical foundation for deploying resilient robotic networks in life-critical missions."

    "abstract": "In the task of automatic Thangka image colorization, traditional methods often struggle to balance artistic color fidelity with semantic structural consistency. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Thangka image colorization framework based on a multi-branch attention fusion mechanism (TCA-Net). Specifically, three directional attention branches (channel-height, channel-width, and channel-spatial) are introduced to capture semantic correlations across different feature dimensions. In addition, we design an Adaptive Graph Channel Recalibration (AGCR) module to enhance the flexibility of attention representation and improve inter-channel dependency modeling. Furthermore, we introduce a Strip-Based Contextual Line-Aware Attention (SCLA) mechanism, which significantly strengthens the model’s capability to perceive contextual information and enables global feature integration across spatial dimensions. By integrating multi-directional attention to guide the learning of color distributions, the proposed method achieves superior performance in terms of detail preservation and semantic coherence. Extensive experiments conducted on both the Thangka dataset and public benchmarks demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods in color realism, edge fidelity, and cross-style generalization. This work provides a promising solution for the digital restoration of Thangka murals."

A Transformer is leveraged by spatiotemporal branch to capture evolving temporal dynamics and spatial dependencies of brain activity, while the power of brain waves is quantified by frequency branch to extract spectral cues linked to seizure onset. An enriched latent vector is formed by fusing representations from both branches which emerges minutes before seizure.

    "abstract": "Precise 3D point cloud information from mining tunnels plays a vital role in tasks like surroundings awareness, 3D modeling, and structural change detection in smart mining systems. Yet, the harsh subsurface setting often results in point clouds contaminated by noise at various scales due to LiDAR scanning. Conventional denoising techniques relying on a single method frequently fail to eliminate noise adequately while safeguarding essential surface details on tunnel walls. To overcome this challenge, we introduce an integrated denoising strategy for mining tunnel point clouds that leverages feature integration and dynamic partitioning. This approach begins by combining surface properties (such as surface normals and bending measures) with tunnel layout knowledge (like the main tunnel orientation) to conduct flexible area division, categorizing the point cloud into smooth surface zones, rounded detail zones, and areas with intense noise. Subsequently, customized adaptive denoising tactics are employed based on each zone's traits: a bending-adjusted adaptive outlier detector for smooth zones, a normal-integrated dual-sided filter with flexible weighting for rounded zones to maintain specifics, and an enhanced grouping-based technique for noise-heavy zones. Tests using actual tunnel point cloud samples show that our strategy successfully identifies and clears diverse noise forms. Relative to standard techniques, it delivers better noise reduction and improved retention of tunnel layout details, offering reliable data for advanced tunnel alignment and simulation."

    "abstract": "Contemporary JavaScript-based web applications generate huge volumes of interactivity and connectedness data that is very sensitive and vulnerable to tight privacy and governance policies. To establish secure and responsible data management in such distributed environments, the approach requires a combination of decentralized control, privacy safeguards and effective collaborative learning. In this research, a hybrid federated learning/blockchain architecture, PSOAdam Federated Blockchain Governance (PA-FedGov) is proposed and aimed at meeting verifiable and privacyprotecting data governance. The new hybrid optimization approach is a combination of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm of adaptive global aggregation and the Adam optimizer of local model optimization which leads to faster convergence and better generalization on non-independent and identically distributed data sources. To achieve immutable, auditable and transparent governance mechanisms, smart contracts are used by the blockchain layer to store model provenance, different privacy budgets, and compliance metadata. To conduct experimental evaluations, the system utilized Benchmark datasets such as FEMNIST to identify user specific handwritings, CICIDS 2017 to detect intrusion in web systems and the Edge-IIoTset to analyze and govern edges, and IoT. These datasets are used in the publicly available CSV or JSON formats. The findings show that the suggested PAFedGov model is more accurate and more stable by up to 12 percent when compared to the conventional federated learning approaches like FedAvg and FedProx, with the same set of differential privacy restrictions. The architecture that ensures traceability and decentralized policy enforcement is blockchain based, and it provides a scalable and reliable foundation of safe data control within federated and privacy-sensitive JavaScript web environments."

To this purpose, the project presents demand forecasting system based on machine learning. It uses past sales information to forecast the sales in each item by each store every day. The model preprocesses time-series data and derives helpful time predictors and uses a Random Forest Regressor to learn intricate and non linear buying characteristics. These experiments demonstrate that the system is giving quality predictions and identifying trends and seasonality, and also makes decisions based on data.

Well-established methods, such as Vickers and Brinell hardness tests, while common, are generally time-consuming and dependent on expert equipment, posing problems during initial material screening. This paper presents a machine learning approach to predict hardness based on a small number of readily available material properties, such as tensile strength, elongation at break, and density. The dataset comprises 25 biocompatible materials with six features selected from MatWeb. Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Random Forest, Gradient boosting, and XG-Boost models were implemented, incorporating feature reduction through Principal Component Analysis (PCA). This enables a fast, data-driven prediction of Vickers and Brinell hardness, with <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$R^{2}$</tex> values of 0.82 and 0.83, respectively. Furthermore, once the value of one of these types of hardness, Brinell or Vickers, is available or predicted, the value of the other can be deduced with great accuracy. In particular, Vickers hardness was predicted from Brinell hardness and density by using Ridge Regression with an <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$R^{2}$</tex> value of 0.96."

Conventional shipboard power systems often operate at low generator load factors, resulting in poor fuel efficiency and significant emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur oxides (SOx), and particulate matter (PM). The proposed microgrid integrates multiple energy sources with advanced control strategies to optimize power flow, enhance generation efficiency, and enable effective exhaust gas treatment. By providing stable onboard power while reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) and pollutant emissions, the system supports practical implementation of cleaner fuels and contributes to carbon-neutral, sustainable maritime operations."

    "abstract": "Diffusion models have recently attracted considerable attention in speech synthesis tasks due to their remarkable capabilities in generating high-fidelity speech. However, existing diffusion-based text-to-speech (TTS) methods typically rely on external aligners, involve complex structures, exhibit slow inference speeds, and struggle to maintain stable performance in multi-speaker scenarios. To address these limitations, this paper proposes UniDiff-TTS, an aligner-free unified diffusion-based speech synthesis framework. UniDiff-TTS integrates the efficient parallel generation architecture of FastSpeech with the high-quality generative capabilities of Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs). Specifically, during training, UniDiff-TTS utilizes duration-guided conditional representations from FastSpeech to assist the LDM in iteratively reconstructing mel-spectrograms in latent space. During inference, high-quality speech can be generated using only a few diffusion sampling steps. Experimental results on four datasets covering both single- and multi-speaker speech synthesis tasks in Chinese and English demonstrate that UniDiff-TTS significantly outperforms existing approaches, including Tacotron 2, FastSpeech 2, and Grad-TTS, in terms of Mean Opinion Score (MOS), Mel Cepstral Distortion (MCD), and Real-Time Factor (RTF). Particularly, UniDiff-TTS maintains superior performance in multi-speaker settings and under low-step inference conditions. Additional ablation studies and analyses of diffusion steps validate the effectiveness of each component and demonstrate the practical deployment potential of the system. Overall, UniDiff-TTS provides a viable approach for developing unified TTS systems that simultaneously achieve high fidelity and low inference latency."

    "abstract": "Vehicular Social Networks (VSNs) face great challenges in achieving efficient caching of content due to the extremely dynamic mobility of vehicles, time-varying traffic conditions, and dynamic social interactions. The challenges cause elevated latency and a low Quality of Experience (QoE). To address the challenges, a work proposes a Traffic- and Social-Aware Content Caching framework optimized with the novel Taylor Flamingo Shark Optimization (TFSO) algorithm. The framework utilizes predicted mobility of vehicles and social relationship-driven content popularity modeling to efficiently direct cache placement at the Road Side Units (RSUs) and in the vehicles. In addition, a hierarchical cooperative caching policy allows RSUs to cache popular, long-term content globally while allowing the vehicles to store locally popular, short-term content for socially related groups, thus decreasing the redundancy and enhancing the coverage in the network. The multi-objective optimization aims at improving the cache hit ratio, reducing delivery latency, and improving QoE at the same time. The simulation outcomes show that the TFSO-directed framework outperforms the existing caching techniques, and it describes an adaptive efficient, and socially aware approach for content delivery in highly dynamic vehicular networks."

    "abstract": "Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are widely preferred in various applications from environmental monitoring to healthcare and industrial automation due to its minimum peripheral requirements and simplified architecture. However, extending lifetime has become a significant challenge in WSNs due to its limited energy resources, non-efficient processing and communication strategies. The traditional network lifetime improvement methods are highly affected with environmental factors, hardware limitations and lack of intelligence. The advancements of Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) addresses these issues with an innovative solution by handling the transmission data in an intelligent way. The efficient resource management and adaptive network protocols of ML and DL approaches are moving further WSNs to a greater improvement. This paper examines the impact of ML and DL approaches on improving the lifetime of wireless sensor networks. It explores the performances of various neural networks implemented to optimize the data aggregation, transmission and node operations of WSNs. The findings suggests the possibility of making autonomous sensor networks using ML and DL models, especially in complex and dynamic environments."

    "abstract": "Multi-view data encompasses various data types, including multi-feature, multi-sequence, and multi-modal data. Multi-view multi-label classification aims to leverage the rich semantic information contained in multiple views to achieve enhanced multi-label classification performance. In practical applications, the absence of views and labels poses a significant challenge to multi-view multi-label classification tasks. Premised on the assumption that shared semantic information across multiple views is sufficient to support the downstream task, we propose CTRL, a novel incomplete multi-view multi-label classification framework to address the multi-view learning challenge on the data with partially missing views and missing labels in this paper. The core mechanism of CTRL lies in learning a high-purity, lowredundancy condensed representation that adequately captures the essential information of the original data. Specifically, we design a new objective loss to enhance the semantic information of shared cross-view within the joint representation learning process while simultaneously suppressing intra-view redundant information that is irrelevant to the downstream task. This enables CTRL to extract task-relevant representations even when views are incomplete. Furthermore, we employ the Beta Evidential Neural Network to model the label distribution. This network is then integrated with Dempster-Shafer theory, enabling our model to perform label-level classification uncertainty estimation. This also allows us to use the estimated uncertainty and belief mass to create high-reliability pseudo-labels, resulting in further gains in model performance. Experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed model in terms of accuracy, robustness, and reliability."

However, the scarcity of US videos for rare cases limits training opportunities for novice sonographers and deep learning models, hindering detection rates and clinical di agnostic applications. US video synthesis is a promising solution to this issue. Nevertheless, accurately imitating the intricate motion of the anatomy while preserving image f idelity presents a significant challenge. In this work, we propose OnUVS, a novel online feature-decoupling frame work for high-fidelity US video synthesis. First, to simulate realistic motion, we incorporate keypoints into anatomical learning through a weakly supervised training approach, which enhances motion representation and minimizes the need for fully annotated data. Second, we implement a dual decoder generator that effectively balances content and textural features of generated frames, significantly enhancing the image fidelity of US videos. Third, a multi-scale discriminator further refines the sharpness and fine details, ensuring high-fidelity video synthesis. Fourth, an online learning strategy is designed to smooth coherence between frames by constraining the keypoint trajectories during inference. Validation on echocardiographic and pelvic floor US datasets demonstrates that OnUVS outperforms existing methods, achieving a 22.08% improvement in motion consistency (FVD) and 25.04% in image fidelity (FID). To facilitate reproducibility, we publicly release the code of OnUVSat: https://github.com/LucyChen159/OnUVS."

    "abstract": "The control system for permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) driven by active neutral-point clamped (ANPC) three-level inverters faces challenges such as slow response of conventional PI controllers, significant chattering and insufficient disturbance rejection in traditional sliding mode control (SMC), and neutral-point (NP) voltage imbalance in the three-level inverter. To address these issues, this paper proposes a composite control strategy integrating second-order fast super-twisting sliding mode control (FSTA-SMC), a novel sliding mode disturbance observer (SMDO), and an improved zero-sequence voltage injection method. The speed loop employs the fast super-twisting algorithm, while the current loop utilizes the super-twisting algorithm, thereby preventing the issue of fast response in individual loops while overall system dynamics remain sluggish. Furthermore, a novel sliding mode disturbance observer is designed by formulating its sliding gain as a function of the disturbance estimation error. This enables precise observation of internal parameter variations and external load disturbances, which are then fed into the sliding mode controller via a feedforward compensation mechanism to enhance system robustness. Additionally, to mitigate the neutral-point voltage deviation, an improved zero-sequence voltage injection method is proposed, characterized by its computational simplicity and ease of engineering implementation. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed control strategy achieves superior performance in enhancing dynamic response speed, improving robustness, and suppressing chattering, while also effectively balancing the neutral-point voltage and improving the overall performance of the drive system."

    "abstract": "Continuous monitoring of industrial rotating machines is essential for ensuring health, reliability, and safety, while minimizing costs from unplanned downtime. Traditional systems require domain experts to configure parameters for each machine, limiting adaptability. Machine learning techniques offer alternatives, with supervised approaches demanding labeled datasets that are rarely available due to the extensive effort required from specialists. This study presents an algorithm for unsupervised condition monitoring based on an online distribution-driven clustering approach. The algorithm autonomously learns machine behavior, detecting new operating conditions in real time while recognizing previously observed states. Input data consist of signals from proximity and accelerometer sensors mounted on the rotor shaft. These signals are processed using time- and frequency-domain feature extraction methods combined with an autoencoder neural network. Validation was performed with four datasets: synthetically generated signals, real measurements from a rotating machine at the Federal University of Uberlandia, and benchmark datasets from Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) and Hanoi University of Science and Technology (HUST) bearing dataset. Evaluation metrics, including accuracy and F1 score, consistently reached values close to 0.96 across most tests. These results confirm the algorithm’s ability to reliably detect and classify machine condition variations in real time. Furthermore, results obtained with benchmark datasets were compared to supervised learning studies, showing comparable or superior performance. This demonstrates the proposed method’s robustness and practicality in industrial applications, where labeled data are scarce and real-time adaptability is critical. Overall, the algorithm provides an effective solution for unsupervised monitoring of rotating machinery, reducing reliance on expert intervention while maintaining high detection accuracy."

    "abstract": "Because of its functionality and practicality, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely discussed, with a large number of benchmarking being done to evaluate them, especially their efficiency. But despite their numerous applications and the significant benefits they offer, LLMs have proven to be extremely susceptible to attacks of various natures due to their, often unknown, large number of vulnerabilities, characteristics often ignored by benchmarking. Given that, this paper aims to develop a multi-criteria method to assist stakeholders in selecting the most suitable Large Language Model taking into account based on both its efficiency in carrying out tasks of various natures, such as math and reasoning, and its capability to resist a large range of security vulnerabilities, such as prompt injection and jailbreaking. This study utilized the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) along with tools developed to evaluate the capabilities of LLMs in multi-interaction dialogues and LLM vulnerability scanner applied in open source models. The analysis showed that an more efficient model does not mean that it is safer. In addition, it reveals an efficient method for analyzing both model performance and security issues."

    "abstract": "In the emerging transportation electrification applications, there is an increasing demand on concurrently pursuing high reliability, high energy efficiency, and high power density of power converters. Conventional cooling technologies, such as using bulky heatsinks or cold plates, have constrained further performance improvements of power converters. Based on an innovative immersion cooling technique, this paper presents a high-fidelity, multi-physics modeling and experimental validation framework for a 100-kW, five-level active neutral point clamped (5L-ANPC) power inverter, making it the first comprehensive study on this topic. The study begins by examining the electrical performance of the 5L-ANPC inverter, followed by the computation of semiconductor losses to be used as heat sources in subsequent thermal simulations. Afterwards, the immersion-cooled inverter is modeled and analyzed by conducting high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. Various operating conditions and thermal design factors for the immersion-cooled 5L-ANPC inverter are considered, and the related impacts are investigated to characterize the thermal performance of the inverter. The results demonstrate significantly reduced semiconductor junction temperatures and more uniform heat distribution compared to conventional air cooling. The findings highlight the advantages of immersion cooling in thermal management, leading to higher output power and higher reliability. Finally, prototypes of air-cooled and immersion-cooled inverters are developed with intensive testing to compare the thermal performance. The multi-physics simulation results showing the superior performance of immersion cooling are also verified in the experiments."

    "abstract": "The advent of extremely large antenna arrays and high-frequency signaling is expected to enable next-generation integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) networks to predominantly operate in the near-field region. Due to the dual influence of distance and angle on wave propagation characteristics in the near-field region, accurately modeling these characteristics remains a critical challenge. Motivated by the potential of large language models (LLMs) in angle prediction and distance estimation, an LLM-enhanced multi-objective optimization problem (MOOP) is developed to accurately capture the dependence of the channel on both the angular position and distance. The formulated LLM-enhanced MOOP framework is decomposed into a series of sub-problems, which can balance spectral efficiency for communication and localization accuracy for sensing. To overcome the computational and energy challenges associated with LLMs, a gray wolf optimization (GWO)-based algorithm is integrated as black-box search operator with LLM-specific prompt engineering to solve these sub-problems. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed LLM-GWO scheme achieves an trade-off between communication and sensing performance, outperforming baseline approaches in terms of both Pareto front quality and convergence."

    "abstract": "The practically fixed-time leaderless cluster synchronization is addressed for uncertain spatiotemporal networks (USTNs) with coopetition interactions, actuator faults and external disturbances. Firstly, by introducing sign-based coupling, a class of USTN is formulated to capture the dynamics of coopetition interactions among different clusters, which provides a more accurate representation compared to dynamical networks with unsigned coupling. Secondly, a practical fixed-time (PFT) convergence theorem is developed for a general partial differential system, which relaxes the constraints on the derivative of the Lyapunov function and provides a less conservative method for estimating the settling time. Subsequently, a distributed fault-tolerant control algorithm is designed to drive the cluster synchronization error to an adjustable attraction region in a fixed time. By exploring specific properties of the intra-cluster Laplacian matrix and proposing a new inter-degree balanced condition, several flexible synchronization criteria are derived and a quantitative relationship among control parameters, the settling time and the size of the attraction region is presented. Finally, the effectiveness of the developed controllers and criteria is validated through a coupled reaction-diffusion neural network."

    "abstract": "Engineered assembloids fabricated from tissue spheroids hold immense promise for developmental biology, disease modeling, and regenerative medicine. However, fabricating heterogeneous assembloids with precise spatial patterning remains a critical bottleneck, often reliant on manual pipetting that lacks scalability and reproducibility. While magnetic microrobotics, which transforms spheroids into controllable robots, offers a non-invasive alternative, it faces a fundamental challenge: the global input of magnetic actuation. A single command moves all robots simultaneously, leading to coupled motion and frequent assembly failures. Here, we present a collaborative control framework that overcomes this limitation by leveraging local constraints and a novel motion decoupling strategy. We reformulate the high-dimensional, coupled multi-robot planning problem into a low-dimensional aggregate space, effectively transforming the assembly task into a dynamic sequential decision problem. This framework, coupled with a graph-based dynamic path optimization algorithm, enables deterministic, collision-free assembly. Experimental validation demonstrates a 78.57% higher success rate and a 33.20% higher assembly efficiency compared to conventional strategies. This work establishes a foundational engineering principle for assembloid fabrication, transitioning the process from a qualitative experiments to a controllable and programmable engineering discipline, thereby unlocking the potential for deterministic construction of complex biological structures."

This research introduces a novel structured data security identification model via a multi-faceted approach. For numerical data, clustering statistics construct a distribution baseline to enable identification extraction by analyzing patterns and multi-dimensional statistical features, effectively capturing numerical data’s cluster characteristics and inter-dimensional correlations. For character data, an intelligent classification algorithm based on a cross-industry feature thesaurus trains a deep learning classification model to predict semantic categories by analyzing lexical semantics, syntactic structures, and contextual dependencies. A Bloom filter-based algorithm generates compact data fingerprints via probabilistic hashing for ownership declaration and rapid traceability, ensuring efficient similarity matching with minimal storage overhead, scalable performance, and high-speed query capabilities. Theoretical analysis and experimental validation on diverse real-world datasets demonstrate the model consistently achieves millisecond-level identification extraction, sub-second traceability for 500,000 identifiers, and state-of-the-art recognition accuracy. These results validate its capability to support robust right confirmation systems in trusted data spaces, addressing critical needs in real-time access control, sensitive data leakage prevention, and post-incident forensics across dynamic network environments.

    "abstract": "High spatial-spectral hyperspectral images are in high demand across multiple fields and can be acquired by fusing the complementary features of low-resolution hyperspectral and high-resolution multispectral images. Although considerable learning-based approaches have been devised for this task, the complexity and the need to exploit vital features still leave room for improvement. Therefore, we devised a Cross Transformer based on an attention mechanism in the Frequency domain to improve computational efficiency. Furthermore, the proposed technique is further improved by introducing an effective Feed-forward Network in the Frequency Domain. The presented network is validated via various experiments employing two widely used datasets, Columbia computer vision laboratory (CAVE) and Imperial Computer Vision & Learning Lab (iCVL)."

    "abstract": "Image captioning aims to generate semantically accurate and linguistically fluent descriptions from images. Despite progress with vision–language pre-trained models (VLMs) and large language models (LLMs), existing methods still suffer from visual hallucination—producing entities or attributes inconsistent with image content. To address this, we propose FVCap, a fact-checking-driven model that employs a multistage \"generate–verify–rewrite\" mechanism to enhance factual consistency and semantic accuracy. The Fact Verification Module (FVM) integrates textual parsing, YOLO-World–based entity verification, and VQA-based attribute checking to impose multimodal factual constraints from entity to attribute levels. This hierarchical verification mitigates hallucination and improves reliability. Experiments on MSCOCO and Flickr30k show that FVCap surpasses state-of-the-art methods across multiple metrics, demonstrating strong robustness, generalization, and interpretability for trustworthy caption generation."

Solar energy is one of the crucial types of energy for enhancing the performance of renewable energy systems. This paper explores the design, development, and implementation of a dual-axis sun-tracking solar panel system. It maximises the output of solar energy by adjusting the panel according to the trajectory of the sun throughout the day. It is constituted of basic elements like LDR sensors, Arduino UNO, and servo motors for the movement of the panel. The panel is designed to move horizontally from east to west and in a vertical direction, north and south. This helps the system receive maximum solar energy, giving maximum output. Compared to a typical fixed solar panel, the proposed system has 40-50% more output energy. It is an overall costeffective, reliable, and expandable solar system."

    "abstract": "Social networking websites possess a profound im- pact on peer relationships and information exchange between users of information. This project has a dual purpose, delivering an XAI-inspired system that is intended to perform two basic tasks, namely friend suggestion based on social graph analysis and disinformation discovery within online content. To enable the recommendation of acquaintances, the system uses advanced graph-oriented method algorithms like Graph Attention Networks (GAT), Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN), and Node2Vec from the domain of machine learning, each trained on actual Facebook network data. These models help uncover potential connections by examining the structural properties of the social network. The project component related to detection of disinformation uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) meth- ods, particularly transformer-based models such as BERT, to ascertain social media content credibility from annotated Twitter datasets. For transparency while making decisions, techniques from explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), like SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), are employed. Furthermore, LIME (Lo- cal Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) is utilized, allowing human-understandable and interpretable visual explanations insights into the behavior of the models. To find the functioning of the models, metrics such as accuracy, recall, F1-score and precision are used. Comparative graphical analysis shows the most efficient frameworks for a number of tasks. The whole solution is built in a single notebook environment, encouraging constant improvement and clarity. Such blending of intelligibility in social networking Analytics adds authenticity, accountability, and trustworthiness to the digital interaction system."

    "abstract": "The increasing penetration of distributed renewable energy and the growing demand for intelligent grid management have brought significant challenges in achieving low latency, high reliability, and energy-efficient task processing in modern power systems. Multi-unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) edge computing systems, especially those enhanced by non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), provide new opportunities for supporting smart grid applications such as real-time fault detection, line inspection, emergency restoration, and wide-area monitoring. In this paper, we study the hierarchical scheduling and joint optimization of UAV trajectory, task offloading, transmit power, and onboard computing resources in NOMA-enabled UAV-assisted smart grid networks. The problem is formulated as a high-dimensional mixed-integer nonconvex optimization, and we propose a reinforcement learning framework that leverages the asynchronous advantage actor–critic algorithm with a hybrid action representation combining discrete and continuous variables. The framework adopts constraint-aware reward shaping to ensure compliance with energy, latency, and UAV mobility requirements while effectively balancing system cost and computational performance. Simulation results show that the proposed method achieves notable gains in latency reduction, energy savings, and resource efficiency, making it a compelling solution for next-generation smart grid infrastructures."

This article presents an optimized hybrid deep learning approach that combines CNN, Bi-LSTM, and PCA to improve intrusion detection. Unlike previous methods based on computationally intensive algorithms like IPSO or ATFDNN, the new method focuses on effective feature selection and real-time responsiveness without sacrificing detection capability. PCA is used to compress feature dimensions, enhancing computational speed, while the CNN and Bi-LSTM layers collaboratively learn many features of network traffic. The model is trained on CICIDS2017 dataset, simulating realistic traffic scenarios. Experiment results reveal an extremely high detection accuracy of 98.2%, which surpasses most of the current models in terms of classification performance as well as false alarm rates reduction.

Securing keys which are part of Linux image during the build process is crucial for protecting sensitive data and ensuring compliance with privacy standards such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Traditional build systems protect individual keys but provide no cryptographic continuity or auditability between them. This paper presents a new and secure block chain inspired system that employs encrypted key management alongside secure build environments where the keys used in the build process and the keys inserted to the Linux image are cryptographically linked to its predecessor. To minimize the risk of key leakage, key rotation and environment isolation are implemented to enforce strict access controls. The resulting chained key lineage embedded to the Linux image can be verified for authenticity and provenance without relying on external trust anchors. The proposed approach enhances trust; accountability and compliance in software build lifecycle providing a robust foundation for maintaining the keys."

    "abstract": "Cyber risk has emerged as a major financial and operational issue, with organizations getting increasingly vulnerable to cyber threats as a result of the rapid digitalization of organizations. Cyber insurance that was once considered an additional protection has taken a new look as a key risk management mechanism. Nevertheless, the process of converting intricate and dynamic cyber threats into the numbers that can be assessed and calculated in monetary terms is still a challenge to insurers and businesses. This paper examines 10 major academic and industry models to assess the effectiveness of the existing cyber insurance models in assessing, pricing, and mitigating the cyber risks. The main limitations, as discovered, are the unavailability of standardized data on incidents, limitations of traditional actuarial techniques, and the inadequacy of integrating technical, human, and organizational factors. Possible solutions to dynamic risk quantification involve the emerging approaches adaptive underwriting (SECURE), Bayesian risk modeling, and machinelearned predictions.[21] The results indicate that there should be open data reporting, standard loss measures and interdisciplinary models between cybersecurity and finance. The paper concludes with realistic suggestions on how to increase the accuracy of underwriting, claims management, and compliance towards a robust and futureproof cyber insurance ecosystem."

    "abstract": "As a core metering device, the wheat proportioner enables precise control of wheat blending ratios. However, existing proportioners often fail to meet industrial accuracy requirements. Mainstream approaches suffer from high costs, limited precision, and vulnerability to environmental disturbances. To address this limitation, we propose a hybrid neural network-based virtual weighing framework. It leverages latent operational patterns in equipment data to achieve high-precision discharge weight estimation. The framework integrates three collaborative modules. The 1D Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN) handles transient event detection. The Backpropagation Neural Network (BPNN) performs global nonlinear regression. The Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) compensates for device state drift. By relying solely on readily available signals (e.g., motor current, voltage) from existing Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) systems, the framework achieves high-precision online estimation of discharge weight for target wheat proportioners without requiring internal metering units or auxiliary sensors. Experimental validation in a real-world production environment demonstrated that the estimation error was reduced to one-tenth that of volumetric proportioners, achieving accuracy comparable to gravimetric systems while incurring negligible additional hardware costs."

Most traditional billing systems have relied on barcode scanning and physical checkouts to find the total cost of a customer's items. These traditional methods of manual processing will often slow down the process at checkout and are prone to human error. The presented system integrates RFID technology with an ESP32-based microcontroller to automatically detect items and their prices, continuously updated onto an LCD display, with total charges calculated instantly. There is a 'cancel' option that allows a customer to remove an item they wish to not purchase throughout the checkout process. In addition, there is also a QR-based payment method for fast, cashless payments. Experimental results indicated the proposed system reduced checkout time by almost 70% compared to the traditional checkout methods. The proposed system enhances billing accuracy, reduces human effort, and is overall a promising practical approach towards establishing advanced smart, automated shopping experiences."

This is significant to protect malicious alterations from organized clinical fields of data. By including deep hash fingerprinting, blockchain-supported provenance management, and semantic-preserving transformer embeddings, the adaptive Adaptive Anomaly-Driven Hash Verification (AADHV) architecture ensures document integrity from the beginning to the end. The system was simulated using databases that were formatted based on Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR). It was subjected to insertions and deletions, as well as field-level modifications. The AADHV performed better than baseline machine learning-based cryptography and verification models with a temporal consistency index of 96.82% and area under the curve (AUC) of 0.985. Cryptographic traceability of versions of documents over time was guaranteed through the combination of version-aware hash signatures with contextual embeddings. This facilitated drift detection at the granular level and field-level localization of anomalies. The experiments demonstrated low verification latency with inference times kept at an average of 210 ms per document. The results also reflected the fact that the system was more robust to structured adversarial manipulation."

Traditional \"one-size-fits-all\" approach fails to consider each learners preference and this leads to poor educational outcome. This paper proposes Lurniq, a platform that creates custom learning path for every learners. The platform begins with a demographic categorization (young, middle school, university, adult) to deliver age appropriate content and a \"cold start\" mechanism that introduces learners to material from all four VARK styles (Visual, Auditory, Read/Write, Kinesthetic). While learners navigate the instructional system, their behavioral data (such as how engaged they were and what they created with the learning material) are collected. This behavioral data, combined with a questionnaire, is used to drive the hybrid AI model that utilizes and combines a deep neural network and a tree based ensemble into a model that can accurately predict the learner’s preferred VARK style. The final prediction created through a weighted average of both approaches serves as the instructional system’s way to modify the learner’s pathway dynamically, from a broad multi-feature engaging approach to a personalized pathway weighted toward the learner’s preferred VARK style."

We present a machine learning based system to forecast the household's hourly energy consumption and trigger an alarm signal if this consumption exceeds a threshold. The data set is hourly with usage profiles, temperature, relative humidity, occupancy and temporal features, which have been preprocessed in such way that they model short term fluctuations as well as long term consumption tendency. Our predictive models are heterogeneous and they include Linear Regression to predict the trend of the baseline, Logistic Regression to classify whether the threshold was reached and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks to organize sequential dependencies in time-series data. Lastly, ensemble method is a combination of all of these to make them more accurate and predictive. It predicts the usage of the next hour and also counts the total import on a daily basis according to the thresholds set and sends alarms and automated emails if the thresholds were exceeded. The experimental results suggest that the proposed LSTM model has better performances in terms of accuracy in the temporal dynamics, and the proposed ensemble model provides a higher level of reliability in using the concurrent advantage of the individual models. The framework proposed in households allows to monitor the consumption in real time, alert on abnormal consumption and to propose actions to reduce wastage. The proposed methodology, which includes automatic alert system, contributes to sustainability in energy practice and contributes to the management of the energy efficiency in the demand side in smart houses using the predictive analytics."

    "abstract": "Multimodal Vision-Language Models are increasingly deployed in critical applications, yet remain vulnerable to back-door attacks—maliciously crafted training data that embeds hidden triggers to elicit adversarial outputs. Addressing this threat, we propose a hybrid anomaly detection and generative framework for identifying poisoned samples and characterizing trigger severity in VLMs. Leveraging CLIP and BLIP for rich multimodal feature extraction, we apply Isolation Forests with an elbow-method-optimized contamination threshold for initial anomaly screening. Clean samples guide the training of a RUNet-based generator, which reconstructs “clean” versions of suspected poisoned images. A frozen surrogate discriminator, modeled on the Isolation Forest decision boundary, guides adversarial refinement. The extracted poison—obtained by subtracting clean reconstructions from originals—is analyzed using a Gaussian Mixture Model to classify trigger severity into weak, moderate, or strong. Experiments on the ICIP 2025 challenge dataset demonstrate the robustness of our approach in both poison detection and severity classification."

This review presents a recent analysis of dataset pruning techniques applied to medical imaging published during the period from 2018 to 2025. The approaches presented have been divided into four distinct taxonomic categories: instance-based selection, coreset-based methods, difficulty-based pruning, and uncertainty-guided techniques. Our analysis reveals that dataset pruning can achieve 40-80% data reduction while maintaining diagnostic accuracy within 2-5% of full dataset performance. Key find- ings demonstrate computational savings of 50-75% in training time, improved model generalization, and enhanced handling of class imbalance. The review identifies emerging trends including foundation model integration, privacy-preserving approaches, and federated learning applications, while highlighting critical challenges in clinical validation and standardized evaluation frameworks."

A very large consumer dataset (structured and unstructured) was utilized, and both MATLAB Simulink and the AnyLogic simulation were implemented to model the dynamic demand-supply interactions. The results of the experiment show that the proposed system proved to be rather effective in satisfaction prediction and loyalty estimation, with a maximum accuracy of 94.7%, FI-score 93.1%, AUC 95.6%, and customer retention 89.8% as compared to the traditional approaches. Consumer confidence was also improved, with blockchain, with 94.2% authentication.

    "abstract": "Federated multi-task learning is an approach where multiple clients collaboratively train related but distinct models on their local data without sharing it, thereby preserving privacy while leveraging collective knowledge. However, participating clients can have very different data distributions, sizes and quality, leading to statistical heterogeneity. This heterogeneity is a major challenge in federated learning, as noisy or inconsistent updates from some clients can slow down convergence or degrade the global model's performance. MOCHA is a seminal federated multi-task learning framework that explicitly models task relationships and optimizes clientspecific models, while addressing system challenges like communication costs, fault tolerance and client dropouts. In this work, we enhance MOCHA with a server-side normalized lossbased weighting technique that focuses on the quality of client updates. Each client in the federated multi-task setup computes its local training loss, which is sent to the server during communication rounds. The server normalizes these losses across clients and assigns adaptive aggregation weights, giving more influence to clients with lower normalized losses and down-weighting noisy or unreliable clients. This design simplifies client-side implementation because all weighting is performed at the server. Experiments on heterogeneous MNIST and CIFAR-10 tasks show that the proposed method achieves a slightly higher final-round average test accuracy (0.5108 vs. 0.5065), reduces average training loss by approximately 2.6 % (from 1.1148 to 1.0858), and improves fairness by lowering the standard deviation of client accuracies by about 5 % (from 0.3631 to 0.3450) compared to baseline MOCHA. These results indicate that server-side normalized loss-based weighting improves training stability, convergence behavior and crossclient fairness in federated multi-task learning under nonconvex optimization."

    "abstract": "Stable operation of power transformers plays a very important role in making the electrical networks stable regardless of the fact that faults in the future cannot be easily detected. Power transformers suffer from numerous repeated faults like short circuits in windings, loosening of the core, overheat, breakdown of insulation, and no oil, which can significantly shorten the lifetime and operation of the transformer. The earlier faults are detected, the longer the fault-free operation and the better the maintenance can be guaranteed. A fault diagnosing system for transformers, that combines machine learning and vibration signal processing from multiple sensors is presented in this research. Vibration signal collected using an MPU6050 sensor and signal processing methods is conditioned finally to feature extraction for fault detection since faults are assumed to create quantifiable changes in vibrations. Additional information is obtained through the monitoring of voltage, current, temperature, and oil level sensor. The sensor data is classified into classes by the XGBoost algorithm, selected partly due to being multi-input, high-accuracy diagnosis algorithm for fault detection. This process detects normal functioning and fault conditions and produce predictive alerts."

Using AIS from Shanghai’s Wusongkou, we compare against cubic splines, Dijkstra, and BiLSTM/GRU. Across reconstruction error, path consistency, and efficiency, our method achieves lower error and higher consistency in most scenarios while outperforming other graph searches, making it practical for large-scale automated repair."

This study presents a methodological proposal for educational innovation that utilizes a Virtual Simulated Patient (PASIVI) enriched with the Body Interact simulator. A quantitative study with a quasiexperimental design with descriptive scope was carried out. The study encompasses two measurement points, designated as the pre and post-test, along with the implementation of PASIVI. Nineteen university students collaborated with the project. Before the intervention with PASIVI, students reported mediumhigh levels of disposition toward simulation, subjective norm, and engagement; after the intervention, the reported levels were higher. Although no statistically significant differences were found in most variables, differences were found in the dimensions of confidence (disposition) and academic (engagement). Likewise, it was found that disposition, engagement, and subjective norm are highly correlated and statistically significant. The findings indicate that PASIVI has had an impact on students’ confidence and academic commitment. Efforts are still needed on the part of faculty to systematize educational practices for learning clinical skills. The use of virtual patient scenarios offers a wide range of possibilities, but these must always be well designed through instructional designs"

This paper proposes an integrated web-based Faculty Appraisal System developed on the LAMP stack, with Python-powered analytics and visualization, thus enabling a role-based dashboard for students, faculty, HODs, HRM in-charges, principals, IQAC, and HR/COE, allowing multi-tier verification. The faculties submit their self-appraisal in academic mentorship (40%), research development (40%), and contribution activities (20%), and the students give structured feedback. This system adopts AHP to deduce weighted evaluation criteria in a structured method, thus ensuring consistent and structured scoring. Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) ranks faculty by comparing performances with ideal marks and hence guarantees fairness and objectivity. The proposed models have been integrated with Random Forest algorithms so as to enhance predictive accuracy and analyze historical data for classification, clustering, and performance prediction. EDA has been embedded to automate data cleaning, outlier detection, and visualization through bar and pie charts so that the reliability and transparency of data increase. An automated scoring engine assists growth-oriented decisions and incentive distribution, reduces bias, and enables real-time institutional analytics and adaptive policy refinement. Experimental deployment of the proposed system verifies its robustness in fostering a consistent data-driven process for faculty appraisals, which also points toward a roadmap for institutional excellence."

The proposed research is a Machine Learning-powered diagnostic prediction system based on algorithms employing genetic information, diagnostic imaging analysis, and patient records, all analyzed to predict the disease at an early stage using algorithms, including but not confined to Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, and deep learning models. Of these, Random Forest algorithm is unique in terms of its consistency, explainability, and maximum achievement in identifying the levels of diseases risk. Trained using labeled datasets and cross-validated to check generalizability, the predictive model is expected to provide useful insights into future application.

    "abstract": "With the ever-growing exponential rise in digital platforms, user registration credibility is a critical challenge to maintain. Fake users created with duplicated or manipulated textual information, such as names, emails, and identification numbers, have the potential to undermine the security and integrity of the platform. The current paper presents a strong fake user identification framework that incorporates the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js) stack for full-stack web development and the Billiards Optimized Depthwise Separable Convolutional Neural Network (DS-CNN-BilOA). It begins with a data capture module, where the user inputs structured textual information—such as name, email, telephone, and discretionary government ID—through a React-based front-end. The input from the user is validated and stored securely in MongoDB prior to the conversion to numerical vectors appropriate for deep learning. The vectors are passed through the Depthwise Separable Convolutional Neural Network (DS-CNN) model, which classifies users into learned registration patterns. With its minimized computational complexity in delivering model accuracy, it is the best choice in real-time usage. For further improvement in the detection performance, the Billiards Optimization Algorithm (BilOA) is employed for hyperparameter fine-tuning. Experimental results are presented, which validate that the proposed DS-CNN-BilOA model has superior performance with 99.21% classification accuracy, 98.97% precision, 99.06% recall, and 99.01% F1-score. Concurrently, this framework is an efficient, scalable solution to fake user identification based on the user input of textual data alone—biometric inputs unnecessary—appropriate for secure, responsive MERN-based platforms."

To address the challenges of complex path planning and stringent energy constraints in urban environments, this paper proposes a path optimization method based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Firstly, we formulate a path optimization objective function that incorporates energy constraints, including factors such as flight energy consumption. Secondly, by adding gating coefficients to each attention head to capture local features between nodes and employing gated connections to enhance the model’s focus on key features, we construct a path decision-making model that integrates energy constraints. Furthermore, to address the issue of the UAV being unable to complete deliveries due to limited endurance during task execution, we have designed a path optimization strategy based on a network of charging stations to ensure continuous task delivery. Experiments demonstrate that this method effectively solves the UAV path planning problem in the logistics field, significantly improving energy utilization efficiency while maintaining delivery timeliness."

    "abstract": "Running ML models in serverless environments is challenging due to memory, storage, and runtime limits. This type of limitation mainly affects the use of neural networks, since they usually require more resources than these environments offer by default. In this work, a solution based on the segmentation of the neural network model is proposed, dividing its architecture into different independent functions. This spreads the workload across separate functions, helping to adhere to constraints without losing accuracy or altering model behavior. From a set of experimental tests carried out in Azure Functions, it has been possible to verify that this modular strategy enables stable execution of neural networks, without errors related to resource limitations and with execution times comparable to traditional monolithic architectures. In summary, the results confirm that a Machine Learning model can be adapted to the serverless environment without relying on closed or high-cost solutions."

    "abstract": "Effective task scheduling in high-performance computing is challenging, particularly when distributing independent tasks across heterogeneous processors with varying capacities and execution times. Ensuring balanced load and minimizing makespan are critical. This paper analyzes and implements several heuristic algorithms Min-Min, Max-Min, Suffrage, List Suffrage, Priority-Based (PB), and Tenacious Priority-Based (TPB) to address these challenges. We propose a Modified Tenacious Priority-Based (MTPB) algorithm, benchmark against traditional heuristics using <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$512 \\times 16$</tex> and <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$1024 \\times 32$</tex> datasets. MTPB employs an iterative reassignment strategy with penalty-driven metrics to dynamically optimize task allocations, improving load balance and reducing execution time. Each algorithm considers processor workload, task priorities, and earliest completion times for efficient resource allocation. Experimental evaluation highlights robust scalability and superior makespan performance. Notably, MTPB consistently outperforms other heuristics, establishing itself as an effective solution for optimizing task scheduling in heterogeneous computing environments."

    "abstract": "Railway cargo transportation plays a pivotal role in the logistics industry, particularly in efficient transportation and warehouse management. However, current cargo grasping systems struggle to accurately identify and localize cargo in complex environments, particularly under high-density stacking or cluttered backgrounds. To address these issues, a robotic grasping framework for railway cargo, YOLOv8-SDA (SoftNMS and Deformable Attention), is proposed in this paper, based on an improved YOLOv8 model and depth map processing. The framework first employs the improved YOLO model to extract cargo features from RGB images, enabling identification and localization. Subsequently, a proposed depth map post-processing algorithm is integrated to denoise detection results, thereby improving localization precision. A dataset comprising 1,700 RGB images of cargo in multiple configurations was developed, featuring varying background complexities (simple, intermediate, and challenging) for robust model assessment. Experimental results demonstrate that the improved YOLOv8 model effectively handles railway cargo grasping tasks under high-density, multi-layered, and complex background conditions. Compared to baseline methods, the proposed framework exhibits stronger robustness and real-time performance, significantly improving recognition accuracy and grasping success rates."

Existing supervised and weakly supervised solutions often rely on extensive annotated datasets and high-capacity models, making them computationally intensive and less adaptable to real-world scenarios. In this work, we introduce a lightweight and unsupervised skeleton-based action localization pipeline that leverages spatio-temporal graph neural representations. Our approach pre-trains an Attention-based Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (ASTGCN) on a pose-sequence denoising task with blockwise partitions, enabling it to learn intrinsic motion dynamics without any manual labeling. At inference, we define a novel Action Dynamics Metric (ADM), computed directly from low-dimensional ASTGCN embeddings, which detects motion boundaries by identifying inflection points in its curvature profile. Our method achieves a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 82.66% and average localization latency of 29.09 ms on the DSV Diving dataset, matching state-of-the-art supervised performance while maintaining computational efficiency. Furthermore, it generalizes robustly to unseen, in-the-wild diving footage without retraining, demonstrating its practical applicability for lightweight, real-time action analysis systems in embedded or dynamic environments."

    "abstract": "Semantic communication for image transmission enhances efficiency by focusing on meaning rather than pixel accuracy. However, existing methods struggle to preserve semantic integrity due to challenges in identifying key content and contextual relationships. To address this, we propose a scalable semantic communication model that prioritizes object-based semantic extraction and dynamic weighting to enhance image representation. The framework detects and extracts objects within an image, assigning significance through a weight map that emphasizes key elements while de-emphasizing irrelevant details. The system dynamically adjusts weights in a weight map for scalable image transmission, adapting to network infrastructure constraints like bandwidth and latency. This ensures only the most relevant data is sent. The weighted semantic representation feeds into a diffusion-based reconstruction model, regenerating high-fidelity images at low bit rates. Experimental results show this approach significantly improves image representation while minimizing transmission overhead, scaling effectively with network conditions. The ability to adaptively control semantic granularity makes it ideal for real-world applications, paving the way for efficient, context-aware image transmission with improved resource utilization and semantic preservation."

    "abstract": "With the rise in complex and evolving cyber threats, the need for intelligent, responsive, and resilient intrusion detection systems has become paramount. Traditional security infrastructures often fall short in detecting real-time anomalies and responding swiftly to attacks. To address these critical challenges, we propose a Network-based Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) that integrates machine learning algorithms for real-time monitoring and protection of IT infrastructures. Our system is trained using the NF-UQ-NIDSv2 dataset, enabling the detection and classification of multiple threat vectors such as port scans, SSH brute force attempts, file integrity violations, and Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks. Our approach employs a Random Forest model to perform highaccuracy anomaly detection through continuous analysis of system logs and network traffic. Upon identifying a threat, the system autonomously blocks the malicious IP and generates detailed incident alerts for administrators. In addition to threat detection, the system provides robust defense mechanisms, including file integrity monitoring, real-time alert notifications, and user behavior analysis. This ensures not only rapid response but also comprehensive threat management across different layers of the system. Moreover, we implemented the architecture using Python with a modular structure to support scalability and adaptability across varied network environments. Emphasis is placed on automation and minimal manual intervention, ensuring the system can evolve by learning from newly encountered attack patterns. Through this, we aim to significantly enhance the cybersecurity landscape by providing a dynamic, self-learning, and efficient intrusion detection solution capable of defending against modern cyber threats. The inclusion of simulated scenarios for attacks and defenses-such as port scanning, DoS attacks, and file tampering-demonstrates the practical effectiveness and realworld relevance of our proposed framework."

    "abstract": "Security vulnerabilities in smart contracts pose a serious threat to the blockchain ecosystem. Traditional detection methods heavily rely on expert-defined rules, leading to issues such as high false positives, false negatives, and poor scalability. Although recent deep learning-based approaches have shown promise, most focus on a single code modality, which limits their ability to capture the multi-dimensional characteristics of complex vulnerabilities. To address these limitations, this paper proposes MCLF, a novel smart contract vulnerability detection framework based on multimodal feature fusion and contrastive learning. The approach simultaneously extracts a Data Flow Graph and code semantic sequences from smart contracts to capture structural dependencies and contextual semantic information, respectively. A dual-branch Transformer architecture is designed to encode each type of feature, while contrastive learning is applied to optimize vector space alignment and enhance intra-class consistency. A masked language modeling task is further incorporated to improve semantic reasoning through multi-task joint training. Finally, transfer learning is employed to fine-tune the model for downstream vulnerability classification. Experimental results on a public benchmark dataset demonstrate that the proposed method achieves precision, recall, and F1score of 91.90%, 92.53% and 92.21%, respectively, significantly outperforming the most advanced vulnerability detection tools and validating the effectiveness of multimodal feature fusion and the contrastive learning mechanism."

The dual-factors control system offers advanced automation and surpasses human reliance compared to legacy systems, and the system performs multitasking with improved efficiency. The system automation paradigm approaches edge cloud processing model of IoT, offering diverse automation in the RFIDs utilized.

However, in long-haul fiber links, polarization mode dispersion (PMD) induced by birefringence is susceptible to environmental perturbations such as temperature fluctuations and mechanical vibrations, potentially degrading the system’s long-term instability. To eliminate this limitation, we innovatively develope a theoretical model characterizing the non-reciprocal delay error introduced by the annoying PMD effect. Concurrently, we demonstrate a PMD suppression technique based on polarization scrambling. Experimental results confirm that polarization scrambling, implemented via data averaging effectively mitigates the system’s temperature dependence. More importantly, this approach significantly improves the long-term instability by half an order of magnitude. Our method paves the way for the practical implementation of large-scale networked optical frequency transfer system."

This paper presents cost and power modelling for pumped storage hydropower (PSH), as one of the potential storage systems that can be used in multi-vector energy systems. The PSH cost and power modelling are required to evaluate the cost, reliability and emission measures of the overall energy system which includes PSH. For cost modelling, this paper examines the relationship between PSH cost and power metrics, focusing on planned projects in the UK and Australia, revealing some useful insights that can be used for initial screening of potential projects. Comparisons are made with recently constructed PSH plants from around the world. Where published cost data was limited, a simplified cost calculator tool was used to model the cost metrics. The paper also presents power balance analysis equations which are needed for evaluating the reliability and emission of the overall energy system. These equations, implemented in MOHRES, predict, for each simulation time step, the state of charge of the upper and lower reservoirs, the pumps input power in case of excess renewable power and the turbines output power when the storage system is in use for generating electricity."

First, high-resolution RGB images of the PV plant are acquired using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). An adaptive sliding window cropping strategy is adopted to solve the problems of low small-target proportion and excessive GPU memory consumption in high-resolution images. Then, a YOLO11OBB rotated target detection model is used to achieve accurate identification of PV modules, outputting rotated bounding boxes containing module position, angle, and confidence. Finally, the number of modules is counted through post-processing steps such as rotated nonmaximum suppression (NMS) and size filtering, and the total installed capacity of the plant is calculated by combining the rated power of a single module. Experiments were conducted on four typical PV scenarios. The results show that the proposed method achieves an average module counting accuracy of 99.61% and a capacity calculation error less than 0.39%.

However, these improvements have also increased the danger zone by making connected cars more vulnerable to sophisticated cyberattacks like Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) assaults. This paper presents a vehicular network DDoS defender framework. The key purpose of the proposed framework is to efficiently detect DDoS attacks in a vehicular network and timely protect the ecosystems that can target automobiles. We applied different machine learning techniques using the most up-to-date information and benchmarks for the Internet of Vehicles. We trained and tested five commonly used machine learning (ML) algorithms over CICIoV2024 dataset among which the support vector machine (SVM) classifier outperformed all other ML algorithms with $\\mathbf{9 8. 2 \\%}$ accuracy, $\\mathbf{9 7 \\%} \\mathbf{F 1}$-score, $\\mathbf{9 8 \\%}$ AUC ROC and $\\mathbf{1. 8 m s}$ inference latency. This experimental results indicates that the proposed framework can accurately locate and react to vehicular network attacks that happen in real life."

    "abstract": "The dynamic nature of the digital economy has brought about digital skills and adaptive capabilities as key people in determining a prosperous career especially among female IT practitioners. Current methods usually boil down to using traditional talent-fit algorithms and competency analysis methodologies, which, in many cases, tend to undermine gendered discrepancies in the availability of digital training and the problem of career development patterns. To fill these cracks, this paper presents a two-algorithmic model that combines skill profiling and a dynamic competency development. The first algorithm, DigiBloom Mapper, gathers and parses open-access career path data on the Women in Tech Global Dataset that already exists (WITGD) to build a high-resolution profile of women professionals with respect to digital skills. The former output of this system is directly fed into the second algorithm EvoPath Optimizer that dynamically simulates adaptive competencies; resilience, problem solving and innovation capacity and prescribes individualized career growth pathways. WITGD experimental evaluation shows that two-stage process improves the accuracy of prediction of career advancement potential and creates a more equitable, data-driven process of supporting women in the IT career, compared to baseline models, performing higher in adaptability scoring and the prediction of career mobility."

A systematic design methodology is followed, integrating stability engineering, loadpull analysis, and distributed-element matching networks. The low-pass filter (LPF)-based output matching network ensures both optimum fundamental impedance matching and strong suppression of the second harmonic. Obtained results demonstrate a broadband drain efficiency ranging from 56% to 70%, a nearly flat saturated output power of 39.3-41.4 dBm, and a stable gain between 8.3-10.4 dB across the band. These results confirm the effectiveness of the LPF-based topology as a practical solution for next-generation broadband wireless communication systems."

    "abstract": "Accurate estimation of leaf traits is critical for evaluating ecosystem functions and elucidating vegetation–environment interactions. Hyperspectral remote sensing provides a non-destructive and information-rich means for trait analysis, yet its potential remains constrained by the scarcity of labeled data and the limited generalizability of existing learning methods. To overcome these challenges, we propose the Spectral Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (S-JEPA), a self-supervised learning framework designed to learn generalizable spectral features by predicting target-region representations from contextual spectral information. Utilizing the largest unlabeled hyperspectral dataset to date, comprising nearly 100,000 samples, S-JEPA enables accurate trait estimation with minimal labeled data. Across six representative leaf traits, S-JEPA achieved an average R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> of 0.784, substantially exceeding conventional supervised, transfer-learning, and multi-task learning models, and also surpassing another self-supervised baseline, S-MAE, by a small margin. Furthermore, S-JEPA demonstrate superior robustness especially in data-scarce scenarios, efficiently tackling a longstanding field challenge. The learned spectral features revealed coherent inter-trait associations aligned with known physiological linkages, demonstrating that S-JEPA captures biologically meaningful structures rather than statistical artifacts. This study highlights the efficacy of SSL in extracting generalizable spectral features and establishes a scalable framework for multi-trait estimation and ecosystem monitoring."

    "source": "IEEE",
    "abstract": "Recent advances in self-supervised image denoising have highlighted the potential of Blind-Spot Networks (BSNs). However, existing methods suffer from three major limitations: (1) Their effectiveness in real-world scenarios is limited by strong assumptions, such as noise independence, which rarely hold in practice. (2) While sampling-based strategies can partially improve performance, BSNs inherently suffer from information loss caused by centroid masking, and removing the blind spot leads to noise overfitting, both of which hinder denoising performance. (3) Sampling-based methods often introduce checkerboard artifacts, yet existing studies typically overlook the fundamental differences between these artifacts and real noise. To address these issues, we propose a novel self-supervised denoising framework, Dual Double-Sampling with Random Sub-samples Generation (D2S-RSG-SSD). To address Limitation 1, we introduce a sampling-based framework that breaks noise dependence by combining Random Sub-samples Generation (RSG) with a cross-paired loss <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\mathcal {L}_{RSG}$</tex-math></inline-formula>. RSG generates diverse sub-samples with inherent variance, referred to as sampling differences, which serve as natural perturbations to augment training data and disrupt spatial noise correlations. The proposed loss function ensures full utilization of these sub-samples while stabilizing optimization. To address Limitation 2, we propose a Dual Double-Sampling (D2S) strategy with fixed sampling patterns and a dual-branch architecture. This design reduces reliance on pixel-level information and leverages complementary features to mitigate both noise overfitting and information loss. A key advantage is its compatibility with various advanced denoising networks, lifting the constraint of using BSNs in self-supervised settings. Additionally, we introduce a fixed sub-image sampling strategy to prevent pattern collapse during inference and ensure stability. To address Limitation 3, we explicitly differentiate checkerboard artifacts from real noise and develop a dedicated artifact remover to correct pixel discontinuities caused by sampling-based operations. This design preserves fine image details while reducing over-smoothing. Experiments on benchmark real-noise datasets and self-captured noisy images demonstrate the robustness and generalizability of our framework, achieving better performance over existing methods."

Existing solutions typically compromise privacy safeguards, computational practicality, or communication efficiency. We propose an edge computing-based FL framework that successfully balances these essential requirements concerning privacy protection, poisoning attack resistance, and communication efficiency by integrating three key innovations. First, gradient sign conversion combined with super-increasing sequence compression achieves lossless dimensionality reduction, enabling communication overhead reduction while preserving homomorphic computation capabilities. Second, a user-side duallayer masking mechanism implements privacy protection before gradient transmission. Third, a poisoning-defense strategy leverages the intrinsic properties of gradient signs to defend poisoning attacks across both IID and non-IID data distributions. Security analysis confirms effective protection against privacy leakage throughout the learning process. Experimental evaluations on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets under varying poisoning attack intensities demonstrate sustained model accuracy exceeding 90% across all attack scenarios. Compared to existing works, our approach reduces communication overheads up to 94.6%, 55% and 80.3% on the user, aggregator and cloud sides, respectively."

The proposed approach enables accurate cost-performance decisions with traceability, optimizing laboratory testing, and operating within feasible windows. The approach integrates synthetic data generation under technological and process constraints, utilizing multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural metamodels for <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">toilet soap</i> and <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">laundry soap</i>. Validation is performed using correlation analysis, residual analysis, response surfaces, and local sensitivity maps. The four models (corresponding to the property and cost networks for each scenario) converge stably, reproduce experimental trends with minimal bias, maintain mean errors below 1%, and generalize well within the scope of the analyzed formulation. The MP response surfaces reveal a high plateau toward higher solid fractions (RBD palm/stearin) and a depression with increasing palm kernel olein. Sensitivity maps confirm that olein governs C12:0 (lauric acid), while palm stearin dominates C16:0/C18:0 (palmitic acid/stearic acid) and increases the MP, with olein exerting a lowering effect on this property. These findings translate into concrete lines of action in formulations, including anchoring operations on plateaus to gain tolerance to variability, applying stricter olein control in <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">laundry soap</i>, and leveraging flat cost gradient zones to arbitrate raw materials without compromising performance.

    "abstract": "Diabetic Retinopathy is one of the major cause of vision impairment around the world, yet its impact can be significantly reduced through early detection and timely intervention. Previous screening techniques were dependent on manual detection, which consumed a lot of time and often provided inconsistent results. However, the successful developments in the area of Deep Learning have facilitated the automated and large-scale analysis of the retinal image with better performance. Irrespective of such developments, the use of explainable AI in many studies has received limited attention. This work, provides an extensive analysis of several deep learning models like ResNet18, EfficientNetB0, DenseNet121 and MobileNetV2 for multiclass diabetic retinopathy classification, using a unified training framework with SMOTE-based class balancing to address severe data imbalance. In addition to individual models, both hard and soft voting ensemble strategies, as well as a feature-level hybrid architecture combining EfficientNetB0 and DenseNet121, were systematically evaluated. The proposed hybrid model achieved an accuracy of 84.02%, while ensemble learning attained the highest overall accuracy of 85.29%, demonstrating improved robustness and balanced performance across severity levels. Model performance was comprehensively evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and class-wise ROC-AUC metrics, with per-class AUC values exceeding 0.90 for multiple severity stages. Particularly, model interpretability is introduced with the help of Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping(Grad-CAM), where visualization in the form of heatmaps of clinically relevant retinal regions is offered. To move beyond purely qualitative analysis, a quantitative Grad-CAM concentration score was employed, demonstrating more spatially localized and diagnostically focused attention in individual and hybrid model representations. Hence, the results indicate that incorporating complementary convolutional neural network architectures, together with ensemble learning and quantitative explainability, yields a more robust, interpretable, and clinically relevant diabetic retinopathy screening framework."

    "abstract": "Accurate cascaded channel state information is pivotal for unlocking the transformative capabilities of extremely large-scale intelligent reflecting surfaces (XL-IRS) in next-generation wireless networks. However, the expansive aperture of XL-IRSs induces spherical wavefront propagation due to near-field (NF) effects, complicating cascaded channel estimation. Conventional dictionary-based methods suffer from cumulative quantization errors and prohibitive computational complexity, particularly in practical uniform planar array (UPA)-structured array systems. To overcome these issues, we firstly propose a tensor modelization method for NF cascaded channels by exploiting the tensor product among the horizontal and vertical response vectors of the UPA-structured base station (BS) and the incident-reflective array response vector of the IRS. This tensor structure leverages the spatial characteristics of cascade channel, enabling independent estimation of the factor matrices to improve channel estimation efficiency. Meanwhile, to avoid quantization errors, we propose an off-grid cascaded channel estimation framework based on sparse Tucker decomposition. Specifically, we model the received signal as a Tucker tensor, where the sparse core tensor captures path gain-delay terms and three factor dictionary matrices are spanned by the BS array responses and the NF IRS array responses. Then, we formulate a sparse core tensor minimization problem with tri-modal logsum sparsity constraints to tackle the NP-hard challenge. Finally, the estimation method is further accelerated through higher-order singular value decomposition preprocessing, combined with the majorization-minimization strategy and a tailored tensor over-relaxation fast iterative shrinkage-thresholding technique. To evaluate the proposed algorithm, we derive the Cramér-Rao lower bound and conduct the convergence analysis. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves an 13.6 dB improvement in terms of the normalized mean square error compared to benchmark methods with significantly reduced runtime."

Aligned with the energy transition strategy to decarbonise the island by 2040, this study focuses on transforming El Pinar’s energy system to a more sustainable model. The studied energy transition scenario in this paper aims to replace the diesel generation that currently supplies 58% of El Hierro's electricity with a system that leverages the abundant local wind and solar resources. Formulating the energy transition problem at hand and employing the design optimisation software MOHRES, the optimum HRES is obtained. The optimum Wind-PV-Battery solution requires an initial investment of 1.64 m$. It produces electricity 60% cheaper than the current prices and has an annual fuel saving of 16.66 m$, leading to a net present value of 162.40 m$ over the 25-year lifespan of the system."

    "abstract": "WBANs have advanced into efficient opportunities for several healthcare, sports, etc., uses. The examination introduced a method for considering efficient information gathering from individual and predictable networks. Energy consumption (EC) is the main reason in WBANs, especially in implantable sensor nodes (SNs), which are limited in energy and capacity. Several routing method data gathering approaches are discussed to transmit the data from the human body sensor nodes (SN) to the server base station (BS). This research article will define an optimized energy-efficient routing method, and it implements the existing ABC-CSO method to create a crossbreed method for data aggregation in the WBAN. The existing implemented ABC-CSO method has different steps: (i) clustering, (ii) cluster head (Ch) selection, and (iii) data broadcast. It classifies the sensor nodes into clusters and utilizes the ABC approach to select the finest Ch for each cluster. Each node transmits information to its consistent node or channel. Generally, CSO is utilized to encrypt the data packets to the BS. The planned optimized EE routing method reduces EC and handles the energy required by several biosensor nodes. In the future, the experimental outcomes will determine whether the planned optimized EE routing method can manage the WBAN framework while handling the energy and reliability of the network. The implemented existing works simulate a variety of cases to define the superiority of the existing suggested methods, ABCCSO and ABC protocols. The comparison was done with the ABC and ABC -CSO models."

    "abstract": "In every automation industry, pneumatic systems are essential. Energy loss and decreased efficiency can be caused by even a small air leak or an unanticipated increase in pressure. Additionally, there is needless machine downtime. In light of this, we created a Pneumatic Air Leakage Detection and Alert System to monitor air pressure continuously. The operation is safe and dependable because the system uses a rectifier circuit and a step-down transformer to obtain steady DC power. Together, the sound and pressure sensors keep an eye on the pneumatic line. The information is handled by a microcontroller, and the LCDs display the pneumatic line's current pressure in real time. Through the GSM module, the system will instantly generate an alert message with information about the department name, machine number, and fault status if any abnormal condition—such as high pressure or air leakage—occurs. When leakage is detected, the buzzer will sound. As a result, maintenance staff can react right away to avoid damage to the machine. The general method is easy to use, reasonably priced, and appropriate for industrial applications requiring prompt fault detection and preventive maintenance."

While these may be usual events, they tend to be inadequately monitored, which could culminate in maternal anxiety and, if inadequately treated, problems for health. This project offers the possibility of an intelligent surveillance system for the early identification and control of oedema-induced pain in the legs of pregnant women.It utilizes sensors to take measurements of leg circumference, pressure, and temperature to detect unusual swelling patterns in real-time. The information obtained would be processed in a way that would help define the severity of the oedema and give prompt recommendations. The system leverages technology in women's health care to make it comfortable, avoid complications, and facilitate early interventions to result in improved maternal health during pregnancy and also the proposed work aligns with the SDG 3 goal of well-being and good health,contributing to better maternal monitoring and healthcare outcomes."

    "abstract": "Hadoop is a widely adopted distributed computing framework that enables large-scale parallel processing through MapReduce and relies on the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) for scalable and fault-tolerant storage. Despite its effectiveness for big data workloads, securing Hadoop environments remains a critical challenge, particularly with respect to authorization, due to system heterogeneity, unresolved vulnerabilities, and both accidental and malicious user behaviors. Traditional policy-based models, such as RBAC and ABAC, provide structured access control but remain inherently static, lacking adaptability and proactive anomaly detection. Behavior-based approaches can partially mitigate these limitations; however, they often introduce additional complexity into the authorization process. By exploiting the adaptive neighborhood selection and weighting capabilities of Graph Attention Networks (GATs), the authorization process in Hadoop can be enhanced by prioritizing the most influential relationships among users, roles, and resources. This capability enables more accurate detection of unauthorized access while alleviating the limitations of static, policy-driven models. Building on this insight, we propose the Authorization-based Heterogeneous Graph Attention Network (AHGAT), a novel learning-based framework that models the authorization landscape as a heterogeneous graph. Its architecture combines a decision network, which identifies the most relevant neighborhood type, with a representation network that refines node embeddings accordingly. To evaluate the performance of AHGAT, experiments were conducted on a custom Hadoop log dataset. The results demonstrate that AHGAT can outperform conventional graph-based learning models, including GAT and GCN, across multiple metrics such as accuracy, precision, F1-score, and ROC-AUC. Furthermore, we assess its adversarial robustness using the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM). The findings show that AHGAT can maintain stable performance under adversarial attacks."

An excellent design of the reward function can guide the agents of DRL to achieve rapid learning. Therefore, in combination with the SDM-EON scenario characteristic, we propose a Multi-link Fragmentation-aware and Inter-core Crosstalk-aware DRL-based RMSCA Algorithm (MIDRL-RMSCA). In MIDRL-RMSCA, a network fragmentation metric based on multiple links is introduced to measure the distribution of global spectrum resources. Furthermore, for the SDM-EON scenario, the inter-core resource adjacency degree is introduced to achieve space-frequency joint resource perception. Simulation results show that our algorithm outperforms reference algorithms in both blocking rate and spectrum resource utilization. Specifically, it achieves blocking rate reductions of 24.85% and 28.01%, as well as resource utilization improvements of 17.66% and 19.05%, in the NSFNET and Cost- 239 networks, respectively."

Unlike transmission systems, distribution grids operate at lower voltages and exhibit weaker grid strength, making them more vulnerable to harmonic resonance and power quality issues. While most existing studies focus solely on harmonics generated by PV inverters, limited attention has been given to the interaction of PV induced harmonics with other nonlinear loads present in industrial grids. This paper addresses this research gap by conducting a harmonic analysis of PV integration in an industrial distribution network with multiple harmonic sources. Furthermore, mitigation techniques are reviewed, and appropriately designed passive double tuned LCL filters are applied to the network model. Simulation-based case studies are performed to validate the effectiveness of these solutions. The findings provide practical insights for improving power quality and support future planning of large-scale PV integration in New Zealand."

This study investigates whether models trained on early vital signs and demographics can generalize to external datasets. Using the MIMIC-IV database, we engineered 61 features from seven vital signs and three demographic variables, capturing descriptive statistics and temporal trends within the first 24 hours of ICU admission. We trained four ensemble models (Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost) to predict mortality at 1-day, 7-day, and 30-day horizons. On internal validation, all models showed strong discriminative performance (AUROC $\\boldsymbol{\\gt } \\mathbf{0. 8 0}$ for $\\mathbf{3 0}$-day mortality). To assess generalizability, the best model, CatBoost, was externally validated on the multicenter eICU database. The model maintained a stable discriminative ability, achieving a comparable AUROC of 0.7955 for 30 -day mortality, confirming its robustness. However, a drop in classification metrics (F1-Score) was observed, indicating a need for site-specific calibration before clinical deployment. Feature importance analysis highlighted physiological variability (e.g., SpO<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</inf> std, SBP min) as key predictors.

On a balanced WEATHER dataset we observe stable optimization, discriminative attention focusing on sky/planar regions where meteorological phenomena manifest, and consistent accuracy gains when combining spectral cues with self-distillation. Confusion analysis highlights the expected ambiguity between haze and cloudy, while snow and thunder remain distinctive due to their high-frequency signatures. Ablations show complementary benefits—spectral stems improve frequency selectivity; self-distillation improves calibration—with stronger improvements on deeper backbones, supporting deployment on edge inspection units."

Deep learning neural networks can learn phase unwrapping operations from large-scale phase data, accurately extracting the phase distribution of interferograms, while can balance both phase unwrapping accuracy and efficiency of phase unwrapping to a certain extent. This paper proposes a deep learning phase unwrapping method based on CBUNet. First, the model combines a global attention upsampling mechanism with a salient feature fusion module to effectively bridge the semantic gap between high-level and low-level features, enhancing the fusion capability of hierarchical information. Second, through channel and spatial attention downsampling mechanisms, it adjusts the weights of channels and spatial positions to precisely extract key features. Finally, it employs a channel residual convolution structure to capture dynamic dependencies between channels, strengthening the representational capability of interferogram features. The results demonstrate that the CBUNet can more effectively balance accuracy and efficiency, yielding robust results in phase unwrapping experiments."

However, while many implementations are software-based and can deliver on the performance, most implementations struggle to provide the required energy efficiency in moving video scenarios. In this work, demonstrated an example of a custom VLSI framework for real-time background adaptation that achieves performance throughputs, latency, and extensibility using minimum hardware resources. The proposed design has a parallelized adaptive background modeling unit with a hardware-compressed update mechanism to accurately perform background modeling on a foreground object in a complex and dynamic environment. However, accounting for illumination variation, motion blur, and background evolution requires a light-weight adaptive thresholding method combined with morphological filtering modules. The framework was developed and implemented on an FPGA, and then synthesized for ASIC purposes, but allows for real-time processing at full-HD resolution, optimally using less memory and performing at lower power levels than existing hardware and software implementations. Evaluation of the method has been performed, through extensive experimentation, with real-time detection demonstrating significantly improved detection accuracy, and resource utilization compared to existing processes, including but not limited to a reduction of latency up to XX% and energy utilized up to YY% in comparison to our conventional designs. This means advancing the use of custom VLSI methods will continue to provide the frameworks required to realize real-time intelligent video analytics, paving the way forward toward uses of intelligent video analytics in surveillance, autonomous analytics, and edge-based vision applications."

Input features consisted of 22 behavioral attributes representing access frequency and duration, while the output comprised five dominant intelligence types derived from the Multiple Intelligences Inventory. To address data imbalance and feature redundancy, the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) and Sequential Floating Forward Selection (SFFS) were applied, respectively. Six classifiers-Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression (LogR), Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting (GB), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN)-were evaluated using 5-fold cross-validation. SVM achieved the highest performance with an accuracy of 83.33% and $F 1$-score of 82%. Integrating SMOTE and SFFS significantly enhanced classification results, contributing to more accurate and scalable adaptive learning systems grounded in multiple intelligences theory."

The system is designed to offer audio-based feedback along with theoretical programming concepts, ensuring that visually impaired learners can access and interact with coding environments independently.

It achieved 92% accuracy and 90% precision for Python code detection and 82% accuracy and 80% precision for HTML code detection. These results demonstrate the platform’s reliability and its potential to enhance programming accessibility. By combining NLP-based code analysis with audio-assisted learning, the platform empowers visually impaired students to navigate programming concepts confidently and participate fully in IT education. Furthermore, the platform’s adaptability allows it to support various programming languages, offering flexibility for students to explore diverse coding environments.

Appropriate grading is necessary to ascertain whether dried coconuts are appropriate for specific uses, such as oil extraction, desiccation, or other by-products. These days, grading is usually done by hand, which leads to mistakes, inefficiencies, and irregularities. Advancements in deep learning and computer vision offer an opportunity to automate and improve the grading process. This work focuses on classifying dried coconuts into three grades (A, B, and C) using deep learning techniques. Traditional manual grading methods are time-consuming, inconsistent, and prone to human error, resulting in inefficiencies and variations in product quality. The system uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to analyze visual features such as texture, color, and shape, ensuring accurate and reliable classification. This approach improves grading efficiency, provides consistent results, and reduces reliance on manual labor, offering a scalable and efficient solution for the coconut processing industry to enhance productivity and quality control."

Bloom’s Taxonomy breaks learning objectives into six levels -they are Remembering, Understanding, Applying, Analyzing, Evaluating, and Creating - helping educators design balanced exams that test a full range of skills, from simple recall to critical thinking and creativity. Traditionally, classifying questions into these levels has been a manual and often subjective task. To address this, our approach uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning, combining the strengths of BERT, a transformed based model known for capturing context and contextual nuances of exam questions for cognitive-level classification. For benchmarking, traditional machine learning algorithms are also implemented for comparison. By integrating these models into an ensemble framework, the system processes the questions through steps such as text cleaning, tokenization and embedding generation before reaching a consensus-based classification. Testing shows that Transformer models clearly outperform traditional approaches, while the ensemble method improves stability. Beyond accuracy, this work can support automated exam paper design, curriculum alignment and adaptive testing that adjusts difficulty while keeping cognitive balance."

To address these concerns, this paper investigates the adoption of Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) within Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) frameworks, emphasizing its role in strengthening electronic signature (eSign) systems against quantum threats. Traditional PKI implementations rely on algorithms such as RSA and ECC in combination with Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) for secure key management; however, these methods are vulnerable to quantum algorithms like Shor's. We examine how quantum-resistant alternatives-including lattice-based, hash-based, and multivariate polynomial-based schemes standardized by NIST-can be integrated into PKI without compromising interoperability and compliance. A comparative evaluation highlights trade-offs in performance, storage, and computational complexity while demonstrating the feasibility of embedding PQC into existing eSign infrastructures.

    "abstract": "Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a complication of diabetes that threatens vision and requires timely and accurate diagnosis. Traditional deep learning (DL) approaches to DR diagnosis have limitations related to poor generalization, ineffective preprocessing, and high computational costs; therefore, a hybrid deep learning framework called Multi-Scale Attention driven ResNest-CapsNet is proposed to improve the accuracy and efficiency of diabetic retinopathy (DR) diagnosis. Preprocessing was performed, starting from standard approaches such as Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE), green channel extraction, median filtering, and Gaussian smoothing, which are recommended for removing artifacts from diabetic retinal images and normalizing illumination. After preprocessing, the features of different scales were extracted using the ResNest architecture, which comprises split-attention blocks, to obtain fine-grained features and multi-resolution features of the retina. These features are extracted from different ResNest layers and combined together by weighted combinations to contextualize the information. The extracted features are sent to the Capsule Network (CapsNet) which maintains the spatial relationship between features, through the use of dynamic routing and squash activation functions. This assists in accurately classifying healthy and every stage of DR, including learning part-to-whole relationships. The model is trained and assessed on benchmark datasets, APTOS 2019 and Kaggle EyePACS, with the following metrics: accuracy, F1-score, AUC, and inference time. The proposed model significantly outperforms the standard CNN-based methods like VGG16, ResNet-50, DenseNet-121 in classification accuracy and computational efficiency."

First-year computer science students were divided into an AI-assisted group and a traditional group. After a guided reading phase, both groups completed a closed-book test evaluating four learning dimensions: syntax comprehension, logical reasoning, creative design, and error detection. Results show the AI group significantly outperformed the traditional group in syntax, creativity, and debugging, though no notable difference was found in logical reasoning. Survey responses revealed positive perceptions of AI’s usefulness, alongside a growing trend of frequent reliance on such tools.

A dual-attention approach dynamically adjusts the significance of influential neighbors and historical time intervals. To improve precision, we include external covariates such as weather conditions, holidays, and seasonal influences. Additionally, we utilize Quantum-behaved Particle Swarm Optimization (QPSO) to facilitate the automation of hyperparameter tuning. Although the model is trained on a recent subset (January-March 2023) for computational feasibility, it leverages the full 2001-2023 dataset for graph construction, seasonal pattern extraction, and feature enrichment. DA-GNN consistently outperforms classical baselines (ARIMA, random forests), deep learning models (LSTM, CNNLSTM), and prior GNN-based approaches. Finally, the model produces interpretable attention maps and district-level risk visualizations, supporting ethical deployment and data-driven patrol strategy design."

With the use of sensors and communication technologies, human movements can be captured to create interactive interfaces that support man-machine collaboration. However, incorporating intelligent computing for enhanced scene comprehension remains a largely underexplored area. In this paper, we propose a novel methodology aimed at enabling machines to better understand human behavior in indoor environments.

By designing thermal, Kinetic energy-based features and SIFT algorithms with individual, local and global centroids combined with a Markov model, we evaluate our system’s performance against other state-of-the-art classifiers. Experimental results with mean recognition accuracy of $87.73 \\%$ demonstrate that our approach is robust in complex, real-world scenarios, making it suitable for applications in security systems, smart surveillance, violence detection, and child abuse prevention."

    "abstract": "Video anomaly detection methods encounter significant challenges in dynamic and complex scenarios, particularly significant interference from irrelevant information and insufficient perception of subtle anomalies caused by the loss of deep feature details. To tackle these issues, this paper proposes a Dual-Branch Feature Refinement Unit (DBFRU), which synergistically optimizes channel and spatial attention mechanisms to enhance the model’s capability for unified perception of channel and spatial semantics, effectively suppressing redundant information interference. Additionally, this paper introduces a Multi-Scale Dilated Dense Block (MDDB), which deepens the fusion of multi-scale contextual information while preserving feature map dimensions, thus improving feature representation and mitigating detail loss. Evaluations on the UCSD Ped2 and CUHK Avenue datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of frame-level AUC, with outstanding results of 97.9% and 86.8%, respectively, significantly outperforming most existing methods. Ablation studies further confirm that the DBFRU and MDDB modules exhibit complementary effects, working together to enhance the model's performance in localizing fine-grained anomalies."

    "abstract": "Since the communications network often adopts advanced communications systems, channel noise, jamming or badwill attacks from the hackers may be very capable of affecting the network; modelling communication channel systems may be very important for soner to correctly transfer data. Therefore, in this paper, an online dynamic adaptation mechanism based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and deep reinforcement learning based on deep q-network model (DQN) for an error correction scheme (DRL-ECMS). Therefore, to control the problem, the proposed system simulates the transmission channel into a DRL learning environment, which can be used to learn what does the agent need to do to make a wise transmission channel to mitigate transmission errors, while enhancing data integrity and transmission throughput. Deep learning models are implemented using the next generation cutting edge Pytorch framework, which is the leading development framework for neural architecture design and training model in GPU accelerated environment. Intensive experiments are performed to showcase the breadth of the proposed DRL-based scheme while successfully overcoming the erroneous bit-rates that are beyond any traditional Hamming coding & LDPC code with high tolerance to intrusional attacks & malicious interferences. This project will bring about a paradigm shift in smart self adaptive communications systems while providing reliability and security to the next generation networks."

    "abstract": "Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly integral to safety-critical applications, yet their reliance on large, uncurated datasets makes them vulnerable to backdoor poisoning attacks. Detecting such attacks is a formidable challenge, particularly when trigger patterns are unknown and no trusted clean data is available. This paper introduces a robust, two-phase hybrid system for high-fidelity backdoor detection and forensic analysis. The first phase employs an assumption-free screening method that constructs a hybrid feature vector from a deep autoencoder’s reconstruction error and hand-crafted visual features, enabling robust anomaly detection without clean data. In the second phase, samples flagged as anomalous undergo high-confidence verification using a pre-trained Vision-Language Model (VLM). We employ gradient-based saliency analysis, backpropagating from a malicious prompt’s logit score to the input pixels, to generate attribution maps that spatially localize the trigger, providing interpretable, visual evidence of the attack. Our integrated pipeline offers a scalable and effective solution, balancing broad-spectrum detection with rapid, explainable forensic analysis to enhance VLM security."

An effective solution lies in leveraging classical computing resources and algorithms to compress quantum circuits into a depth that can be efficiently handled by quantum hardware. Herein, we propose a learning-based approach that employs an autoregressive model to achieve efficient learning of Hermitian operators. Specifically, we decompose the Hermitian operator into a linear combination of Pauli strings and parameterize the combination coefficients via an autoregressive neural network (ARNN). Through training the ARNN on a randomly sampled dataset, we enable it to learn such Hermitian operators. Numerical experiments validate that our method can approximate the target Hermitian operator with high precision, thereby facilitating efficient compression of quantum circuits."

Its accuracy and reliability directly affect the development of cryogenic and related fields. This paper addresses the problems of high cost, long performance testing cycles, and narrow calibration range of existing cryogenic sensors by building an integrated cryogenic sensor calibration platform and a rapid thermal cycling test platform. A comprehensive evaluation of the temperature control accuracy and repeatability of the self-developed sensor was conducted to ensure its high accuracy and repeatability. Preliminary tests show that the sensor calibration platform can cover a wide temperature range of 2.7K ~ 325 K, with temperature fluctuations in the liquid helium range suppressed to within ± 7 mK. Calibration using diode-type and resistive sensors yielded excellent accuracy in the cryogenic region, as reflected in the calibration and fitting results. Thermal cycling tests were conducted using the thermal cycling test platform from 4.2 K to 300 K. The sensor's standard deviation was only 0.003 K, the coefficient of variation was 0.07%, and the temperature change across cycles was less than 0.002 K, demonstrating excellent repeatability. During 40 thermal cycling tests, the temperature curve remained largely consistent with that of the standard sensor, demonstrating excellent stability. The aforementioned testing platform and methods can effectively test the accuracy and repeatability of cryogenic sensors, providing technical support for the development of quantum computing, cryogenic superconductivity and aerospace exploration in the field of cryogenics."

    "abstract": "Conventional threshing systems are mostly crop-specific, fossil fuel-driven, and their costs of operation are very high, which renders their use uneconomical to smallholder farmers. The study shows the design and building construction of a multi crop solar-powered thresher with a smart efficiency monitoring system. This is a system that has used a brushless DC motor of 750W operated by a 1kW solar PV and a 1.5kWh lithium-ion battery bank. Swappable threshing drums and variable concave set-ups would be created to handle crops such as wheat, rice and maize. A monitoring module based on ESP32 stores real-time information such as throughput, drum RPM value, and energy consumption. Field tests revealed that the machine had an average threshing efficiency of 93 percent and cleaning efficiency of 88 percent with an energy requirement of 0.35 Kilowatt per hundred kilograms of the processed crop. The prototype lowered the cost of energy by about 60 percent and CO 2 emissions by 100 percent as compared to a conventional diesel thresher. These findings show the prospect of the system to provide a low cost and environmentally friendly method to decentralized and multi-crop threshing in the farms."

An agentic AI-based system for early detection and management of diabetic nephropathy is a predictive modeling with integrated healthcare services. Machine learning algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost, trained on diabetes and chronic kidney disease data, predict nephropathy risk as Low, Medium, or High based on parameters like age, blood pressure, HbA1c, creatinine, BMI, and cholesterol. Novel aspects include detection of prescription error for dosage and drug interactions, physician recommendations via geolocation services, and integration with pharmacies for ordering and delivery of medicines. The system ensures precise risk prediction, alerts for unusual values, and enhanced patient convenience.

This study proposes a deep learning-based framework for automatic plant disease detection and pesticide recommendation using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model is trained and evaluated on the publicly available PlantVillage dataset, which contains diverse leaf images affected by multiple crop diseases. The proposed CNN architecture effectively extracts hierarchical features and achieves superior classification performance compared to the traditional machine learning techniques. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the CNN model attains an accuracy of $98.8 \\%$, outperforming Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) classifiers, which exhibit lower accuracy due to their limited feature extraction capabilities. Based on the predicted disease class, the system further recommends suitable chemical or biological pesticides aligned with standard agricultural guidelines, ensuring practical utility for farmers and agronomists. The results confirm that deep learning-driven disease identification combined with automated pesticide recommendation offers a reliable and efficient decision-support system for precision agriculture."

In this work, we propose a diffusion model-based network for underwater image enhancement, which exploits the intrinsic reconstruction capabilities of diffusion processes to restore distorted inputs. To mitigate the high computational cost, prolonged inference time, and potential instability associated with conventional diffusion models, we introduce a conditional diffusion framework grounded in discrete wavelet transforms. This design enables us to maintain high restoration fidelity while substantially reducing computational overhead. Moreover, our training regime incorporates both forward diffusion and denoising steps to further constrain randomness and improve convergence. To specifically address the unique artifacts encountered in underwater scenes, we integrate a deep learning-driven channel attention module that adaptively refines feature representations, leading to enhanced image clarity, contrast, and color consistency. Extensive experiments on publicly available underwater enhancement benchmarks demonstrate that our approach outperforms both classical algorithms and contemporary deep learning methods across multiple quantitative metrics."

    "abstract": "As the volume of data exchanged is growing and the number of remote workers is also rising, the need for reliable and secure remote access solutions becomes much more critical in the IT domain. This research work presents a model for secure remote access by integrating a scalable VPN infrastructure with a machine learning-based Intrusion Detection System employing the Random Forest algorithm. The framework has been built in such a way that it can identify and block the access attempts made illegally in real time and thus ensure remote users an uninterrupted and secure network. The basic structure is not only supportive of scaling that is ultimately utilized to handle the various loads but is also highly intelligent that it adapts to new and changing attack patterns by continuously learning. The distinctiveness of this innovation comes from the fact that the Random Forest algorithm is seamlessly fused with the VPN structure to achieve the required level of security. The proposed method relies on the use of the Random Forest algorithm to classify the network traffic and to detect abnormal behavior while keeping the VPN performance unchanged. The Random Forest algorithm is taught using labelled network traffic data, which means that it can accurately determine if an activity is harmful or is legitimate. The method’s ensemble feature is responsible for increasing precision in the detection of the attack and therefore for reducing false positives which gives the detection of the threat a rapid effect. Moreover, the framework has also been adapted for a smooth distribution and deployment in different environmental settings which makes it a very practical and useful solution for companies looking for a secure and intelligent remote access."

The target is to construct a scalable self-learning AI model that assists the prediction analytics and thereby the decision making for the smart cities. In contrast to methodical digital twins, the proposed CDT combines both the advanced AI and distributed cloud-edge computing to both speed up data processing and to create more accurate forecasting. The contribution of this work is in its holistic approach by integrating time series forecasting, anomaly detection, and energy consumption prediction in a single AI Driven system and has been verified for both simulation environments as well as real world setup. RMSE and MAPE metrics are used to assess the system performance in terms of processing latency values of around 50 milliseconds for one thousand IoT devices and MAPE values below industry thresholds. Robustness, scalability and precision of urban data management is demonstrated with CDT through optimization of resource allocation, improvement of public safety responsiveness and sustainability of urban development. These results confirm the proposed model’s ability to improve the urban management efficiency to a great extent while ensuring the stringent data security and system resilience."

Simultaneously, small retailers struggle to compete due to their lack of digital visibility and limited technological infrastructure. This paper introduces APRIX (Anomaly Powered Retail Index), a mobile-based solution designed to digitally empower local retailers by connecting them directly with nearby shoppers within a 500-meter radius. APRIX enables real-time product availability, shop status updates, and transparent pricing. It integrates a tag-based recommendation engine to personalize the shopping experience and employs anomaly detection techniques to identify and flag pricing irregularities. The system features three distinct modules for Admin, Retailer, and Shopper roles, providing tailored functionalities across the ecosystem.

Our proposition involves the implementation of an innovative and reliable Electronic Health Record (EHR) system that leverages attribute-based cryptosystem (ABE) and blockchain technology. ABE enables precise access control, ensuring that only authorized individuals possessing particular criteria may have access to encrypted data. Blockchain offers an immutable and easily verifiable record of all data exchanges.

    "abstract": "The increasing digital demands and geopolitical risks as well as the rapid-evolving security threats are testing the global network infrastructures to a level that is unprecedented. The demand to be resilient, defined by the round-the-clock availability, flexibility and security has taken precedence in the organizations that operate globally. The case study of the Move Off Corp modernization program used here offers the vision for the migration of the legacy systems into the cloud-native, scalable, and secure infrastructure as the way to create robust global networks. Comparing architectural principles, resilience evaluation metrics, and implementation strategies, the research demonstrates best practices of redundancy, fault tolerance, automatic failover, and governance based on compliance. The suggested methodology blends a case study and comparative benchmarking with global standards and renders both organizational and technical value of the problem. The results indicate measurable increases in uptime, latencies and sufficiency reduction, and significant risk management lessons, stakeholder coordination, and cost vs. performance balance. The article concludes by situating such results against the broader backdrop of upcoming global infrastructures stressing AI-facilitated resilience, selfhealing networks, and sustainable architectures. Lastly, the Move Off Corp initiative can serve as a model for the enterprises interested in building networks that are not only technologically feasible but also more strategically better suited to the changing nature of global digital environments."

The approach integrates the eddy current effect with a Tunnel Magneto-Resistance (TMR) sensor.

The resulting variations in magnetic field intensity differ under various degradation conditions, enabling fault identification. The paper details the working principles and sensor output mechanisms.

    "abstract": "As online learning usage grows, there is a greater need to understand how student activities affect academic success. Classic methods focus on static parameters such as final grades or presence, which cannot reflect the continual and changing nature of virtual learning. Such techniques may overlook key implicit behavioral cues such as content engagement, consumption, and interaction patterns. To solve these issues, the proposed system uses machine learning models that pay attention to behavior, along with random forests (RF), support vector machines (SVM), and gradient boosting (GB), which analyze real-time data from the learning management systems (LMS), like how long students spend in sessions, how many videos these watch, their participation in forums, and how timely these submit assignments. The proposed system uses preprocessing, feature extraction, and predictive modeling to forecast academic performance. It demonstrates that these segments outperform existing system structures, with 91.6% accuracy, 90.2% precision, 89.7% recall, and an F1-score of 89.9%. It also has the lowest RMSE (5.6) and MAE (4.1), indicating that the proposed system is resilient for performance prediction and intervention."

    "abstract": "In mobile edge computing (MEC), computation offloading serves as an effective solution to bridge the gap between the stringent latency requirements of computational tasks and the limited processing capabilities of terminal devices (TDs). However, complex inter-task dependencies, dynamic network conditions, and the decentralized architecture of MEC systems pose significant challenges to efficient and adaptive task offloading. To address these challenges, this paper investigates dependency-aware task offloading and resource optimization in MEC environments. First, we propose a task feature extraction method based on dependency-aware graph neural networks (FEDG), which captures the hierarchical structure and varying importance of subtask dependencies by adaptively learning the aggregation weights of predecessor nodes and edges. Then, to address the joint dependency-aware task offloading and resource allocation problem under partial observability in MEC networks, we design a Dependency-aware Graph-based Multi-Agent deep reinforcement learning (DGMA) algorithm. DGMA integrates adaptive prioritized experience replay and correlation-based selective parameter sharing to improve learning efficiency and accelerate convergence in multi-agent environments. Extensive simulations demonstrate that DGMA achieves superior performance in terms of delay, energy consumption, offloading utility, and deadline violation rate."

    "abstract": "Neutral Point Clamped Three-Level Inverters (NPC 3LI) are widely used in dc to ac power conversion due to their superior waveform quality and reduced voltage stress compared to two-level inverters. The performance of NPC-3LI can be further improved by employing a low-loss 240◦-Clamped Pulse Width Modulation (240CPWM) technique. 240CPWM is currently the lowest switching loss PWM method in cascaded configurations comprising a dc-dc stage followed by a dc-ac stage, reducing the dc-ac stage switching losses by at least 80% compared to the conventional Space Vector PWM (SVPWM) at unity power factor. In this work, the performance enhancement of NPC-3LI using 240CPWM in terms of total harmonic distortion (THD) and switching loss is presented and compared with benchmark PWM methods. The THD analysisis carried out using the concept of virtual stator flux ripple, and power losses (switching and conduction) are derived by analyzing the switching device char acteristics and the phase relationship between the modulation voltage and output current. A three-closed-loop control method is also developed for the front-end boost converter to achieve an effective neutral-point voltage balance. The analytical results are validated using a 3 kW experimental prototype. A peak efficiency of 97.71% is achieved for NPC-3LI with 240CPWM at 3 kW, compared to 97.22% with SVPWM, while maintaining comparable THD performance."

    "abstract": "Abnormal behavior detection is crucial in many fields, such as social networks, financial transactions, and cyber security. However, it poses significant challenges due to the intricate structural evolution of heterogeneous graphs and the need for explainable models. To address these issues, we propose a novel method called Explainable anomalous behavior (edge) detection for dynamic heterogeneous Graphs (ExpGraph). ExpGraph captures relation-aware structural evolution to model temporal behavioral patterns and introduces a prototype alignment mechanism to improve both performance and interpretability. Specifically, prototype alignment enhances detection by en couraging discriminative representations of normal behaviors, which facilitates more accurate identification of anomalies. It also improves interpretability by enabling intuitive explanations through measuring how anomalous behaviors differ from learned normal prototypes. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate ExpGraph against advanced competitors. It demonstrates that ExpGraph is 16.2% more effective than other methods on average. Moreover, it offers a deeper insight into abnormal behaviors in dynamic heterogeneous graphs. Our code is available at https://github.com/anonymous-123a/ExpGraph."

    "abstract": "Reconstructing high-frequency seismic data is essential for detailed subsurface imaging and accurate reservoir characterization, particularly when dealing with complex geological formations. Traditional machine learning approaches typically depend on large labeled datasets, which are often challenging to acquire and may fail to adequately represent the diverse conditions found in subsurface environments. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel physcis-guided, self-supervise learning methodology that eliminates the requirement for labeled data. This approach integrates physical constraints to ensure that the reconstructed seismic data retains its fidelity. A significant innovation in our method is the application of structure-guided constraints, enhanced by the use of cosine similarity. This allows for the adaptive calculation and minimization of angle errors, effectively preserving the orientation and continuity of geological features. Comprehensive testing on both synthetic and field datasets has demonstrated the robustness and accuracy of our method, showing its capability to maintain high-frequency details and faithfully reconstruct seismic signals in the presence of complex subsurface structures. The results indicate that this method significantly improves the resolution and reliability of seismic data, providing high-quality inputs that can enhance subsequent interpretation in reservoir management."

    "abstract": "To address the economic efficiency and controllability obstacles that significantly impact demand response (DR) performance, this paper proposes an incentive-compatible flexibility sharing strategy that optimally coordinates adjustment flexibility of customers with multi-period coupling constraints. In contrast to existing sharing schemes that set adjustment targets based on manipulable load baselines and share time-decoupled energy, we characterize the deviation between individual post-adjustment load curve and the load directrix (LD) as shared flexibility from a holistic multi-period perspective. LD represents an ideal target curve exogenously determined by the system to guide customer in DR, remaining immune to customer manipulation. A tractable model is established to encapsulate the decision making of optimal economic allocation of flexibility, and the closed-form optimal solution is rigorously derived. It is theoretically proved that flexibility sharing satisfies incentive compatibility. That is, individual decisions align with the guided optimal outcomes, which ensures the perfect tracking of LD. We show that every customer achieves cost reductions and hence has motivation to participate in the sharing. Furthermore, revenue adequacy and fairness are guaranteed. Case studies validate the theoretical outcomes and demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of the flexibility sharing strategy."

The algorithm first models ID sources using a uniform rectangular array (URA), and then estimates the nominal DOA, along with angular spreads, via the beamspace unitary estimating signal parameters via rotational invariance techniques (UESPRIT) algorithm. The above estimates are then used as pseudo-measurements for each time step within the GLMB filter and smoother to improve estimation accuracy. At the same time, for the uncertainty of measurement noise, Cramér-Rao bound (CRB) is used to approximate the covariance of measurement noise in the tracking process.Within the framework of the GLMB smoother, a forward filtering stage is performed to generate the association history as well as the trajectory information using the GLMB filter. Term trajectories and trajectory fragments are removed through the trajectory pruning operation. Next, the backward smoothing is applied to achieve the data association of the ID sources and the estimation of kinematic states. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach, Monte Carlo (MC) simulations are performed. The results confirm its superior DOA tracking capability, enhanced estimation accuracy, and high robustness."

    "abstract": "Referring remote sensing image segmentation aims to localize specific targets described by natural language within complex overhead imagery. However, due to extreme scale variations, dense similar distractors, and intricate boundary structures, the reliability of cross-modal alignment exhibits significant spatial non-uniformity. Existing methods typically employ uniform fusion and refinement strategies across the entire image, which often introduces unnecessary linguistic perturbations in visually clear regions while failing to provide sufficient disambiguation in confused areas. To address this, we propose an uncertainty-guided framework that explicitly leverages a pixel-wise referring uncertainty map as a spatial prior to orchestrate adaptive inference. Specifically, we introduce a plug-and-play Referring Uncertainty Scorer (RUS), which is trained via an online error-consistency supervision strategy to interpretably predict the spatial distribution of referential ambiguity. Building on this prior, we design two plug-and-play modules: 1) Uncertainty-Gated Fusion (UGF), which dynamically modulates language injection strength to enhance constraints in high-uncertainty regions while suppressing noise in low-uncertainty ones; and 2) Uncertainty-Driven Local Refinement (UDLR), which utilizes uncertainty-derived soft masks to focus refinement on error-prone boundaries and fine details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method functions as a unified, plug-and-play solution that significantly improves robustness and geometric fidelity in complex remote sensing scenes without altering the backbone architecture."

    "abstract": "Agricultural productivity is often threatened by foliage diseases that weaken plant health and reduce yield quality. Manual inspection remains the standard practice for disease identification, yet it requires expert knowledge, consumes significant time, and is not readily available in rural farming contexts. Advanced artificial intelligence methods such as deep convolutional networks have shown promise in agricultural diagnostics, but many of these solutions are computationally intensive and unsuitable for low-resource environments. To bridge this gap, an integrated lightweight framework for guava leaf disease prediction and sustainable management has been developed. The system employs a compressed convolutional neural network combined with a probabilistic assessment module to enhance reliability while maintaining efficiency. The Guava Leaf Disease Dataset (GLDD) was utilized, with a curated subset of 2,500 images across four categories: anthracnose, healthy, insect bite, and scorch. Images are standardized through preprocessing techniques, including resizing, normalization, and augmentation, to strengthen model generalization. Experimental results indicate consistent classification performance above 85% accuracy, with each prediction generated in under three seconds on a standard laptop.

Traditional incident logging systems, reliant on centralized databases or paper records, suffer from data tampering, opacity, and poor inter-agency collaboration, undermining conservation and law enforcement efforts. This work proposes Poaching Tracker, a blockchain-based system leveraging Ethereum smart contracts to securely and transparently record poaching incidents. The Poaching Records smart contract, implemented in Solidity, immutably stores detailed incident data-species, GPS coordinates, health status, poaching method, and motivation-while enforcing access control via MetaMask authentication. A React.js frontend provides an intuitive interface for authorized users to log and query incidents, validated through usability testing with conservation personnel. Testing with a synthetic dataset simulating diverse poaching scenarios demonstrates reliable logging at an average cost of 305,008 gas units and data retrieval times of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{1 0 - 1 5}$</tex> seconds on Ethereum's main net. Compared to centralized systems, Poaching Tracker enhances data integrity, transparency, and stakeholder trust, supporting legal evidence and policy-making. Aligning with Sustainable Development Goal 15 (Life on Land), Poaching Tracker offers a scalable, tamper-proof framework for wildlife conservation, with potential applications to illegal logging and habitat protection, paving the way for decentralized environmental data management."

    "abstract": "Human gait offers a novel optimisation framework for human gait biometrics, employing the most up-to-date techniques in state-of-the-art-based methods, utilising Trimmed Gait Energy Images and deep learning techniques. The TGEI is attained by smoothing of GEIs as well as decreasing the redundancy of the time features and conserving the motion facts. Such a method also creates recognition accuracy with the help of deep neural networks, thereby addressing such conditions as occlusion, change in walking velocity and viewpoints. The framework would involve a pre-processing pipeline for the generation of TGEIs with a CNN deployed that specialises in feature extraction and classification. The trial tests conducted on benchmark gait databases have been found to be better in recognition, efficiency in computation, and robustness as compared to the conventional GEI-based techniques. This article indicates that feature refinement and deep learning are relevant to the future of the gait biometrics sector to advance into scalable and reliable solutions that may be applied in practice."

    "abstract": "The displacement of synchronous generators by inverter-based resources (IBRs) fundamentally reduces the physical inertia in alternating current (AC) power systems, posing significant challenges to frequency stability. This issue is particularly critical in networks connected via high voltage direct current (HVDC) systems, which do not inherently contribute to AC-side inertia. This paper presents a rigorous comparative analysis of battery energy storage systems (BESS) and hydrogen storage systems (HSS) in providing primary frequency support to an AC network. Using an AC system model with an embedded VSC-HVDC link developed in PSCAD/EMTDC, distinct operational scenarios are simulated: (1) an ideal grid-forming (GFM) inverter with an infinite DC source, (2) a GFM inverter supported by a BESS, and (3) a GFM inverter supported by an HSS. Each scenario is subjected to an identical, significant step-load disturbance to evaluate key performance indicators, including frequency nadir, Rate of Change of Frequency (RoCoF), and settling time. The results quantify the distinct dynamic characteristics of each technology, highlighting the rapid power-centric response of BESS and the slower, energy-centric capabilities of HSS. The discussion synthesizes these findings, providing data-driven insights into the strategic deployment of these technologies to enhance the resilience and operational security of modern AC power systems."

Transcranial ultrasound, due to its safety and portability, is the most widely used modality. However, diagnosis using Transcranial ultrasound has often been limited by inter-observer variability and subtle imaging features. The authors introduce MobileGraphNet, a lightweight deep learning model for automated HIE detection using cranial ultrasound images, which combines the strength of MobileNetV2, Grid Graph Convolution, and Multi-Head Self-Attention. The model captures both local texture and global spatial relationships, enhancing precision and interpretability. The performance of three different experimental settings-training from scratch, transfer learning, and fine-tuning with transfer learning-has been evaluated using a balanced neonatal ultrasound dataset. The optimal model achieved 99.4% test accuracy and an F1-score of 0.994, with a validation loss of approximately 0.03, significantly outperforming the benchmark CNN models. Finally, the optimized model was exported as a TensorFlow Lite (.tflite) file and integrated into an Android mobile application that can classify cranial ultrasound images in real-time and offline. These findings confirm the hypothesis that MobileGraphNet offers an accurate, efficient, and portable solution for early neonatal HIE detection and bridges the gap between research-grade deep learning and bedside clinical diagnosis."

A penalty-based method is employed in the STAR-RIS beamforming subproblem to enhance beamforming efficiency and overall system performance. These subproblems are iteratively solved to obtain suboptimal solutions. Simulations validate that the proposed framework significantly outperforms traditional methods in terms of sum rate, yielding substantial gains in spectral efficiency and system performance."

Particularly, the biological mechanism behind fish migration is not fully understood. Moreover, its observation is often conducted visually and hence manually, raising questions of accuracy and interpretation of the data sampled. We address the two issues, mechanism and observation, of fish migration based on a recently developed mathematical model. The results obtained in this short paper show that fish migration can be characterized through a minimization principle and evaluate the error of its manual observations. The minimization principle we hypothesize is an optimal control problem where the migrating fish population dynamically changes its size and fluctuation. We numerically investigate alternating and intensive observation schemes as case studies, demonstrating that in some realistic conditions the estimate of total fish count is not reliable. We believe that this paper contributes to a deeper understanding of fish migration"

    "abstract": "In the present generation, the extended spread of fake news across online platforms is a major threat to democratic processes, public health, and social stability. The existing methods for detecting fake news are purely dependent on text-based features, and all those methods ultimately fail to capture multimodal misinformation given to them, which contains both text and image-based information. To address these types of challenges, this work proposes a hybrid deep learning framework that integrates multimodal feature extraction along with an explainable artificial intelligence (AI Explainability) mechanism for the transparent and accurate classification of news. The Multi-Head Fusion Network (MHFN) acts as the core component of the system and has been designed to effectively integrate text and image embeddings through hybrid embedding techniques, including Word2Vec, TF-IDF, and PCA-based dimensionality reduction, which play key roles in accurate and precise classification. The framework further introduces a live news proof retrieval mechanism that validates news claims against multiple trusted sources through real-time API integration with SerperAPI, thereby enhancing the credibility of the detection process with fresh, comprehensive proofs. The explainability layer provides detailed prediction-based reasoning, which helps end-users understand model decisions. The system demonstrates strong potential for real-time deployment, combining detection accuracy with explainability and a dynamic fact verification process, offering a robust solution to combat multimodal misinformation."

Firstly, an allocation model with AUV energy consumption and sailing distance as the optimisation objectives is established, and the fitness function is constructed using multi-objective optimisation theory. Second, a fast allocation method based on the cumulative auction algorithm is designed to ensure real-time performance. To further improve the overall performance of the allocation scheme, particle swarm algorithm is introduced for global optimisation search. To solve the problem that the PSO algorithm tends to fall into local optimum, an auction-particle swarm hybrid optimisation algorithm is proposed by using the auction algorithm to generate a high-quality initial population. Simulation results show that the proposed hybrid algorithm is better than the standard PSO algorithm and auction algorithm in terms of allocation adaptability and scheme quality, and is able to effectively achieve the collaborative position allocation of multiple AUVs, which verifies its effectiveness and superiority."

This paper introduces the GeoAI-Platform, a modern, web-based system designed to bridge this gap by democratizing access to geospatial intelligence. We present a scalable microservice architecture grounded in principles of distributed systems and human-computer interaction. The architecture is organized into three distinct layers—Interaction, Orchestration, and Intelligence—which separate the user-facing interface, service coordination, and high-performance computation. The platform enables two core workflows: (1) on-demand AI analysis from user-defined Regions of Interest (ROIs), and (2) dynamic integration of user-provided imagery. As a proof of concept, the architecture was validated by fine-tuning two state-of-the-art foundation models (Prithvi and Satlas), which were combined using a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) approach for cereal crop detection. The ensemble model achieved a Mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU) of 95.74%, outperforming the individual models.

Instead of assigning fixed categories, our approach predicts continuous scores, making it closer to how humans grade. We trained the model on $40-50$ QA pairs from various subjects, applying careful preprocessing and normalization for accuracy. The results show that our system performs better than traditional methods and even standard BERT-based models, achieving lower error rates. While it works well for factual and structured answers, it struggles with subjective or partially correct responses, indicating to the need for more explainable and fair AI tools.

By manipulating the internal attention layers across timesteps, our method enables local-ized and semantically aligned attribute transfer without the need for task-specific fine-tuning or external supervision. Our training-free setting refers specifically to the absence of any task-specific fine-tuning on the pre-trained diffusion model. Additionally, we incorporate null-text inversion to reinforce identity consistency during sampling. Experimental results demonstrate high-quality style transfer with strong structure-attribute separation across varied domains."

Finally, the feasibility of the proposed scheme was verified based on MATLAB/Simulink simulation platform, which can stably control the DC bus voltage and maintain strict phase synchronization between the current and voltage of each phase even under unbalanced power grid conditions."

    "abstract": "Transmission lines Power systems have high-voltage transmission lines which are both very important and undetected faults may cause serious outage, equipment damages, and safety risks. To overcome this obstacle, this paper suggests a fault detection system based on machine learning with the Random Forest (RF) algorithm as the main solution. Random Forest is chosen due to its strength, high classification rate and its capability to deal with the non-linear data trends that are common in the power system fault signals. It uses previously processed wavelet transform on the current and voltage waveforms to utilize data gathered on both current and voltage to extract features effectively. The RF model is then used in order to classify the extracted features to detect fault type and location in real time. The main tool used in this research is MATLAB with Scikit-learn library of Python to develop, simulate and validate the models. The results of the experiments prove the method is highly accurate, with a high detection rate, and high adaptability, making transmission networks much more reliable."

    "abstract": "High-performance Digital Signal Processing (DSP) applications, particularly in real-time systems, require efficient multiplication, particularly audio filtering, image processing and communication protocols. The classical multipliers such as the Dadda, Wallace and Booth designs though functionally valid have drawbacks, in terms of limiting dynamic power, delay, and area scalability under DSP-type workloads. This paper is proposing an Optimized Signal Processing-Based Dadda Multiplier (OSPD-M) that integrates signal-path-conscious partial product suppression, adaptively compressed compressor-based reduction trees, operand isolation, and delay-balanced pipelining to maximize speed and energy efficiency. The novelty is in identifying redundant operand patterns dynamically to disabled the unnecessary blocks of computation and using hybrid (3:2, 4:2, 5:2) compressors selectively depending on signal density. The architecture was coded in Verilog and synthesized on 45nm CMOS platform, and tested by embedding into a 64-tap FIR filter to benchmark at application level. Comparative 10 operand width results indicate that OSPD-M has an average delay reduction of 21.9, dynamic power reduction of 23.6 and area reduction of 14.7 over conventional Dadda multipliers. Also, during DSP application testing, the design achieved a fixed-point simulation environment execution accuracy of 98.92% and no loss of functional correctness. All these enhancements make OSPD-M an appropriate candidate in the power-sensitive machine-on-chip (DSP) in embedded and IoT platforms. It is scalable, FPGA/ASIC-friendly, design. The study shows that architectural and signal-aware optimization can make a substantial contribution to energy-delay-area trade-offs that are so critical in the present DSP environment."

The system employs a Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) for audio deepfakes based on Log-Mel spectogram features, a specially built ExceptionNet for image forgery detection, and a ResNet18 model optimized for both video frame analysis and signature verification, using different architectures for each modality. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show how accurate and generalizable DeepLock is, which makes it appropriate for forensic applications, identity verification, and real-time content validation."

    "abstract": "Skin tone and pigmentation assessment are critical diagnostic parameters in dermatology and cosmetic science. Conventional clinical evaluation relies on manual observation, which is often subjective and inconsistent under varying illumination conditions. Hyperpigmentation, caused by localized melanin overproduction due to ultraviolet exposure, hormonal imbalances, or inflammation, requires continuous monitoring for an early diagnosis. Recent advances in the Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI) have enabled smart, low-cost systems for real-time skin analysis. This paper presents a low-cost IoT-integrated image processing system employing an ESP32-CAM module for image acquisition, uniform LED illumination for consistent lighting, and a cloud-based server for automated pigmentation evaluation. to perform color normalization, segmentation of region and melanin index computation the image captured is transmitted over Wi-Fi to a python-based server by applying OpenCV algorithms. This system provides 92% of accuracy and latency response is below 1.5s. The results of experiment trails prove the device offers better reproducibility for different skin types and across various illuminations. The potential gateway for tele dermatology is opened by using this system, which also provides cost effective and home-based dermatology monitor."

Grid-forming inverters (GFMs) have emerged as a key solution, offering voltage and frequency regulation, inertia response, fault ride-through, and black-start capability. This paper reviews their principles, distinctions from grid-following (GFL) inverters, control strategies, and validation across distribution, transmission, and integrated transmission–distribution (T–D) networks. Control strategies include droop-based, synchronous-machine-emulation, oscillator-based, and emerging hybrid or AI-driven methods. Validation spans simulations, HIL testing, and large-scale projects such as Hornsdale, Dalrymple BESS, and SuperFACTS. Findings show that GFMs enhance stability, improve transient performance, and enable seamless GFM–GFL transitions.

This paper is intended to establish the prevailing cognitive variables across different stages in the placement such as Quantitative Aptitude Test (QAT), Verbal and Non-Verbal Reasoning (VNR), Computer Proficiency Test (CPT), Programming and Coding Test (PCT), English Communication Test (ECT), Technical Round (TR) and the HR Round (HR). It suggests a new model, which is a combination of the Mean Difference-Based Clustering algorithm and Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) to analyze cognitive profiles holistically. This paper analyzes the data of engineering learners, which gathers attributes of multiple intelligences, learning styles, thinking styles, metacognitive awareness, and personality. Once the data has been properly prepared, similarities among students in terms of cognitive abilities and constraints are found through the help of clustering algorithms. This is followed by the ranking of cognitive qualities based on the TOPSIS (Technique order preference by similarity to ideal solution) technique in which the cognitive qualities with the highest influence on the success of placement are emphasized. The comparison shows essential psychological and cognitive traits differentiating successful candidates that can give valuable information to develop a personalized solution. Through the systematic rating of cognitive qualities and the classification of learners according to several dimensions of preparedness, this study offers a structured, data-driven framework to improve placement outcomes. Because the suggested methodology is reproducible and scalable, it may be used in a variety of educational settings and adapts to changing industry demands by matching student cognitive profiles."

The design and implementation of a web-based platform for the automation of the evaluation of research performance from publicly accessible Google Scholar metrics are presented in this paper. The system responds to the requirement of effective data collection and analysis by pulling out citation-based metrics like total citations, h-index, and i10-index from faculty profiles. These are then classified into quartile levels (Q1-Q4) in relation to journal quality, enabling institutions to assess departmental research productivity in an organized and comparative way. The architecture of the platform combines web scraping methodologies for data harvesting, Python for data processing, and React.js for frontend interaction. Data is displayed through interactive dashboards that present department-wise averages and allow users to drill down into faculty-specific contributions within a quartile. The solution further includes fall-back mechanisms to deal with missing or inconsistent information and uses optimized scraping frequencies to adhere to web access restrictions. The system suggested offers an institutional research analysis with a scalable and visually appealing method. Translating disjointed citation data into actionable visual understandings, the platform allows academic administrators to track research trends, discover high-performing departments, and aid accreditation or strategic planning purposes.

To overcome shortcomings of single-modality and high-latency systems, it proposes a multimodal AI-based framework incorporating computation of facial, speech, and physiological modalities in a robust manner and with low-latency real-time emotion recognition. A reinforcement learning-based hybrid CNNBiLSTM model is proposed to code emotional states and dynamically optimize the allocation of humans and robots in tasks. The proposed model has an accuracy of 96.7%, F1-score of 95.4% and a lower real-time latency of 70ms, thus remarkably better reliability than previously suggested methods. Along with emotion-based collaboration, a 14.2% reduction in error was observed, a 92.9% index of worker satisfaction, and a 95.9% index of collaboration, which increased flexibility in smart factories. The results indicate that AI-powered desiring machines based on the recognition of human emotions can turn Industry 5.0 factories into environmentally-aware, resilient, and human-friendly eco-systems."

    "abstract": "Post-training compression of large language models (LLMs) is moving from heuristic ratios toward interpretable, layer-wise policies. We propose a unified, training-free low-rank pipeline that (i) uses an information-theoretic effective rank to set the retained rank k per layer, (ii) constructs layer-wise second-order statistics from a WikiText-2 calibration set (256×4096) and applies right-multiplicative whitening to obtain a better-conditioned factorization domain, (iii) performs SVD on the whitened weight WL and maps the approximation back to the original domain via right-multiplying L<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">−1</sup>, and (iv) realizes deployment as two linear factors by splitting the truncated diagonal term. On LLaMA-2-7B, we systematically evaluate decompositions of Gate, Up, Down, and their combinations by using perplexity (PPL), and activation-distribution statistics. Under the same effective-rank policy, whitened-domain decomposition is more robust (e.g., PPL 7.45→≈8.02) than direct decomposition in the original domain (PPL up to 8.38); effective rank serves as a practical lower bound for singular-value retention, offering a consistent, transferable truncation starting point across layers; and clear layer heterogeneity emerges that Gate/Up are more amenable to low-rank approximation, whereas Down is more sensitive and benefits from larger k or conservative handling. Rather than pursuing extreme compression, this work validates the compressibility boundary of LLM weights and provides an interpretable truncation policy, forming a clean interface and engineering baseline for composite compression with quantization, pruning, and distillation."

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of large-scale remote sensing constellations, their sizes have experienced explosive growth, posing significant challenges to both the dynamic and variable nature and timeliness requirements of satellite mission planning. Traditional ground-based constellation control methods are becoming less flexible and increasingly costly. However, the emergence of large language models (LLMs) offers a promising solution for autonomous mission planning in large constellations, reflecting a future development trend. These LLMs can intelligently interpret task requirements and perform mission planning through tool invocation. The key to their feasibility lies in the timeliness of planning for large-scale constellations. To address this issue, a mathematical model for mission planning was developed by comprehensively considering factors such as observational benefits, resource consumption, and balanced observation opportunities for targets. A high-efficiency model algorithm based on GPU parallel acceleration was proposed. This method utilizes custom GPU operators for fast parallel computation of large-scale objective functions and incorporates tensorized improvements to evolutionary strategies, adapting them to the GPU parallel computing architecture. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach can converge within hours for large-scale mission planning problems involving millions of observation windows, providing critical support to solve mission planning challenges in mega-constellations."

    "abstract": "Conductive materials such as EMI gaskets and fabrics are widely employed in equipment under test (EUT) to suppress electromagnetic interference (EMI) by ensuring electrical continuity across metallic interfaces. EMI gaskets specifically reduce field leakage at joints. While shielding effectiveness (SE) is the standard metric, it is often assessed without considering integration into the EUT. This study experimentally characterizes EMI gaskets and conductive fabrics up to 1.5 GHz using the transmission line method, focusing on electrical conductivity and surface impedance as key parameters in addition to SE, for high-altitude electromagnetic pulse (HEMP) protection, which involves frequencies up to 1 GHz."

    "abstract": "Securing data in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is critical due to the growing complexity and scale of industrial networks. Integrating Ethereum-based blockchain technology offers a promising solution by leveraging distributed ledgers to enhance the transparency, immutability, and security of IIoT systems. This study aims to enhance threat detection and data protection in IIoT environments through blockchain integration. To achieve this, the proposed approach incorporates Dynamic Threat Landscape (DTL)-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) for real-time attack modelling, enabling systems to adapt to evolving threats. However, integrating blockchain with IIoT also presents challenges, including ensuring low latency for real-time processing, scalability to manage large volumes of sensor data, and maintaining robust cybersecurity while preserving data privacy and integrity. Addressing these concerns is essential for the effective deployment of blockchain-enabled threat detection in IIoT networks."
