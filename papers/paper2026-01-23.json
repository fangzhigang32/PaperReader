    "abstract": "Ankle sprains are common among athletes, especially in ball sports, and often require targeted rehabilitation to restore joint mobility. This article presents the design and evaluation of a 3-RPS type parallel mechanism developed for the passive rehabilitation of lateral ankle sprains. The system replicates natural ankle movements using inverse kinematic models based on geometric methods and screw theory. To solve the forward kinematics, three numerical strategies were tested: gradient descent, gradient descent with momentum, and Newton-Raphson, with the latter being the most efficient. Workspace analysis confirmed that the mechanism covers the physiological ranges for dorsiflexion-plantarflexion (30° to <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$-20^{\\circ})$</tex> and eversion-inversion (20° to <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$-10^{\\circ})$</tex>, with vertical displacements ranging from 0.2044 m to 0.3046 m. Both positional and orientational workspaces were analyzed to ensure complete therapeutic coverage. A singularity analysis identified twelve critical configurations, all of which are outside the effective operating range. Structurally, the device is compact and lightweight <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$(\\leq 3.5 ~\\text{kg})$</tex>, ensuring portability and ease of use in clinical and sports environments. Its precision, stability, and ability to generate controlled, repeatable ankle movements make it a valuable tool for early-stage rehabilitation, promoting functional recovery in injured athletes."

It includes linear accelerators and small synchrotrons. The synchrotron high-frequency system is composed of a digital low-level system, solid-state power source, and magnetic alloy loading cavity. The entire system operates in sweep mode, with a sweep frequency range of 0.38 MHz to 6.5 MHz and a maximum voltage of 1 kV, thus ensuring that the PREF unit can output a proton beam with a maximum energy of 60 MeV. Considering the system requirements, cost, and existing development experience, the hardware framework based on the CPCI bus architecture is adopted in the low-level of the system. It uses 14-bit high-speed ADCs, 16-bit high-speed DACs, and Virtex-5 series FPGAs as the core high-speed processing units. The system communicates with blade computer controllers via a CPCI high-speed backplane bus to achieve system data delivery and real-time upload of operational data. At the same time, to solve the problem of uneven ADC sampling passband frequency response in extremely wide bands, a nonlinear correction is designed in the closed loop, and the response is calibrated online according to the real-time frequency, ensuring the amplitude control accuracy of the system. Through system testing, the phase control accuracy is better than ±1°, and the amplitude control accuracy is better than ±1<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">%</sup>, meeting the requirements of the system design and operational index.

    "abstract": "Multi-agent collaborative perception enables agents to share complementary information through communication, thus significantly improving sensing performance. In pursuit of effective collaboration, intelligent connected vehicles (ICVs) must exchange massive volumes of perception messages, the transmission of which demands substantial communication resources. However, many researches concentrates on resource allocation for simple messages, overlooking the substantial resource requirements of perception messages, thus failing to guarantee quality of service (QoS) in such scenarios. We treat each ICV as an agent and design a cooperative multi agent fair reinforcement learning (CMAFRL) framework for learning the efficient and fair resource allocation policy for each agent. Specifically, to avoid mutual interference among different vehicles during the transmission process, we leverage the heterogeneous-agent proximal policy optimization algorithm to generate cooperative resource allocation policies for ICVs. As ICVs compete intensely for resources to transmit perception messages, the framework optimizes a fairness utility function and ensures equitable communication opportunities for all ICVs. We establish a V2V communication simulator to evaluate CMAFRL's performance. The results show that CMAFRL significantly outperforms all baselines."

    "source": "IEEE",
    "abstract": "To meet the growing demand for wireless communication systems, a design scheme for a multi-frequency slot microstrip antenna based on a defected ground structure is proposed. The microstrip antenna uses a rectangular radiating patch as its initial structure, after which symmetric U-shaped slots and rectangular groove slots are etched on its surface, while an H-shaped defected ground structure is loaded on the ground plane. By adjusting the positions and sizes of the U-shaped slots, rectangular groove slots, and the H-shaped slot, the distribution of radiating current on the antenna surface is altered, achieving multi-frequency resonance of the microstrip antenna. Simulation results indicate that the antenna can resonate simultaneously in four frequency bands: 2.39-2.42 GHz, 3.14-3.17 GHz, 4.56-4.62 GHz, and 5.36-5.44 GHz, with good directivity at the center frequency of each band. The physical antenna was tested using a vector network analyzer, and the return loss was found to be less than -10 dB at 2.33 GHz, 3.13 GHz, 4.67 GHz, and 5.47 GHz. The test results are basically in agreement with the simulation results. The antenna features a simple structure that is easy to fabricate, making it a useful reference for the design of multi-frequency antennas in wireless communication terminals."

    "abstract": "The recent growing interest in neuromorphic architectures based on emergent dynamics of self-organizing memristive networks has posed some challenges regarding the spatiotemporal characterization of these multiterminal systems. This work presents a versatile measurement platform specifically designed for the characterization of memristive nanowire networks and for testing the implementation of unconventional computing paradigms in these systems. By integrating an FPGA controlled, parallel multiterminal array of source-measure units with a custom fixture based on spring-loaded electrodes, the system allows for real-time, reconfigurable voltage and current measurements across 16 terminals without hardware reconnections. The platform supports seamless transition between conventional two-terminal characterization, multiterminal characterization and testing computational properties in the framework of physical reservoir computing. Local conductance measurements, voltage mapping, and real-time dynamic monitoring offer unique insights into the spatiotemporal behavior of the networks. Furthermore, we show that the system enables to correlate electrical properties of the multiterminal network in terms of conductance matrices and voltage maps with computational performances, allowing also adaptive control over the network's operating state. The here reported setup provides a versatile platform for computing at the matter level (i.e., in materia) with multiterminal systems based on self-organizing memristive networks."

    "abstract": "Automated detection of skin cancer demands both precision and efficiency, yet conventional visual and histopathological methods remain time- consuming and variable. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) such as ResNet50, DenseNet121 and EfficientNet-B0 have set performance benchmarks on the HAM10000 dermatoscopic dataset, while vision transformers (ViTs) offer an alternative via global self-attention. To our knowledge, no prior study has systematically compared CNNs and transformers under identical training and evaluation conditions on a dermatology dataset. Here, we present a unified evaluation of three CNNs (ResNet50, DenseNet121, EfficientNet-B0) alongside two transformer variants (ViT-B/16, DeiT-S) on HAM10000. We evaluate resilience to class imbalance, computational cost, and diagnostic accuracy. Our findings demonstrate that while ViTs may attain similar accuracy with substantial pre-training, their clinical utility is limited by their large data needs and computational cost. On the other hand, EfficientNet-B0 is a strong contender for practical implementation as it achieves the ideal balance between speed and performance. This work underscores the necessity for transformer adjustments specific to medical datasets and provides guidance for model selection for automated skin cancer screening by elucidating these trade-offs."

However, managing Kubernetes at scale presents significant challenges, prompting cloud providers to offer managed Kubernetes solutions tailored to enterprise needs. This study provides a comparative analysis of four prominent managed Kubernetes distributions-Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS), Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), and Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform (OCP). By evaluating key features such as scalability, security, cost structure, and enterprise-level functionalities, this research identifies the strengths and weaknesses of each distribution and assesses their suitability for various business use cases.

    "abstract": "Federated learning has attracted widespread attention because it can share data without leaking privacy. Traditional federated learning algorithms (such as Federated Averaging Algorithm (FedAvg) often show low adaptability and robustness when facing non-independent and identically distributed (Non-IID) data and dynamically changing data environments. Federated Learning based on Dynamic Regularization (FedDyn) improves the training effect of the global model under unbalanced and dynamically changing data distributions. This study aims to evaluate the performance of the FedDyn algorithm in a non-IID data environment, focusing on its effect under the combination of optimizer adjustment, communication compression, and differential privacy protection mechanisms. The study uses the Cifar10 dataset and designs three experimental scenarios: comparing the performance of FedDyn and FedAvg under different optimizers (SGD and Adam), analyzing the robustness of the algorithm under communication compression conditions, and evaluating the impact of differential privacy mechanisms on privacy protection. The experimental results show that the FedDyn algorithm shows high robustness under various experimental conditions, especially under the combination of optimizer adjustment and communication compression, showing better accuracy and effectively improving communication efficiency. In summary, the FedDyn algorithm provides an effective solution to the federated learning problem under non-IID data and has great application potential."

    "abstract": "The increasing need for smart and environmentally friendly automation has led to the progress of robotic systems powered by renewable energy that take over outdoor maintenance tasks completely and repeatedly. The article highlight the creation and execution of an APLC (Autonomous Precision Lawn Cutter) that is powered by solar energy. The APLC is a combination of renewable energy collection, embedded control, and multisensor fusion to offer effective and completely autonomous lawn care. The proposed setup is based on an Arduino microcontroller, which is the main control unit in charge of sensor data gathering and relay-based motor actuation. A combination of a $\\mathbf{1 2 V}$ solar panel and Li-ion battery is the hybrid energy source that supplies power to the entire system through a charge controller, which guarantees the system’s continuous operation under different sunlight conditions.A VL53L1X Time-of-Flight (ToF) sensor is used by the mower for an accurate measurement of grass height and the blade is turned on only when the height of grass detected is more than the previously set height, thus saving energy. An HC-SR04 ultrasonic distance sensor serves to detect obstacles and avoid collisions by monitoring continuously the way of the mower. The controlling of the motors is done by a relay-based switching network instead of normal H-bridge drivers, which leads to less power loss, better torque efficiency, and easier circuit design. Experimental tests substantiate that the new APLC offers a grass height detection accuracy of $\\mathbf{\\pm 5 ~ m m}$, Experiments conducted in typical outdoor weather have validated correct sensing and navigation module operation over the conventional manual or wired mowers. The system shows that combining renewable energy, sensor-based intelligence, and efficient relay control can make a sustainable and low-cost solution for modern precision lawn maintenance."

A multi-joint flexible robotic arm with Z-shape geometry is designed, and the kinematic model is established using the improved D-H parameter method, and a planar simulation environment is constructed, including the state space of joint angles, angular velocities, end position errors, target trajectory derivatives, and kinetic energy indexes, as well as a specific action space and a reward function. The PPO algorithm is improved by introducing a clipping operation to limit the magnitude of the policy update, which improves the training Stability. The performance of the algorithm is optimized by a planar feature extractor, a policy network parameterized by a Gaussian distribution, and a value network that introduces the derivative of the target trajectory. Motion control training was carried out in planar space, and the experimental results show that the algorithm performs poorly at the beginning of training, but the reward value rises rapidly as the training proceeds, and eventually reaches a high level of stability. The end-effector of the multi-joint linear mechanical structure can accurately pass the given target point, the control signals of different joints are different, the end-effector stays at the specific position with high frequency. And the expected trajectory control is basically realized, and this study provides an effective method for the trajectory tracking control of the multi-joint flexible robotic arm."

    "abstract": "Quantum computing's rapid progress threatens traditional cryptography like Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) in blockchains. This paper examines CRYSTALS-Dilithium, a NIST-approved lattice-based signature scheme using Module Learning With Errors (MLWE) and Module Short Integer Solution (MSIS), for quantum-resistant blockchain security. However, Dilithium's complex key structure risks full compromise from partial leaks. We propose a three-layer defense: (1) Threshold Signature Scheme (TSS) distributes <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$s_{1}$</tex> across 20 nodes with threshold <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$t=15$</tex> using Multi-Party Computation (MPC) signing to avoid single points of failure; (2) Dynamic Key Rotation (DKR) enables rapid revocation of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$s_{2}$</tex> upon anomaly detection; (3) Verifiable Timed Signatures (VTS) leverage Timelock Puzzles (TLP) and Non-Interactive Zero-Knowledge Proofs (NIZKP) to impose timed delays, allowing detection of malicious activity. This architecture enhances post-quantum blockchain resilience, scalability, and decentralization while significantly increasing the cost of attacks. In 20-node simulations, baseline architectures fail after 4–5 node compromises, whereas our system endures up to 14, raising attack costs by a factor of 100. The combination of VTS and DKR reduces detection latency by 94.9% (from over 5 minutes to under 30 seconds). The overhead is approximately 2.5 KB per signature plus MPC operations, remaining feasible at 500 TPS for Proof-of-Work (PoW) or 100 TPS for Proof-of-Stake (PoS) systems."

The decentralized structure of wireless sensor networks alongside resource limitations creates security holes that enable malicious node attacks to disrupt network functionality and reliability. This study presents a combined detection method which employs Dempster-Shafer Theory (DST) and trust-based metrics to detect malicious network nodes. The framework utilizes trust score collection from neighboring nodes to implement Dempster-Shafer Theory for effective uncertainty management in trust evaluation. The system utilizes the Contiki operating system for implementation and runs simulations through the Cooja simulator. The experimental findings demonstrate that the new detection method maintains high packet delivery rates and decreases end-to-end delay while sustaining energy efficiency across various network structures."

As modern rail systems require stable, high-capacity connections for both passenger services and train-control applications, addressing the communication challenges associated with rapid mobility remains essential. The initial phase of this study evaluates system behavior using classical analytical tools, including MATLAB-based simulations to estimate metrics such as signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), transmission capacity, handoff probability, and network coverage under omnidirectional antenna configurations. These baseline results highlight constraints of traditional models in environments characterized by unpredictable and rapidly changing channel conditions.To overcome these shortcomings, machine learning (ML) techniques are later incorporated to enable adaptive handoff control and real-time signal optimization. Ensemble bagging algorithms are applied to predict channel variations and refine mobility management processes. Comparative evaluation shows that ML-driven techniques provide notable improvements in throughput consistency, handoff reliability, and SNR estimation of HSR System."

Among these tasks, robotic shelf picking is particularly challenging due to the limited capability of current robotic systems for reliable operation in unstructured environments. In particular, cluttered objects standing on shelves make it difficult to obtain object’s information, making it challenging to determine the suitable grasp candidate. This study proposes an integrated finger and retractable suction gripper to address the complexities of shelf picking and compensate for computer vision uncertainty. Specifically, the finger mechanism facilitates stable grasping by providing adaptive parallel support, even when object dimensions are not accurately estimated. The gripper achieves stable grasping even with a relatively simple vision model by employing a grasp-and-pull strategy following suction grasping. The system was tested in a simulated logistics environment, demonstrating its effectiveness in overcoming the lack of vision algorithms. This research contributes to developing a versatile robotic gripper for picking and stowing tasks on a shelf, essential for improving automation in the logistics industry."

    "abstract": "Pancreatic cancer is a highly malignant disease with a low survival rate. The primary reason for its high mortality is the absence of early-stage symptoms and the lack of effective early diagnostic systems. The late-stage diagnosis further exacerbates its mortality rate. Supervised artificial intelligence (AI) techniques have recently demonstrated promising results in earlystage diagnosis. However, a significant challenge with supervised AI methods is their reliance on large, labeled data sets, which are challenging to obtain in the medical field. In this work, the authors investigate the potential of semi-supervised AI techniques to address this limitation. The performance of supervised deep learning classification models is evaluated quantitatively using smaller training datasets. In addition, the authors explore the integration of contrast loss functions with existing AI models to enhance the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer using limited data. The performance of the models is analyzed using three publicly available datasets: BTCV, NIH, and MSD. Experimental results indicate that incorporating contrastive loss with classification loss can significantly improve the diagnostic accuracy of deep learning models, even with a reduced number of training data points."

    "abstract": "With the multitude of IoT applications, the limitations of traditional cloud computing have been exposed, particularly in the area of real-time response and latency. Fog computing addresses these issues by delivering computation and storage services closer to the data sources. This study investigates the role of fog computing in complementing IoT applications, presenting a smart offloading mechanism whereby data processing is done locally at the fog nodes before selective transfer to the cloud. The selective offloading depends on several parameters such as current network load, latency sensitivity, computational intensity, and task size, which together form the basis of the criterion for intelligent offloading. By means of architectural investigation, comparative analysis, and a delay-sensitive mathematical model in Python designed for synthetically efficient IoT tasks and corresponding latencies calculation, we demonstrate the potential of fog computing in latency minimization, resource usage optimization, and Quality of Service improvement. The experimental results show an average latency of about 50 ms for the cloud-only solution and 15 ms for the fog-based solution, which is approximately a $70 \\%$ reduction of the total latency. Validating its worth in latency-constrained IoT applications. The future could see AI-based adaptive offloading and real-world deployment scenarios."

    "abstract": "Fabry-Perot (F-P) sensors exhibit extremely high sensitivity in partial discharge (PD) detection. However, traditional F-P intensity demodulation systems are susceptible to disturbances from vibration and temperature, leading to a decrease in demodulation sensitivity or even failure. A novel demodulation method with high robustness is proposed to detect PD by leveraging differential interference, ensuring reliable PD detection performance of the F-P sensing system in complex environments. The theoretical frequency characteristics and sensitivity of the method are firstly calculated and analyzed. Then, the differential phase demodulation system for F-P sensor is designed and manufactured for insulation PD detection, and the response performance of the system is tested and evaluated in the laboratory. Furthermore, compared with the universal intensity demodulation method, it is certified that the new method has the same phase sensitivity. Meanwhile, F-P interference system with differential phase demodulation demonstrates improved linearity and a wider response bandwidth. Within the temperature range of 30-90°C, the signal amplitude of the F-P intensity demodulation system decreases by 94%, while the F-P differential phase demodulation system only attenuates by 10.7%. At a starting discharge voltage of 12kV, the signal-to-noise ratio of the differential phase demodulation system is only 1.36% lower than that of the intensity demodulation system. Moreover, under harsh environmental changes, the differential phase demodulation system exhibits extremely high stability. The highly robust F-P local electric detection system is conducive to the broader application and promotion of fiber optic F-P sensors."

Traditional recommendation algorithms usually rely on static models and cannot fully consider the dynamic changes and individual differences of learners' behaviors. Deep learning can effectively extract implicit features such as learners' interests, behaviors, and knowledge mastery. The algorithm in this paper combines the advantages of deep learning and reinforcement learning. First, the deep learning model is used to extract features from learners' historical behavior data to obtain personalized interest and demand features. Then, the reinforcement learning algorithm dynamically adjusts the recommendation strategy and optimizes the recommended content in real time, so that the system can make adaptive adjustments based on learners' feedback and needs to improve the accuracy of recommendations. To test the validity of the proposed algorithm, an intelligent learning platform is designed, and various learning scenarios are simulated. The experiment results indicate that, compared with the traditional recommendation algorithms, learners can improve on average 12% on average, improve on recommendation accuracy by 15%, and reduce learning time by 10%. These data show that the intelligent recommendation algorithm based on the fusion of deep learning and reinforcement learning can significantly improve the learning effect of learners and the personalized recommendation ability of the system, thereby optimizing the learning process and improving learning efficiency."

To address this challenge, in this work, we conduct a comparative analysis between two deep learning based approaches (end-to-end and hierarchical) for also taking into account background class alongside motor imagery classes (specifically, left and right hand motor imagery). We demonstrate that the end-to-end approach achieves performance comparable to the hierarchical one, with only a negligible drop in accuracy, while offering significant advantages in terms of model complexity and suitability for portable applications."

A real room was captured and displayed as an equirectangular texture mapped onto a virtual sphere. Twenty-two participants explored the scene using natural locomotion and completed perceptual and cognitive tasks. Their experience was assessed using standardized questionnaires concerning presence, depth perception, visual realism, and distortion. Results indicate that the method can effectively convey a sense of immersion and spatial presence when viewed through a VR headset, though projection-related distortions remain a limitation. Overall, the approach is shown to be a viable solution for rapid VR deployment where visual immersion is prioritized over interactive complexity."

    "abstract": "Out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization is a major challenge in federated graph learning, where client data distributions often differ significantly due to shifts in node features and structural patterns. This non-IID nature leads to poor performance of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) trained solely on federated task losses. While domain-alignment techniques—such as adversarial training, invariant risk minimization, and kernel-based methods like Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD)—offer promising solutions for mitigating distribution shifts, they typically require access to shared embeddings, which compromises user privacy. We propose FedMMD-P, a framework for privacy-preserving alignment in federated out-of-distribution graph learning. Each client computes a compact, noisy RFF-based sketch of its node-embedding distribution, enabling a DP-MMD penalty with only O( nD) local cost and D-dimensional communication per round. Across five benchmarks (Reddit, OGB-Arxiv, Ethereum, Tox21, PubMed), FedMMD-P delivers up to 6 percentage-point accuracy gains over non-private baselines under severe domain shifts while incurring <0.1% communication overhead and only 5–10% runtime overhead. We derive end-to-end (ε, δ)-DP bounds via Moments Accountant and Rényi composition, demonstrating practical privacy guarantees."

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a lane detection system that improves upon traditional Fully Convolutional Networks (FCNs) by integrating dual attention mechanisms and a preprocessing strategy that uses Meta's Segment Anything Model (SAM). The core of the system's innovation lies in its use of Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) channel and spatial attention modules to refine feature representation, and its use of SAM to guide the network towards lane-specific features. The system was trained on the TuSimple dataset and achieved a test accuracy of 96.4 %, outperforming standard FCN approaches. Although the model is highly accurate, its high latency poses a challenge for real-time applications. Future work will include conducting ablation studies to reduce this latency and training the model in other datasets to improve its performance in complex driving environments."

The system first uses ensemble learning models (such as random forests and gradient boosting trees) to preliminarily process multi-source data, extract features and generate decisions. Subsequently, the decision model is further optimized through deep neural networks to handle complex nonlinear relationships and improve the prediction accuracy of the system. In addition, the system introduces an adaptive optimization mechanism to dynamically adjust the weight of the model according to historical data to ensure efficient decision-making in different scenarios. Experimental results show that the system improves decision accuracy by 7.2% and reduces response time by 15.4% compared with traditional methods in multiple experimental scenarios. In particular, the proposed hybrid model shows significant advantages in large-scale data processing and real-time optimization.

Using a 4D ultrasound scanner called the Voluson-S8, many operators collected 1319 ultrasound images of ovarian cysts from a prestigious obstetrics and gynecological hospital. The Voluson-S8 is a device made specifically for gynecological scans by General Electric (GE). Each image in the dataset was meticulously categorized by a radiology specialist with more than 20 years of gynecological experience. Five image classes were created. The two deep learning networks, mobileNetV-2 and VGG-16, were developed using MATLAB R 2022b’s Deep Learning Toolbox. The research compares these two pre-trained deep learning networks on a number of significant metrics. The validation accuracy of mobileNetV-2 is 90.11%, whereas that of VGG-16 is 74.52%. MobileNetV-2 is 15.59% more accurate than VGG-16. Endometriomas, hemorrhagic cysts, hydrosalpinges, polycystic, and normal ovaries are the five different abnormalities that we were able to classify in the current study. The classification results were compared with their analysis by the gynecologist/radiologist, who has many years of expertise and currently completes the assignment regularly. We have found that the deep learning (DL) based CAD system has a high degree of accuracy in identifying and classifying ovarian cysts when compared to radiologists and gynecologists."

    "abstract": "WSNs have established themselves as critical research subject because they enable numerous practical applications in environmental monitoring and industrial automation and military surveillance and healthcare systems and smart cities operations. A sensor network embraces many nodes as deployed sensors across geographic space for the purpose of data acquisition and forwarding information to a centralized hub station. The sensor nodes found in WSNs face energy constraints which create challenges for maintaining network operations and ensuring reliable communication because of their limited power resources. This paper presents an energy-efficient routing protocol which can strengthen both secure network operations and extend operational lifetime in WSNs. The proposed approach leverages the Modified Honey Badger Approach (MHBA) for optimal clustering and cluster head (CH) selection. The multi-objective optimization method which powers the MHBA framework takes into account three main factors including residual energy together with node distance and security risk to develop energy-efficient data paths with strong protection features. The proposed model enhances network energy efficiency while promoting security which results in longer network lifetime together with superior data delivery performance according to experimental findings and simulation results. Results demonstrate that using MHBA leads to effective cluster building for dynamic and adaptive operations in constrained energy WSN systems."

However, soldiers often face challenges such as in determining their precise coordinates, the inability to discern whether they are situated within a secure area, and the lack of surveillance to assess both environmental security and their physical condition on the battlefield. This study presents the development of a LoRa-based system to monitor the health of military personnel on the battlefield. Operating at 915 MHz, the prototype transmits health data from a LoRa transmitter (TX) to a receiver (RX), enabling the utilization of the data for problem-solving. The resulting personal tracking device supports soldier health surveillance during combat. The prototype incorporates various supporting components, including GPS Neo-7, MAX30102 sensor, $\\mathbf{1 2 8} \\boldsymbol{\\times} \\mathbf{6 4}$ OLED display, and emergency (SOS) button. Performance test was conducted to evaluate transmission delay over distances ranging from 100 to 500 meters. Results showed a minimum delay of 0.12 seconds at 100 meters and a maximum delay of 5.23 seconds at 500 meters. Notably, the system successfully transmitted SOS signals at all five test points, including in non-line-of-sight (NLOS) conditions. These results demonstrate the potential of the proposed system to enhance soldier safety through real-time monitoring and reliable emergency communication."

    "abstract": "With the accelerated process of urbanization, air pollution has become increasingly severe, particularly in terms of fine particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10). The accurate monitoring and prediction of these pollutants are crucial for environmental management and public health. However, due to the nonlinear and nonstationary nature of environmental data, traditional prediction methods exhibit certain limitations in air quality forecasting. To address this issue, this paper proposes a hybrid approach that integrates an Autoencoder and a Transformer-based prediction model. First, the Autoencoder is employed to remove noise from environmental data, thereby reducing its complexity and eliminating redundant information. Subsequently, the Transformer model leverages its strong capability of capturing long-range temporal dependencies to further model the denoised time-series data, enhancing the accuracy of air quality prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to LSTM, GRU, MLP, and RNN models, the Transformer achieves the best performance in terms of MAE, RMSE, and MAPE, significantly improving the prediction accuracy and robustness. This study provides new insights into the field of air quality forecasting."

The condition-specific trajectory prediction reduces Root-Mean-Square Error (RMSE) as low as 0.52, showing how accurate the system is forecasting the future positions of the surrounding vehicle. The Path Planning system deploys a hybrid method involving both deterministic <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathrm{A}^{*}$</tex> and probabilistic RRT algorithms, offering both optimum and flexible route generation that dynamically changes its configuration due to environmental conditions. By integrating this, high accuracy is achieved, comparing to other existing path planning strategies. The model was trained with IDDAW dataset with extreme conditions like fog, rain, lowlight and snow. The accuracy of our proposed model is 95.1%, which is comparatively higher than the average of other existing models. The visual outputs, together with accuracy-loss plots and by plotting paths will complement the validations for general robust conditions under challenging situations. Furthermore, the proposed integrated framework enhance the actual time decisions in the autonomous cars that would make them avoid risks, while at the same time achieve efficiency in environment with diverse road and weather conditions. Based on this methodology, great progress has been achieved towards achieving reliable autonomous navigation under complex weather conditions. It has been achieved by making seamless road condition detection, trajectory prediction, and path planning to fit within one framework, which makes the autonomous systems more robust and adaptable."

Our architecture includes two distinct Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs)-a GADT for semantic reflection and an ADT optimized for code generation-enabling both interpretation and artifact synthesis (e.g., Scala source code). We also present a type reconstruction mechanism aligned with Scala's compiler logic, enhancing semantic fidelity. By minimizing reliance on macros and exotic metaprogramming, our design democratizes access to formal specification techniques for everyday developers.

Yet, due to power losses, electromagnetic interference, as well as the potential of unauthorized access or malicious attacks, guaranteeing the reliability and security of WPT systems is still a big challenge. Conventional monitoring and defect detection mechanisms need to be more efficient, reactive in real-time, and prone to data tampering. Implementation of the blockchain is a promising usable solution to solve these issues due to decentralized, tamper-proofed and transparent data management characteristics of the technology. At the same time, the research presents results on the implementation of one of the blockchain-oriented technologies in terms of constant control of normal operating conditions and detection of defects in wireless power transfer (WPT) networks, thus improving the efficiency of the operation while ensuring the security of the entire system. This study presents a novel data integrity assurance and autonomous fault detection framework for WPT systems by integrating blockchain with real-time sensor networks and artificial intelligence (AI)-based analytics. Automated Responses: Smart contracts allow automatic reactions when anomalies are detected, minimizing downtime and maintenance costs. Moreover, it enables secure and transparent records of power transactions using distributed ledger technology (DLT), preventing unauthorized access to energy and enhancing accountability of the system. Results of simulation and experimental validation show the gain in defect detection accuracy, reduced fault reporting latency, and improved cyber-attack resilience of blockchain-enabled WPT networks. This research proposes a pioneering model that can utilize blockchain-based monitoring solutions to enhance the design of WPT networks, providing an innovative proof of concept that can address the limitations of such systems. In the future, research directions that address challenges such as optimizing consensus mechanisms specifically for low-power IoT devices and investigate hybrid blockchain models could improve scalability and increase transaction speed to facilitate potential real-world applications of WPT in practical cases."

The decentralized, immutable and tamper-proof characteristics of blockchain mitigate many of the challenges that exist in deep learning, including data privacy, trust, and accountability. Deep learning, on the other hand, provides us with robust computational techniques for identifying tight relationships within massive datasets, which elevates the predictive power of AI systems. To overcome the challenges in information security, privacy, transparency, and ethical decision-making in AI, this study proposes new techniques of synergy between blockchain and deep learning AI. Some of the critical aspects of this integration are the usage of blockchain to create a verifiable audit trail of the AI model training process, data provenance, and enabling secure energyefficient sharing of data between distributed entities. In this comprehensive study, latest findings on new areas on the Confines of Blockchain & deep learning applied to AI systems are reviewed and discussed along with how the mutual complementing security aspects of each other can be providing the solutions to the risk/metrology challenges faced in AI. In addition, blockchain’s consensus mechanisms, smart contracts, and decentralized frameworks are investigated as tools to improve the transparency and fairness of AI decisionmaking processes.

This study shows how the combination of blockchain and deep learning appears successful in constructing more ethical and trustworthy AI systems after a comprehensive review of the literature concerning existing implementations and case studies. By integrating blockchain with deep learning, the research tries to augment security and data integrity, besides addressing bigger ethical issues like accountability for AI decision making and potential data monopolization issues.

    "abstract": "Cyberattacks have becoming increasingly sophisticated, and static cybersecurity constructs are now not well enough equipped to secure layered IT infrastructure. Modern enterprises exist in complex interconnected systems comprised of application, network, data, and endpoint layers with their own set of vulnerabilities. Because Internet threats are constantly changing to bypass security devices and applications, the software checks itself daily to acquire the ability to identify and block new threats. In response to these challenges, DL- based reactive learning systems provide an innovative path to cybersecurity by being able to detect, adapt, and mitigate threats in real-time. This research introduces reactive learning to deep learning architectures to fight against emerging threats in multi-layer IT environment, offering this enhanced cybersecurity model. Unlike traditional static defenses, the proposed method learns in real-time from novel attack vectors such as unwarranted communication from any blocked addresses, adapting its detection models from real-time threat intelligence and behavioral analysis. The engine uses neural models like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for packet snapping, RNNs and LSTM networks for sequencebased anomaly detection, and GANs for synthetic threat simulation, to proactively harden defenses against new attack patterns. The system includes a multi-tier defense mechanism, with each IT layer (network, transport, application, and user endpoint) having an associated deep learning-based detection and response mechanism. Consolidated threat intelligence aggregation provides the means for correlating events across layers, so that an attacker implementing coordinated multi-vector attacks that would be beyond the capabilities of any isolated security tool would not otherwise go unnoticed. Moreover, reactive learning is, by nature, the model periodically or incrementally re-trains with streaming data, which enables it to defend against new attacks with little human effort. Experimental validation in simulated enterprise IT environments shows that the proposed DLenabled reactive cybersecurity framework increases the accuracy of detection by up to 18% against conventional intrusion detection systems and reduces response time to incidents by more than 25%. The flexibility of the framework provides robustness against polymorphic malware, APTs, zero-day exploits, and beyond, providing an adaptive and selfimproving defense stance. Through the incorporation of the deep learning with the reactive learning strategies, the study offers a reference for the next generation intelligent cybersecurity systems that are able to protect multi-layer IT infrastructures in constantly changing threat landscape. It doesn’t just harden the organization; it fills in what is arguably the most serious missing line item on any security balance sheet - the ability to learn and adapt faster than the adversary."

By alternatively arranging offset-fed dipoles on a parallel strip line, two new modes only existing on the staggered arms are excited. The bands where the elements weakly resonate in the two modes are taken as the working band. On account of the air-substrate TEM transmission line, the propagation constant required by endfire radiation can be guaranteed in wide bands. The excitation of the 3/2 λ mode of the long arm pairs and the 1/2 λ mode of the short arm pairs spread the field to the whole transverse aperture, thus improving the high band (HB) gain. The uniform aperture field facilitates the achievement of high gain with a small length of 3.04 λ<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><i>L</i></sub>. Besides, the working band can be adjusted by tuning the length and width of the long and short arms. The proposed antenna exhibits high gains of up to 11.6, 12.1, and 15.7 dBi, respectively in the low band (LB), the middle band (MB), and the HB. The 3dB gain bandwidths of 8.5%, 54.8%, and 22.1% cover the Wi-Fi 6 bands with broad bandwidth and high gain, indicating an excellent point-to-point communication capability."

    "abstract": "Body Area Network technology is rapidly evolving, presenting a future where wearable devices seamlessly integrate with our lives, fostering a new era of personalized healthcare through wearable devices. These gadgets need antennas that can generate precise results while withstanding human motion and being noise-immune. The antennas ought to be small and flexible. The substrate has a significant impact on the antenna's flexibility. A miniature wearable patch antenna for body area network (BAN) application is presented in this research. The antenna reduces its size by 31% over traditional designs by using a crown fractal design technique. Furthermore, a flexible Rogers RT Duroid 5880 substrate is used, which qualifies the antenna for use in wearable medical equipment. With a gain of 4.54 dB and a bandwidth of 145 MHz, the proposed antenna covers the 2.45 GHz ISM band when operating. Simulations analyze the antenna's performance through return loss (S11), radiation pattern, and directivity [1] [2]. The results make it a strong candidate for wearable BAN applications."

    "abstract": "Image enhancement and noise reduction play essential roles in the use of imaging systems in remote sensing, medical fields, and security cameras and for personal photography. Even so, the majority of current denoising algorithms are either hard to apply or do not effectively deal with all types of noise in real life. Therefore, we suggest ImageReviveCore which uses various techniques to combine convolutional and transformer architectures, scale factors and attention to achieve high-performing image restoration quickly. The system is built on a CNN-Swin Transformer backbone, use of spatio-temporal attention and adaptive denoising paths directed by reinforcement agents. Ten benchmark datasets like DIV2K, BSD68, Set5 and Urban100 were carefully evaluated using various image quality metrics. It is shown that ImageReviveCore has better results than DnCNN and RIDNet with their average PSNR reaching 32.56 dB and SSIM at 0.874 and performs in real time (taking less than 165 ms for 1080p images). Perception and numbers from BRISQUE make it clearer that my method is better than other techniques. The model's average user rating is 4.5/5, meaning that people find the visuals very pleasing. With edge-aware enhancement, content-adaptive fixing and scalable use, ImageReviveCore raises the standard for restoring images in real-life cases. It is particularly designed for live use in things like embedded systems, mobile imaging and telemedicine. Progressive work will prioritize making models smaller, combining different types of images and applying federated learning for security in mobile applications."

    "abstract": "Understanding the power of quantum data in machine learning is central to many proposed applications of quantum technologies. While access to quantum data can offer exponential advantages for carefully designed learning tasks and often under strong assumptions on the data distribution, it remains an open question whether such advantages persist in less structured settings and under more realistic, naturally occurring distributions. Motivated by these practical concerns, we introduce a systematic framework based on quantum lossy data compression to bound the power of quantum data in the context of probably approximately correct (PAC) learning. Specifically, we provide lower bounds on the sample complexity of quantum learners for arbitrary functions when data is drawn from Zipf's distribution, a widely used model for the empirical distributions of real-world data. We also establish lower bounds on the size of quantum input data required to learn linear functions, thereby proving the optimality of previous positive results. Beyond learning theory, we show that our framework has applications in secure delegated quantum computation within the measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC) model. In particular, we constrain the amount of private information the server can infer, strengthening the security guarantees of the delegation protocol proposed in (Mantri et al., PRX, 2017) [1]."

    "abstract": "Earthquakes cause several losses every year, both in terms of human lives and infrastructure damage. Therefore, it is increasingly important to think of new tools that reduce the damage caused by an earthquake as much as possible. In this context, the role of Earthquake Early Warning Systems (EEWSs) is becoming increasingly significant. These systems can rapidly detect earthquakes and issue alerts that guide emergency safety actions. They capture ground shaking shortly after an earthquake occurs and raise alarms in target areas with an advance of seconds to several tens of seconds before the strong ground motion impacts on target infrastructures. This paper proposes the design of an system intended to assist a moderately injured operator, after a seismic event within a critical environment, who is unable to communicate with emergency responders. The system provides autonomous self-rescue instructions that aim to mitigate the risk of additional complications from injuries. The system architecture is based on the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) offline with the continuous monitoring of selected vital parameters, periodically acquired through wearable smartwatch technology."

The proposed scheme utilizes the strength of Wavelet Scattering Transform (WST) and the Color Layout Descriptor (CLD) of Mpeg-7. The Wavelet Scattering Transform is used to capture texture features while Color Layout Descriptor is a strong color feature extractor. Both WST and CLD together have given competitive outcomes and recognition accuracy of 98.25%. As the proposed scheme uses Machine Learning, it does not require large image dataset like Deep Learning. Also, it is faster and robust. The skin images used for training and testing are taken from ISIC image database."

    "abstract": "Vection, the illusory sensation of self-motion induced by visual stimuli, is fundamental to understanding sensory integration and has significant implications for virtual reality (VR) and motion sickness research. This review synthesizes findings from 16 peer-reviewed studies that employed electroencephalography (EEG) to investigate the neural correlates of vection. We find that EEG research consistently identifies modulations in the alpha frequency band (a), particularly over parieto-occipital regions, as a key neural signature. Early visual event-related potentials (ERPs), notably the N2 component, also serve as reliable correlates, indexing the initial processing and integration of motion cues sensitive to stimulus properties. Neural activity patterns are further influenced by stimulus characteristics (e.g., field-of-view, motion type), task demands, and individual differences, including handedness and susceptibility to visually induced motion sickness (VIMS). Emerging research explores network connectivity and demonstrates the potential for manipulation of vection via non-invasive brain stimulation targeting a oscillations. Despite these advances, considerable methodological heterogeneity in stimuli, EEG analysis, and vection assessment across studies currently limits direct comparison and the establishment of universally accepted biomarkers. Future research with standardized protocols and larger sample sizes is necessary to solidify these findings. Nonetheless, EEG stands as a valuable tool for exploring the temporal dynamics of vection, offering potential pathways to enhance VR design, mitigate adverse effects like motion sickness, and deepen our understanding of human self-motion perception."

This enhancement is especially crucial in ultra-reliable and low-latency communication (URLLC) environments, where stringent requirements on reliability and latency are imposed. In this work, we investigate the rate characteristics of a cell-free massive MIMO system augmented by IRSs, operating under Rician fading conditions within a URLLC framework. We begin by formulating a comprehensive system model that captures both the wireless channel and the downlink transmission scheme. Assuming ideal uplink channel state information (CSI) for the composite links between access points, IRSs, and end users, we derive two analytical expressions representing the achievable rate under maximum ratio transmission (MRT) precoding. These formulations shed light on efficient strategies for power allocation and phase adjustment, thereby facilitating more effective resource optimization. To validate our theoretical findings, we conduct a series of numerical experiments that confirm the precision and practical utility of the proposed rate models."

Three distinct RL-based control strategies are compared: direct control using RL agent actions, feedback regulator enhancement through RL agent actions, and auxiliary control signals provided by RL agent actions to the feedback regulator. Each control system was initially trained on a mathematical model of the crane and subsequently fine-tuned on the actual physical system. The direct control approach leverages the RL agent's actions as immediate control inputs, aiming for rapid adaptation to dynamic changes. The feedback enhancement strategy integrates RL actions to refine the feedback loop, improving stability and response time. The auxiliary control method uses RL actions to support the primary feedback regulator, enhancing overall system robustness. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of each approach, with detailed performance metrics highlighting their respective advantages and limitations. This study provides valuable insights into the practical implementation of RL-based control systems for complex, real-world applications."

First, most methods ignore the effects of visible and infrared images on the predicted maps. Second, they fail to generalize adequately to future unseen data. Third, methods that limit the number of model parameters often reduce the model complexity and degrade the performance. To resolve the aforementioned issues, we designed global dependency networks (GDNet-S* and GDNet-S) utilizing three-stage knowledge distillation (KD) for TLD. First, to extract useful information from visible and infrared images, we developed two generators that extract essential information from the main and auxiliary images, respectively. Second, we designed a Bayesian module to enhance the ability of the model to generalize to new data. Finally, we designed three KD methods for encoding the basic, relational, and output features of the student and teacher networks to improve the performance without changing the GDNet-S parameters. Comprehensive experiments on a TLD dataset demonstrated that both GDNet-T and GDNet-S* achieved outstanding performance. Furthermore, to validate the generalizability of GDNet-S*, we tested it on three public RGB-D datasets. GDNet-S* achieved moderately competitive results on these datasets.

    "abstract": "Quality in higher education is crucial for the growth of the country, as it builds the skills, knowledge that encourage professional growth of the people. Professional skills are driving the economy, innovations, academics, administration, and industries of the country. To bring uniformity in the educational process across India, UGC (University Grant Commission) issued mandatory guidelines for all Higher Education Institutions in the country. These guidelines are known as Mandates. In 2018, UGC introduced quality mandates to enhance the quality of education in higher education to enhance employability for graduates through meaningful teaching and learning practices. This work aims to determine the level of higher education teachers' awareness in the colleges and universities of Lucknow district in the state of Uttar Pradesh, India. This method utilizes Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) and Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) as statistical tools to determine the internal consistency of responses for multiple variables and confirm this through analyzing the responses under the same variable. 92 samples were tested for the 15 test items on various quality mandates. These samples comprise the responses of 55 female and 37 male teachers. Responses show a high level of awareness among the teachers. Validation of the questions' consistency is done through exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis. Cronbach's alpha (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\alpha$</tex>) is used as a statistical tool to determine the inner consistency. The calculated value of Cronbach's alpha has validated the inner consistency between the questions through EFA and CFA which verifies the authenticity of the responses."

Currently, the majority of bidirectional WPT systems adopt bilaterally symmetric structures, while limited research has been conducted on asymmetric compensation networks. This paper focuses on the parameter sensitivity of a BD-WPT system based on the LCC-S compensation topology for EVs. A system model is established, and the conditions for power transmission are derived. To investigate the sensitivity characteristics of power transfer, a parametric analysis is performed on the DC bus voltage and phase shift angles (internal and external), identifying the most influential parameters and their operational mechanisms. Finally, the theoretical model and parametric sensitivity of power transmission are validated through MATLAB/Simulink simulations."

So, in this work, the fuel cell energy system is referred to as providing electricity to hydrogen vehicles. However, the fuel stack peak energy delivered from the fuel module device is very difficult because it supplies continuously disturbed nonlinear energy, which is not recommended for the consumer automotive system. So, the Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) concept is included in the fuel module energy production system. Here, the traditional Perturb & Observe and Incremental conductance technologies are investigated to select the appropriate MPPT block for the introduced fuel module system. Finally, the fuel stack voltage delivery is a low value. So, the non-isolated converter technology is referred to as boosting the voltage levels of the fuel stack system.

Deep-EIoU (Deep Expansion Intersection over Union) is a multi-object tracking method that enhances object association in occlusion-heavy scenarios by combining IoU-based bounding box matching with deep feature embeddings. In the context of football match analysis, it leverages YOLOX as its object detector, but the detector's high computational demands become a bottleneck for real-time applications. This study proposes an optimization strategy combining architectural pruning, FP16 quantization, and TensorRT acceleration to reduce inference latency. The proposed method reduces YOLOX parameters from 99 million to 39.56 million. It enhances system throughput by 3.5x increasing from 4.22 to 14.84 FPS, without compromising tracking accuracy on NVIDIA T4 GPU hardware. The accuracy is validated by the Higher Order Tracking Accuracy (HOTA) metric. These results demonstrate a practical and efficient approach to improving detector performance in end-to-end multi-object tracking systems for sports analytics"

This field is highly relevant to real-world scenarios, holding significant practical implications. Currently, the field has only a few solutions, primarily relying on conventional methods such as metric learning and feature aggregation. However, these methods often struggle in more complex scenarios. Recent breakthroughs in foundation models such as CLIP and DINO have demonstrated their strong representational capabilities, even in resource-limited environments. These advancements have led to a shift from “training model from scratch” towards “exploiting the extensive capabilities and expertise of these pre-trained foundation models for OFSL”. Inspired by this shift, we introduce the Improved Collaborative Consortium of Foundation Models (CO<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">+</sup><sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sub>), an extension of CO<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sub>, first presented in AAAI 2024.

    "abstract": "Converter transformers are critical for the reliable operation of high-voltage direct current systems, yet they operate under harsh conditions involving high electrical stress, elevated temperatures, and mechanical vibrations. Conventional cellulose pressboard exhibits limited resistance to these combined stresses, which motivates the use of meta-aramid pressboard as a promising alternative insulation material. To elucidate the multi-field coupling aging mechanisms of meta-aramid pressboard, this study develops a thermal-electrical-mechanical multi-field coupling aging platform. The degree of polymerization is employed to quantitatively evaluate macroscopic aging progression. Scanning electron microscopy is used to observe surface morphology evolution, including fiber peeling, microcrack generation, and pore formation, while X-ray diffraction characterizes changes in crystal structure, diffraction intensity, crystallinity, and microcrystalline size at different aging stages. Breakdown strength is measured to evaluate the evolution of dielectric withstand capability under different aging conditions. Furthermore, molecular dynamics simulations are carried out to calculate cohesive energy density and the number of hydrogen bonds under different field combinations, providing molecular-scale insight into structural deterioration. The results indicate that thermal aging induces more pronounced microstructural and mechanical degradation of the meta-aramid pressboard than electrical or mechanical loading, while superimposed electrical and mechanical stresses mainly act to further intensify the deterioration caused by thermal aging. Overall, the combined action of thermal, electrical, and mechanical stresses produces a synergistic effect that significantly accelerates the hierarchical degradation of meta-aramid pressboard."

The models were assessed using accuracy, F1 score, and ROC AUC metrics. This study shows that the LTP with Random Forest classifier achieved the highest accuracy of 90.71%.

Among their many applications, text generation stands out as a particularly impactful domain, sometimes even involving high-stakes decision-making. As more LLMs are developed, a growing number of evaluation methods and metrics have also emerged to assess their performance. Although recent advances have introduced several new evaluation techniques, this document reaffirms the continued relevance of Statistical, Embedding, and Distance-based evaluation metrics. In today's landscape, characterized by numerous tools and overlapping approaches, it is often challenging to determine the most appropriate metric for a given task. This work aims to provide clarity by suggesting suitable metrics for specific text generation tasks. We center our analysis on the task of Question-Answering, using it as a case study to demonstrate how carefully selected evaluation metrics can meaningfully distinguish the performance of three state-of-the-art LLMs. Our findings suggest that employing a small set of well-chosen metrics is effective and sufficient for robust model evaluation."

    "abstract": "Small object detection is an indispensable challenge in computer vision due to issues such as low resolution, background clutter, and occlusion. This study conducts a comparative evaluation of four prominent YOLO (You Only Look Once) variants, namely, YOLOv3, YOLOv5 (n, m, x), YOLOv8 (n, m, x), and YOLOv12 (n, m, x) for their effectiveness in detecting small objects on a curated MS COCO subset. Models are evaluated using mAP@0.5, mAP@0.5:0.95, precision, recall, and inference speed. The analysis indicate consistent gains with each generation in both accuracy and localization precision. YOLOv12x outperformed all other variants with mAP@0.5 = 0.846, mAP@0.5:0.95 = 0.7419, Precision = 0.6022, and Recall = 0.2666. However, it marginally surpassed YOLOv3 in fine-grained accuracy while matching its coarse localization. YOLOv12m demonstrated a strong balance between speed and accuracy, making it viable choice for balanced workloads. YOLOv8x also performed competitively with mAP@0.5 of 0.8051 and an improved recall over YOLOv5x. The ultralight variants like YOLOv8n and YOLOv12n maintained a reasonable detection accuracy with less than 90s inference speed. Thus, making them ideal for edge and resource constrained deployments. The study also revealed that the recent models exhibit smaller reductions in mAP@0.5 and mAP@0.5:0.95, reflecting that bounding box regression and spatial accuracy under stricter IoU thresholds has generationally improved. YOLOv3, while achieving good performance in coarse detection was less performant in recall and fine localization, illustrating the impact of modern enhancements such as anchor-free prediction, and attention-based feature aggregation. The results validate that the improvement in performance of small object detection are due to the architectural evolution in YOLO family. High-end models, such as YOLOv12x achieve state-of-the-art accuracy for precision-dependent tasks, while lightweight variants offer competitive real-time detections for embedded and resource-constrained environments, broadening the applicability of YOLO models to diverse computer vision applications."

    "abstract": "To develop scenarios for post-war reconstruction of Ukraine, in particular the measures to stabilize the functioning of war-damaged territories, it is necessary to assess the land cover ecological state based on comprehensive system monitoring. Currently, there are no comprehensive quantitative assessments that combine multiparametric analysis of physical, hydrological properties of the surface soil layer and land cover parameters using high spatial resolution satellite data. The purpose of this article is to create a model for assessing land cover ecological state of southern Ukraine based on satellite data with high spatial resolution (10 m) to analyze the consequences of the Kakhovka Reservoir shallowing. To form an integrated ecological state index (ESI), the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) method is used for four main indicators: normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), land surface temperature (LST), moisture deficit in the surface soil layer (SSMD) and drought severity index (DSI). Sentinel, Landsat and MODIS satellite data, as well as machine learning methods, are used to calculate the values of the indicators. The ESI allows for a quantitative and qualitative assessment of the land cover state. Analysis of long-term ESI data showed a significant deterioration in the ecological state of the studied territory. The average index value decreased by 17.3% over 2019 2024, with the sharpest deterioration observed in 2022-2024 (a decrease of 15.5%). Qualitative analysis revealed that the area of favorable zones decreased by almost half (–49%), while the area of problem zones increased by 59%. If in 2019–2022 the distribution of zones remained relatively stable (the share of problem zones increased only from 33.9% to 34.8%), then in 2022 2024 there were sharp changes (an increase to 53.9%), likely caused by increased drought conditions and the consequences of the destruction of the Kakhovka HPP. The developed model with 10 m resolution enables ecological state assessment, land degradation detection and restoration planning, irrigation optimization in water-scarce conditions, evaluation of crop production potential and food security, monitoring of territories where ground surveys are impossible, and evidence-based support for land management and post-war recovery."

Moreover, fixed PID parameters are incapable of adapting to dynamic environments. To address these issues, we have designed a self-tuning PID controller based on error backpropagation and developed a controller optimization system using Q-learning and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). To reduce computational load during operation and meet the real-time requirements of motor speed control, we introduced the concept of pre-training. By pre-training an optimized control system framework in a high-level simulation environment and then transferring it to a low-computation motor control platform, we enable real-time fine-tuning of parameters during operation. Experimental results demonstrate that the designed controller exhibits rapid response and minimal overshoot, maintains good control performance under load variations, effectively bypasses the complex tuning process, and significantly enhances the precision and stability of the control system."

    "abstract": "The rapid development of wireless communication technology has increased the demand for compact, efficient, and high-performance multiband antennas in MIMO systems. This research proposes a tri-band MIMO antenna design with an F-shaped patch configuration, incorporating an integrated meander line structure with parasitic elements and a defected ground structure (DGS) to reduce mutual coupling. The main aim of this design is to support three primary frequency bands- L-band, sub- 6 GHz, and ISM bands- simultaneously without enlarging the overall size. The antenna features two ports and is developed using the Particle Swarm Optimisation algorithm to enhance performance metrics such as reflection coefficient (S11), bandwidth, gain, envelope correlation coefficient, and diversity gain. Simulation results indicate that the antenna achieves a reflection coefficient of -47.02 dB, a VSWR as low as 1.01, a gain of up to 4.58 dBi, a maximum bandwidth of 1.10 GHz, an ECC below 0.01, and a diversity gain approaching 10 dBi. These results demonstrate significant advantages, making it a promising option for next-generation wireless applications like 5G, IoT, and portable devices."

This paper explores the application of quantum computing to NP-complete problems, and by focusing on the Graph Coloring Problem (GCP) we benchmark the performance of two prominent quantum computing devices: D-Wave's quantum annealer and IBM's gatebased quantum processors. After mapping instances of the GCP native formulation, we evaluate the effectiveness and limitations of quantum annealing and gate-based approaches in tackling such combinatorial problems. For annealers, the problem is cast into Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) forms, while gate-based quantum devices employ variational algorithms like the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA).

    "abstract": "With the increasing complexity, scope, and diversity of modern cyber threats, vulnerability assessment enabled by AI is increasingly essential for cloud-based platforms such as Salesforce CRM. The existing system is dominated by rule-based scanning and human audits, but it lacks flexibility and scalability, resulting in a significant number of false positives, especially in dynamic, multi-tenant setups. The strategy relies on artificial intelligence. To solve these problems, the paper suggests using an AI-based method that combines machine learning models like Isolation Forest for spotting unusual activities, Random Forest for identifying threats, and LSTM for analyzing behavior to find configuration errors, new threats, and suspicious user actions in real time. Contextual risk prioritization and visual reporting give insights into remedial stages for automated remediation. The performance evaluations show that these outperform with the greatest detection accuracy of 95.2%, the highest true positive rate of 91.2%, the fewest false positives of 8.8%, and the shortest detection delay of 7.6 seconds. These enhancements demonstrate that the outlined system is a very efficient, effective, and scalable method for safeguarding Salesforce CRM instances."

Examples include the hypothesis that machine learning may soon be able to relieve employees of some of their duties, which could lead to better processes or the capacity to identify the most effective ways to complete tasks. The goal of Work-life balance means keeping a good balance between a person's personal life and their job. The IT industry has grown a lot and is now an important part of the country's economy. As time has passed, more people working in IT have started to focus on balancing their personal and professional lives. Employers need to support their workers in achieving this balance life in order to maintain employee motivation. Employers can assess and analyse their employees' WLB using a variety of methods, including ML and questionnaires. This study used effort and work-life balance metrics to categorise employees according to turnover rates. This is accomplished by machine learning, which includes ensemble learning (EL) strategies. The k-NN and Navie Bayes algorithms produced the worst results in this investigation, whereas the BRDT algorithm produced the best.

    "abstract": "Received Signal Strength (RSS)-based Wi-Fi localization offers a cost-effective solution for multi-floor indoor location estimation. However, its accuracy is often degraded by signal fading, multipath propagation, and device heterogeneity, posing major challenges to reliable localization. Recent studies have increasingly employed deep neural networks due to their ability to extract meaningful patterns from RSS data; however, these models require substantial computational resources and extensive parameter tuning, which limits their adaptability across diverse dynamic environments. To address these limitations, we propose DELLoc-RT, a localization framework integrating Dynamic Ensemble Learning (DELLoc) with RSS Transformation (RT) for accurate, efficient, and adaptable multi-floor indoor localization. The RT module applies Sigmoid-scaled normalization and confidence weighting to convert RSS values into compact, learnable features. DELLoc employs multiple base learners optimized via the Tree-structured Parzen Estimator with a pruning strategy (TPE-PS) that accelerates convergence by focusing on promising configurations. Additionally, Iterative Ensemble Optimization with Stepwise Selection (IEO-SS) selects complementary learners to enhance overall performance. Experimental results demonstrate that DELLoc-RT achieves floor classification accuracies of 93.32%, 94.38%, and 94.02% on the UJIIndoorLoc, UTSIndoorLoc, and Tampere datasets, respectively, with mean Euclidean errors (MEE) of 10.63 m, 7.87 m, and 8.19 m. These results highlight the model’s strong adaptability across diverse datasets. Evaluation on a self-constructed dataset further confirms that DELLoc-RT delivers high accuracy and efficiency while substantially reducing the need for manual tuning, enabling rapid deployment in practical scenarios."

This paper examines the use of SNNs in simulating synaptic activity in large-scale brain simulations, focusing on their capacity to accurately reproduce the complex mechanisms of neuronal communication and plasticity. Unlike conventional neural networks, SNN s use accurate spike timing and temporal coding to replicate synaptic contacts. This facilitates a more authentic depiction of brain processes such as learning, memory, and signal transmission. This study investigates the key characteristics of spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) to illustrate the ability of SNNs to represent synaptic plasticity and adaptability in neural circuits accurately. It demonstrates with a sequence of simulations that SNN s accurately represent the complex synaptic dynamics and provide a valuable understanding of the fundamental processes involved in cortical processing. The results emphasize the potential of SNN s to enhance our comprehension of brain function and to construct advanced neurocomputational models for future study."

These methods enable the efficient use of the available spectrum, leading to increased data rates, lower latency, and improved reliability, all of which are fundamental for supporting the applications envisioned for these networks. By optimizing beamforming, networks can achieve more precise directional signal transmission, reducing interference and increasing capacity. Similarly, power optimization ensures that the transmission power is used judiciously, extending battery life in user devices and reducing overall energy consumption. These improvements are essential for meeting the ever-growing demand for higher data throughput and better quality of service in modern wireless communication systems. This article explores how optimization methods can be applied to finetune transmission power of beamforming antennas with various transmit and receive patterns, ultimately maximizing overall channel capacity. We employed these optimization techniques to identify the highest achievable total channel capacity by identifying the optimal beamforming steering vectors for both transmitters and receivers. Among the seven optimization methods evaluated, Genetic Algorithm, Hill Climbing, and Shotgun Hill Climbing consistently demonstrated superior performance achieving up to 99.7% accuracy which making them the most effective approaches when considering both accuracy and execution time. The goal of this approach is to improve the efficiency and performance of 5G and 6G networks while also minimizing energy consumption."

We, therefore, consider multiple deep learning approaches with a focus on the Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) that is enhanced by the Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) to analyze the mixed-coded texts accurately. With a test accuracy of 91.7 %, our model can capacitate in cases with problems created by code-switching and colloquialism. The results, reveal to what extent BiLSTM with GRU can capture the changes in context and semantics' cohesion in the Hinglish video comments.

Through a novel secondary-modulation technique, the current fed dual active bridge topology achieves natural voltage clamping across the primary-side devices and resolves the long-standing issue of voltage spikes across devices during turn-off, this solution eliminates unnecessary snubbers or clamping circuits. As a result, converter is snubber-free, characterized by reduced hardware complexity, enhanced compactness, and improved cost-effectiveness. By enabling zero current switching on the primary side and zero-current turn-on switching on the secondary side, converter effectively reduces switching losses. A 1.5 kW hardware has been designed, and results are demonstrated."

Traditional methods for computing BTD either unrealistically assume the number of blocks and block ranks are known or require exhaustive tuning of these parameters. While sparsity-promoting regularization has been introduced to estimate these parameters more efficiently, it still requires regularization parameter tuning. Bayesian learning addresses these issues by employing sparsity-promoting priors on the number of blocks and block ranks, but so far is limited to fully observed BTD tensors. To process incomplete BTD tensors, only a few optimization-based methods have been proposed, and they continue to suffer from heavy parameter tuning. To enable tuning-free BTD completion, a prior that simultaneously enforces block-wise sparsity and withinblock column-wise sparsity while incorporating graph structure is introduced within the Bayesian framework. Besides theoretically establishing the legitimacy of the prior distribution, a mean-field design is developed to obtain a closed-form updating variational inference (VI) algorithm without loss of graph information. Extensive experiments on both synthetic datasets and real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over existing optimization-based algorithms and the Bayesian model without graph information, in terms of rank learning, tensor recovery, and factor recovery."

    "abstract": "Exoskeletons are nowadays at the core of research for human enhancement, rehabilitation and prevention of musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs). MSDs are one of the major causes of long-term disability and illness among workers, and some of them could be prevented by the use of exoskeletons. However, the control of those devices is not always intuitive, and thus, they are poorly accepted. Some control methods using surface electromyography (sEMG) information are currently under research and give promising results. This paper aims to introduce a robust sEMG-based intention detection relying on an LSTM neural network. The method consists of collecting three channels of sEMG together with the position and acceleration angle and rotational speed of the end effector to teach a long short-term memory neural network to predict the angle of contraction of the elbow. The negative effect of external factors on the prediction, such as the presence of load in the hand or the differences between individuals, are highlighted, and the benefits of calibration methods to solve this problem are presented."

    "abstract": "One significant way to address privacy, security, and revocability concerns in biometric systems is through cancelable biometrics. For efficient iris recognition, this paper presents a deep learning-based model that combines cancelable template generation techniques with hybrid convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures. Two benchmark datasets, MMU Iris and Cornea Iris, are used, with preprocessing involving Gaussian filtering and hold-out validation. Hybrid feature extraction models that integrate MobileNetV3Small, InceptionNetV3, EfficientNetB0, DenseNet121, and XceptionNet are utilized to obtain highly discriminative iris features. Ten transformation methods, i.e., Gaussian Random Projection, Bio-Hashing, Deep Hashing, Homomorphic Noise, and Block Permutation, are evaluated systematically for cancelability. With up to 99.32% accuracy and an EER of 0.027 on the Cornea dataset and 97.78% accuracy and an EER of 0.044 on the MMU dataset, experimental results demonstrate that Block Permutation offers the best trade-off between recognition accuracy and template security. From the hybrid models, MobileNetV3Small + InceptionNetV3 and XceptionNet + MobileNetV3Small are always at the top. Experiments validate that hybrid CNNs combined with lightweight cancelable transformations have the capability to maintain high recognition performance and guarantee non-invertibility, revocability, and diversity, making the method highly applicable to robust secure biometric authentication in real-world scenarios."

    "abstract": "This research work proposes the use of the Glowworm Swarm Optimization technique for the integration in to mesh networks to improve their self-healing and optimization function. Mesh networks, as is well understood, consists of nodes that can dynamically communicate with each other; the lack of centralized controller, while being beneficial in many ways, entails that different protocols need self-healing capabilities to ensure that communication is maintained in situations where one or more nodes are offline or the network is otherwise disrupted. Known methods of self-healing for software applications are not very efficient when it comes to the scalability and flexibility, which can become major issues when it is applied to rapidly changing surroundings. To tackle these issues, we mount a GSO-based approach enhancing routing paths, load balancing and fault tolerance in mesh network. In fact, the GSO algorithm that mimic the light emitting capacity of glowworms is ideal in solving large optimization problems in real time. The framework that has been proposed in this paper was thoroughly validated with the help of numerical simulations based on the datasets characterizing the different network settings. These conclusions show that the proposed GSO-based approach provide better results for the recovery time, the network throughput, the energy consumption and the delivery packet ratio than the excluding strategies. Thus, this work advances the improvement to the robustness and reliability of mesh networks while offering future use cases in various fields including military, disaster management, the Internet of Things(IoT)."

    "abstract": "Combinatorial optimization problems are central to addressing complex decision-making challenges in finance and represent a promising avenue for demonstrating quantum advantage using near-term quantum hardware. While significant progress has been made in encoding unconstrained optimization problems into Hamiltonian formulations for quantum computing, constrained optimization problems remain an open challenge. The knapsack problem, a class of NP-hard constrained combinatorial optimization problems, exemplifies this issue. Existing Hamiltonian encodings for knapsack problems typically employ either a prohibitive number of slack variables, exceeding the qubit capacity of current quantum devices, or unbalanced penalty methods that demand extensive parameter tuning to achieve the optimal solutions. This paper introduces a novel Hamiltonian formulation that addresses these limitations by requiring only two slack variables and significantly reducing the need for penalty parameter calibration. Experiments conducted on a quantum annealer for small-scale instances demonstrate the proposed method's superior performance compared to existing approaches, achieving higher success rates in locating the optimal solutions while maintaining hardware feasibility. The results highlight the potential of this formulation to advance the practical application of quantum optimization to constrained combinatorial problems in finance and beyond."

    "abstract": "Acoustic emission provides an effective, nondestructive method for assessing the well-being of high-voltage equipment, enabling engineers to identify failures at an early stage and thereby improve the safety and reliability of electricity systems. This paper examines how saliency methods can be used to enhance partial-discharge identification in environments with heavy noise. The convolutional neural network was designed and trained to work with experimentally recorded acoustic-emission waveforms, which include three different classes: hot-spot events, partial discharges, and ambient noise. After training, five types of saliency visualization were used to produce complementary saliency maps. The automatic process of choosing the most informative maps was based on the comparison to the weighted-average deletion score. The selection strategy was validated by retraining the network on 50% of the best salient regions, based on the best maps, as inbound masks. Further variants of the models were trained using the best 50% of salient regions in each map in order to compare the results. Examples of experimental findings demonstrate that the model using optimally chosen saliency masking achieves a classification accuracy of 95.01%, equivalent to that of a full spectrogram with no masking. The results indicate that saliency-directed masking in terms of weighted-average deletion score will enable the preservation of a high detection rate and focus computational resources on the most important acoustic features. The method is, therefore, a potential route for improving the process of partial-discharge diagnosis in real high-voltage installations, which will eventually aid in achieving reliability in the grids."

The developed system relies on CNNs using Xception and MobileNet architectures and performs on a lowcost hardware accelerator, enabling low-computational-cost and real-time operation. The proposed system analytically examines the images to identify subtle inconsistencies at a pixel level, as well as compression artifacts. Whenever a forgery is detected, it outputs a visual heat-map that localizes the tampered regions and gives users timely insights about the integrity of an image. It may become a useful enabler in the realms of digital forensics, journalism, and social media moderation through its capabilities as a robust, non-invasive, and accessible tool for integrity verification."

Our work consists of two parts. One is closely related to the technical details of electric wheelchairs and is based on a lot of reverse-engineering. The other one is more high-level, consisting of a system design that is no longer specific to wheelchairs, but can be applied to other mobile platforms as well. We equipped a wheelchair with cameras and positioning sensors to make it drive autonomously across the campus, showing that we have control over it. The proposed higher-level system design is very flexible to make it usable for a wide range of projects. As our main focus, we show how the system can be tailored to the requirements of wheelchair users. We anticipate that it will be used to create innovative user interfaces for wheelchairs in the future, improving safety, comfort, mobility and independence of users."

Reducing electrodes enhances portability but its effects on neural source reconstruction quality and source connectivity - treated as proxies to BCI performance - remain understudied. We address this gap through systematic evaluation of 62-, 32-, and 16-channel configurations using a fixed, fully automated processing pipeline applied to the well-characterized P300 potential. This approach's rationale is to minimize variability and bias inherent to EEG analysis by leveraging the P300's stimulus-locked reproducibility and pipeline standardization. Analyzing 63 sessions (31 subjects) from the Eye-BCI dataset with rigorous artifact correction and channel validation, we demonstrate: (1) Progressive degradation in source reconstruction quality with sparser configurations, including obscured deep neural generators and spatiotemporal distortions; (2) A novel <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\sqrt{R_{\\mathrm{e}}}$</tex> scaling law linking electrode reduction ratio <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$(R_{e})$</tex> to localization accuracy - a previously unquantified relationship to the best of our knowledge; (3) While reduced configurations preserve basic P300 topography and may suffice for communicative BCIs, higher-density channels are essential for reliable deep source reconstruction. Overall, this study establishes a first step towards quantitative benchmarks for electrode selection, with critical implications for clinical BCIs requiring anatomical precision in applications like neurodegenerative disease monitoring, where compromised spatial resolution could mask pathological signatures.

First, this paper integrates constellation orbital and component information and time-frequency domain features to construct multi-satellite graph data.

This study aimed to extract radiomic features from the grey matter (GM) of structural brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of seventy-five healthy control (HC) subjects, to classify them based on age-related differences. Subjects were classified as “young” and “old” using the median age as a reference, excluding those within a range of ten years around the median. T1-weighted anatomical scans were acquired for all participants, and MRI images were preprocessed before radiomic feature extraction. A total of 107 features, including shape, first order and texture, were collected. Several machine learning (ML) algorithms-Extra Tree Classifier (ETC), Random Forest (RF), XGBoost (XGB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Linear Regression (LR), and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)-were employed to classify HCs in the two groups. Additionally, the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis was carried out to identify the most informative radiomic features contributing to brain age estimation. Most classifiers achieved performance metrics exceeding 0.80, with LR yielding the best results: an accuracy of 0.86 <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$(\\pm 0.09)$</tex>, sensitivity of 0.88 <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$(+0.12)$</tex> and specificity of 0.84 <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$(\\pm 0.10)$</tex>, in terms of mean (±standard deviation).

This paper presents an immersive “Learning-Assessment” application developed in Unity for the Meta Quest 3 headset to teach safe and efficient operation of a metal lathe. The system integrates three main components: (1) an interactive learning module introducing machining principles and tool-workpiece interactions, (2) an adaptive assessment module based on dynamic multiple-choice questions (MCQs) to evaluate theoretical understanding, and (3) a real-time gesture and posture monitoring module using artificial intelligence (AI). The latter relies on OpenPose for skeletal keypoint extraction and a convolutional neural network (CNN) for detecting hazardous or ergonomically incorrect postures. The proposed AI pipeline was optimized for on-device execution and validated on a dedicated dataset of lathe-operation gestures. Initial experiments with 20 novice participants demonstrated an 85% posture-detection accuracy, a 90% recognition rate for critical hazardous postures, and a 35% reduction in gestural errors after three learning sessions. User feedback also indicated strong engagement and perceived safety (mean score: 4.6/5). These results highlight the potential of the proposed system as an effective, interactive, and ergonomically compliant VRbased training solution for mechanical manufacturing."

    "abstract": "The landscape of software engineering has undergone rapid transformation with the emergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) coding assistants, which are being increasingly integrated into development workflows to boost productivity and automate routine tasks. Although modern AI coding assistants, such as Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, and many others, can automatically access entire repositories, they operate as black boxes: developers cannot see or control what context drives AI decisions. This automatic operation creates uncertainty about whether critical dependencies, security configurations, or test files are considered. We present Lumen, an open-source tool that takes a fundamentally different approach: preserving developer control through transparent context assembly. Using a double-copy interaction paradigm that leverages natural clipboard behavior, Lumen instantly shows developers the dependency graph and AI-generated summaries of files connected to their copied code. This allows developers to create AI-generated code where the model uses the same context that the developer is focusing on. This design philosophy, which incorporates human-in-the-loop capabilities with full visibility, lays the foundation for future agentic capabilities, ensuring that developers understand and control what the AI sees and does. We demonstrate through Cognitive Walkthrough Analysis how Lumen reduces context assembly overhead while maintaining the transparency necessary for production code. Our open-source implementation provides a foundation for the community to build upon, developing AI tools that enhance rather than replace human judgment."

    "abstract": "Over the past decade, several studies have proposed optimization strategies targeting components of Electro-Adhesive Devices (EAD) to enhance their performance in terms of normal or shear grasping force. Notably, the comb-shaped interdigitated geometry, widely used in EAD grasping applications, has demonstrated superior shear force performance. While many studies have focused on determining the optimal electrode geometry for specific applications, employing analytical models and finite element method (FEM) simulations of electrostatic interdigitated systems, few studies have systematically explored the optimal combination of electrode gap and width, incorporating an empirical evaluation. However, the EAD performance is often influenced by several physical factors related to the manufacturing process and environmental conditions, which are neglected by analytical and numerical models. This work presents an empirical-statistical method for optimizing EADs through a study based on the Design of Experiments (DoE) technique. EADs comprising two comb-shaped electrodes are fabricated using the Drop on Demand inkjet printing technique to deposit a silver-based ink on thin polyethylene terephthalate (PET) film. By varying the gap and width, and by assessing shear force through shear stress tests, the best combination for grasping a given material is determined, providing a suitable benchmark for selecting the appropriate device geometry for a specific application. Tests on a conductive substrate resulted in less intense electro-adhesive phenomena than tests on a dielectric substrate. In both cases, increasing the electrode gap decreased the shear stress. However, reducing electrode width led to opposite effects: shear stress increased on the dielectric substrate, but decreased on the conductive one."

A YOLOv8 object detection model is employed for real-time classification of biodegradable waste using images captured from a camera positioned above the conveyor belt. Metal and plastic waste are identified through inductive and capacitive proximity sensors, respectively, based on their electromagnetic and dielectric properties. An Arduino Uno serves as the central controller, synchronizing sensor inputs and operating servo-actuated diverters to route each waste item to its designated bin. Experimental evaluations demonstrate reliable classification and multi-stage separation of biodegradable, metal, and plastic waste with minimal human intervention. The proposed system offers a scalable, low-cost, and practical solution suitable for smart cities, public infrastructures, and decentralized waste management environments."

The framework can quickly process large-scale, high-dimensional financial data. By optimizing the task decomposition and parallel execution mechanism of MapReduce distributed computing, it effectively improves the efficiency of data processing and the adaptability of the system. This paper selects multiple public financial data sets for simulation tests.

In addition, the system performs particularly well when processing high-dimensional data. The experimental data show that its data throughput rate reaches up to 1.2 GB per second. This result shows that the optimized MapReduce algorithm cannot only quickly cope with massive data, but also maintain excellent computing performance under the condition of complex high-dimensional features. The experiment also further verifies the scalability and robustness of the system.

    "abstract": "In recent years, renewable energies have experienced exponential growth in power systems. However, an excess of renewable energy in a specific area can generate reverse power flows in transmission lines, overvoltages, and overloads. Therefore, analyzing the hosting capacity in distribution systems is essential to ensure the proper integration of renewable energies into the distribution network. Initially, an IEEE 13-Bus Distribution Network was selected and modeled using OpenDSS software, and through the integration of Python with OpenDSS, a binary search algorithm was applied to determine the hosting capacity at each node. The results show that hosting capacity decreases as the distance from the substation increases and is higher when closer to it. Additionally, they reveal that high levels of uncontrolled renewable energy penetration can compromise the reliability of the electrical grid by exceeding critical technical limits, such as the current-carrying capacity of conductors, transformer overloads, and over-voltages. Based on the proposed methodology, it is possible to increase the hosting capacity of distribution networks with a proper integration strategy by monitoring the growth of renewable energy."

High-speed chiplet communication depends heavily on the accuracy of quadrature clock phases, and even small deviations can disturb the setup and hold margins required for reliable data transfer. To overcome these issues, the proposed design brings phase alignment and duty-cycle adjustment together in a single control loop. This integrated approach helps the system settle more quickly, lowers switching noise, and strengthens overall signal integrity. The receiver in a UCIe link relies on a tight phase relationship, where data transitions occur at 0° and 180°, and clock transitions are positioned at 90° and 270°. Preserving this relationship across process and voltage variations is critical for consistent operation. The circuit is implemented using a $65-\\mathrm{nm}$ CMOS technology and powered by a 1 -V supply, achieving data rates of up to 6 Gbps. Simulation results show noticeable improvement in phase accuracy and duty-cycle stability, even under varying operating conditions. These results highlight the suitability of the proposed approach for building efficient, high-performance UCIe interfaces in nextgeneration chiplet-based systems."

Informer, a modified version of Transformer, was specifically designed for Long Sequence Time-series Forecasting (LSTF). Introduced in year 2021, Informer is still considered a new algorithm, and its implementation in NTP requires comparison with the commonly used algorithm, such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). One of the challenges in NTP is whether an algorithm can be implemented in different network traffic dataset (NTD). Hence, this research has compared LSTM and Informer using 3 different NTDs namely Abilene, GEANT, and CBT datasets. Informer showed slightly better performance in irregular behavior NTDs, such as Abilene and CBT, and a considerable superior performance in a regular behavior NTD, such as GEANT. In terms of MSE and $\\mathbf{R}^{\\mathbf{2}}$, Informer achieved almost 8 times and 0.14 units better than LSTM respectively. Furthermore, RMSE and MAE results showed approximately 0.35 GB and 0.25 GB error differences between LSTM and Informer. Despite that, a balance between performance and computational efficiency needs to be established, as LSTM entails a lower computational burden compared to Informer."

To substantiate the efficacy and interplay of the components within the upgraded YOLOv5s network, the study conducts ablation experiments, juxtaposing the performance of the enhanced YOLOv5s algorithm against other algorithms using a shared dataset of pine wilt disease. The findings reveal that the proposed algorithm markedly enhances the model's capability to detect diseased wood, with a negligible impact on computational demand."

Conventional manual inspection approaches are resource-intensive, time-consuming, and costly, highlighting the need for solutions based on computer vision. This paper presents an improved YOLOv8-based detection model, YOLOv8-SF, tailored for high-precision and lightweight chip defect detection. The proposed model integrates two key enhancements: the Squeeze-and-Excitation attention mechanism and the C2f_Faster module. The SE mechanism enhances chip defect detection by emphasizing important features through adaptive channel weighting. The C2f_Faster module, replacing the traditional Bottleneck structure, reduces computational complexity while maintaining efficient chip defect feature extraction. Experimental results demonstrate that YOLOv8-SF achieves outstanding performance compared to mainstream YOLO models with mAP50 of 88.6% and mAP50-95 of 72%, while maintaining low computational demands with 6.4 GFLOPS, making it highly suitable for industrial environments. Ablation experiments validate the effectiveness of the individual improvements, showing their contributions to both detection accuracy and computational efficiency. Furthermore, comparative experiments confirm that YOLOv8-SF outperforms existing YOLO models in detecting chip defects under complex conditions. This study not only introduces a lightweight and accurate detection framework for chip inspection but also provides valuable insights for developing high-performance object detection models in other industrial applications. Future work aims to improve this model's scalability and investigate its potential in wider industrial scenarios."

    "abstract": "Image classification of remote sensing images is an important task of environmental monitoring, urban planner and land use evaluation, but currently it is a problem because of the complexity and variability of aerial scenes. The classic methods tend to have problems with both intra-class variability and inter-class similarity, which are particularly acute in case of scarce labeled data and different imaging conditions. Based on the identification of these problems the present paper proposes a dual-path approach-GVF-SVM- that complements the handcrafted texture features using Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) with deep semantic representations learned using a ViT. The latter are concatenated by a fully connected layer and are then separated by a Support Vector Machine in the form of an RBF kernel, which is very non-linear in nature. What is new about it, though, is that it combines both classical and transformer-based paradigms into a single and explainable pipeline. The superiority of the method is proven by the experimental assessment of similarity on the UCMerced_LandUse dataset, which takes into account only eight classes of the most essential land use types and employs a thorough data augmentation strategy. GVF-SVM obtains a macro average accuracy of 93.76% and an overall better improvement rate over CNN s and transfer learning baselines. The findings highlight the efficacy and generalizability of the framework and hence it is a reliable candidate to remotely sense on a large-scale in real-life scenarios."

The key need of modern edge-based smart energy systems is efficient, privacy secured and intelligent energy management. This investigation provides a Federated Reinforcement Learning (FRL) approach that could enhance energy consumption of distributed edge devices and secure users' privacy. The objective is to enable residential or microgrid systems within the grid to work as a collective to design effective control policies through the exchange of model parameters, without requiring raw data. Integrated to the proposed framework are Deep Q-Networks (DQNs) and Federated Averaging (FedAvg) and the performance under these conditions is assessed using the real-world Smart dataset which emulates interactions with 10 non-lID residential clients. Each agent itself tapers based on local data and synchronizes model parameters to the central server periodically. The system's primary elements are adaptive reward tuning, battery-conscious state representations, and economical communication techniques. Analysis reveals that the proposed FRL framework produces 14.7% energy savings, a 19.3% improvement of battery use, and 32% data transmission cost decrease compared. The framework demonstrates effective convergence and is easily adaptable to various client settings. This research verifies the efficiency of federated reinforcement learning to provide scalable, secure and efficient methods of energy optimization in real-world smart grid environments."

This paper adopts the DQN algorithm, uses multiple variables such as ESG ratings, market risks, and corporate financial status as state inputs, and financing decisions (such as financing amount, financing interest rate, etc.) as actions. The optimization goal is to reduce financing costs and risks. The experimental results show that with the improvement of ESG ratings, the financing costs of enterprises show a significant downward trend, and the reinforcement learning model is more flexible than the traditional fixed rule financing model to adapt to changes in the market environment and effectively reduce financing costs. Specific data experiments show that when the ESG rating of an enterprise increases by 10%, its financing cost can be reduced by about 3.2%, and the prediction accuracy of the model is as high as 94%. In addition, in the process of optimizing financing decisions, the model can also flexibly adjust strategies and improve financing efficiency, which is crucial to the enhanced ability of reinforcement learning in dealing with complex decision-making problems. The research in this paper not only provides an innovative financing optimization method for the financial field, but also provides new ideas for the application of ESG ratings in financing, and promotes the process of transformation in the financial field."

Among several TMS-evoked potential (TEP) metrics, the absolute area under the curve (AUC) reflects the total energy of the post-stimulus response. However, the extent to which pre-stimulus neural features influence these responses remains unclear. This study presents a transparent machine learning pipeline to systematically evaluate how pre-stimulus spectral power and complexity measures predict post-stimulus TEPs. Methodological choices-including scaling techniques and feature selection methods (mutual information, LASSO, f-regression)-were rigorously compared and validated. The results demonstrate that gamma band power and Higuchi Fractal Dimension (HFD) consistently yield the highest predictive relevance. The best performance was achieved using the full feature set, suggesting a complementary role of spectral and nonlinear features. These findings emphasize the importance of methodological transparency and robust validation in TMS-EEG analysis. Future work may benefit from incorporating subject-specific modeling and connectivity-based features to enhance both prediction and neuroscientific insight."

    "abstract": "This paper proposes an intelligent recognition pattern system of user behavior in social networks based on data mining, which aims to efficiently identify and analyze user behavior patterns and provide support for user research and application development in social networks. The core of the system adopts an optimized matrix decomposition algorithm to process complex social network interaction data through deep mining and feature extraction, and accurately identify user behavior patterns. Compared with traditional algorithms, this method has significant advantages in the ability to process massive data and recognition accuracy. This paper combines multi-feature fusion technology to deeply integrate multi-dimensional data of user behavior. The matrix decomposition algorithm is optimized in a targeted manner in the design, so that it can more efficiently process complex network structures and dynamic interaction data. Simulation tests on real social network data sets show that the system performs well in key indicators such as accuracy, recall rate and F1 value, reaching 93.7%, 91.2% and 92.4% respectively, which is significantly better than traditional methods. In addition, in large-scale data processing scenarios, the system shows good scalability and real-time performance, and can quickly adapt to changes in data scale and complexity."

    "abstract": "In this paper, an intelligent rebar binding system based on machine vision is proposed, aiming to realize automatic identification and precise positioning of rebar intersection points. The system adopts a multilevel vision scheme combining global and local cameras, realizes the global positioning of the mold by eight high-resolution industrial cameras, and completes the local scanning and reconstruction of the rebar intersection points by using depth cameras. For point cloud data processing, a planar filtering and multilinear fitting method based on Random Sampling Consistency (RANSAC) algorithm is proposed, which effectively solves the noise interference and feature extraction problems of rebar point cloud. Meanwhile, the system significantly improves the accuracy of visual measurement through monocular camera calibration and aberration correction techniques. In terms of eye-in-hand calibration, the system adopts the “Eye-in-hand” mode to establish an accurate transformation relationship between the camera coordinate system and the robot end coordinate system, which provides a reliable spatial reference for the lashing path planning. The experimental results show that the system can efficiently and accurately identify the rebar intersection points, which provides a practical solution for automated rebar tying."

    "abstract": "Urban trees are critical for regulating microclimates, improving air quality, and sustaining biodiversity, yet monitoring their health at scale remains challenging. Traditional sensor-based or manual inspection systems are costly, slow, and difficult to scale across large metropolitan areas. This paper presents GreenScan, a novel large-language-model (LLM) powered platform that integrates citizen participation, multimodal machine learning, and retrieval-augmented knowledge bases to monitor urban tree health in real time. Citizens submit text descriptions and images of trees through a web or mobile interface. Images are processed by a vision-language encoder that extracts descriptive features, while a retrieval-augmented LLM consults a curated forestry knowledge base to infer potential diseases, stressors, or environmental impacts. The system provides immediate, evidence-backed recommendations and generates aggregated analytics for urban planners and environmental agencies. Results from simulated datasets and publicly available plant pathology images demonstrate the framework’s scalability, low deployment cost, and high diagnostic relevance compared to traditional sensor-only approaches. GreenScan illustrates how LLMs can bridge knowledge retrieval, visual reasoning, and community engagement to deliver actionable insights for sustainable urban forestry."

The ex-periment consisted of 5 FGs - guided by two analysts and a set of Competency Questions (CQs) - with different numbers of participants, who were asked to share their opinions over a conceptual map in the fields of Medical Devices (MDs) and Health Technology Assessment (HTA). All experts had experience in adopting MDs. They were MD manufacturers, clinicians, HTA analysts, or managers responsible for introducing new MDs into healthcare facilities. This work sketches the qualitative results from the FGs' discussions and presents the quantitative results of a questionnaire aimed at investigating participants' perspectives on FGs experience; in particular, knowledge acquisition and flexibility features, satisfaction, perceived role, and collaboration were assessed. Although preliminary, the results indicate that FG has the potential to elicit implicit and tacit knowledge and that using CQs to guide the discussion can result in an enhanced domain analysis phase during Ontology Engineering."

To contribute to this debate, the present study assessed disturbance ratings for robots, androids, and humans images, described as either mindful or mindless. The results indicate that mismatched mind descriptions affect uncanniness only when the entity's appearance allows for clear category identification (e.g., a mindless human), whereas for perceptually ambiguous entities (e.g., an android), appearance alone determines the uncanny response."

Therefore, in this paper, the relevant theories and technologies of deep learning in the field of 3D reconstruction are systematically sorted out, and the network model suitable for the reconstruction of the grid structure is analyzed by convolutional neural network, and the mechanism of extracting the geometric features of the grid structure is discussed. Secondly, according to the characteristics of the grid structure data, a special data set is constructed. It has significantly improved the reconstruction accuracy and efficiency, and can accurately restore the spatial geometry of grid structure, provide high-precision 3D model."

    "abstract": "Accurate prediction of clinical scores is critical for early detection and prognosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). While existing approaches primarily focus on forecasting the ADASCog global score, they often overlook the predictive value of its sub-scores (13-items), which capture domain-specific cognitive decline. In this study, we propose a multi-task learning (MTL) framework that jointly predicts the global ADAS-Cog score and its sub-scores (13-items) at Month 24 using baseline MRI and longitudinal clinical scores from baseline and Month 6. The main goal is to examine how each sub-scores—particularly those associated with MRI features—contribute to the prediction of the global score, an aspect largely neglected in prior MTL studies. We employ Vision Transformer (ViT) and Swin Transformer architectures to extract imaging features, which are fused with longitudinal clinical inputs to model cognitive progression. Our results show that incorporating sub-score learning improves global score prediction. Subscore-level analysis reveals that a small subset—especially Q1 (Word Recall), Q4 (Delayed Recall), and Q8 (Word Recognition)—consistently dominates the predicted global score. However, some of these influential subscores exhibit high prediction errors, pointing to model instability. Further analysis suggests that this is caused by clinical feature dominance, where the model prioritizes easily predictable clinical scores over more complex MRI-derived features. These findings emphasize the need for improved multimodal fusion and adaptive loss weighting to achieve more balanced learning. Our study demonstrates the value of sub-score-informed modeling and provides insights into building more interpretable and clinically robust AD prediction frameworks. (Github repo provided)"

With the rapid advancement of wearable devices, Large Language Models (LLMs), Indoor Positioning Systems (IPS) and augmented reality, a new generation of EEWS is emerging. These new generation EEWS not only alert a user of the arrival of a potentially destructive seismic event, but are also able to actively support the operator working in the critical environment, during all phases of the seismic event by providing him with contextual safeguard information: to his actual state of health, to the place where he is at the time of the seismic event alert, maintaining a good degree of resilience to damage to the communication infrastructure both internal and external to the critical environment. This work aims to propose a Serious game in Virtual Reality (VR) that is essential both for developing this type of EEWS and in particular the development and validity of the workflow related to the management of the alert by the operator and as a training tool for the EEWS for real operators."

Traditional trust evaluation methods focused on static rules or subjective experts and struggled to address sophisticated terminal behaviors. To tackle this problem, this paper proposes an adaptive evaluation method for distribution terminals with multidimensional behavior features. Leveraging a random forest regression algorithm, the proposed method integrates terminal attributes to quantify terminal trust dynamically while autonomously learning the impact of behavior features without relying on predefined rules. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can identify five key behavioral factors with a cumulative contribution of over 90%, which can effectively evaluate the trustworthiness of distribution terminals. MSE, MAE and RSME of the evaluation model are close to 0, providing reliable support for secure access of different terminals in the distribution system."

    "abstract": "Regions of Interest (ROI) play a crucial role in point cloud compression, especially in applications such as autonomous driving and robot navigation, where foreground regions often contain key information such as obstacles and object boundaries. However, traditional point cloud compression methods typically fail to optimize for these critical areas, instead applying uniform processing across the whole point clouds. The paper aims to optimize the point cloud compression process by allocating more bitstream resources to the foreground regions, thereby preserving important information in the point clouds. To achieve this, we propose a separation-based Foreground-Background Network (FB-Net) for compressing point cloud. The framework first identifies and separates the foreground and background regions, then designs an attention-based compression network, which includes multi-stage Occupancy Probability Estimation (OPE) module. The OPE module consist of an Attention-based Feature Extraction Layer (AFEL) and an Occupancy Probability Generation (AOPG) module. By controlling the number of OPE modules, we can allocate more bitstream resources to critical regions in the scene point cloud, such as tables and chairs, thus improving the performance of downstream detection tasks. Furthermore, to compensate for perceptual distortions in human vision, we design a large-scale receptive field-based Point Cloud Upsampling Network (PCU-Net), to enhance the objective quality. Through extensive experiments on point cloud datasets such as ScanNet and SUN RGB-D, we demonstrate that allocating more bitstream resources to the foreground regions benefits the accuracy of detection tasks. Compared to G-PCC and many state-of-the-art learning-based point cloud compression methods, our approach shows superior performance in detection tasks than compression-then-detection process methods."

    "abstract": "As vehicle automation continues to progress to-wards full autonomy, the potential for increasingly sophisticated interactions between vehicles and traffic infrastructure presents new opportunities and challenges for improving the driving experience. One critical area is passenger comfort, particularly during transitions at signalized intersections. Vehicles that rely solely on onboard perception may respond abruptly to traffic signal changes, leading to uncomfortable acceleration or deceleration patterns. By leveraging vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication, automated systems could react in anticipation of signal transitions to enhance ride comfort and overall system efficiency. This study explores the potential benefits of V2I communication in enhancing passenger comfort at signalized intersections. Two operating scenarios are compared: one that relies exclusively on the car perception system, and another that incorporates V2I communication, which provides traffic signal timing data to the automated vehicle (AV). A co-simulation testbed integrating CARLA, Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2), ns-3, and MATLAB/Simulink is developed to model both scenarios and assess passenger comfort based on acceleration and deceleration metrics. The results show that V2I-enabled AVs achieve smoother and more predictable deceleration, reducing abrupt maneuvers and enhancing ride comfort without compromising safety. By quantifying these improvements, this work contributes to a better understanding of how V2I communication can enhance passenger experience while supporting safer and more anticipatory driving behaviors."

Automatized approaches for the prediction of ALS progression provide a more accurate and time-efficient alternative to the subjective and labor-intensive manual examination. This paper present the Neural Learning and Optimization Strategy (Neural-LOS) model, a novel advanced model for automatic ALS speech detection. Filters can well separate speech characteristics between ALS and non-ALS subjects and distinguish samples in a binary form. The investigation consists of two different classifiers: (i) a sample-based classifier that performs epoch-by-epoch classification of the speech samples, and (ii) a patient-based classifier that uses a majority voting mechanism over the sample-based classifier decisions, for each patient. Results indicate that this model is effective and in prospect, it has the ability to develop a low-cost, user-friendly tool which might be helpful for early screening of ALS."

    "abstract": "Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are currently drawing a great amount of interest as a key part of system defense. IDSs collect network traffic information from various points on the network or computer system and then use this information to secure the network. Distinguishing between normal and malicious network activities is challenging and time-consuming due to the large volume of data and complex patterns involved. Traditionally, an analyst must review extensive datasets to identify sequences of intrusion within network connections. Thus, there is a need for efficient methods to detect network intrusions that reflect current network traffic conditions. In this study, a novel method is proposed to identify intrusion characteristics for IDSs using a stacking classifier in machine learning. The method involves generating rules through classification by a stacking classifier that combines multiple models to improve prediction accuracy. These rules can identify intrusion characteristics and are implemented in the stacking classifier to not only detect the presence of intrusions but also to execute preventive actions by denying intrusions. The classification of attack types includes: Fuzzers, Analysis, Backdoors, DoS, Exploits, Generic, Reconnaissance, Shellcode, Worms, and Normal. The evaluation techniques used to assess the performance of the proposed method include Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). This approach aims to enhance the effectiveness of IDSs by leveraging the strengths of ensemble learning, thus providing a more robust and accurate detection and prevention mechanism for network intrusions."

The complexity and dynamics of financial markets make traditional time series models limited in capturing nonlinear relationships, and machine learning algorithms provide new ideas to cope with this situation. GBDT, as an integrated learning algorithm, demonstrates a powerful nonlinear fitting capability and feature selection function through the iterative combination of multiple decision trees. In this study, the GBDT model is first analyzed in detail and compared with traditional statistical models (e.g., ARIMA) and other machine learning models to evaluate its performance in stock price prediction in the U.S. financial market. Then, in order to improve the prediction effect of the model, this paper also carries out an in-depth study on the parameter optimization and sensitivity analysis of the GBDT model. Ultimately, it is shown that GBDT is highly adaptable in dealing with financial market data and can provide more accurate prediction results than traditional models."

IASSR employs sparse self-attention to filter irrelevant items and extract target embeddings, followed by an intent-aware filter that captures fine-grained item details to model dynamic user intent. The final fused representation predicts the next click. Experiments on Nowplaying and Tmall show that IASSR outperforms baselines in HR{@}10 and MRR{@}10. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of its core components: target embedding learning, intent-aware filtering, and item positional encoding."

    "abstract": "Multiagent path finding (MAPF) involves planning efficient paths for multiple agents to move simultaneously while avoiding collisions. In typical warehouse environments, agents are often sparsely distributed along aisles; however, increasing the agent density can improve space efficiency. When the agent density is high, it becomes necessary to optimize the paths not only for goal-assigned agents but also for those obstructing them. This study proposes a novel MAPF framework for high-density environments (MAPF-HD). Several studies have explored MAPF in similar settings using integer linear programming (ILP). However, ILP-based methods require substantial computation time to optimize all agent paths simultaneously. Even in small grid-based environments with fewer than 100 cells, these computations can take tens to hundreds of seconds. Such high computational costs render these methods impractical for large-scale applications such as automated warehouses and valet parking. To address these limitations, we introduce the phased null-agent swapping (PHANS) method. PHANS employs a heuristic approach to incrementally swap positions between agents and empty vertices. This method solves the MAPF-HD problem within a few seconds, even in large environments containing more than 700 cells. The proposed method has the potential to improve efficiency in various real-world applications, such as warehouse logistics, traffic management, and crowd control."

This paper brings up the gradual development of two SRAM controllers(controller five and controller six) depending on Finite State Machines (FSMs), which solved particular concerns resulting in a bus write-contention, smaller write-enable (WE) pulse width, and unconfirmed tristate control. The last architecture, Controller 6 brings a new burst-mode operation, full cycle WE compatibility, dedicated precharge stage, tristate safety to provide timing integrity and data asynchronous at high frequency range (50MHz and 100MHz). Simulation of the controller is implemented on xilinx Vivado, and post synthesis analysis done on Cadence Genus. Controller 6 exhibits better slack, lesser setup time and non-contention than earlier designs. It is also well-suited as an embedded system designed on FPGA using fast and reliable communication in SRAM because it is integration of friendly and has strong behavior."

Through the adoption of Internet of Things (IoT) including sensor, networks, real-time communications (MQTT, CoAP) and edge-cloud analysis, PV systems can continuously adapt to changes in the environment and faults can be identified with low latency. The performance of the system was assessed on a hybrid experimental configuration that involves the combination of physical hardware and MATLAB/ Simulink simulation platform. Results indicate that there has been an improvement of the daily energy yield by 12.8 percent and a substantial decrease in the time fault response time in IoT enhanced systems by 15 minutes to less than 30 seconds. Support Vector Machines and Random Forests machine learning algorithms were used to detect anomalies and did so with high accuracy. Scalable data analysis and visualization with hierarchical computing (edge, fog, cloud) was also implemented into the system architecture."

    "abstract": "Accurate assessment of energy expenditure is crucial for characterizing human metabolism and health. The gold standard method for measuring energy expenditure is indirect calorimetry in a metabolic chamber, which provides accurate estimates of metabolic rate under controlled conditions. However, the limited availability of metabolic chambers worldwide limits large-scale research and clinical applications. Wearable technologies offer a promising alternative, allowing continuous monitoring of key physiological parameters such as heart rate variability, electrodermal activity, and physical activity, all of which correlate with metabolic rate. This study integrates 24-hour metabolic chamber measurements and multimodal wearable sensor data to quantify day-night (diurnal-nocturnal) differences in energy expenditure and autonomic state. Physiological data were collected using two multimodal wearable devices: a textile-based smart t-shirt (Wearable Wellness System, Smartex) and a wrist-worn smartwatch (Embrace Plus, Empatica). In a preliminary sample of six healthy men, the median metabolic rate was 42% higher during the daytime compared to nighttime, mirroring a 3.1-fold increase in sympathetic electrodermal activity power during the day. During daytime, metabolic rate showed the strongest pooled Spearman correlations with heart rate variability features derived from the smart t-shirt: mean RR interval (average time between heartbeats; <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\rho=-0.37$</tex>), low-frequency <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$(\\rho=-0.31)$</tex>, and high-frequency <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$(\\rho=-0.28)$</tex> components. At night, tonic electrodermal activity (EDA) features from the smartwatch (Embrace Plus) were most informative, with the minimum (minTonic, lowest baseline skin conductance, <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\rho=0.36$</tex>) and mean (meanTonic, average baseline skin conductance, <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\rho=0.34$</tex>) values showing the highest associations. Synchronizing wearable-derived measures with continuous chamber calorimetry validates their ability to track diurnal metabolic dynamics and provides a foundation for large-scale metabolic monitoring, facilitating broader applications in health and metabolic research."

The methodology combined descriptive statistical analysis, hierarchical and k-means clustering, and principal component analysis (PCA) to identify capability gaps and perception patterns among institutional units. The results reveal an incipient level of KM maturity, characterized by limited documentation practices, weak internal policies, and underutilized technological infrastructure.

    "abstract": "Financial fraud not only causes huge financial losses to financial institutions, but also threatens the stability of the entire financial system. In order to effectively detect and prevent financial fraud, this study proposes a novel detection model based on Autoencoder feature learning and XGBoost, aiming to improve the accuracy and efficiency of financial fraud detection. We use Autoencoders for feature learning. An Autoencoder is a neural network structure that is trained to compress input data into a low-dimensional representation by an encoder, and then reconstruct the original input by a decoder. In doing so, the Autoencoder is able to capture the intrinsic patterns in the data and filter out the noise to extract more representative features. These characteristics not only retain the main information of the original data, but also better reflect the characteristics of potential fraud. The features extracted by the Autoencoder are fed into the XGBoost classifier. XGBoost is a gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT)-based machine learning algorithm known for its efficiency, flexibility, and excellent performance. It works by constructing a series of weak classifiers and combining them additively to form a strong classifier, while utilizing regularization terms to prevent overfitting. XGBoost excels at handling high-dimensional sparse data, making it ideal for financial fraud detection tasks. Experimental results show that compared with the traditional XGBoost model, the proposed model based on Autoencoder feature learning has significant improvement in accuracy, recall and F1 score. The model can not only effectively identify known types of fraud, but also have certain generalization capabilities to deal with emerging fraud methods. In addition, explanatory analysis of the model can provide valuable insights for financial institutions to understand which characteristics are most important for fraud detection."

This paper proposes a holographic risk sensing platform for cable tunnels based on the four-level linkage of “sensing-transmission-application-decision-making”, which realizes real-time monitoring of environmental parameters and accurate early warning of fire risk through the integration of multi-source sensor networks and artificial intelligence technology. The platform adopts the hierarchical analysis method (AHP) to build a risk assessment model, combining expert scoring and judgment matrix to quantify the weight relationship between fire facilities, video monitoring, environmental and gas parameters and other dimensions to form a hierarchical early warning mechanism; and through the fusion of multi-source heterogeneous data, four-dimensional alarm algorithms, intelligent video analysis and the integration of security and fire safety technology, to build a “monitoring-analysis-response” closed-loop system. Experimental results show that the platform can reduce the false alarm rate to more than 85%, significantly improving the early detection of fire hazards and emergency response efficiency. The study not only provides intelligent solutions for cable tunnel safety management, but also provides theoretical support and practical reference for the digital transformation of risk prevention and control in urban underground space with its flexible architecture and core technology."

    "abstract": "Nowadays, data are being generated from so many diversified domains, characterized by their own traits and intricacies. Data integration from such diversified sources poses significant challenges in heterogeneity, scalability, and meaningful feature representation. The paper introduces a new paradigm for cross-domain analytics using the power of LLM-derived embeddings combined with transfer learning techniques. This will also enable us to show how LLMs can effectively capture complex patterns and semantic relationships within and across domains. We take real-world datasets across diverse sectors such as healthcare, finance, and social media, and show that it is possible to leverage state-of-the-art LLMs for creating high-dimensional embeddings as a unified representation framework across diverse data sources. These are then followed by transfer learning to fine-tune such embeddings on a specific analytical task, hence improving the generalization of the model and its accuracy across diverse applications. We show via an extensive set of experiments that our integrative approach substantially improves both the predictive performance and interpretability of traditional cross-domain analytics methods. Moreover, since transfer learning is applied here, much fewer labeled data are needed, making the approach quite time-effective and scalable. The findings point to the possibility of extracting the embeddings from LLMs, which further uses transfer learning to bridge the gap between disparate data domains and allows for much more robust and deep analytics. This advancement not only strengthens the capability for data-driven decision-making but also opens up new avenues for interdisciplinary research and innovation. This will enable organizations to unearth deeper insights, to drive more informed strategies in an increasingly data-rich environment, by embedding cross-domain data analytics using sophisticated techniques of embedding and transfer learning."

This paper investigates the MA-aided air-to-ground (A2G) system, where an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) equipped with MAs serves multiple ground users. The primary objective is to jointly optimize UAV deployment, antenna positions, beamforming, and power control to maximize the downlink communication sum rate. A key challenge lies in the difficulty of acquiring complete instantaneous channel state information (I-CSI), as the antennas cannot traverse all possible positions to obtain such full-scale I-CSI, which impedes the efficient optimization of system parameters. To address this challenge, we propose a two-stage transmission scheme: in the first stage, location-aware statistical CSI (S-CSI) is leveraged to optimize UAV deployment, power control, and MA positions for maximizing long-term system performance, while the second stage estimates I-CSI based on the optimized UAV and antenna positions to refine short-term transmit beamforming after long-term variables are determined, thereby substantially reducing CSI acquisition overhead. For long-term policy optimization, we introduce a novel dual-spatial-scale hierarchical deep reinforcement learning (DSSH-DRL) framework, which preserves flexibility in global policy formulation while enhancing training efficiency via effective decoupling of control variables. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and validate the promising application potential of MA technology in A2G communication networks."

    "abstract": "Disaggregated LLM inference service (DLIS), which decouples the compute-intensive prefill phase and the memory-intensive decode phase, enables more flexible and efficient resource usage. Existing solutions for deploying DLIS are typically designed for homogeneous environments. However, real-world production environments are becoming increasingly heterogeneous due to GPU shortages and rapid hardware evolution. Deploying DLIS in heterogeneous environments introduces three key challenges: (1) complicated GPU resource allocation caused by significant performance differences between GPUs; (2) communication bottlenecks caused by additional key-value (KV) cache transfers; and (3) dynamic inference loads caused by time-varying arrival rates and diverse task types. Existing methods adopted uniform model partitioning on heterogeneous GPUs and single-instance partitioning, suffering from heavy straggler effect and cross-node communication overheads. Additionally, they rely on reloading model parameters for dynamic tasks, which leads to significant service interruptions. To address these issues, we propose DisHelis, a high-throughput and low-latency DLIS system for heterogeneous environments. We formulate the DLIS deployment over heterogeneous environments as a hierarchical <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">max-flow</i> problem. This formulation jointly incorporates non-uniform model partitioning and hybrid instance partitioning to maximize DLIS throughput. Furthermore, we design a light-weight instance-switching approach to handle dynamic tasks without service interruptions. We solve it via a hierarchical alternating optimization algorithm that iteratively converges to a high-quality deployment plan. Experimental results show that DisHelis improves throughput by up to 1.63× and reduces latency by up to 2.4× over existing approaches."

    "abstract": "AI integration in language education has significantly improved students' language proficiency and created an engaging learning environment. However, some challenges continue to hinder the development of AI. While existing literature reviews tend to focus narrowly on specific AI technologies and language skills. To address this gap, this study aims to conduct a comprehensive systematic literature review to critically analyze <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$A I$</tex> integration in language education, exploring its contributions to language learning. We methodically selected and analyzed 27 papers from 226 documents based on the WOS and Scopus databases. Our findings indicate that the main challenges are limited sample size, technical difficulty, ethical issues, short research duration, etc. To address these challenges, more empirical research with a larger sample size and a long-term duration is needed to validate the effect of AI tools in language education. Accordingly, both students and instructors should undergo systematic training to tackle technical issues. Finally, combining AI technologies with human instructions is recommended as a future direction to ensure the accuracy of feedback and address ethical considerations."

    "abstract": "Driving long distances can be tiring and can cause discomfort in the driver’s legs and feet due to the constant pressing of the accelerator and brake. This can, over the long term, cause foot and leg discomfort. In response to this issue, we developed an innovative insole with integrated massagers. The insole works with the use of pressure sensors that determine the pressure the driver’s foot is exerting on the brake and accelerator. When the pressure is too intense, the vibrating motors on the insole start working. The motors provide relaxing relief to the feet, aiding in the relief of basic discomfort. Undoubtedly, the massagers serve to alleviate discomfort in the feet and legs, in addition to decreasing the driver’s fatigue. The insole is thin and lightweight, so it can easily fit inside normal shoes without causing any difficulty or discomfort. Overall, this smart provides a simple, practical, and highly effective solution to improve comfort and relaxation. Smart insole food pressure and massage relief satisfy the sustainable goals like SDG 3 Good Health and Well-Being."

    "abstract": "Identity matching (ID matching) across domains using skull or facial features is a challenging task, particularly when transitioning from homogeneous-domain (face-face) to heterogeneous-domain (skull-face). To mitigate the computational errors in ID matching caused by the strong dependence on sampling locations for shape feature descriptions and the limitations of linear matching techniques, we propose a shared kernel transform learning (SKTL) method leveraging the Laplacian-Beltrami operator (LBO) for shape feature description, referred to as LBOSKTL. The LBO is unaffected by sampling locations and captures both global and local shape information, spanning low to high-frequency descriptions. By integrating the LBO with a kernel version of shared transform learning algorithm, we derive a transform matrix via nonlinear ways, addressing the complex nonlinear relationships between shapes as they align with real-world scenarios in the LBO kernel feature space. Subsequently, the Gram matrix is employed to solve the problem. In the matching process, shape similarity is assessed by comparing the sparse coefficient/representation induced by the transform matrix. We validate the efficacy of our method through three datasets – multilinear model, FaceWarehouse, and FaceScape – demonstrating its performance in 3D skull-face and face-face ID matching tasks, with evaluation based on quantitative metrics such as matching accuracy and F1 scores."

    "abstract": "In order to ensure continuous DC link current, the overlap time introduced in the switching process of the current source rectifier (CSR) can lead to undesirable harmonics and reduce grid-side current quality. To address this issue, a hybrid space vector modulation (HSVM) method is proposed. This method designs two current vector sequence modes by reconstructing the sequence of the dwell current vectors. Then, an adaptive threshold decision (ATD) method is introduced, which can dynamically select two sequence modes during the modulation process to solve the current sharing phenomenon. The proposed method no longer need to add overlap time in modulation and fundamentally eliminates the overlap time effect (OTE). Moreover, it can minimize the switching times by using reverse voltage to block the on-state switches. By comparing with the ideal five-segment space vector modulation, theoretical analysis, simulation and experimental results prove the effectiveness of HSVM in improving system performance and minimizing the number of switching operations."

    "abstract": "People living in rural and urban slum areas are disproportionately affected by the Public Distribution System’s (PDS) ongoing problems, which include lengthy wait times, a lack of real-time information, manual recordkeeping errors, and operational inefficiencies. These restrictions lead to decreased customer satisfaction, delayed service delivery, and crowded ration shops. A Web-Based Smart Ration Card and Time Efficiency System utilizing the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js) is suggested as a cutting-edge and scalable digital solution to address these problems. A React-powered interface facilitates safe beneficiary registration utilizing ration card and Aadhaar details, while a Node.js-Express backend effectively manages shop data management, automatic notifications, and authentication. For all user profiles and transaction records, MongoDB offers scalable, transparent, and safe storage. Beneficiaries can more effectively schedule their trips thanks to a real-time queue monitoring system that continuously monitors client traffic and instantly notifies them when the queue length drops below a predetermined threshold. In order to ensure optimal resource utilization, the system also incorporates welfare-oriented features including automatic identification of unclaimed ration goods for redistribution to approved orphanages and temporary home delivery for senior residents and people with health issues The proposed system improves efficiency, reduces crowding, cuts waiting times by $30-40 \\%$, and increases transparency the distribution process when compared to conventional manual operations. All things considered, the system provides a clever, citizen-friendly, and time-efficient digital infrastructure for the distribution of public rations."

    "abstract": "As the amount of wireless sensor networks (WSN) built into Wi-Fi-based IoT systems is growing at a rapid pace, the growing degree of connectivity has increased the threat of cyberattacks, including information leakage, network outage, and communication blockade. Current machine-learningbased IDSs are poor in scalability, transparency, and high false positive, making them inappropriate in current dynamic networks. To combat these problems, this paper suggests a real-time Intrusion Detection System (IDS) based on Deep Learning (DL) and Explainable AI (XAI). It uses CNN-LSTM-DNN ensemble to train on intricate spatial-temporal network traffic features, and SHAP to interpret to determine the most significant features associated with attacks. An interactive dashboard (Streamlit based) is deployed in order to visualize the performance metrics, SHAP information, and traffic categories. Tests on the UNSWNB15 and synthetic IoT-WSN datasets indicate the 99.36 and 1.1 percent detection and false positive errors, respectively, which are higher than the conventional ML and single-scale DL methods. These findings indicate that XAI should be used together with DL to enhance the transparency and practical implementation to provide a next-generation IoT and WSN security solution that can be scaled and efficiently implemented."

At the lower level, actuator dynamics are experimentally identified and characterized via frequency-dependent uncertainty weighting functions. A mixed-μ-synthesis-based controller with a two-degree-of-freedom (2-DOF) structure is designed for robust acceleration tracking, improving the robust performance margin by 7% and 40% over classic μ and <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">H</i><sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">∞</sub> synthesis, respectively. At the upper level, a spacing-error integral and an actuation time delay are incorporated into the car-following model. A time-delay-dependent guaranteed-cost robust optimal control is then developed to reject preceding-vehicle disturbances. Simulations show that the proposed method reduces maximum deceleration and jerk variations by 50.4% and 93.4%, respectively, compared with the nominal optimal controller. It also alleviates the safety–comfort tradeoff caused by high-gain disturbance rejection. Real-vehicle experiments validate the approach’s effectiveness and robustness under practical uncertainties."

    "abstract": "With the increasing deployment of polypropylene (PP) cables in power systems, early identification of partial discharge (PD) defects is critical for ensuring equipment reliability. However, as PP cables remain in the trial stage, defect samples from industrial sites are limited, making traditional recognition methods ineffective under limited-sample conditions. A limited-sample cross-domain recognition method for PD defects in PP cables is proposed in this paper, with the transfer recognition task from generator stator bar PD to PP cable PD being addressed. In the proposed framework, PD signals from generator stator bars and PP cables are collected as source- and target-domain data under typical defect scenarios. Phase-resolved PD (PRPD) patterns are constructed, and a deep synthetic minority oversampling technique (DeepSMOTE, DS) enhancement technique is applied to balance feature distribution among defect types in the target domain. A transfer framework combining graph isomorphism networks (GIN) and domain-adversarial neural networks (DANN) is then employed to improve graph feature representation and cross-domain adaptability. Experimental results show that the DS-GIN-DANN method achieves 90.25% accuracy at 64×64 resolution under limited-sample conditions, outperforming CNN-based transfer methods by 8.75%, effectively mitigating the problem of limited samples. Therefore, a new technical pathway for limited-sample recognition of PD defects in cable equipment is provided, with significant practical application value."

Their primary concerns are enhancing network capacity, reducing latency, and optimizing spectrum use. The paper introduces an innovative hybrid approach in the field of Device to Device communication systems by combining Particle Swarm Optimisation with Multiverse Optimisation. This notion aims to find useful techniques devoid of danger. The hybrid method leverages the optimization capabilities of Particle Swarm Optimisation to get improved device matching accuracy. It concurrently circumvents local optima using Multiverse Optimisation exploration, hence enhancing device identification throughout the network. The hybrid paradigm seeks to address prevalent security issues like as eavesdropping, MITM attacks, and impersonation. This architecture facilitates continuous communication between devices, hence augmenting their capabilities. The proposed method is rational for future communication networks because to its advantages in resource allocation, expedited discovery time, and minimal energy usage. The hybrid model surpasses standard methods in terms of security resilience, processing efficiency, and discovery success rate. This outcome was achieved via simulations and performance evaluations. Device to Device applications need this architecture as it provides an optimal equilibrium between security and communication velocity."

    "abstract": "As critical protection devices for achieving low voltage ride-through (LVRT) in a doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG), DC choppers are widely used because of their low costs and high reliability. The conventional DC choppers are limited to DC-link voltage regulation and cannot provide rotor current control. This inherent limitation has spurred growing research interest in multifunctional DC choppers (MDCCs). However, the absence of a systematic approach for deriving the topologies of MDCCs has significantly constrained their practical applications, resulting in only a limited number of proposed configurations. To address this challenge, in this study, a systematic topology derivation methodology for MDCCs is proposed. The hierarchical three-stage topology derivation method sequentially generates unweighted, weighted, and directed-weighted graphs. Moreover, the specific characteristics of an MDCC are modeled via formally established topology filtering criteria, which ensures the completeness of the generation process. The proposed code implemented method significantly improves the efficiency of MDCC design while maintaining high configuration accuracy. A hardware-in-the-loop experimental validation conducted on a real-time digital simulator (RTDS) confirms that the optimized topology (with only two insulated-gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs), two diodes and one resistor) achieves satisfactory performance during LVRT transients."

Preprocessing operations like grayscale conversion, Gaussian blurring, and Otsu's binarization are included as part of the utilized methodology. In addition, an XAI method, such as Grad-CAM, is utilized for explaining and interpreting the model's predictions. The introduced approach allows for the effective detection and segmentation of cysts without the need for manually annotated binary masks, thus emerging as an effective detection and segmentation of cysts without an effective medical imaging tool that promotes confidence in AI-based diagnosis. This amalgamation of Explainable AI(XAI) technique with the deep learning algorithm provides increased segmentation accuracy and a transparent view for the clinicians on how the model is into a decision making process. Further, the future work is planned on expanding this framework on other renal abnormalities and incorporation of multi-modal imaging for improved diagnostic precision."

The agglutinative and complex morphological Malayalam language has large patterns of suffixation that complicate the use of traditional stemmers. The paper presents a better hybrid stemming architecture that combines a suffix-stripping engine that is linguistically based with an unsupervised K-Means clustering module. The morphological component is first carried out through the rule-based component in which handcrafted suffix heuristics are used based on the Malayalam inflectional and derivational patterns. The clustered refinement phase then clusters stem candidates according to similarity of vectors, and allows word perfecting over-stemming and understemming mistakes to be automatically corrected. Benchmark Malayalam corpus experimental evaluation shows much higher accuracy, precision, and recall than current rule-based and statistical stemmers. These findings confirm the efficacy of the integration of linguistics with machine learning tools in order to achieve strong morphological normalization in low resource Indian languages.

Chest X-ray imaging is the most accessible diagnostic tool but is often affected by motion blur or equipment limitations. This study evaluates the performance of eleven deep learning models for binary pneumonia classification under two training conditions: with and without Gaussian blur. The models span CNN-based architectures, hybrid convolution-attention networks, and transformer models. To increase training volume and assess generalization, data from two public datasets were merged. Each model was evaluated on a consistent unblurred test set using macro-averaged accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. EfficientNet, ConvNeXt, CoAtNet, and MobileNet achieved the best class-wise F1 performance under blurred training, each with class gap scores below 0.04. In contrast, the CNN with LSTM and ANN exhibited severe class imbalance, with the former failing to detect pneumonia cases. Models trained on unblurred data consistently outperformed blurred-trained models on the clean test set, while blurred-trained models demonstrated greater resilience to image quality degradation. These findings highlight the importance of both model architecture and training strategy in designing robust classification systems, offering valuable insights for the development of reliable diagnostic tools suitable for deployment in diverse clinical environments."

This study focuses on the kinematic analysis and error calibration of the 2UPU-SP+RR hybrid robot. The inverse kinematic analytical solution is first derived to establish the coordinate mapping between the end-effector and joint inputs. A novel forward kinematic analytical solution with joint angles as the inputs is subsequently proposed, based on which a real-time pose detection system for the hybrid robot’s end-effector is developed. Furthermore, an elasto-static stiffness model of the 2UPU-SP parallel mechanism is established using the weighted generalized inverse method to map the relationship between external loads and terminal deformations. Error modeling is implemented through two distinct approaches: zero-point calibration and comprehensive error calibration. Laser tracker-based measurements provide geometric error parameters for both methods, which are then compensated in the robot’s kinematic algorithm. Experimental findings confirm that the two calibration approaches significantly improve the positioning precision of the end-effector. After zero-point calibration and comprehensive error calibration, the end-effector positioning accuracy of the robot is improved by 38.40% and 56.71% respectively, confirming the effectiveness of the proposed calibration methods."

A parametric dataset is first created using three materials, three load levels, and fingertip and finger geometric parameters (length, breadth, and thickness). This dataset trains a Python-based surrogate model that rapidly estimates the structural performance of the end-effector across its design space. The model is validated through randomly selected cases re-simulated in ANSYS, showing strong agreement within engineering accuracy limits. Finally, an optimization stage identifies feasible material, geometry and load combinations that minimize deformation while meeting yield constraints. The overall framework demonstrates a fast and reliable pathway for structural decision-making, with strong applicability to vacuumcompatible grippers used in semiconductor automation and other precision robotic environments."

Leveraging this spectral information, we present a novel biometric approach that extracts and analyzes skin reflectance patterns from hyperspectral fingertip images. In prior work, hyperspectral analysis has primarily been applied to facial biometrics; however, the associated lighting requirements are often impractical or inconvenient for users in real-world scenarios. From a computational perspective, while deep learning has significantly advanced recognition using conventional imaging, effectively applying these frameworks to the rich and complex signals captured by HSI remains a critical open challenge. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) often have difficulty preserving the sequential structure of spectral information. Vision transformers effectively capture global context through self-attention but often face challenges in modeling fine-grained local features due to the lack of convolutional inductive biases. To address existing limitations, this work introduces a novel integration of Context-Enriched Contrastive Loss (CECL) into two architectures: SpectralFormer, a ViT-based model that employs decoupled spatial–spectral processing to handle spectral signatures extracted from carefully selected spatial regions; and the Swin Transformer, which leverages a unified 3D joint representation. For the first time, SpectralFormer is employed for identity verification, leveraging group-wise spectral embeddings, inspired by ViT’s patch-based processing, across adjacent bands, along with intermediate skip connections to enhance the analysis of complex spectral data. The proposed approach was evaluated on three biometric databases, including the Mason FHSD-2022 hyperspectral fingertip dataset collected at George Mason University with 100 subjects. The code will be publicly available on GitHub."

    "abstract": "Objective: Accurate visualization of interventional devices, such as medical needles, in relation to the procedural target is critical for the safe and effective guidance of interventional procedures. Ultrasound (US) imaging is widely used for guiding percutaneous needle interventions, but the 2D nature of most clinical US probes limits accurate 3D localization, particularly of the needle tip. In this work, we introduce a novel system that combines both volumetric US imaging and 3D needle tracking. Method: The proposed novel system integrates a fiber-optic hydrophone (FOH) into the needle and employs a 2D sparse spiral US array with 256 active elements. Real-time volumetric US imaging was achieved by plane-wave imaging with the sparse array, while 3D needle tip tracking was enabled through communications between the US probe and the FOH. Results: The system achieved spatial resolutions (mean ± standard deviation) of 2.06 ± 0.29mm (lateral), 2.26 ± 0.23mm (elevational), and 0.69 ± 0.12mm (axial) at depths ranging from 10 to 40mm. The tracking accuracy was better than 0.30 ± 0.21mm. The clinical potential of the system was demonstrated using a nerve block training phantom. Conclusions: This study presents a proof-of-concept for an integrated solution that enables simultaneous volumetric anatomical imaging and precise 3D needle tip tracking. Significance: The proposed system holds strong potential to enhance the efficacy and safety of image-guided interventional procedures by providing real-time 3D anatomical visualization and accurate needle tracking."

The rapid analysis, dissemination and storage of the substantial data generated by advanced imaging modalities such as CT and MRI presents great challenges. Consequently effective image compression methods are essential for minimizing the storage space and increasing the transmission speed without compromising the quality needed for an accurate diagnosis. In this work, we have explored and evaluated different methods for compressing medical images, starting with classical lossless algorithms and extending to modern deep learning frameworks. In addition to hybrid frameworks that combine Huffman coding with DWT, new deep learning architectures such as AutoEncoders (AE), Convolutional AutoEncoders (CAE), Variational AutoEncoders (VAE), and CNN-driven Predictive Encoders are analyzed and the evaluation is carried out using their performance metrics such as their Compression Ratio (CR), Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), Mean Square Error (MSE), Bits Per Pixel (BPP), Compression Time (CT), and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) are measured and compared. This study evaluates the performance metrics of various image compression methods and summarizes the methods and strategies incorporated in the traditional and deep learning approaches."

Manual microscopic examination of blood smears is a reliable method but it is also very laborintensive and needs a lot of expert knowledge. In this paper, an automatic deep learning-based framework is put forward for the detection of malaria-infected red blood cells employing three different architectures: custom CNN, AlexNet, and DenseNet. For the sake of fairness and reliability, a uniform preprocessing pipeline and a cross-validated evaluation process are adopted for the comparison. Moreover, an enhanced dataset is created by having the ambiguous and low-quality samples removed, which makes it possible to analyze the performance under both original and refined conditions. The experimental results indicate that among the architectures, DenseNet obtains the highest accuracy (97.79 on the refined dataset). The framework proposed illustrates a very strong possibility for the use in real-time malaria screening and gives reproducible insights for the future studies in AI-based healthcare diagnosis research."

The resulting decomposition and compression information is reused across the entire band, eliminating the need to repeatedly perform the time-consuming MLFACA decomposition and CBF generation at each analyzed frequency. Moreover, impedance interpolation is employed to efficiently construct the approximate decomposed impedance matrices at analyzed frequencies.

The approach integrates stabilized Kerr frequency combs with quantum generative adversarial networks (qGANs) to achieve Nash equilibrium solutions that balance security and performance. Comprehensive experimental validation across multiple quantum hardware platforms demonstrates the framework's effectiveness, with detailed performance metrics presented in Section II.

This paper presents a large-scale empirical study of 497,742 issues mined from 1,209 open-source blockchain projects hosted on GitHub. Employing BERTopic, a transformer-based topic modeling technique, we identify 49 distinct issue topics and organize them hierarchically into 11 major subcategories. Our analysis reveals that both general software development issues and blockchainspecific concerns are nearly equally represented, with Wallet Management and UI Enhancement emerging as the most prominent topics. We further examine the temporal evolution of issue categories and resolution times, finding that Wallet issues not only dominate in frequency but also exhibit the longest resolution time. Conversely, Mechanisms issues are resolved significantly faster. Issue frequency surged after 2016 with the rise of Ethereum and decentralized applications, but started declining after 2022. These findings enhance our understanding of blockchain software maintenance, informing the development of specialized tools and practices to improve robustness and maintainability."

    "abstract": "Wireless Underground Sensor Networks (WUSNs) have emerged as a key enabling technology for applications such as precision agriculture, underground infrastructure monitoring, and environmental sensing. However, electromagnetic (EM) wave propagation in the underground-to-aboveground (UG2AG) link is strongly influenced by multilayered, lossy, and heterogeneous media, which poses significant challenges for accurate signal modeling. In this paper, a novel bi/tri-layer UG2AG channel model is proposed that explicitly incorporates EM spherical wavefront deformation and antenna reflection losses. The model is analytically derived for an arbitrary number of layers and validated through comprehensive laboratory experiments using a LoRa-based WUSNs system. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model significantly reduces the prediction error of 81% and 89%, compared to the traditional ray tracing-based models under the bi-layer and tri-layer condition, respectively. The model also provides a detailed decomposition of signal attenuation, revealing the relative contributions of diffusion, absorption, and reflection losses in bi/tri-layer conditions. These findings offer new insights into UG2AG communication mechanisms and provide a new perspective for advancing future research on underground wireless channels and the design and optimization of WUSNs."

    "abstract": "This paper proposes an enhanced semantic interference cancellation (SemantIC) technique, Swin-SemantIC, which improves the efficiency of cross-domain noise mitigation and anti-interference performance by optimizing the semantic auto-encoder in the original SemantIC system. Grounded in the Wyner-Ziv theorem, the original SemantIC system constructs a Turbo loop by cascading a channel decoder and a CNN-based semantic auto-encoder, enabling alternating denoising in the signal and semantic domains to enhance received signal quality. However, the inherent limitation of CNNs in local feature extraction constrains their capability to capture global semantic content of information, thereby degrading the quality of side information. To address this, Swin-SemantIC employs a Swin Transformer-based semantic auto-encoder to strengthen global dependency capture, enabling more efficient and reliable side information transmission within the Turbo loop. Simulation results demonstrate that Swin-SemantIC achieves further performance gains, with particularly significant advantages under low signal-to-noise ratio conditions, meanwhile incurring no additional channel resource consumption."

Although these models have shown high performance on standard benchmark datasets, such as ModelNet10and ScanObjectNN, their efficacy on culturally specific specialized datasets remains largely unexplored. This paper presents an experimental study to evaluate and compare the classification performance of PointNet and DGCNN using a novel dataset, TogogBali3d, which comprises eight classes of traditional Balinese statues (Togog). We benchmarked the performance of these models on the TogogBali3d dataset and compared the results with their established performance on ModelNet10 and ScanObjectNN. This study aims to assess the generalization capabilities of state-of-the-art 3D classification models and highlight the challenges associated with classifying objects with intricate and unique geometric features. The DGCNN model achieved an Overall Accuracy (OA) of 61.25%, narrowly outperforming PointNet's 60.83% OA. The performance drop compared to generic benchmarks confirms the challenge posed by the fine-grained geometry of the dataset. A detailed analysis shows that while PointNet's global features are highly effective for specific macro-level classes (such as Punakawan and Pengapit), DGCNN's local feature aggregation provides marginally better overall consistency, particularly in achieving superior recall for classes defined by localized detail (such as Penabuh and Dewi)."

We employed a mixed-methods approach combining large-scale corpus analysis of underrepresented dialects and sociolects, community-participatory design sessions with marginalized groups, and the development of inclusive natural language processing models using transfer learning and domain adaptation techniques. Our methodology included collecting linguistic data from 15 diverse communities, implementing bias detection algorithms, and creating culturally-aware language models through collaborative annotation processes involving community members. The results demonstrate that our democratized AI framework achieved 23% higher accuracy in understanding diverse linguistic patterns compared to conventional models, with significant improvements in sentiment analysis (18% increase in F1-score) and intent recognition (31% reduction in misclassification) for underrepresented groups. The democratized approach also showed enhanced cultural sensitivity scores and reduced algorithmic bias across all tested demographic categories. This research contributes to the growing field of inclusive AI by providing a replicable framework for developing linguistic technologies that authentically represent diverse social voices, with implications for improving digital equity, enhancing cross-cultural communication, and ensuring fair representation in AI-driven social platforms and decisionmaking systems."

This study reduces dependency on central servers by implementing a cooperative content-sharing approach in which User Equipments (UEs) work together to efficiently distribute cached content. Using the NS-3 simulator, the system is evaluated under both cooperative and non-cooperative setups for a network of 28 UEs. The results demonstrate that the cooperative approach achieves a consistent throughput of 0.07 Mbps across all UEs and significantly reduces delays compared to the non-cooperative setup, where only the first 4 UEs achieve marginal throughput, and others experience stalling. These findings highlight the potential of cooperative content sharing to enhance resource utilization and Quality of Service (quality of service) in high-traffic LTE-MEC environments."

However, challenges like high-dimensional data processing, parameter sensitivity, and scalability with massive datasets can limit its effectiveness. This research focuses on enhancing the efficiency of DBSCAN by optimizing nearest neighbor search techniques, specifically Ball-tree, KD-tree, and Approximate Nearest Neighbors (ANN). These optimizations aim to reduce computational complexity, improve clustering performance, and increase DBSCAN's applicability to large-scale, highdimensional datasets.

    "abstract": "Multi-bit flip-flops (MBFFs) are widely adopted in low-power digital designs due to their ability to reduce area and clock switching power by sharing clock buffers across multiple individual flip-flops. However, this clock resource sharing introduces new bit-upsets vulnerabilities in the form of single-event transients (SETs) within the shared clock buffer, distinct from standard storage-node single-event upset (SEU). This work presents neutron-induced soft error characterization results for MBFFs implemented with both standard and radiation-hardened dual interlocked storage cell (DICE) latches in a 0.9V, 28nm CMOS technology. Neutron irradiation experiment was conducted at the ChipIR facility in the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, UK. A total of 84 test chips containing over 800,000 flip-flops were tested under multiple voltage conditions and data patterns. Upset mechanisms were classified into storage-node upsets, local clock buffer SETs, and global scan clock SETs. The results confirm that MBFFs, despite the use of DICE for hardened storage, exhibit significantly increased susceptibility to SETs in shared clock buffers. This study highlights an important trade-off between power efficiency and radiation resilience in multi-bit flip-flop designs, calling attention to the need for targeted mitigation strategies to ensure robust system operation in radiation prone environments."

The suggested autonomous system analyzes real-time air quality parameters and optimizes air purification tactics using cloud-based data processing. Advanced sensors and purification processes allow robotic agents to intelligently adapt to shifting pollution patterns in dynamic settings. Robots use Deep Q Networks (DQN) to learn and change their purifying tactics based on past data and environmental input. Cloud computing and deep learning improve air purification efficiency and enable real-time pollution response decision-making. The autonomous system is scalable and adaptable to varied urban environments since it requires little human involvement. The cloud-based design lets autonomous agents communicate and coordinate to improve air quality. Experimental findings show that the suggested strategy improves air purification over previous approaches. This system advances environmental robotics and lays the groundwork for intelligent, autonomous systems that handle urban air quality and pollution issues."

Using historical records and ARIMA modeling, key climatic variables-including temperature, atmospheric pressure, precipitation, relative humidity, solar radiation, and wind speed-were analyzed to identify trends and forecast near-future behavior. Results reveal a progressive increase in temperature and atmospheric pressure, particularly in Joya de los Sachas, accompanied by a decline in precipitation and relative humidity, indicating a trend toward warmer and drier conditions. Seasonal variability in climatic parameters is predicted to decrease, suggesting more stable but less resilient environmental conditions. Soil analyses confirm higher fertility in Joya de los Sachas, while Loreto exhibits a clayrich texture with nutrient limitations. Water quality assessments detected seasonal spikes in metals and microbial contamination, with irrigation sources in Joya de los Sachas exceeding permissible copper levels. The study highlights significant spatial and temporal climatic differences between the cantons, driven by factors such as altitude and microclimate, and underscores implications for sustainable agricultural planning, water resource management, and climate adaptation strategies. These findings offer critical insights for local stakeholders aiming to enhance resilience amid ongoing environmental changes in the Ecuadorian Amazon."

This paper centers on building its basic components to address low-efficiency and non-personalization in traditional preschool English teaching. Deep knowledge tracing, relying on RNNs and LSTMs, we need to precisely record and analyze preschoolers' multi-dimensional English-learning data (vocabulary, grammar, oral skills). Using these data, the system customizes learning paths, like auto-adjusting content push and offering targeted help. Experiments show a 40% rise in word-memorization accuracy, a 35% increase in grammar-understanding correctness, and a knowledge-absorption rate jump from 30% (traditional) to over 60%. The system has modules of intelligent assessment, learning content push, learning task design, and innovative learning mode. The assessment module uses RNNs or LSTMs for analysis; the content-push module selects from a graded resource library; the task-design module adjusts tasks based on personalization and gradation; the innovative-mode module uses VR/AR for immersive learning. This research fills the gap in creating an intelligent preschool-English education scenario by integrating AI, offers an innovative solution for its intelligent transformation, and is expected to draw expert cooperation to boost preschool English education."

    "abstract": "Ultra-Wideband (UWB) technology offers high accuracy in distance estimation, a crucial characteristic for localization and tracking systems. However, when people carry UWB devices, the accuracy of distance measurements can be compromised by signal absorption and blocking due to the human body, as well as by environmental propagation conditions. This work presents a comprehensive experimental evaluation of distance estimation accuracy, specifically analyzing the influence of device location on seven parts of the human body: head, hips, hands, wrists, chest, knees, and ankles, under different channel conditions: Line of Sight (LOS) and Non-Line of Sight (NLOS). The study employs DWM1001 UWB modules and the Two-Way Ranging (TWR) technique to obtain distance measurements in two representative scenarios: an outdoor environment (open space) and an indoor corridor. Key findings reveal that the chest location achieves the highest accuracy, with a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.0364 m under outdoor LOS conditions. In contrast, the knee location exhibits the worst performance, with errors up to 2.23 m under outdoor NLOS conditions. The study identifies a counterintuitive phenomenon where specific device locations, such as the hand and wrist, present superior performance under NLOS conditions compared to LOS in confined environments. The degradation factor ranges between <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$1.5 \\times$</tex> and <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$16.3 \\times$</tex> when transitioning from LOS to NLOS conditions, with an overall MAE of 0.3944 m for all configurations. The results provide a detailed characterization of how device location on the body and channel conditions affect UWB distance estimation accuracy, offering guidelines for the design and deployment of applications that require precise distance measurements with wearable devices."

    "abstract": "Employee attrition is referred to the gradual loss of members within a work place. Over time, various factors can lead to staff departures, which may be either voluntary or involuntary. For companies, employee attrition poses a significant risk and is a critical concern, as it affects not only operational efficiency but also the overall effectiveness of the organization. The employees are the most important asset of any organization, making it essential to identify potential employees who might leave. This is important due to the costs associated with training, the loyalty developed over time, and the sensitive nature of certain roles like social welfare. Organizations can leverage technology to assist in decision-making across various areas. For instance, machine learning techniques are increasingly relevant today, as they support personnel management, organizational challenges, and corporate strategy. This research aims to identify the key factors influencing staff employment and attrition. Four machine learning models (LDA, MLP, AdaBoost and Gradient Boosting) have been implemented in this work. The experimental results show that the AdaBoost and Gradient Boosting models perform better than the other two models with same accuracy of 90%."

    "abstract": "The integration of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies across various domains has significantly enhanced operational efficiency. However, it has also introduced serious cybersecurity threats. For instance, buffer overflow vulnerabilities can lead to device crashes, often arising from inadequate validation of data format and length in back-end processing of front-end transmitted data, which may subsequently be misused by unsafe functions. Static taint analysis is an effective approach for detecting such vulnerabilities, but existing methods often suffer from high computational overhead and excessive false positives due to the identification of too many irrelevant sources. To address these challenges, this paper proposes LLMIOT, a large language model-assisted vulnerability detection method that improves efficiency and reduces false positives through keyword filtering in embedded firmware. We leverage shared front-end and back-end keywords to identify relevant function call paths in the program's function call graph (CG). Large language models (LLMs) are then used to filter out irrelevant keywords before performing taint analysis to detect vulnerabilities. We evaluated LLMIOT on two datasets and compared it against state-of-the-art methods, SaTC and HermeScan. Experimental results show that LLMIOT efficiently eliminates more irrelevant keywords, reducing their count by 66% compared to SaTC and 83% compared to HermeScan. Furthermore, LLMIOT improves processing speed, achieving an average speed up of 1.9x over SaTC and 1.83x over HermeScan."

    "abstract": "Brain parcellation enables the extraction of region-specific measurements from multimodal MRI data and represents a crucial step in neuroimaging analyses. Different atlases, derived using segmentation or clustering approaches, may play a crucial role in shaping analytical outcomes. Neurovascu-lar coupling (NVC)-the local spatial relationship between blood perfusion and neuronal activity-can be estimated by correlating functional connectivity with cerebral blood flow measures within predefined brain parcels. Although NVC alterations have been investigated in several neurological conditions, the impact of parcellation schemes on the resulting NVC estimates-both regionally and within large-scale functional net-works-has yet to be systematically assessed. The present study addresses this gap by comparing NVC estimates across Yeo's seven canonical large-scale brain networks using two widely adopted network-labelled parcellation schemes: the Schaefer atlas, originally derived from functional MRI data only, and the Brainnetome atlas, constructed from multimodal structural and functional connectivity data. Despite the overall good consistency in NVC estimates across all networks (Interclass Correlation Coefficient ≥ 0.702), significant differences (p < 0.05) were observed between the Schaefer and Brainnetome atlases in all networks, especially in dorsal and ventral attention networks. These findings highlight that parcellation choice can substantially impact NVC estimation, even when using atlases with high overall consistency, underscoring the need to carefully consider atlas properties when investigating more subtle neurovascular alterations across brain networks."

    "abstract": "The copy-move forgery is one of the most widespread image manipulations that is often used to tamper with images in a general sense, this kind of forgery involves duplicating a part of an image and placing it in a new area of the image. Such manipulation is difficult to detect because the copied area does not change the color tones, texture and illumination with the original area. Detecting high precision is a challenge of the traditional methods when post processing changes such as rotation, scaling, and compression are involved. In our current paper, We present a novel deep learning architecture using Pairwise Ranking Learning and Deep PatchMatch to identify and locate copy-move forgeries in the most resilient and accurate way. In order to create a model that has the ability to detect subtle differences between authentic and manipulated areas, we apply deep features to adaptive patch comparison and even include a ranking loss. Experiments on standard datasets demonstrate that our approach is superior to the current state of the art approaches with regard to detection and post processing artifacts resistance."

The system employs sensors, radars, and cameras to monitor airspace and identify aerial threats, such as combat aircraft and drones, using state-of-the-art object detection algorithms like you only look once (YOLO) and faster region-based convolutional neural network (R-CNN). By calculating the speed and trajectory of incoming threats, it predicts the probable impact zone and leverages geospatial analysis to identify safe and danger zones. This information is disseminated to users via notifications, guiding evacuation efforts with real-time, map-based alerts. A threat classifier, developed using machine learning algorithms like support vector machines (SVMs), assesses the severity of threats based on parameters such as size, speed, and predicted impact point. The system further integrates with cloud-based geographic information system (GIS) platforms, such as Google Maps application programming interface (API), to optimize evacuation routes based on crowd density and threat projections. It achieves high accuracy through training on a mix of real-world and simulated data, including flight and crowd scenarios.

    "abstract": "Transformer-based foundation models are becoming deeper and larger. For fast training, their billions of parameters (tensors) are split onto parallel tasks running on many modern yet expensive accelerators. To amortize the huge hardware investments, it is cost-effective to share the aggregated resources among multi-tenants. However, resource contention yields the heavy straggling problem. Existing works feature contributions for the traditional data parallelism. They cannot work well for the new tensor parallelism, due to the dependency among split tensors. This paper is the first attempt on accelerating heterogeneous tensor parallelism. We summarize specific challenges, including the very frequent synchronizations and the heavy tensor computation workloads. Our solution is to resize dimensions of parameters on demand, to quickly and dynamically balance workloads. The accuracy loss is reduced through priority resizing. We also migrate workloads between tasks, without any loss of accuracy. The most efficient communication primitives are selected and then scheduled in a non-redundant manner, to reduce the runtime latency. Our final hybrid solution is built on top of resizing and migration. By studying the tradeoff between accuracy and efficiency, it can smartly hit the “sweet spot”. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our proposals."

    "abstract": "Abstract-The methods that hackers use to break into systems are becoming increasingly sophisticated. Cyber security systems of today are required to deal with a large amount of unstructured data, which includes system logs, network traffic, and threat intelligence reports, in order to find possible indicators of compromise (IoCs). Because of the many, complicated, and confusing cyber incidents that have happened in the last few years, traditional rule-based systems and manual log analysis techniques are no longer enough. This study aims to illustrate the application of an advanced deep learning architecture and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to autonomously identify, interpret, and correlate indicators of compromise within unstructured cybersecurity data. The method uses transformer-based designs like BERT and GPT to figure out what words imply based on the context in which they are used. Because of this, the system can find behaviors that weren’t expected, threat patterns that were hidden, and attack signatures that had never been seen before. The recommended solution uses preprocessing pipelines to do both log normalization and entity recognition. Then, it uses semantic embedding to turn unstructured log entries into vectors that the learning model can understand. It is possible for the model to detect critical signals such as IP anomalies, unlawful access attempts, and hazardous payloads without the requirement to be configured with specific criteria. The labeled threat datasets not only contribute to the further improvement of the deep learning module, but it also makes use of attention techniques in order to select the most significant tokens associated with threats. The results of experimental assessments show that the accuracy and recall of IoC extraction are significantly higher than those of typical machine learning benchmarks. Additionally, it is able to manage a wide variety of log formats and an everevolving threat vocabulary. The goal of this project is to construct an autonomous threat analysis system that is able to learn from data streams that are constantly changing. This project links natural language processing (NLP) and cybersecurity. Furthermore, it improves the effectiveness of proactive security methods and makes it simpler for analysts to identify items in real time. According to the findings of our research, powerful natural language processing (NLP)driven cybersecurity analytics have the potential to transform threat intelligence by transforming unstructured data into a dependable and efficient method of identifying and resolving new cyber threats."

In fertility, AI enables prediction of pregnancy, monitoring of pregnancy, and identifying complications during the early stages of pregnancy like preeclampsia and gestational diabetes. Machine learning and deep learning algorithms have shown high levels of accuracy in the interpretation of mammograms, Pap smears, and ultrasound images to detect cancer. Additionally, wearable and chatbots using AI are also utilized in providing constant health monitoring and mental health care. As promising as it is, there are still concerns of data inclusivity, algorithmic bias, privacy and ethical concerns. The future outlooks are that clear, unbiased, and open sourced AI tools will be required to secure fair access to healthcare services by women worldwide. On the whole, AI is a new paradigm of more active, accurate, and proactive and patient-oriented approaches to female health."

    "abstract": "This paper discusses how automation and artificial intelligence (AI) are transforming the way teams work and the skill base that is necessary to build high-performing teams. The study is based on empirical data collected from 280 professionals across IT, manufacturing, finance and healthcare sectors, we modeled seven reflective variables using SEM (SmartPLS)4.0: Automation Integration (AUT), AI Utilization Quality (AIU), Collaboration and Communication Quality (COL), Psychological Safety (PSY), Future-Ready Skills (FRS), Team Adaptability and Learning Agility (TAD), and Team Performance (TPF). The measurement model showed a high level of reliability and convergent validity (all AVE $\\gt 0.70$). There is a mediated architecture as supported by structural results: AUT, AIU, and COL have significant incremental benefits, and the direct impact of COL on TPF is the largest, with FRS and TAD having smaller yet significant incremental benefits. PSY enhances coordination through the positive effect on COL. The model only describes a middle portion of the variance in performance (TPF R $2=$ about 0.29), which means that outcomes are being driven by human-machine complementarity and not only by automation. In practice, organizations are advised to combine automation with routines, which improve the quality of AI use, invest in psychologically safe collaboration, and develop hybrid skills and learning agility to transfer their technological potential into the quality of continued team performance. The findings also highlight the importance of ethical AI use and workforce reskilling to ensure that automation enhances human potential rather than replacing it."

    "abstract": "High-precision and robust positioning is crucial for ensuring safety and reliability of autonomous driving. The combination of precise point positioning (PPP) technology and inertial navigation system (INS) offers a globally available solution for continuous outdoor positioning. However, due to satellite signal degradation and error accumulation of low-cost INS, the positioning performance is challenged in complex urban environments. To address this issue, leveraging visual perception of specific prior map elements is an effective and applicable complementary approach. In this work, we tightly integrate visual map matching into PPP/INS navigation through a centralized extended Kalman filter (EKF). For map matching, heterogeneous road markings that structure urban roads are considered for constraint construction, whose observations are compactly modelled in 3D space and can be flexibly associated with the prior map. The complementary characteristics of map matching and PPP are fully exploited through tightly coupled integration, offering fast convergence, robustness against outliers, and sustained accuracy. The positioning performance and influencing factors of the proposed system are evaluated in both simulation and realistic urban road experiments. The results indicate that with the incorporation of map matching measurements, the proposed method exhibits superior performance in terms of accuracy and convergence, maintaining sub-decimeter to decimeter level positioning accuracy even under harsh GNSS observation conditions."

This study presents an innovative deep learning framework architecture that integrates a fine-tuned ResNet18-based CNN for spatial feature extraction and a temporal BiLSTM network for temporal acoustic information capture. with high accuracy and robustness. The framework is designed to leverage the complementary capability of convolutional layers (CNN s) to effectively extract spatial and spectral patterns from spectrogram inputs, while Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) component is tasked with the temporal dynamics present within audio data. To cope with the challenges arising from the highly variable and noise-rich underwater environment, we incorporate a spectrogram-based data augmentation approach using natural ambient sounds, which effectively enhances the model's generalization to diverse acoustic conditions. Our system is trained on a comprehensive dataset comprising multiple marine species, with both original and augmented samples, to ensure scalability and adaptability across varied underwater soundscapes. Extensive experimental evaluations on real-world marine bioacoustic datasets demonstrate that the proposed hybrid model consistently outperforms baseline CNN-only and Bi-LSTM-only architectures with respect to accuracy, recall, and F1-score metrics. Moreover, the model exhibits strong resilience to environmental noise, validating its applicability for practical, real-time underwater acoustic monitoring tasks. This research contributes a robust, scalable, and introduces a unified deep learning framework that advances the current state-of-the-art in automated marine animal sound classification, enabling more efficient monitoring and conservation efforts in acoustically diverse and increasingly noisy marine habitats."

They are yielding a strong boost to technological innovation in all fields, including drug discovery and development, in which in-silico models are often used to describe the behavior of biological systems and study their pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) properties. This study aimed to evaluate how Generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT and Gemini, among the widely accessible LLMs, can support the PK/PD modeling process. It evaluated the potential of these LLMs in generating instructions within SimBiology, a MATLAB tool dedicated to modeling, simulation and analysis of biological systems. Four case studies were considered, the first two aimed at teaching SimBiology fundamentals and at providing basic model examples, and the second two directly related to the creation of a PK/PD model. Each output was evaluated based on the instructions provided, the differences between the two LLMs' answers, the errors made, and the ability of the tool to correct them. The results showed that ChatGPT offered greater accuracy and flexibility in code generation than Gemini, since it is able to better correct its errors, although both presented structural and syntactic errors, limiting the fully automated modeling tasks. In conclusion, ChatGPT and Gemini are promising tools for building in-silico models, especially in the early stages of model development, but at present, they require human supervision and expertise to correct errors and improve reliability."

The objective was to identify the neurophysiological correlates of dystonia. Through the synchronized recording of deep cerebral (Local Field Potentials, LFP), electroencephalographic, (EEG), and electromyographic (EMG) signals, dystonic events were identified and analyzed in different stimulation configurations (including ring mode and directional settings using contacts either proximal to or distal from GPi) and at various levels of stimulation intensity.

Yet, in collaborative human-AI interaction contexts, such as working with generative AI (GenAI) to co-create pieces, human-like features can undermine user autonomy and therefore reduce perceived psychological ownership. Psychological ownership offers a productive lens for examining humanAI interaction, particularly in human-AI collaboration, in which AI might be viewed as a tool, a partner, or even something in between. Drawing from previous research on the topic, we argue that design for agentic GenAI should prioritize user autonomy by limiting anthropomorphic features to promote productive and safe use of GenAI."

    "abstract": "The growing number of cyber-attacks that penetrate many levels of network infrastructure make the traditional detection method insufficient for sufficient cyber security. To address this challenge, in this paper, we propose a multimodal neural networkbased deep learning methodology for cyber-security attack classification. When communing different sources of observational information, such as network flows, system logs, application behaviors and protocol metadata, the above model is capable to detect and characterize with high degree of accuracy a multitude of cyber threats that target Hot-Cool components from Layer 2 to Layer 7. The deep learning method employs convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and long shortterm memory (LSTM) to capture spatial and temporal features, which in turn assist in recognizing sophisticated and stealthy attack patterns that may not be detected by traditional rule-based techniques. This research develops a multimodal architecture that operates with multiple modalities of heterogeneous data in parallel, which enables the model to distill diverse feature representations from each modality before integrating them into a unified classification output. The fusion of multiple views enables the model to better understand the cross-layer anomalies, for example the coordinated DDoS attack signatures, privilege escalation, lateral movement, polymorphic malware behavior, etc. We train and verify the model on benchmark-derived datasets as well as artificially generated real-world threat scenarios. Experiment results show that our method outperforms the state of the art with respect to latecy, accuracy, precision, recall over the conventional machine-learning methods and single-modal deep learning methods, especially for the case of detecting zero-day exploits and advanced persistent threats. This work aims at demonstrating how multimodal deep learning architectures can be leveraged to achieve an adaptive and scalable defense in the context of intelligent cybersecurity. The proposed system provides the ability of real-time classification with low false positives, as well as canarness new threat vectors through the continuous learning strategy. Its modular structure makes it easy to plug in with existing security information and event management (SIEM) tools and network monitoring systems. The study demonstrates a viable platform for implementing next-gen cybersecurity technologies which leverage deep learning for proactive cross-layer threat detection and classification in complex digital environments."

    "abstract": "Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a severe and disabling psychiatric illness, and growing evidence suggests that abnormal brain network connectivity is a key neurobiological marker of the disorder. As a result, numerous studies have explored graph-based Transformer models for MDD diagnosis due to their ability to capture complex topological dependencies in brain networks. However, existing methods are limited by their reliance on large annotated datasets and their tendency to focus only on positive connections, often ignoring negative node relationships that may carry important pathological signals. To address these limitations, we propose a novel model called Negative Node-enhanced Transformer (NNTrans). Specifically, we introduce a self-supervised contrastive learning strategy with a sliding window mechanism to learn robust representations from unlabeled fMRI data, alleviating the need for extensive manual annotation. Furthermore, by preserving the sign information in the adjacency matrix, our model explicitly incorporates negative node relationships during spatial attention computation, thereby enhancing its ability to distinguish abnormal connectivity patterns associated with MDD. NNTrans also employs Grad-CAM to identify brain regions significantly associated with MDD. Cross-site experiments on the REST-MDD dataset demonstrate that NNTrans significantly outperforms traditional machine learning methods."

We therefore focused on the UNet3+ backbone and built two advanced variants: Attention-UNet3+, which inserts spatial attention gates into every skip connection, and Transformer-UNet3+, which replaces the bottleneck with a multi-head self-attention module. All three models-baseline UNet3+, AttentionUNet3+, and Transformer-UNet3+-were trained with fivefold cross-validation on carotid ultrasound scans from postmenopausal women in Hong Kong and evaluated with boundary errors (lumen-intima, media-adventitia), overlap indices (Jaccard, Dice), correlations with cIMT and plaque area, overall accuracy, and AUC. Baseline UNet3+ achieved a cIMT error of 0.0580 mm. Adding attention gates lowered this to $0.0385 \\mathrm{~mm}(33.6 \\%)$, while introducing a transformer block reduced it further to 0.0264 mm ($54.5 \\%$ versus baseline). Similar stepwise gains were observed across all other metrics, confirming that multi-scale feature fusion paired first with spatial attention and finally with global self-attention delivers the most precise CCA segmentation and, by extension, the most reliable CVD risk assessment."

In this work, we address this gap by distinguishing between startle and surprise events based on physiological signals using machine learning and multi-modal fusion strategies. Our results demonstrate that these events can be reliably predicted, achieving a highest mean accuracy of 85.7% with SVM and Late Fusion. To further validate the robustness of our model, we extended the evaluation to include a baseline condition, successfully differentiating between Startle, Surprise, and Baseline states with a highest mean accuracy of 74.9% with XGBoost and Late Fusion."

    "abstract": "In today's competitive marketplace, establishing a consistent and recognizable brand identity through product family design has become essential. Traditional design approaches, however, often rely on subjective intuition, consume substantial resources, and lack scalability. This paper introduces a datadriven framework for product family design that integrates deep learning, Kansei engineering, and generative artificial intelligence (AIGC) to enable a structured human-AI collaborative process. The framework identifies explicit DNA features (e.g., body-shape segmentation, decorative lines, ventilation grilles) through ResNet50-based visual analysis and quantifies implicit DNA attributes (e.g., “minimalist,” “stable,” “technological”) through stakeholder interviews and sensory-evaluative questionnaires. These dimensions are systematically translated into precise prompts for generative AI tools such as Midjourney and Stable Diffusion. Through iterative refinement and expert-user screening, the process converges on high-quality styling schemes, which are synthesized and extended across the entire product family. A case study on the Mingjian test instrument family demonstrates the framework's effectiveness. In a blind classification experiment with 12 participants, the redesigned family achieved a 100% correct classification rate, compared with only 39.2% for the original products. These results confirm the framework's ability to establish coherent and extensible brand identity while addressing the subjectivity and scalability limitations of traditional design workflows. This research contributes a quantifiable and reproducible paradigm for human-AI collaboration in industrial design, operationalizing the concept of cognitive synergy. Beyond practical use for design teams, the framework also highlights implications for design education, underscoring the need for future designers to integrate data analysis, prompt engineering, and AI collaboration into their skillset."

We proposed a control method when developing a control system for energy harvesting. Redundancy schemes, unlike today’s simple networks, require respecting operator-imposed limits on the amount of data received while extending the lifetime of the network. In some of these networks, the supervisory and control controller receives less unnecessary or reciprocal feedback from the nodes. Therefore, control methods should be designed to achieve efficient energy harvesting based on the utility’s needs through data-driven evaluation. Among several control methods, model predictive control is one important control techniques. There are several effective ways to use it. This article compares MPC techniques with particle swam optimization next Flower Pollination Optimization for auto tuning. The main task of MPC is to coordinate the control coefficients of multiple WSN targets, and PSO or FPO applications for automatic tuning can be used as part of the solution. The MPC tuning problem is an optimization problem. Optimization techniques such as PSO and FPO can be used. PSO and FPO are well- known metasearch approaches. Instead of relying on ascension and chasing higher percentages, seek out the best overall solution. The calculation results of WSN energy harvesting show the influence of the proposed parameters based on PSO and FPO."

    "abstract": "Sharks and tunas play a pivotal role in marine ecosystems, yet their populations are declining due to overfishing and habitat loss. Accurate, non-invasive monitoring methods are urgently needed to guide effective conservation strategies. In this study, we propose a YOLO-based automated detection system designed to accurately identify sharks (specifically silky and tiger sharks) and tunas in underwater videos recorded in the Galápagos Islands. Our training dataset was constructed from two one-minute video clips-one focusing on silky sharks and the other on tiger sharks and tunas-yielding 229 annotated images. We used 90 % of these images for training and 10 % for testing, applying a 5-fold cross-validation procedure. Each model was trained for 30 epochs, and multiple YOLO architectures such as YOLOv8 and YOLOv9 were evaluated based on mean Average Precision (mAP@50) and inference speed. Among the tested configurations, YOLOv9 Medium achieved the highest mAP@50 <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$(95.83 \\%)$</tex>, while YOLOv8 Medium provided a strong balance between accuracy and computational efficiency, attaining a mAP@50 of 94.20 %. By adjusting the frame processing rate, the system can be optimized for real-time or near real-time monitoring. To avoid data contamination, training and evaluation were conducted on distinct video clips. Results indicate that YOLO-based detection frameworks can facilitate efficient, reliable monitoring of sharks and tunas, providing a powerful tool for informed conservation efforts and sustainable management of marine protected areas."

    "abstract": "Among various electric motor drives, BLDC motor drives are gaining attention for numerous applications because of their unique features and characteristics. To operate the BLDC motor, the most commonly employed method is direct torque control (DTC). Traditional DTC models struggle to function efficiently when there are alterations in the source and swift fluctuations in load torque. Traditional PI controllers are unable to deliver precise output immediately during abrupt changes in the drive. Consequently, this paper proposes modified DTC utilizing super twisting sliding mode (STSM) controllers to operate the BLDC motor across different operating conditions. By integrating the regulation of the dc-link current (which serves as the input to the inverter) into the proposed control model, valuable speed and torque responses can be attained even amidst fluctuations in the power supply system. The proposed methodology is evaluated against several existing methodologies. Additionally, the design of the STSM controller has been integrated, and the PSO methodology has been developed to update the parameters of the STSM controllers. The suggested methodology is executed through the use of OPAL-RT units to demonstrate various outcomes of the hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) process."

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a resistance analysis algorithm for butterfly stroke athlete posture optimization based on machine vision. It combines deep learning and fluid dynamics models to capture the athlete's movements in real time and optimize their postures to achieve precise control of water flow resistance. The algorithm obtains the athlete's motion data in real time through machine vision technology, extracts the athlete's key posture features using DNN, and calculates the resistance under different postures in combination with the fluid dynamics model. Then, RL is used to optimize the athlete's motion path, reduce water flow resistance, and improve sports efficiency. The experimental results show that the posture optimization algorithm based on deep learning performs significantly in controlling water flow resistance. The optimized athlete's swimming speed is increased by 12% and the resistance is reduced by 18%. Compared with the traditional resistance analysis method, this method not only improves the accuracy, but also can adjust the athlete's motion path in real time, and has stronger adaptability and real-time feedback capabilities. This study provides a new intelligent optimization method for the training of butterfly stroke athletes, which has broad application prospects, especially in improving the training effect and competition performance of athletes."

This paper investigates the use of a Decision Tree (DT) algorithm for adaptive modulation and coding scheme (MCS) prediction in multi-user scenarios. Leveraging real-time datasets collected from a Software Defined Radio (SDR) platform using USRP N210 and GNU Radio, the proposed approach classifies modulation type and code rate based on key channel parameters, including user distance from the base station, channel noise, and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The DT algorithm's performance is evaluated using both Gini Index and Entropy criteria, with results analyzed in terms of predicted values, confusion matrices, and classification accuracy. Experimental findings demonstrate that the Gini Index yields superior accuracy compared to Entropy, achieving up to 100<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">%</sup> classification performance for certain parameters. Furthermore, higher user counts (50 users) enhance prediction accuracy due to richer training data.

This paper proposes a method incorporating multilevel visual and textual interactions while considering the weights of features at different levels. First, the pretrained BERT model encodes textual information, and the Vision Transformer encodes global and local object-level image features, extracting multilevel visual information using its hierarchical structure. Second, an attention mechanism guides the integration of textual and multilevel visual features, generating rich multimodal representations. Finally, expert routing assigns weights to features at each level, and a fusion process combines these features. The multimodal representations are projected through a linear layer to calculate the predicted relation probabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that integrating multilevel visual information with textual interactions significantly improves relation extraction performance."

    "abstract": "Microservices have become the dominant architectural paradigm for building scalable and modular cloud-native systems. However, achieving effective auto-scaling remains challenging, as it depends not only on advanced scaling techniques but also on sound design, implementation, and deployment practices. Yet, these foundational aspects are often overlooked in existing benchmarks, making it difficult to evaluate autoscaling methods under realistic conditions. In this paper, we identify practical auto-scaling considerations by applying several state-of-the-art autoscaling methods to widely used microservice benchmarks. To structure these findings, we classify the issues based on when they arise during the software lifecycle: Architecture, Implementation, and Deployment. The Architecture phase covers high-level decisions such as service decomposition and inter-service dependencies. The Implementation phase includes aspects like initialization overhead, metrics instrumentation, and error propagation. The Deployment phase focuses on runtime configurations such as resource limits and health checks. We validate these considerations using the Sock-Shop benchmark and evaluate diverse autoscaling strategies-including threshold-based, control-theoretic, learning-based, black-box optimization, and dependency-aware approaches. Our findings show that overlooking key lifecycle concerns can degrade autoscaler performance, while addressing them improves stability and efficiency. These results underscore the importance of lifecycle-aware engineering for unlocking the full potential of auto-scaling in microservice-based systems."

This research introduces a machine learningbased approach to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of CVD detection using ECG signals and sensor data. We explored various modern methodologies, including the application of Frequency Domain Measures coupled with deep-learning image classifiers. Furthermore, we leveraged the raw ECG signals, processing them through a one-dimensional convolutional model, and utilized the XGBoost model for time- series feature-based predictions. Preliminary results indicate the effectiveness of Frequency Domain Measures in predicting atrial fibrillation, though with some limitations for other arrhythmias. TheXGBoost model demonstrated proficiency with long-term data, albeit with extended inference times due to computational demands during pre-processing. This study underscores the potential of machine learning in revolutionizing ECG-based CVD detection, emphasizing the need for continual refinement and research in this domain."

This study addresses multi-stage decision-making in manufacturing, encompassing parts procurement, inspection, assembly, and handling of nonconforming products. A dynamic planning-based decision model is proposed to optimize decisions at each stage, achieving a global optimum. The model aims to minimize the number of inspections while accurately determining if defect rates exceed predefined thresholds, thereby improving operational efficiency and product quality. Initially, sampling inspection and the Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT) method are employed to estimate defect rates. Subsequently, a dynamic programming model, guided by a greedy algorithm, optimizes the production process, ensuring optimal decisions at each stage and an overall optimal sequence. Although real-world constraints may prevent full implementation of the theoretical optimal results, the framework significantly enhances process performance and decision-making in manufacturing environments."

    "abstract": "In recent years, the increasing demand for sustainable and energy-efficient solutions has led to the development of smart technologies in various sectors. A smart solar street light system equipped with dynamic brightness control and fault detection mechanisms can enhance the efficiency and reliability of outdoor lighting infrastructure. The system utilises solar energy as a renewable power source, reducing dependence on conventional electricity grids and minimizing the environmental impact. The system employs PIR sensors to detect the motion of vehicles or pedestrians, automatically adjusting the brightness of the street lights in response. This dynamic brightness control not only ensures optimal visibility but also maximizes energy savings by dimming the lights during periods of low activity. To enhance the system's reliability, a comprehensive fault detection mechanism has been integrated. The fault detection system monitors the functioning of lights through LDR modules. In the event of a malfunction or abnormality, the system is designed to promptly identify the issue and trigger appropriate alerts. The street light control system is configured to integrate with the Blynk platform. This integration allows the system to communicate with the Blynk servers and utilize its features, including sending notifications to connected devices via the Blynk app. This feature facilitates proactive maintenance, minimizing downtime and ensuring uninterrupted illumination of the street. A web interface is implemented, serving as a centralized platform for remote monitoring, control, and management of the street light system, while providing real-time insights. The integration of smart technologies not only makes the system an energy-efficient and environmentally friendly solution but also contributes to the creation of intelligent urban lighting systems. As cities continue to evolve towards smart and sustainable environments, the implementation of such innovative systems becomes imperative for a greener and more efficient future."

This enables real-time monitoring, intelligent decision-making, and adaptive cross-layer collaboration. In addition, we explore the communication mechanisms, core capabilities, application scenarios, and several open research challenges within this framework. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in dynamic traffic environments, we propose Lyapunov-based Aerial Traffic Optimization Scheduling (LATOS), an online scheduling framework for resource allocation that balances UAV energy consumption, communication delay, and computational load. Within the LATOS framework, we decompose the scheduling problem into two subproblems centered on transmission time and energy consumption. These subproblems are solved in an iterative manner to jointly optimize system timeliness and energy efficiency. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves scheduling robustness and energy efficiency."

These advantages stem from the use of inherently compliant soft materials, making them the safer option in many applications. Taking inspiration from biological systems, controlled deformation is “programmed” into a soft gripper through its geometry and materials, as opposed to joints and linkages as in conventional pinch-type grippers. This work outlines the development of such a system, a cable-actuated soft robotic gripper whose prehension is inspired by the tentacles of a cuttlefish. A segmented geometry and tendon-like actuation define the design to replicate the effortless, distributed bending observed in nature. The system development involved material selection, structural design, actuation and transmission design, manufacturing constraints, and the control system design. Through the integration of these elements, this work demonstrates a structured approach to building a soft bioinspired robotic gripper."

    "abstract": "The structure and function of brain neurons is severely damaged in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), resulting in the pathology of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Disorder (ALSD). The affected individuals are prone to different physical morbidities and psychological morbidities if it is not diagnosed and managed at the earliest. For this purpose, Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals that can record the brain's internal activity at a relatively lower spatial resolution, are mostly used. Nevertheless it is difficult to manually analyze the EEG signals for ALSD detection as they are in the microvolts in amplitude and due to the complex nature of the brain. To address this challenge, an automated Intensive Neural Classifier Model based on Deep Learning (DL-INC) for ALSD has been developed to assist medical experts in the screening of ALSD. Since EEG signals are nonlinear and oscillatory, the proposed DL-INC method examines this signal through distinct frequency sub-bands. The approach is based on an Enhanced Flexible Analytical Wavelet Transform (E-FA-WT) that breaks up EEG signals into the approximate and detailed wavelet coefficients. The statistical features comprising of mean, standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis and Shannon entropy are calculated from the calculated motion coefficients and these are utilized for model DL-INC training as input. The procedure apply a 12-fold cross-validation strategy for model training and evaluation. Performance is analyzed based on standard measures such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, F -measure, and precision extracted from the confusion matrix. The DL-INC with polynomial kernel among the models experimented recorded the highest accuracy of 99.06% using 12-fold cross-validation method."

    "abstract": "The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly advanced various applications on software engineering tasks, particularly in code generation. Despite the promising performance, LLMs are prone to generate hallucinations, which means LLMs might produce outputs that deviate from users’ intent, exhibit internal inconsistencies, or misaligned with the real world knowledge, making the deployment of LLMs potentially risky in a wide range of applications. Existing work mainly focuses on investigating the hallucination in the domain of Natural Language Generation (NLG), leaving a gap in comprehensively understanding the types, causes, and impacts of hallucinations in the context of code generation. To bridge the gap, we conducted a thematic analysis of the LLM-generated code to summarize and categorize the hallucinations, as well as their causes and impacts. Our study established a comprehensive taxonomy of code hallucinations, encompassing 3 primary categories and 12 specific categories. Furthermore, we systematically analyzed the distribution of hallucinations, exploring variations among different LLMs and benchmarks. Moreover, we perform an indepth analysis on the causes and impacts of various hallucinations, aiming to provide valuable insights into hallucination mitigation. Finally, to enhance the correctness and reliability of LLM-generated code in a lightweight manner, we explore a training-free hallucination mitigation approach by prompt enhancing techniques. We believe our findings will shed light on future research about hallucination evaluation and mitigation, ultimately paving the way for building more effective and reliable code LLMs in the future.

    "abstract": "Effective Road maintenance is critical for maintaining infrastructure quality, ensuring road safety and extending its service lifespan. However, traditional pavement defect detection methods at Pasir Gudang Highway are a reactive approach, time-consuming, labor-intensive, and lack real-time monitoring capabilities. The adoption of smart road asset management (SRAM) can address these challenges; however, its deployment remains limited. This study examines the key determinants that influence the deployment of SRAM for real-time pavement defect detection on the Pasir Gudang Highway, with the aim of transitioning from conventional to proactive maintenance. A quantitative approach was employed, utilising a structured questionnaire survey distributed among authorities, road maintenance professionals, engineers, and contractors involved in the Pasir Gudang Highway project. Data were analysed using both descriptive and inferential statistics to identify significant factors influencing adoption. Results indicate that perceived usefulness, including high productivity, accuracy, and reliability of output, as well as ease of operation, are the most influential determinants of SRAM deployment. The operational challenges and drawbacks of the current system have a significant and direct impact influencing the determinants. The findings provide actionable insights for policymakers and road authorities to facilitate SRAM adoption by addressing critical barriers and leveraging enabling factors. This study contributes to the literature on smart infrastructure and road management by highlighting the prerequisites for successful technology integration in road maintenance."

    "abstract": "This work focuses on designing a modified Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to improve the generator's performance while keeping the discriminator's influence minimal. The network is trained using the MNIST dataset, which consists of handwritten digits in grayscale. A DCGAN-inspired (Deep Convolutional GAN) architecture is adopted, featuring convolutional layers in both the generator and discriminator. To ensure stable training and encourage the generator to produce more realistic images, several enhancements are applied. These include adding noise to real images, applying label smoothing, and introducing dropout layers within the discriminator to prevent it from overfitting. Additionally, the discriminator is trained with a slower learning rate compared to the generator, helping to maintain a balance between the two networks. During training, both generator and discriminator losses and accuracies are tracked and visualized. The results show that the generator becomes more effective over time, producing images that the discriminator struggles to classify correctly. As training progresses, the generator loss decreases and its accuracy increases, while the discriminator's accuracy tends toward chance level. These outcomes highlight how targeted adjustments to training and architecture can improve GAN performance by allowing the generator to learn better and replicate the characteristics of real data."

    "abstract": "Communications have been an object of study for years, but not only terrestrial, now thanks to the advancement of technology and the need to study or maintain aquatic ecosystems, even for defense mechanisms in areas of war, are exploring alternatives underwater communication. This paper presents the development of a low-cost point-to-point underwater digital communication system based on acoustic signal transmission. The system uses a standard ultrasonic transducer operating at 40 kilohertz and amplitude shift keying for digital data modulation. A microcontroller manages the communication process and applies Reed Solomon block coding to reduce the effects of noise and signal distortion in the water medium. A custom communication protocol is implemented to manage data framing, synchronization, and retransmission. Experimental tests were conducted in a controlled freshwater environment at data rates of 100,600, and 1000 bits per second, and distances of 0.30, 1.00, and 3.12 meters. Results demonstrate that the system is capable of achieving reliable data transmission up to 3.12 meters at 100 bits per second with a bit error rate under four percent. The use of Reed Solomon coding achieved a consistent improvement in communication quality, reducing error rates by over forty percent in most cases. These findings validate the feasibility of low-cost underwater communication for short-range applications such as sensor networks and environmental monitoring."

This paper investigates the problem of localizing a low-cost Photo Detector (PD) in a VLC-based indoor environment consisting of only a single Light Emitting Diode (LED) as an active anchor, and multiple spatially distributed single-element OIRSs. We formulate the problem within an indirect, computationally efficient localization framework: first, the optimal Maximum Likelihood (ML) estimators of the LoS and Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) distances are derived, using a suitable OIRS activation strategy to prevent interferences. To overcome the grid-based optimization required by the ML NLoS estimator, we devise a novel algorithm based on an unstructured noise variance transformation, which admits a closed-form solution. The set of estimated LoS/NLoS distances are then used within a low-complexity localization algorithm combining an Iterative Weighted Least Squares (IWLS) procedure, whose weights are set according to the inverse of the Cram´er-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB), with an adaptive beam steering strategy that allows the OIRSs network to dynamically steer the reflected NLoS signals toward the PD, without any prior knowledge of its position. Accordingly, we derive the CRLB for both LoS/NLoS distance and PD position estimation. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in terms of localization accuracy, robustness against OIRSs misalignment conditions, and low number of iterations required to attain the theoretical bounds."

This paper explores the use of an efficient constraint solver, CP-SAT, from Google to automatically generate explicit issue orderings in agile development sprints. Using historical data from real-world agile projects managed in Jira, we evaluate how well different constraint configurations approximate a gold-standard resolution order. Additionally, we simulate user elicitation to resolve ambiguities in cases where the solver produces multiple orderings, including scenarios where user input may deviate from the gold standard due to user errors. By varying both the quantity and accuracy of user elicitation, we evaluate its impact on the quality of the generated prioritization of the issues. This analysis aims to identify the constraint configurations that best replicate the orderings of real-world issue resolutions. Our findings suggest the system accurately captures improvements in the solution space with increased elicitation and remains robust to user errors. All three constraints: priority class, issue type, and creation date potentially impact prioritization."

    "abstract": "This project addresses the problem of road anomaly detection, a pertinent challenge for autonomous driving. Autonomous cars are well equipped with sensors to read the environment patterns. Anomalies such as cracks, potholes, sidewalks, or surface wear are a challenge in non-autonomous and autonomous driving. To offset this, our model, RaDRoad-AI uses the RadRoad dataset that comprises diverse images of road condition. The data is pre-processed, including resizing and normalization to be ready for model training. Autoencoders, an unsupervised learning model has been employed for the same. The model is based on the reconstruction strategy. The reconstruction error pattern is used to identify the presence of anomalies on the road. Challenges such as high-dimensionality, noisy images, and feature learning are dealt efficiently with autoencoder pipeline. This research focuses on the building of intelligent, autonomous road condition monitoring systems to enable timely maintenance of infrastructure and enhanced transportation safety."

    "abstract": "The power consumption performance of a Finite State Machine (FSM) is significantly influenced by state encoding. Optimal state encoding can greatly reduce dynamic power consumption by minimizing switching activities. This work employs the Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) to determine the optimal state encoding and reduce power consumption. A cost model aimed at minimizing power consumption has been developed based on Minimum Weighted Hamming Distance. The proposed approach utilizes state probabilities and a total transition model to form a weighted graph for the FSM. Additionally, other meta-heuristic approaches, such as Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) in both static and adaptive versions, were also examined, and their performances were evaluated. Ultimately, the WOA achieved the lowest power consumption and demonstrated excellent consistency."

The system employs a $\\mathbf{3 6 0}$-degree array camera consisting of six RGB cameras, combined with a 2D ray sensor, to detect and localize hazardous objects in unstructured indoor environments. Using a custom-trained YOLO model and transfer learning, it segments objects and assigns hazard levels, which are then transformed into spherical coordinates. These semantic labels are embedded directly into the occupancy grid produced by the GMapping SLAM algorithm. Experimental results in a Gazebo simulation show consistent mapping with hazard-level annotations, achieving an average RMSE of 0.093 and a mapping cycle time of 893 ms. The method offers reliable performance for near real-time semantic SLAM. However, manual field-of-view calibration is currently required."

    "abstract": "As artificial intelligence-generated content (AIGC) technologies advance rapidly, their role in visual design has expanded from simple image synthesis to enabling creative workflows and seamlessly integrating into design systems. However, existing research has largely focused on AIGC's core image-generation capabilities, with scant systematic examination of workflow efficiency, targeted adaptability, and practical deployment in specific design contexts. This study leverages AIRAI Cloud — a cloud-deployed AIGC visual platform underpinned by Stable Diffusion—to propose and empirically validate an AI-assisted workflow framework specifically designed for children's food packaging. The platform empowers users, regardless of local hardware limitations, to navigate every critical creative phase, from initial concept ideation to visual prototype realization, while ensuring robust scalability and configurable adaptability. Empirical results indicate that AIRAI Cloud substantially improves designers' ideation efficiency, shortens iteration cycles, and enhances the effectiveness of visual communication with stakeholders. Compared to conventional design workflows or off-the-shelf AIGC solutions, the AIRAI platform demonstrates superior process alignment and integration value in targeted consumer product design tasks. This study addresses a critical gap in research on AIGC deployment pathways and system-level validation within professional design settings, offering empirical evidence and a platform-based framework to support AI-assisted methodologies in consumer visual design workflows."

    "abstract": "The digitization of historical documents faces significant challenges when dealing with degraded book pages that suffer from physical degradation including yellowing, faded text, stains, and uneven lighting conditions. These factors severely impair Optical Character Recognition (OCR) performance, creating barriers to effective text extraction and preservation of cultural heritage. This study presents a novel Color Transfer-based image enhancement approach specifically designed to optimize OCR performance on degraded book pages. The research employed a quantitative experimental design using a dataset of 50 pages from books published before 1990, representing typical aging symptoms found in historical documents. The enhancement pipeline implemented a six-stage process including illumination correction, noise reduction, color transfer using Reinhard's method, edge-preserving denoising, unsharp masking, and contrast stretching. Evaluation was conducted using Full-Reference Image Quality Assessment metrics (PSNR, SSIM, RMSE) and OCR performance metrics (WER, CER). Results demonstrated significant improvements in both image quality and OCR accuracy: PSNR values increased from 28.08 dB to 30.91 dB, SSIM improved from 0.49 to 0.63, RMSE decreased from 10.06 to 7.37, while OCR performance showed dramatic enhancement with Word Error Rate (WER) reducing from 70.81% to 20.02% and Character Error Rate (CER) improving from 44.90% to 5.25%. The study reveals that color transfer techniques can effectively address the unique challenges of historical document processing, though performance varies depending on initial image characteristics. This research contributes a practical solution for improving the accessibility and preservation of historical texts through enhanced digitization processes."

    "abstract": "Accurate nowcasting of Tropical Cyclone Satellite Cloud Imagery (TCSCI) is critical for disaster prevention and mitigation, but it remains challenging due to coupled uncertainties and multiscale dynamics in TCSCI evolution. While data-driven deep learning-based deterministic models mitigate biases inherent in traditional physics-driven approaches, their deterministic nature inherently limits uncertainty quantification. To address this, we propose TCSat-Diff, an ensemble framework that integrates spectral deterministic prediction with a frequency-adaptive probabilistic diffusion model. Specifically, we introduce a physics-inspired Reynolds decomposition strategy that separates TCSCI evolution into a large-scale trend flow and a small-scale fluctuating flow. The trend flow is predicted using the Adaptive Fourier Neural Operator (AFNO) with MSE loss for smooth large-scale forecasts, while the fluctuating flow is captured by a Conditional Latent Diffusion Model (CLDM) for highly uncertain small-scale fluctuations. To further improve frequency-aware uncertainty modeling, we develop a Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)-guided Noise Frequency Modulation module and a Time-Frequency Response module into the CLDM, enabling adaptive spectral focus during denoising. Experiments on 1,099 tropical cyclones (TCs) from the Northwest Pacific demonstrate that TCSat-Diff outperforms previous deterministic and probabilistic baselines. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of the decomposition strategy and frequency-aware modules. Notably, cross-regional generalization evaluation on 480 TCs from the Southern Hemisphere reveals excellent generalization capability across different hemispheres. These results highlight the potential of TCSat-Diff for global TCSCI nowcasting, supporting early warning and risk reduction for TC hazards."

The biological visual system, consisting of the human retina and brain, has the ability to perceive and process the changing information from the outside in real time. Here, based on synapses as the basic units of neural network processing in the human brain, we propose a quantum dot-doped artificial synaptic transistor that integrates perception and processing for bionic vision. CdSe/ZnS quantum dots are doped into the P-type organic light-absorbing material IDTBT as the active and light-absorbing layers of the transistor, and the device exhibits good transistor performance with a 10<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">5</sup> current switching ratio. The dispersed quantum dots provide a quantum well-like effect, which successfully simulates the modulation of synaptic weights under different light pulses, such as excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC), paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) and long-term plasticity (LTP) and other synaptic properties, and enables perceptual processing of visual information as well as colour recognition."

    "abstract": "This paper presents an enhancement to a hybrid energy system by incorporating an AI-driven predictive control mechanism designed to improve power supply stability and continuity. The proposed approach addresses a common limitation in conventional control strategies, which often respond reactively to short-term drops in solar irradiance by prematurely switching from renewable sources to the electrical grid. These transitions can lead to power flicker degrading the user quality of experience. Thus, a traditional operation state controller is extended with an AI-powered predicting operational mode governed by a real-time prediction model that forecasts shortterm solar power generation using a lightweight LSTM-BiCNNMLP neural network. This prediction, combined with an estimation of battery bank autonomy, enables the system to distinguish between transient and sustained irradiance reductions and to defer switching decisions accordingly. The control logic is implemented and validated in MATLAB/Simulink, demonstrating a significant decrease in redundant source switching and improved load stability under fluctuating environmental conditions. Results confirm that the proposed predictive strategy not only enhances system reliability but also operates efficiently on low-resource platforms, making it particularly suitable for rural microgrids and cost-constrained autonomous energy systems. This work represents a meaningful step toward the development of more resilient, adaptive, and intelligent renewable energy solutions."

Drawing on classical filter synthesis, a method to determine parameters for the HF equivalent circuit is established, while parameters of the LF equivalent circuit are derived according to positions of transmission zeros (TZs) and poles. As a result, analytical design formulas that simultaneously satisfy both LF and HF responses are obtained. This work breaks the conventional limitation that BTCs are only used in LF designs. To validate the proposed theory, a compact on-chip cross-band filter based on BTCs is implemented using four BTC units in GaAs integrated passive device (IPD) technology, achieving an FR of 7.31 within a chip area of only <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$1.90\\times 1.51$</tex-math> </inline-formula> mm<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>.

Targeting fifth-generation (5G) applications, the proposed design effectively covers both the sub-6 GHz and millimeter-wave (mm-wave) bands, which makes the circuit reusable."

In this work, we analyze the local QEM effect on QAOA trained via genetic algorithms (GA-QAOA), solving Max-Cut instances on up to 15 qubits using a mock IBM quantum backend. We compare three scenarios: non-mitigation baseline, post-training mitigation, and step-wise mitigation.

The paper justifies why there is a necessity to apply XAI to healthcare with references to the application of XAI to advance trust, accountability and adherence to ethical and legal principles.

We also discuss how such things are implemented as the criteria of evaluation, accuracy/interpretability trade-offs, and privacy data.

    "abstract": "Despite advances, personalized medicine involving patient-specific drug selection and dosing remains challenging. In this paper, we propose an interpretable, generative AI framework for drug recommendation and dosing. While clinical decisions often follow general guidelines, our approach uses patient-specific data to generate evidence-supported candidate drug-and-dose recommendations informed by up-to-date, provenance-linked sources. The Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework combines data from electronic health records (EHRs) and employs machine learning and explainable AI methods. The digital twin approach supports this by simulating counterfactual treatment effects in a virtual patient model. Hence, the approach provides not only patient-tailored recommendations but also a clear, evidence-supported justification for the suggested drug and dose. We demonstrate feasibility via illustrations and simulations and outline record-based evaluations across multiple cohorts, reporting lower dose-prediction error, better calibration, and better discrimination of adverse drug reactions (AUC-ROC) and lower simulated ADR-risk indicators (RRI = 0.78; 95% CI 0.72-0.85) relative to guideline-based baselines, together with clinician-trust assessments. Retrospective results were consistent across heterogeneous cohorts, suggesting robustness to population and data shifts. The dataset comprises 75% real anonymized EHR records and 25% validated synthetic samples used only for training, with all test metrics computed on real-only data. We evaluate our approach on a de-identified, multi-cohort EHR-pharmacogenomics dataset of 20,030 patients spanning Hypertension, Diabetes Mellitus, Oncology, and Renal Impairment cohorts (hereafter, the ADR-20K multi-cohort dataset), constructed from anonymized EHRs, PharmGKB resources, and GAN-augmented synthetic samples with patient-level splits and temporal blocking to prevent leakage."

    "abstract": "This paper introduces Provably Secure Homomorphic Steganography (ProSt), a novel technique that combines the principles of steganography and homomorphic computation. ProSt enables secure computations on data hidden within cover images using steganographic techniques. Unlike traditional steganography, which hides the existence of a message, ProSt assumes the cloud provider knows it is processing hidden data. However, it conceals the specific location and meaning of the secret bits, maintaining their imperceptibility and security. The system utilises the Fredkin gate, a universal reversible logic gate, to perform homomorphic operations on secret bits embedded in image pixels using Least Significant Bit (LSB) steganography. The paper provides an implementation of the scheme, including setup, secret embedding, homomorphic computation (which involves evaluating a single gate that is arbitrarily repeatable), and extraction processes. The security analysis shows that ProSt admits only a cryptographically negligible advantage for an honest-but-curious adversary. This advantage decays with the number of decoy bits and is preserved over any number of gate evaluations. This approach opens new possibilities for secure computation outsourcing in public cloud environments, enabling privacy-preserving data analytics, secure multi-party computation, and confidential image processing on untrusted cloud infrastructure. The paper concludes by discussing potential enhancements and future research directions to further improve the system’s security, efficiency, and applicability."

The system includes preprocessing techniques, segmentation, feature extraction, and classification algorithms for effectively, diseased regions identification. The features in the form of texture, color, and shape of the segmented images are used and classified by machine learning algorithms. The experimental results will illustrate that Support Vector Machine and K-Nearest Neighbor are dependable classifiers that yield high accuracy in differentiating common skin diseases.

Caused by sensor malfunctions, environmental interference, or human errors, these anomalies currently require manual inspection, which is time-consuming and prone to error. This paper explores the use of feature-based machine learning for automated anomaly detection, focusing on the interpretability of model decisions through SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations). Traditional automated anomaly detection methods struggle with generalization and often produce false positives and missed detections, motivating the need for more adaptive approaches. We apply Isolation Forest to detect anomalies in both synthetic and real NVH signals. SHAP values are used to analyze and explain model outputs, offering insights into whether detected anomalies are true positives or false alarms, and helping to characterize different anomaly types. The results show that SHAP-based interpretability significantly enhances the reliability and transparency of machine learning-based anomaly detection, making it more practical for industrial NVH testing applications."

The solution requires no additional or specialized hardware, ensuring high scalability and accessibility, particularly for low-resource settings. Beyond reducing the need for physical travel, the platform also contributes to the decongestion of healthcare facilities.

    "abstract": "Early detection and prevention of running-related injuries are fundamental to protecting the health of athletes and optimizing performance outcomes. Despite this importance, early diagnosis remains a significant challenge due to the subtle and often nonspecific nature of initial symptoms, as well as the dependence on subjective clinical judgment. To address these limitations, this work proposes a machine learning-based classification framework aimed at enhancing the identification of injury patterns among runners, thus improving diagnostic accuracy. The proposed method explores five classification models, such as random forest, three different feed-forward back propagation neural networks, support vector machine, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Gaussian naive Bayes on a comprehensive dataset encompassing biomechanical, anthropometric, demographic, and training history variables. The feed-forward back-propagation neural network with 1544 and 772 neurons in the first and second hidden layers was the best model, achieving the highest F1-score of 0.980 and 0.983 in the training and test phases, respectively. Consistent performance in unseen data demonstrated the robust learning capacity of the model and strong generalization in classifying running-related injuries. These results underscore the promise of machine learning approaches in supporting objective and scalable decision-making within sports injury prevention and management."

While early research emphasized hardware and algorithmic breakthroughs, recent progress underscores the necessity of Quantum Soft-ware Engineering (QSE), an emerging discipline that combines software lifecycle processes, tooling, hybrid orchestration, and human-centered design. This paper integrates insights from QSE and quantum software architecture (QSA) to propose a hybrid execution architecture explicitly shaped by Quantum HCI principles, emphasizing developer experience, trust, and the quality of interaction with quantum systems. While quantum software represents a new genre of software-intensive systems, existing processes and notations can be adapted to derive architecting activities and develop modeling languages for quantum software. Additionally, tool chains can incorporate reusable knowledge and roles to automate and customize the architectural process. By analyzing current research and iden-tifying existing gaps, this paper aims to guide the systematic development of robust and scalable quantum software systems. Central to this vision is meaningful human interaction, ensuring that developers can interpret, act on, and trust system outputs from design to post-execution analysis."

This study presents a manually annotated dataset comprising 12,005 commit messages from the open-source Apache Tomcat project, exploring emotion and sentiment analysis through the application of natural language processing and machine learning techniques. We studied traditional models (SVM and random forest), deep learning models (bidirectional-LSTM), and pre-trained language models (LMs), as well as their ensemble, to evaluate and compare their performance on the curated dataset. Our findings suggest that software engineering domain-specific pretrained LMs consistently outperform traditional and deep learning models. The ensemble of pretrained LMs performs better on sentiment analysis. Additionally, identifying sentiment from commit messages outperforms emotion analysis tasks. We have made model implementations and the curated dataset available."

The aim was not only to develop items targeting different facets of Emotional Awareness - such as interoceptive perception, emotional clarity, causal reasoning, and meta-reflection - but to examine how these items function when embedded in life-like scenes and paired with specific response formats. Each item was anchored to a volumetric clip, inviting participants to reflect on their own emotions or infer those of others in context. By analyzing expert feedback on item formulation, scale structure, and interpretability, the study foregrounds response design as a central component in measuring Emotional Awareness. This work moves beyond traditional self-report, offering insights into how immersive media and carefully crafted response modalities can enhance the ecological and conceptual validity of emotional assessment tools."

The model primarily consists of three essential components: BERT, Bi-LSTM, and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). To begin with, BERT serves as a feature extractor, leveraging its robust pre-training capabilities to capture the contextual semantic information present in the essay. The bidirectional encoding approach of BERT effectively captures the text's deep semantic meaning, providing a comprehensive feature representation for the subsequent evaluation process. Subsequently, the features obtained from BERT are input into the Bidirectional Long Short- Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) network to capture the sequential information and long-range dependencies within the essay, thereby enhancing the model's capability to evaluate grammar and structure accurately. Finally, the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm is utilized to optimize the parameters of the scoring model, thereby enhancing its performance by minimizing scoring errors. Experimental results indicate that the model performs exceptionally well in practical scoring tasks, making it highly suitable for automated grading systems, particularly in the context of educational assessments and essay evaluations on online learning platforms."

Traditional PID control is prone to response lag and low tracking accuracy. In view of the above, this article proposes a research on FPV unmanned aerial vehicle trajectory tracking servo control system based on H-PID algorithm. Firstly, a dynamic model is established, a PID structure is established, weight functions are taken to build a generalized Plant, and H ∞ optimization is solved to obtain a set of robust PID control parameters. Finally, through simulation, a tracking curve is obtained.

The outcome of the game can be determined by constructing for each defender and attacker their respective areas of dominance. In the case of one defender versus one attacker game, a adjust strategies method is proposed for the attacker to dynamically adjust strategies to identify the optimal attack point. For scenarios involving two heterogeneous defenders and one attacker, the study examines whether both defenders can function as effective defenders and proposes a cooperative defense strategy. In multi-attacker versus multi-defender scenarios, a task allocation mathematical model is constructed, and the problem is transformed into multiple one versus one and two versus one games by solving a simplified 0–1 integer programming problem, aiming to maximize the number of intercepted attackers. Finally, simulations are conducted to validate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed methods."

In this context, automatic segmentation methods have emerged as efficient alternatives to manual segmentation, helping to overcome limitations such as time consumption and subjective variability. This study assessed the validity of an automatic segmentation approach for acceleration signals recorded during load-lifting tasks, comparing it with manual segmentation. Four healthy female participants (aged 20 to 30) each performed 20 load-lifting tasks, conducted under safe conditions in accordance with the guidelines of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. An inertial sensor positioned on the lumbar region recorded acceleration data along the vertical axis. The automatic segmentation approach consisted of a subject-specific threshold algorithm, which used a 4th-order Butterworth filter and Savitzky-Golay smoothing to detect lifting events. For comparison, three time-domain features - rectified signal area, root mean square, and peak-to-peak amplitude - were extracted from both manual and automatic segmentations. Statistical analyses revealed strong agreement between manual and automatic segmentations for rectified signal area (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathrm{p}=0.535$</tex>; bias <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$=0.731$</tex>, CI: -2.689 to 1.226) and peak-to-peak amplitude <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$(\\mathbf{p}=\\mathbf{0.371}$</tex>; <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\textbf{bias} =\\textbf{0.003}$</tex>, CI: -0.002 to 0.008), with no observable trends or systematic errors.

While extensively explored in the context of public blockchains, its application alongside classical distributed consensus protocols in permissioned blockchain environments has received limited attention. This paper presents a shard-level integration of the Raft and Paxos consensus algorithms within a private blockchain architecture to support parallel transaction execution and improved fault tolerance. By allowing each shard to operate its own independent consensus process, the system mitigates bottlenecks associated with centralized consensus mechanisms. Experimental results under simulated conditions demonstrate that Raft achieves a peak throughput of 142,943 transactions per second (TPS), surpassing Paxos at 118,339 TPS, yielding a 20.8% improvement. Both protocols maintain low latency and minimal failover time, demonstrating their practicality for scalable shard-based deployments.

Existing AI tools may offer real-time analysis, but they frequently provide limited, generalised insights, lack a non-judgmental approach, and often overlook security factors critical for sustained communication growth. This paper introduces an AI-powered communication coaching web application that delivers real-time, personalised feedback on key aspects such as pacing, tone, clarity, and filler words, with latency under one second. Leveraging technologies like NLP.js, the Web Speech API, and custom logic, the platform ensures fast and accurate speech analysis. Designed with a clean, responsive interface using React.js and TailwindCSS, it supports seamless use across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices. The system also provides tailored analytics reports and integrates smoothly into enterprise workflows, supporting goals such as interview readiness, public speaking, and ongoing professional development. Results demonstrate that this AI-driven approach surpasses traditional methods by offering scalable, accessible, and individualised communication training, driving measurable improvements across diverse user groups."

Genomic datasets are sensitive and therefore issue of privacy is a concern because they are extensively applied in the current day medicine, research and consumer services. These databases can be attacked in a de- anonymization attack even without the identifiers attached since they can re-identify the person. Long-range familial searches reveal identities, which brings the question of consent as well as family implications and equity in genomic research. genomic beacons are query systems that can be attacked by allele inference attacks to alter the genotype of an individual. Observable characteristics can be traced to genomic records that can undermine its anonymization and re-identify researched people. The privacy issues involve surveying the systemic risks of sharing the genomic datasets and searching the research opportunities in case of safe cooperation. The problems associated with a synthetic dataset include keeping the accuracy but still provide perfect means of balancing between utility and privacy. All these issues can be addressed with the help of the multi key homomorphic encryption, which allows privacy preserving genomic calculations with the help of a state-of-the-art approach."

To ensure a comfortable environment within buildings, it is necessary to have a precautionary mechanism to maintain residents' comfort and health. Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ) mainly depends on indoor air pollution factors, such as the concentration of gases like CO<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</inf>, particulate pollutants (PM2.5, PM10), etc., as well as user comfort indicators like temperature, humidity, and lighting conditions inside the building. If the air quality factors and comfort indicators can be forecasted, it would allow for the prediction of future indoor conditions, enabling proactive measures. To contribute in this area, this paper proposes self-attention-based Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Hybrid Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-LSTM models for predicting future values of CO<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</inf>, PM2.5, PM10, temperature, and humidity.

The dataset consists of 4,992 Indonesian sentences annotated by psychology experts. To assess model robustness, experiments were conducted across various data proportions: 10%, 25%, 50%, and 100%. The results show that LoRA improves and stabilizes model performance, particularly under low-resource conditions. IndoLEM-IndoBERT achieved the best performance with an accuracy of 0.9657 and an F1-score of 0.9676 using 100% of the data.

    "abstract": "Decentralized learning, which facilitates joint model training across geographically scattered agents, has gained significant attention in the field of signal and information processing in recent years. While the optimization errors of decentralized learning algorithms have been extensively studied, their generalization errors remain relatively under-explored. As the generalization error reflects the scalability of a trained model on unseen data and are crucial in determining the performance of a trained model in real-world applications, understanding the generalization error of decentralized learning is of paramount importance. In this paper, we present fine-grained generalization error analysis for both attack-free and Byzantine-resilient decentralized learning with heterogeneous data as well as under mild assumptions, in contrast to prior studies that consider homogeneous data and/or rely on a stringent bounded stochastic gradient assumption. Our results shed light on the impact of data heterogeneity, model initialization and stochastic gradient noise – factors that have not been closely investigated before – on the generalization error of decentralized learning. We also reveal that Byzantine attacks performed by malicious agents largely affect the generalization error, and their negative impact is inherently linked to the data heterogeneity while remaining independent on the sample size. Numerical experiments on both strongly convex and non-convex tasks are conducted to validate our theoretical findings."

Western provinces have made significant strides toward elimination, while persistent transmission remains in eastern zones, particularly Papua. Climatic variability is a key driver of malaria dynamics, yet its integration into routine surveillance and prediction systems remains limited. To address this gap, this study introduces framework that integrates malaria surveillance data (2019–2025) with climate observations (BMKG, Copernicus ERA5) and demographic data (BPS) to enhance early warning systems and prediction accuracy. Three models were developed to capture distinct malaria transmission dynamics: deep learning architecture (LSTM-GRU-Attention) for endemic zones in Central Papua, hurdle model for elimination zones in Lampung, and univariate time-series model for Mimika Regency as a high-burden hotspot. Results indicate that zone-specific approaches substantially improve predictive performance, with the elimination zone model achieving higher accuracy (SMAPE 19.05<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">%</sup>) compared to the endemic zone model (SMAPE 172.21%). These findings highlight the importance of tailoring modeling strategies to transmission intensity and demonstrate how integrating climatic and epidemiological data can strengthen surveillance and accelerate progress toward malaria elimination in Indonesia."

    "abstract": "In the high-speed bipolar dynamic wireless power transfer (DWPT) system, the fast movement of the receiver (Rx) leads to the high-frequency mutual inductance fluctuation (MIF). This causes the violent Rx current oscillation, thereby resulting in elevated stresses and equipment damage. However, due to the complexity of modeling and experiment of the high-speed DWPT process, existing studies tend to focus on the low-speed quasi-static process. In order to analyze this transient problem, this article first proposes a Rx equivalent large-signal modeling method considering MIF for LCC-S compensation topology. In order to reduce the volume and cost of existing experiment platforms, a high-speed rotating experimental platform employing the MIF frequency equivalence principle is established. Furthermore, the mechanism of the Rx current oscillation is explained, the effects of different speeds and circuit parameters on the Rx current oscillation are analyzed by the model and platform, and the guidance on parameter design for high-speed DWPT systems is given. Finally, the above principles are verified by the experiment with an output power of 1.8 kW and a maximum speed of 120 km/h."

However, the ambiguity problem in magnetic pose estimation has been long overlooked that could result in inaccuracy and even divergence of pose tracking. This article is devoted to fundamentally investigating the ambiguity issue in 6-DoF electromagnetic pose estimation systems. Magnetic ambiguity is formally defined, and its existence and impacts on pose estimation are analyzed for single-magnet and dual-magnet tracking systems, then generalized to multiple-magnet systems. It is found that there are different types of ambiguity, each with distinct influence on pose estimation. Efficient algorithms are proposed to systematically identify all ambiguous poses in a workspace. The ambiguity in typical configurations of dual-magnet systems is identified and discussed. It is found that ambiguity can be completely eliminated by using at least THREE magnetic sources. An unambiguous tri-magnet system is proposed by combining the collocated and parallel dual-magnet systems and validated by tracking a continuum robot. This article lays the foundation for optimizing configurations of magnetic sources and designing compact, energy-efficient, but unambiguous magnetic tracking systems with minimum number of magnetic sources."

Investigating the migration dynamics of impurity particles in transformer oil is highly important for guiding daily maintenance and ensuring the safe operation of transformers. This study focuses on the motion and aggregation behavior of cellulose particles in transformer oil under DC voltage, establishes a simulation model for the migration dynamics of cellulose particles in oil-paper insulation, and the aggregation properties of cellulose particles under different insulation structures are computed. An experimental observation platform is constructed to monitor the aggregation behavior of cellulose particles in oil under various contamination levels, which verifies the effectiveness of the proposed migration dynamics model. The results show that, under the action of dielectrophoretic force, cellulose particles aggregate in high electric field intensity regions to form high-concentration aggregates, and such aggregation occurs even when insulation barriers are introduced between electrodes. The aggregation behavior leads to a significant distortion of the electric field in the oil gap, with the local field strength increasing by more than 30% compared with that of the unaggregated state. These findings enhance the understanding of cellulose particle aggregation under DC voltage and offer new theoretical support for interpreting sudden discharge failures in transformers."

    "abstract": "Current AI training clusters widely utilize RoCEv2 to enhance the communication efficiency of interconnect networks across machines. RoCEv2 relies on priority flow control (PFC) to ensure a lossless network. However, PFC brings specific side effects, such as head-of-line blocking, congestion spreading, and deadlock. Numerous studies have been proposed to eliminate the side effects. Unlike traditional high-performance computing applications, distributed machine learning (DML) is bounded-loss tolerant. In light of this observation, this paper proposes a loss-tolerant flow control (LTFC). LTFC does not rely on PFC to ensure a lossless environment, but to control the packet loss ratio within the tolerance threshold. Compared to the traditional trigger condition, LTFC reduces the likelihood that the PFC will be triggered. Additionally, we replace RoCEv2's default Go-back-N mechanism with a non-retransmission mechanism to eliminate retransmission delay. Further, we adapt LTFC to high network load scenarios through loss-aware buffer management. We demonstrate the bounded-loss tolerance feature of DML on our testbed and evaluate the performance of LTFC in simulations. Simulation results show that LTFC reduces the average flow completion time (FCT) slowdown by up to 27.2% and tail FCT slowdown by up to 23.8%."

In this paper, we propose a bi-directional motion enhanced semantic communication (SemCom) system for efficient and robust video transmission. In particular, we introduce a bi-directional motion estimation module to capture inter-frame differences caused by camera movements, where the obtained forward and backward motion vectors are combined with the residual information to generate motion-compensated frames. We also introduce a predicted feature module to discard semantically redundant features, prioritizing crucial semantic-related content. Leveraging information from previously reconstructed frames, the frame prediction module refines predicted frames with the assistance of the motion compensation module. To enhance the system’s robustness to channel noise, we propose a noise attention module that assigns varying importance weights to the extracted features under different channel conditions. Experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms existing deep learning (DL)-based approaches in terms of transmission efficiency, achieving about 33.3% reduction in the number of transmitted symbols while improving the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and multi-scale structural similarity index measure (MS-SSIM) performance by an average of 0.56 dB and 0.0024 over an additive white Gaussian noise channel for different schemes. When employing the same compression ratio, our method achieves an average gain of 0.637 dB in PSNR and 0.0038 in MS-SSIM over the slow Rayleigh fading channel."

The data set includes the varied scope of clinical and lifestyle characteristics, such as Age, BMI, Pulse rate, Cycle length, FSH, LH, AMH, PRL, and TSH levels and ultrasound measurements. In this project, various preprocessing practices are performed, and the main attention is paid to data normalization, categorical attributes encoding, and missing values. In the given project, models are trained and evaluated in terms of such performance measures as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1- score. Random Forest was found to be better than another model as it produced the highest accuracy. Thus, one can possibly indicate that this model is the most dependable and could be used to deal with nonlinear interactions between features. In addition, the model does not only categorize whether a particular individual is a PCOS or PCOD patient but also identifies the most potent attributes, which result in the occurrence of the disorder. As such, it is an effective decision support system that can be used to assist clinicians in making appropriate decisions."

The transient heat equation with temperature-dependent properties is solved by a pseudo-spectral Fourier scheme in space and a firstorder Exponential Time Differencing (FFT-ETD1) update in time, which analytically integrates the linear diffusion in the spectral domain while the nonlinear residual (moving heat input and surface exchanges) is treated explicitly. The heat input is represented by a double-ellipsoidal (Goldak) volumetric source with energy normalization to conserve absorbed power. Boundary losses are applied with a thin-layer sink combining convectionradiation at the free surfaces and convection at the base. For process monitoring, a thermocouple (TC) and the global maximum temperature are streamed at each time step and are used in a lightweight calibration loop (Differential Evolution followed by L-BFGS-B) to align the model with in-situ data. On a representative single pass, TC and peak-temperature histories are reproduced with about $6 \\%$ normalized error, indicating suitability for parameter studies and supervisory monitoring in wire-laser deposition."

The Lyapunov stability analysis methodology corresponding to the robust integral of the sign of the error (RISE) control method is exploited to theoretically prove the asymptotically tracking result, despite unknown uncertainties, tire self-aligning torque, and exogenous disturbances.

The filter structure utilizes two Differential Difference Transconductance Amplifiers (DDTAs) and a single grounded fractional capacitor, leading to a versatile filter design with four inputs and a single output that supports low, high, and all-pass filter responses at fractional orders in inverting as well as in non-inverting modes in a single topology. The proposed configuration allows for electronic tunability, with the filter characteristics being adjustable by modifying the biasing current (I<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">b</inf>) and the fractional order (α). The CFE approximation is used to get the rational function for the fractional-order Laplacian operator, which is realized by Foster-I and Foster-II topologies using MATLAB. Furthermore, the circuit's performance is validated using LT SPICE software using a 180-nm CMOS technology."

Maximum distance, average distance, total color values, mean square error (MSE), and magnet to noise ratio all gave positive correlations as expected.

    "abstract": "Sparse Bayesian learning (SBL)-based methods for wideband direction of arrival (DOA) estimation have shown impressive performance in terms of high-resolution. It generally assumes that all signals share the same frequency band, resulting in performance degradation when signals occupy different frequency bands. To deal with this problem, we propose a wideband DOA estimation method utilizing the Indian Buffet Process (IBP) prior, namely IBP-SBL, to explore the frequency band correlation structure of target signals and hence their DOAs. Specifically, IBP-SBL regards the spatial spectrum as the combination of multiple latent features to be estimated, and infers the occupied frequency band of each signal by exploring the activation of the latent features at each frequency point. Subsequently, the DOA refinement procedure based on maximum likelihood (ML) is applied to reduce the quantization error caused by grid mismatch problem. Compared to the previous methods, the proposed algorithm can associate each sub-band with the relevant signals even in scenarios with severe overlap of signal frequency bands, thereby realizing more accurate DOA estimation by using the estimated frequency band related to each signal. Numerical simulation results of 500 Monte Carlo experiments show that our method achieves lower DOA estimation error and convergence time. In real-world data experiments, our method also exhibits superior DOA estimation accuracy and clearer target trajectory."

    "abstract": "Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite networks, represented by Starlink, have rapidly advanced as communication solutions for unconnected regions and during disaster scenarios. However, related studies have reported that communication via Starlink experiences significant performance degradation due to link quality fluctuations caused by frequent handovers. Moreover, since Starlink employs a proprietary communication system, existing research has mainly focused on end-to-end performance evaluation, while its internal route selection mechanisms remain undisclosed. To address this, we simulate both current and future Starlink environments using the ns-3 LEO module and evaluate the impact of satellite selection methods on communication performance in LEO satellite networks. This study proposes a satellite selection method that predicts the satellite trajectory based on the variation in RTT, enabling the selection of satellites capable of providing longer communication durations. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified using two key performance metrics: communication duration per satellite and route establishment success rate, which have been challenges in previous studies. As a result, the proposed method demonstrated up to 98.4% of the theoretical maximum performance, achieving both stable route establishment and extended communication duration."

    "abstract": "In recent years, there has been a growing trend toward using large language models (LLMs) to automate penetration testing tasks, including reconnaissance, vulnerability discovery, exploit identification, and reporting. Previous works, including PentestGPT, Curriculum PT, RapidPen, White Rabbit Neo- PentestGPT, and HackSynth, have shown that LLM guided workflows can be superior to naive prompting and traditional scripting-based approaches on both capture the flag (CTF) challenges and realistic lab environments, and have attracted significant community interest and public benchmarking. Nevertheless, the complete automation of penetration testing remains an unsolved problem: current tools continue to fail to address issues related to managing context, orchestrating tools, handling environmental variations, and enforcing safety constraints. In this paper, we introduce a unified LLM-driven automated Penetration Testing Framework that divides the workflow of penetration testing into formally defined tasks, states, and actions, utilizing LLM-based agents to develop, execute, and modify multi-step attack chains across multiple layers of networks, web, cloud, and application environments. We detail how to integrate external tools (scanners, exploit frameworks, and knowledge bases) into the framework, design a memory and reasoning layer to prevent the loss of context, and define safety and governance controls to limit the misuse of the system. We conduct experiments using synthetic labs, standardized CTFstyle benchmarks, and real-world-inspired scenarios, and compare our results against those obtained from human testers, scripted pipelines, and previous LLM-based systems. Our results indicate significant improvements in task completion, coverage, and time-to-compromise, while also identifying failure modes and informing future research directions. The purpose of this paper is to provide a reference architecture and experimental guide for next-generation, LLM-driven penetration testing."

    "source": "IEEE",
    "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel pattern-reconfigurable fluid reconfigurable intelligent surface (FRIS) framework, where each fluid element can dynamically adjust its radiation pattern based on instantaneous channel conditions. To evaluate its potential, we first conduct a comparative analysis of the received signal power in point-to-point communication systems assisted by three types of surfaces: (1) the proposed pattern-reconfigurable FRIS, (2) a position-reconfigurable FRIS, and (3) a conventional RIS. Theoretical results demonstrate that the pattern-reconfigurable FRIS provides a significant advantage in modulating transmission signals compared to the other two configurations. To further study its capabilities, we extend the framework to a multiuser communication scenario. In this context, the spherical harmonics orthogonal decomposition (SHOD) method is employed to accurately model the radiation patterns of individual fluid elements, making the pattern design process more tractable. An optimization problem is then formulated with the objective of maximizing the weighted sum rate among users by jointly designing the active beamforming vectors and the spherical harmonics coefficients, subject to both transmit power and pattern energy constraints. To tackle the resulting non-convex optimization problem, we propose an iterative algorithm that alternates between a minimum mean-square error (MMSE) approach for active beamforming and a Riemannian conjugate gradient (RCG) method for updating the spherical harmonics coefficients. Simulation results show that the proposed pattern-reconfigurable FRIS significantly outperforms traditional RIS architectures based on the 3GPP 38.901 and isotropic radiation models, achieving average performance gains of 161.5% and 176.2%, respectively. Additionally, it reduces the required number of antennas and RIS elements by over 300%, offering substantial improvements in hardware efficiency."

However, as antenna arrays grow in size and link distances decrease, near-field propagation effects become significant, particularly at sub-THz frequencies. This letter proposes an initial extension to the 3GPP channel model to incorporate near-field characteristics at these frequencies. The approach models both line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight paths using exact geometric distances. An image-theory-based method is introduced to model specular reflections. The extended model maintains consistency with the existing 3GPP framework while enhancing modeling accuracy in the near-field."

Here, we introduce a clinic-friendly method that isolates and quantifies tongue agility, defined as the ability to execute rapid and precise movements, using a wireless intraoral sensing device that provides real-time visual feedback of movement. Six participants diagnosed with dysarthria completed seven one-hour intervention sessions. Tongue movement probability distributions were generated to identify individualized deviations from neurotypical patterns. An individualized visual feedback intervention was designed to redirect movement away from over-expressed regions toward under-expressed deficient areas. Across the intervention, sensing area coverage increased significantly by 10.29 %, while over-expressed areas decreased significantly by 3.99 %, and movement velocity improved significantly by 3.85 %. This pilot study provides promising preliminary evidence that precision visual feedback rehabilitation can reshape tongue movement patterns and enhance tongue agility in individuals with oral motor disorders."

    "abstract": "Autonomous dynamic systems (ADS)-based encoding of human motion skills has been widely demonstrated to exhibit high transfer efficiency in goal-directed tasks; however, significant gaps remain in the study of skill transfer for periodic motions, particularly complex periodic motions. In this letter, we propose a novel method for directly learning complex periodic movements using Lyapunov functions (LF), which is fundamentally different from all existing methods that learn periodic movements through limit cycle mapping. First, we introduce a polar coordinate transformation to decouple trajectory and angle modulation, enabling the radially increasing Lyapunov energy function to acquire non-radial expansion capabilities. Then, based on this, we learn a data-driven Lyapunov energy function by solving a dual objective optimization problem that combines geometric alignment and orbit parallelism constraints, aligning one of its horizontal surfaces with a periodic human demonstration trajectory. Finally, ADS is learned by sequentially solving LF-related constrained optimization problems. By designing appropriate constraint functions, we can ensure that the trajectories generated by ADS converge to an LF-level surface whose shape resembles that of periodic human demonstration trajectories. Both simulations and real robot experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method."

Our model employs variational quantum circuits to learn an approximate distribution over the configuration space, guiding the generation of new, physically meaningful determinants. This distribution reflects the correlations among significant electronic configurations, allowing for a guided exploration of the determinant space and accelerating convergence toward reference energies. By framing determinant selection as a generative modeling task, our approach contributes to the emerging field of quantum generative AI applied to many-body systems. Implemented using Pennylane and accelerated with JAX, the QLSTM model converges faster than both classical LSTM and random baselines. Notably, it exhibits stable and consistent convergence across different hyperparameter settings, suggesting that the model captures an underlying physical structure rather than overfitting to specific training conditions. Our results demonstrate the scalability and physical consistency of hybrid quantum-classical generative models for quantum chemistry tasks."

In this study we investigated how non-expert viewers evaluate modern sculptures. In a custom-built virtual reality (VR) art gallery, we asked 28 healthy non-art experts to view 3D scans of 10 figurative modern sculptures and to provide their subjective responses (e.g., emotional impact, likability). Simultaneously, eye-tracking and pupil dilation data were recorded. Using Gradient Boosting Decision Trees with SHAP analysis, we found that only three aesthetic judgments were consistently predictable from sculptural attributes: Beauty, Valence, and Technical Skill. Visual Harmony and Texture were the strongest predictors. Participants preferred smooth, more harmonious sculptures. Aesthetic evaluations became more systematic after exposure to sculptural attributes, with Valence predictions improving from 68% to 88 % explained variance. Eye-tracking analyses showed that aesthetic appreciation involves efficient, focused processing rather than extensive exploration. Participants who rated sculptures as beautiful showed 24% fewer fixations, 26% fewer saccades, longer fixation durations, and significantly lower gaze depth variability, indicating more stable visual attention. These patterns align with processing fluency theory. This approach provides new insights into the cognitive and visual perceptual mechanisms involved in three-dimensional aesthetic experience."

    "abstract": "Multivariate time series forecasting is ubiquitous in various fields such as financial analysis, medical analysis and weather forecasting. In recent times, approaches grounded in deep learning have demonstrated significant promise for tackling time series prediction tasks. However, recent research approaches focus on capturing temporal patterns from a single domain (time or frequency) and do not combine the strengths of both to deal with time series. Inspired by this, we propose a novel forecasting approach for time series data, termed the Time-Frequency Aware Network (TFAN). Specifically, in order to mine deeper temporal dependencies, TFAN captures both global and local information through a frequency-domain MLP module (GFM) and a time-domain convolution module (LTC). The GFM explores a new method of combining the frequency domain with the MLP for time-series prediction, utilizing the properties of the frequency domain to capture key global features. The LTC employs a segmentation mechanism to convolve the different time segments, enabling the model to focus on localized features in different regions. Comprehensive experiments conducted on seven real-world datasets reveal that TFAN consistently surpasses existing state-of-the-art models in both accuracy and efficiency."

    "abstract": "This letter proposes a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) assisted integrated sensing and hybrid symbiotic radio (ISAHSR) system, where the RIS is utilized to not only assist target sensing within the directions of interest, but also support hybrid symbiotic radio (HSR) communications with both parasitic SR (PSR) and commensal SR (CSR) in the absence of direct links. To enable HSR communications, we first introduce a hybrid modulation scheme combining RIS partitioning (RP) and hybrid phase shift (HPS), referred to as the RP–HPS scheme. For this scheme, we maximize the primary transmission performance under practical constraints on target sensing and hybrid secondary transmissions. A two-layer optimization framework is developed to obtain a high-quality solution. Then, we propose the Pure-HPS scheme, where both PSR and CSR setups are achieved solely through phase shift adjustments, eliminating the need for the RP operation. To optimize this scheme, we design a single-layer optimization algorithm with low complexity. Numerical results demonstrate that the Pure-HPS scheme achieves better performance with significantly reduced computational complexity compared to the RP–HPS scheme."

This condition is a major cause of perinatal morbidity and mortality. One way to address this type of medical problem is to use approaches based on computational intelligence models to detect the disease using variables of different nature. In this work, we develop a methodology (GA-FCM) that integrates genetic algorithms (GA) with fuzzy cognitive maps (FCM) in order to find the best model to predict FGR. Our proposal was evaluated using two datasets containing maternal and fetal variables, signs, symptoms, biochemical markers, and tests related to the Doppler study. The results showed that the models created with GA-FCM have excellent predictive performance. The development of this type of models could contribute to the early detection of this condition so that medical professionals can make the best decisions to ensure the health of the mother and fetus."

Specifically, the study addresses the issue of scheduling in batch process machines that are parallel and handle incompatible job families. The objective of this research is to minimize both the maximum completion time and the average earliness/tardiness of the jobs. Drawing on the idea of problem decomposition in the literature, constructing compound dispatching rules for solving the original problem, an automatic generation method of combined scheduling rules based on gene expression programming (GEP) is proposed. Taking into account the characteristics of the multi-objective optimization problem, the NSGA-II non-dominated sorting method with the elite strategy is introduced. At the same time, improvement strategies including Repetitive individual elimination, variable neighborhood search and adaptive genetic operator are proposed for the algorithm's shortcomings that the algorithm is prone to repeat individuals and fall into local optimum. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed improved GEP algorithm is verified by numerical examples. The results show that the improved GEP algorithm is superior to the traditional GEP algorithm and the GEP algorithm with terminal set elements as workshop parameters in terms of the convergence, distribution, and coverage of non-inferior solutions and significantly superior to the classic dispatching rules."

Teachers are required to engage in problem-solving, work with virtual colleagues, simulating typical professional interactions. The result of the assessment is the unique collection of collaborative and teamwork skills mastered by each teacher. The test is composed of 20 items, developed in multiple-choice and short answer formats, and it was compiled by 161 Italian teachers. Test validation combined both qualitative and quantitative approaches, confirming that the items actually assess the skills they were assumed to evaluate. Findings suggest that the test allows for uncovering the skills a teacher masters with a fairly high level of confidence. Additionally, they highlight the potential of the test in fostering self-reflection, professional dialogue, and continuous skill growth. The test offers a promising avenue to empower teachers with critical social skills, while promoting a culture of collaboration in education."

    "abstract": "Precisely predicting how volatile the stock market will be is still one of the hardest things to do in finance, but it's important for building smart investment strategies and good risk management. This paper proposes a hybrid predictive model, which takes the strong advantages and performance of the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Generalized AutoRegressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) models into consideration, aiming to enhance the volatility prediction. The procedure takes two steps: first, LSTM networks drill down historical stock data to find complicated patterns and produce residuals. The GARCH models then come in to forecast the conditional volatility from these residuals. This hybrid approach can improve the power of LSTM in non-linear patterns and time-series dependencies and, meanwhile, can take advantage of the successfulness of GARCH for modeling volatility clustering. The research, which uses historical data from India's BSE and NSE exchanges, employs careful pre-processing steps such as normalization, feature engineering, and the computation of volatility using the Rogers-Satchell method in order to make the data as clean and relevant as possible. A comprehensive assessment based on MAE, RMSE, R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> demonstrates the effectiveness of this hybrid model over single LSTM and single GARCH models."

    "abstract": "Inspired by the dual-stream (dorsal and ventral streams) theory of the human visual system (HVS), recent Video Quality Assessment (VQA) methods have integrated Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) to enhance semantic understanding. However, as CLIP is originally designed for images, it lacks the ability to adequately capture the temporal dynamics and motion perception (dorsal stream) inherent in videos. To address this limitation, we propose DVLTA-VQA (Decoupled Vision-Language Modeling with Text-Guided Adaptation), which decouples CLIP’s visual and textual components to better align with the NR-VQA pipeline. Specifically, we introduce a Video-Based Temporal CLIP module and a Temporal Context Module to explicitly model motion dynamics, effectively enhancing the dorsal stream representation. Complementing this, a Basic Visual Feature Extraction Module is employed to strengthen spatial detail analysis in the ventral stream. Furthermore, we propose a text-guided adaptive fusion strategy that leverages textual semantics to dynamically weight visual features, facilitating effective spatiotemporal integration. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly improving prediction accuracy and generalization capability."

A content retrieval based method for personalized online teaching video resource recommendation in universities is proposed. We use user association denoising and interaction enhancement methods to construct a tree structure model for the distribution of online teaching video resources. Based on the correlation between individual users, we establish a user feature distribution map and learn from each other in different views to achieve personalized content retrieval of online teaching resources in universities. Based on the content retrieval results, we implement clustering control of teaching video resources, mine the correlation feature quantities between user groups, and implement deep learning retrieval of content based on feature mining and clustering results. This alleviates the sparsity of data interaction between users and short videos, and achieves resource adaptation recommendation. The simulation results show that using this method for personalized online teaching video resource recommendation in universities effectively solves the problem of interaction sparsity. The clustering of content retrieval output is good, and it pays good attention to users' short-term and postnatal interests and preferences, improving the accuracy of recommendations."

Artificial Intelligence (AI) functions as a powerful investigative tool because traditional food authentication methods fail to discover modern complex food scams. Deep Learning (DL) models prove effective for boosting accuracy together with the efficiency of food fraud detection systems. The research investigates how Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) works with DL models used to analyze food authenticity. DL uses Convolutional neural networks and Recurrent neural networks and generative models as components to perform complete food composition analysis while identifying adulterants and detecting irregularities in both spectral and imaging data series. XAI plays a critical part in making these models easy to understand because it uses Shapley Additive Explanations and Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations tools to reveal both decision mechanisms and the importance of features. The paper explores the cooperative effect of AI with cutting-edge spectroscopy systems like Near-Infrared, Hyperspectral Imaging, and Raman Spectroscopy when these systems deliver precise compositions of food materials. The field still encounters multiple difficulties including complex computability and live computation and approval regulations together with moral dilemmas."

Engagement and emotions are two important factors that greatly impact a reader's perspective throughout a reading job. One statistical technique that aids in determining and evaluating an individual's emotions through written material is sentiment evaluation. Various instruments and approaches were used to analyze text data employing artificial intelligence methods to identify mixed emotions. Employing the Random Forest (RF) method, a 5-fold cross-validation method was used to distinguish between optimistic and sad emotions. In the end, the grid-search strategy was used to adjust the hyperparameters, and the outcomes were contrasted with those of five standard methods: AdaBoost, XGBoost, Support Vector Machine (SVM), LSTM, and Naïve Bayes (NB).

    "abstract": "The cost-effective production of green hydrogen by water electrolysis is a key issue for the green energy transition. Although current commercial electrolyzers are mainly based on Polymer Electrolyte Membranes (PEM), Anion Exchange Membranes (AEMs) as an ongoing research topic offer the possibility of reducing the initial cost of the system by using nonprecious materials. Subsequently, high-pressure AEM electrolysis decreases the need for mechanical compression. This offers further reduction of initial and operational costs. Subsequently, high-pressure AEM electrolysis offers further reduced initial and operational costs by decreasing the need for mechanical compression. Here, hydrogen is produced at up to $\\mathbf{1 0 ~ M P a}$ while the oxygen electrode with the aqueous electrolyte remains at ambient pressure. However, the removal of water vapor and small droplets from the produced hydrogen gas at this high gas pressure is challenging because sensors for level control introduce complexity in regard to tightness and integrity of the system. Therefore, a noninvasive measurement technique to capture the electrolyte level in a liquid separator has been investigated, that can be implemented downstream of a high-pressure electrolyzer. Using an ultrasonic transmitter on the outside of a stainless steel pressure cylinder and a receiver on the opposite side allows level detection. This assembly does not influence the integrity of the pressure cylinder up to $\\mathbf{1 0 ~ M P a}$ and enables low-cost level detection by implementation of excitation and analysis on a microcontroller."

TBT consists of five interlinked visualization perspectives: feature view, forest view, tree view, path purity view and history view, which visually reveal the complex structure and prediction dynamics of gradient boosted trees. The system allows for direct manipulation of model structure via actions including feature selection, node-pruning, tree pruning and path expansion that allow domain expertise to be incorporated into the learning process. We show that TBT works well on the Mushroom classification dataset and a clinical diabetes prediction dataset by exposing structural redundancies (so the model size can be simplified) with no penalty to predictive performance. Our work connects automated machine learning with human guidance, enabling interpretable and user-guided development of predictive models."

Various manufacturers provide this type of movement with the purchase of a robot controller. However, the calculation cannot be easily comprehended. This paper deals with the development of Inverse Kinematics for a KUKA KR6 R900 Agilus and the KUKA KRC4 compact robot controller using MATLAB. Then a PTP movement will be implemented with the developed Inverse Kinematics. The KUKA RobotSensorInterface and the MATLAB Toolbox RoBO2 L are used to control the robot. The calculation and the resulting movement are presented here in a comprehensible manner. First, the ambiguities of the kinematics of the aforementioned industrial robot were investigated. Taking these into account, inverse kinematics were developed over the entire workspace of the robot. With this inverse kinematics, all possible joint angle combinations are output for a desired position and orientation (pose) of the tool center point (TCP) in order to achieve this pose. Then, the solution requiring the shortest travel time is found. The axis with the longest path time is then determined in order to adapt the speed of the remaining axes to it. This results in a synchronous PTP movement. It turns out that in most of the robot’s workspace there are up to 24 possible joint angle combinations for a given pose, due to of the multiturn of axes 4 and 6. This means that a robot controller must use suitable criteria to select one of these solutions if more than one solution is available. Here, the solution that moves to the target position in the shortest time was selected."

Our method is evaluated on TVSum (50 videos), SumMe (25 videos), OVP (150 videos), and a custom educational dataset (75 lecture videos). The framework achieves F-scores of 0.687 on TVSum and 0.561 on SumMe, representing 8.4% and 6.7% improvements over state-of-the-art methods. Precision of 0.72 and recall of 0.65 demonstrate balanced performance, while maintaining 15:1 compression ratio and temporal coherence of 0.78. The multilingual module integrates Whisper ASR (4.2% WER), BART summarization (ROUGE-L 0.441), and mBART-50 translation, achieving 94.3% average BLEU score across five Indian languages (Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, Bengali, Marathi).

This study presents an AI-driven comment classification framework leveraging deep learning techniques for effective content moderation. The proposed framework is designed to handle the challenges of noisy social media data, Transformer-based models to capture semantic, contextual, and syntactic features of textual data and classification. The framework begins with rigorous preprocessing and feature extraction using both traditional approaches, such as Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), and advanced contextual embeddings. These features are then leveraged by a range of models, including classical machine learning algorithms as well as deep learning approaches such as TF-IDF embeddings, Universal Sentence Encoder, BERT, and DistilBERT. Further, the results of the aforementioned approaches are compared in terms of various classification performance measures."

    "abstract": "Head Computed Tomography (CT) scans are com-monly used in emergency departments to identify neurologi-cal conditions. However, manual radiology reporting is time-consuming and subject to cognitive biases, especially under time constraints. This work presents a self-attentive deep fusion frame-work for automatic radiology reporting tailored to emergency head CT imaging. Building on our previously developed system, the proposed model incorporates clinically validated preprocessing for head CTs, a multimodal neural network refined through fine-grained regularization, and intra-sequence self-attention to enhance context modeling. Eight uniformly resampled slices per scan are used as input, and each report section is generated as an independent caption and semantically ranked using a Transformer-based evaluator based on perplexity. The best pre-dictions are concatenated to form ordered reports. The model was trained and evaluated on a dataset of real-world emergency head CTs using ROUGE-L and METEOR as quantitative met-rics. The proposed system achieved improvements of +6% in ROUGE-L and +3% in METEOR compared to the reference architecture, and +4% and +2% compared to the same model without self-attention. These results confirm the contribution of self-attention for improving contextual coherence and report quality. The framework remains lightweight and scalable, making it suitable for time-sensitive environments. Future work will explore condition-specific modeling and vision-language model integration."

The system follows a three-layer distributed architecture consisting of an upper-level interface, a C++-based intermediary controller, and a PLC-controlled robotic unit. The intermediary layer coordinates command parsing, visual perception, motion control, and status feedback, using TCP and ADS protocols for decoupled communication. A YOLOv5-based detection module processes RGB-D images to localize rebar intersections, and coordinate transformation maps detections into robot space. Two task scheduling algorithms are implemented: a basic sequential strategy and an optimized parallel-action version where tying gun rotation and descent are executed concurrently. Experiments involving 32-node tying sequences across four stations demonstrate that the optimized algorithm reduces average operation time by over 50% while maintaining stable performance. The results validate the robustness, flexibility, and reusability of the proposed intermediary system, supporting autonomous task execution without code-level changes. This architecture offers a scalable solution for intelligent construction robotics."

Deep neural networks are investigated to improve classification accuracy. However, performance variability due to uncertainty sources is a critical challenge. To assess this variability, the effects of parameter initialization and pre-processing were analyzed. EEGNet and Sinc-EEGNet served as test models. Results indicate that network's weight initialization significantly impacts performance. Classification accuracy actually improves from 67 % ± 3 % to 73 % ± 3 % with adjusted initialization. Conversely, EEG pre-processing does not improve performance. As a result, pre-processing can be omitted to reduce computational effort.

This system extracts and compresses the features of 3D models based on deep learning algorithms, and uses adaptive quantization technology to dynamically adjust the data volume according to the complexity of the model to ensure that the compression rate is maximized while maintaining visual quality. To verify the performance of the algorithm, this paper designs a series of simulation experiments and compares multiple optimization schemes. During the simulation process, multiple data sets are used to test indicators such as transmission time, bandwidth occupancy and compression rate.

    "abstract": "Web applications deployed in cloud platforms expose APIs that are vulnerable to injection attacks. Cloud platform providers need to establish Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) at application API gateways to mitigate these risks. However, WAFs often struggle to intercept Malicious Injection Variants (MIVs) generated through mutations that differ from historical attack patterns. Adversarial training, which involves generating MIVs using techniques similar to those used by attackers and then refining detection models in WAFs with these MIVs, is a promising means of enhancing detection capabilities. Driven by this challenge, we propose AdaRode, which is an adversarially augmented robust detector training method designed from the perspective of defenders. To ensure the diversity of the generated MIVs, we comprehensively collected mutation meta-rule for SQL and XSS injections. To improve the efficiency of generating MIVs, we propose a sampling algorithm that uses internal model outputs as feedback for validating generated variants. Additionally, we conducted experiments to select the suitable model backbone. The evaluation results demonstrate that the detector generated by AdaRode significantly outperforms existing baseline methods in detecting both original attacks and attacks using MIVs. Our method improves the detection of MIVs by 10% of F<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub> compared with baseline detectors.

In the non-defrosting period, it can function as a general transformer to supply power to the distribution network.

We propose an explainable ensemble learning framework for multi-nutrient soil modeling, integrating both macronutrients (N, P, K) and micronutrients (Zn, Fe, Mn, Cu, S, B). The system employs a heterogeneous ensemble of tree-based regressors and multi-target learners, optimized for predictive performance and interpretability. Model explainability is achieved using SHAP, ensuring transparent nutrient-specific insights across agronomic data manifolds. To enhance responsible deployment, we incorporate a generative multilingual interpretation module that translates model outputs into human-aligned, region-specific textual recommendations in multiple Indian languages. This supports actionable decision-making by farmers and field officers, even in low-resource linguistic contexts.

    "abstract": "The urban transportation system suffers from severe congestion due to rapid growth in vehicle density, limited road infrastructure, and inefficient traffic signal control. Fixed-time and actuated controllers fail to adapt with the dynamics of varying traffic conditions, which eventually results in lengthy delays, higher consumption of fuel, and increased emissions. This work proposes an IoT and AI-driven adaptive traffic signal control framework by incorporating DRL and GNN methodologies for real-time optimization. The continuous V2I communication facilitated by IoT-enabled RSUs and OBUs provides real-time live data related to queue length, vehicle density, and waiting time. The DRL agent incorporates several algorithms, namely, $\\mathrm{DQN}, \\mathrm{PPO}$, and A3C, to calculate the optimal phase duration. Further, GNNs model the spatial dependencies among intersections for enabling coordinated network-level control. The concept of edge computing has also been exploited to reduce latency and increase scalability. Experimental validation has been done in the SUMO environment, where performance metrics like average delay, queue length, and emission level have been analyzed. The proposed IoT-AI-GNN hybrid ensures improved traffic flow, reduced waiting time, and enhanced environmental sustainability, thus proving its viability for smart city applications."

    "abstract": "The design and analysis of a small multiband patch antenna in microstrip that uses a Defective Ground Structure (DGS) to facilitate IoT communication and RF energy harvesting is presented in this paper. It is an antenna that is based on FR-4 substrate and is optimized to resonate at more than one frequency $(2.4 \\mathrm{GHz}, 5.2 \\mathrm{GHz})$ to be compatible with common wireless standards (ISM, WLAN) and at the same time to reuse the $\\mathbf{R F}$ energy in the environment. The squareshaped DGS etched on the ground plane increases the impedance bandwidth and forms other resonant modes that allow efficient multi-band operation without expanding the antenna size by a significant percentage. CSST Studio Suite 2024 simulation studies have verified that the antenna has a return loss no more than -10 dB and a VSWR of less than 2 at all target bands, and optimizes to an antenna gain of approximately 8.1 dBi at 2.4 GHz and 4.4 dBi at 5.2 GHz. The radiation patterns are constant and directional throughout the bands and the radiation and overall efficiencies of the antenna are more than 80%. The suggested design, therefore, provides a high-performance and energy-saving design as a next- generation IoT node by eliminating reliance on the battery and utilizing ambient RF energy. The paper presents the design procedure of the antenna, the comparison of the antenna performance with the current multiband DGS- based antennas, and the applicability of the antenna to sustainable IoT and wireless sensor application. 8.2"

However, existing self-generation schemes face two problems: efficiently revoking malicious vehicles remains difficult, and hardware-independent solutions additionally struggle to verify the legitimacy of pseudonyms. To overcome these issues, we propose an efficient Revocable CAA scheme with Verifiable Self-generated Pseudonyms for VANETs (RCAA<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">VSP</sub>). First, a Traceable Chameleon Hash (TCH) function is designed to implicit membership through TCH collision, enforcing verifiable and unlinkable pseudonym generation. And then a multi-parameter authentication mechanism leveraging dynamic accumulators, which achieves <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">O</i>(1)-complexity revocation via domain membership polynomial updates without system-wide reconfiguration. Formal security analysis demonstrates the semantic security of our proposed scheme under the random oracle model, with proven resilience against common attacks. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that RCAA<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">VSP</sub> achieves a 76% relative improvement in pseudonym generation efficiency, while maintaining the overhead of anonymous authentication and malicious vehicle revocation at ms-level, providing a lightweight solution for secure VANET communication."

Computation of pairwise alignments between candidate haplotypes and sequencing reads using Pair-HMMs is a key component in DNA variant calling tools such as the GATK HaplotypeCaller but can be highly time consuming due to its quadratic time complexity and the large number of pairs to be aligned. Unfortunately, previous approaches to accelerate this task using the massively parallel processing capabilities of modern GPUs are limited by inefficient memory access schemes. This established the need for significantly faster solutions. We address this need by presenting gpuPairHMM – a novel GPU-based parallelization scheme for the dynamic-programming based Pair-HMM forward algorithm based on wavefronts and warp-shuffles. It gains efficiency by minimizing both memory accesses and instructions. We show that our approach achieves close-to-peak performance on several generations of modern CUDA-enabled GPUs (Volta, Ampere, Ada, Hopper, Blackwell). It also outperforms prior implementations on GPUs, CPUs, and FPGAs by a factor of at least 11.7, 14.2, and 19.8, respectively. gpuPairHMM is publicly available at <uri xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">https://github.com/asbschmidt/gpuPairHMM</uri>."

Health care chatbots have emerged as a promising tool to bridge the gap between patients and healthcare providers by offering instant access to medical information. These chatbots, powered by Natural Language Processing and Large Language Models, can assist in symptom assessment, condition prediction, and guiding patients toward appropriate care, thereby alleviating the workload on medical professionals. This study presents a hybrid AI model that integrates DeepSeek R1 fine-tuning with a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system powered by MiniLLM. Unlike conventional transformer-based models, our approach leverages fine-tuned DeepSeek R1 for contextual medical understanding while utilizing MiniLLM as a lightweight retrieval engine trained on medical literature. This hybrid frame-work ensures real-time access to updated medical knowledge, improves response accuracy, and reduces hallucinations. The integration of RAG enhances the chatbot's ability to reference authoritative medical sources, making interactions more reliable and informative. With the increasing global demand for accessible and accurate healthcare information, this hybrid chatbot model offers an effective, scalable, and patient-friendly AI-driven solution, capable of providing timely and well-informed medical guidance in both resource-rich and resource-limited settings. By leveraging these technologies, we successfully enhanced the accuracy (95.22%) and efficiency of medical query processing.

While conventional modeling techniques, like compartmental or agentic models, exist, supporting tools are not necessarily standardized. Consequently, learning a new tool may incur significant effort. In this work, we explore the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) as a means to quickly transition from requirements, in the form of graphical model representations and initial parameters to a software-aided modeling platform with simulation and verification capabilities. Our methodology employs a metamodel-based language specification for prompt engineering, combined with multimodal inputs comprising textual descriptions and epidemiological diagrams. We evaluate LLM performance across three epidemiological models of varying complexity: a simple SIR compartmental model, a COVID-19 pandemic model, and an HIV transmission model. Initial results demonstrate the potential of LLMs to significantly reduce manual modeling effort while maintaining accuracy in structural representation and parameter extraction. The study provides insights into optimal input configurations and identifies key challenges in automated epidemiological model generation."

However., due to the complexities of the underwater environment and the scarcity of training samples, the accuracy of existing underwater target recognition algorithms remains a significant challenge. To address this issue, we propose an improved underwater target detection model, CA-YOLO, based on YOLOv8 and the Coordinate Attention (CA) mechanism, aimed at enhancing detection accuracy in complex underwater scenarios. By incorporating the Coordinate Attention mechanism, CA-YOLO improves the model's multi-scale feature extraction capabilities, enabling it to effectively recognize target objects of varying sizes across different underwater environments. Extensive comparison experiments validate the model's performance on the 2020 Underwater Target Detection Algorithm Competition optical channel dataset, with Recall reaching 71.3% and mAP improving to 77.3%, surpassing YOLOv8 by 0.6% and 3%, respectively. The experimental results demonstrate that CA-YOLO can more effectively focus on target objects by enhancing attention to key features, significantly reducing false detections and missed detections. This model offers robust technical assistance for real-world applications in underwater biological monitoring and the protection of marine ecosystems."

An adaptive population clustering strategy divides the population into subpopulations based on fitness differences to enhance diversity. A marriage operation promotes co-evolution and prevents local optima. A regional crossover-mutation strategy is applied in subregions, and adaptive parameters adjust the crossover-mutation probability to improve evolutionary efficiency.

The traditional deep learning models, though they are effective, have been known to consume high amounts of computational resources and memory, which restricts its applicability in resource-constrained healthcare settings. To address the problem of fast and accurate image analysis of medical images, this paper suggests ShuffleNet-AMC a lightweight deep learning architecture that is a hybrid of the efficiency of ShuffleNet and Automated Model Compression (AMC) to analysis medical images. ShuffleNet can extract the discriminative features of fetal MRI images to measure brain development and pediatric MRI/CT images to identify cancer, whereas AMC is able to automatically detect redundant parameters and compress the model to achieve a smaller size and lower latency without loss of accuracy. Experimental analysis of fetal brain imaging and childhood cancer applications shows that ShuffleNet-AMC can produce up to 70% of model compression, which reduced the cost of computations by a large margin and still produced sampletestable predictions. Its small size supports its application on low power medical equipment, mobile platforms, and edgecomputing devices allowing it to be deployed to scalable, realtime early diagnosis applications. Efficiency and accuracy are the two aspects through which ShuffleNet-AMC offers a feasible remedy in improving maternal-fetal health monitoring and pediatric oncology diagnostics."

To address this issue, recent works have suggested that retrieving background knowledge as assistance is a potential solution, yet how to obtain and leverage related background knowledge for the NER task remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose a neural-based approach that utilizes auxiliary knowledge from search engines for Chinese NER in big data systems. Specifically, we retrieve external related texts via the search engine with a query generated from the input sentence. Then, a multi-channel semantic fusion model is adopted to aggregate the original sentences with the retrieved external related texts. Experiments have demonstrated the superiority of our model across four NER datasets, including formal and social media language contexts, which further proves the effectiveness of our approach. By improving the accuracy and robustness of Chinese NER, this work provides a practical solution for safeguarding big data content security."

    "abstract": "The rapid evolution of Industry 4.0 and smart manufacturing has underscored the critical role of fault detection in managing industrial equipment and facilitating autonomous factory operations. Industrial equipment data typically exhibits high volume, diversity, and real-time characteristics, rendering traditional monitoring methods that primarily rely on expert knowledge and rule-based heuristics insufficient for addressing the complex and dynamic conditions encountered. To overcome these limitations, this study transforms raw signal data from industrial bearings into images using wavelet transformation. Additionally, noise is introduced to simulate varying signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), allowing for the evaluation of noise resistance in classic deep networks such as GoogLeNet, ResNet, and AlexNet. This process aims to identify the most suitable network architecture for the given dataset. Subsequently, image-based training is performed to accurately classify images into fault and normal categories. To further enhance model performance, parameter optimization is conducted using grid search, progressive grid search, and population-based optimization algorithms, resulting in a set of optimal parameters tailored to the specific equipment under analysis. Finally, decision fusion of multiple trained models is implemented to improve classification accuracy for test samples. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach effectively extracts image features through convolution and pooling operations, enabling automatic recognition and intelligent diagnostics in industrial processes. This provides new insights into equipment monitoring and lifecycle management."

In addition, monthly rainfall data, mean temperature, and maximum and minimum temperatures are utilized as climate risk indicators to demonstrate their impact on ESG performance in India using a multifaceted methodology. The Granger causality test is conducted to assess the direction of the influence of the change in climate risk on market performance. Time series models are developed using ARIMA in order to forecast trend lines and explain dynamic interaction across time. The results indicate ESG index is being positively influenced by rising mean and minimum temperatures, which may indicate market optimism for more comfortable climatic developments. The negative effects of maximum temperatures and rainfall may be a sign of operational or economic difficulties brought on by extreme weather."

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a motion control optimization algorithm of cable-driven robot based on deep learning, which combines DNN and RL. The algorithm extracts features of the motion characteristics of the cable-driven robot through deep neural network, analyzes and learns historical motion data, and combines the reward mechanism of reinforcement learning to optimize the control strategy and motion trajectory in real time in complex and dynamic environments. The experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm has higher precision, faster response and higher energy efficiency than the conventional one. Specifically, the optimized control scheme improves the robot control accuracy by 15%, the response speed by 20%, and the energy efficiency by 10%. The results show that the algorithm combining deep learning and reinforcement learning can effectively improve the robot's motion control ability in complex environments, which not only improves the accuracy and stability of the robot's motion, but also enhances its adaptability in changing environments."

    "abstract": "Geo-Foundational Models (GFMs) enable fast and reliable extraction of spatiotemporal information from satellite imagery, improving flood inundation mapping by leveraging location and time embeddings. Despite their potential, it remains unclear whether GFMs outperform traditional models like U-Net. A systematic comparison across sensors and data availability scenarios is still lacking, which is essential to guide end-users in model selection. To address this, we evaluate three GFMs—Prithvi 2.0, Clay V1.5, DOFA—and UViT (a Prithvi variant), against TransNorm, U-Net, DeepLabv3+, and Attention U-Net using PlanetScope, Sentinel-1, and Sentinel-2. We observe competitive performance among all GFMs, with 2–5% variation between the best and worst models across sensors. Clay outperforms others on PlanetScope (0.79 mIoU) and Sentinel-2 (0.72), while Prithvi leads on Sentinel-1 (0.57). In leave-one-region-out cross-validation across five regions, Clay shows slightly better performance across all sensors, with mIoU scores of 0.72, 0.66, and 0.51 for PanetScope, Sentinel-2, and Sentinel-1 respectively, compared to Prithvi (0.70, 0.64, 0.49) and DOFA (0.67, 0.64, 0.49).Across all 19 sites, cross-validation reveals a 4% improvement by Clay over U-Net. Visual inspection highlights Clay's superior ability to retain fine details. Few-shot experiments show Clay achieves 0.64 mIoU on PlanetScope with just five training images, outperforming Prithvi (0.24) and DOFA (0.35). In terms of computational time, Clay is a better choice due to its smaller model size (26M parameters), making it approximately 3× faster than Prithvi (650M) and 2× faster than DOFA (410M). Our results suggest GFMs offer small to moderate improvements in flood mapping accuracy at lower computational cost and labeling effort."

    "abstract": "The increasing need for efficient spectrum management arises from the speed of sending 5G networks into service to support different applications while keeping peak network performance levels. Spectrum management tactics which work traditionally do not have the capability to calibrate efficiently to the complex 5G environment hence encountering the efficiency problems of distributing spectrum resource. This research assesses cognitive fuzzy logic algorithms as revolutionary methods for 5G networks high spectrum management structures. The cognitive fuzzy logic combines fuzzy logic reasoning with cognitive computing technology to provide smart real time decision system at dynamic operational situations. The proposed framework leverages user demand along with traffic pattern with interference level and QoS to make optimal spectrum allocation decision. The fusion of fuzzy systems structure and cognitive models results in an algorithm that offers superior spectral performance and reduced latency times with guaranteed fair distribution of resources. Simulation tests along with performance analyses ensure successful verification that the proposed method provides outstanding results as compared to conventional spectrum management practices. The research shows that cognitive fuzzy logic is a transformational solution to spectrum challenges in 5G networks and support the intelligent sustainable wireless communication."

This paper explores the differences in correlation between original and derived topics, as well as the challenges in capturing users' dynamic emotions, while proposing a derivative topic propagation model that integrates topic relevance and user sentiment. First, to tackle the identification and classification of derived topics, this paper introduces the KC-SIFRank model. By extracting topic keywords and performing keyword clustering, this model enables the identification of derivative topics and the evaluation of their relevance to the original topic. Secondly, to tackle the challenge of capturing users' dynamic emotions and their changes, this paper proposes DeepLex, a novel text-to-emotion method. This method can learn the dynamic changes in users' emotions and calculate specific user sentiment scores. Finally, to solve the problem of multi-level feature interaction in user-topic interactions, this paper develops the TRS-GCN derivative topic prediction model. Experimental results confirm that this model, which integrates topic relevance and sentiment analysis results, can not only predict user behaviors more accurately and infer the propagation patterns of derivative topics effectively, but also significantly enhance its interpretability and predictive performance."

This issue has long been a prominent subject of study in the marine acoustics domain.

The algorithm constructs frequency basis matrices and time basis matrices for target echoes and reverberation, respectively. It establishes sparsity constraints to fully utilize the sparse characteristics of target echoes and combines optimization estimation with constraints such as temporal continuity and time length. This effectively improves the robustness of target signal extraction. When compared to PCI algorithms and AR pre-whitening algorithms, this method demonstrates significant improvements in SRR while also better preserving the temporal and spectral properties of the target signals."

This study investigates the role of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) molecular weight in determining the performance of a composite hydrogel sensor. The effect of varying molecular weights of PVA at $61,70,145$, and 200 kDa on the mechanical strength, swelling behavior, surface hydrophilicity, and electrical conductivity properties of hydrogel sensor were investigated. The results showed that molecular weight significantly influences the structure and functionality of the hydrogel. Hydrogels with 145 kDa PVA demonstrated the most favorable balance across key performance metrics including high swelling ratio, low water contact angle (high hydrophilicity), good tensile strength, and reliable piezoresistive behavior. Although the 200 kDa PVA hydrogel exhibited the highest electrical conductivity (0.010 S/m), its excessive rigidity and limited flexibility reduced its suitability for dynamic sensing. In contrast, the 61 and 70 kDa variants showed moderate conductivity but lacked mechanical robustness. Notably, the 145 kDa hydrogel, despite its lower conductivity ($0.007 \\mathrm{~S} / \\mathrm{m}$), offered the optimal balance between mechanical resilience and stable piezoresistive as the most promising formulation for flexible sensing applications."

This paper presents a systematic comparison of two deep learning architectures for LDCT denoising: a conventional 2D UNet and a hybrid 3D-to-2D UNet. Both models were trained and tested under identical conditions on the Mayo Clinic LDCT Challenge dataset and evaluated using peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity index measure (SSIM), normalized root mean square error (NRMSE), and edge preservation index (EPI), alongside qualitative analysis. Results show that the 3D-to-2D UNet achieves superior fidelity and structural preservation by exploiting inter-slice context, though at a higher computational cost, while the 2D UNet offers faster, resource-efficient performance. Despite many denoising techniques in the literature, direct comparisons between 2D and hybrid 3D-to-2D models remain limited; this work addresses that gap and underscores the tradeoff between accuracy and efficiency in LDCT denoising."

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the dependent task scheduling with service caching (DTSSC) in mobile edge computing (MEC) systems, where each task requires a specific service program for execution. The DTSSC problem is characterized by bi-objective optimization, minimizing the application delay and energy consumption of the mobile equipment, simultaneously. The conflict between the two objectives in the problem makes it quite challenging to address. Recently, some single-objective reinforcement learning (SORL) algorithms have been introduced to solve the DTSSC problem. Nevertheless, these SORLs adopt the weighted sum method to define the user utility, thus ignoring the conflict between objectives. Furthermore, in dynamic MEC scenarios, the weights (i.e., preference) assigned to each objective may vary over time, posing significant challenges for conventional SORLs. Although several multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) algorithms have been adopted to handle dynamic preferences, they only adapt to small-scale dynamic preferences and cannot generalize across all possible preferences. To solve these challenges, we first build a multi-objective Markov decision process model that has a vectorial reward mechanism. Each component of the reward and one of the two objectives is correlated. Then, we propose a new trajectory-based experience replay scheme to improve sample efficiency and reduce replay buffer bias, resulting in a modified MORL algorithm. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is more adaptive to dynamic preferences and strikes a better balance between objectives compared with several algorithms."

Ultra-Reliable Low Latency Communication (URLLC) and Hyper-Reliable Low Latency Communication (HRLLC) are the cutting-edge services offered by 5G and 6G wireless systems, enabling more missioncritical applications by employing highly reliable and low latency signal transmission. Apart from applications emphasize reliability and low latency, this study focuses on a lightweight security mechanism known as Physical Layer Security (PLS), which is an essential requirement to enable secure data transmission in mission-critical applications. URLLC/HRLLC uses finite block length (FBL) signals to achieve stringent reliability and latency requirements, thereby eliminating the need for traditional key-based cryptographic techniques. Then the Channel State Information (CSI) value and signal block length, are correspondingly introduced. Therefore, this survey presents a comprehensive and detailed study on the PLS of URLLC/HRLLC in 5G and beyond communications. This paper mainly concentrates on the current enhancements in PLS for mission-critical applications and provides an in-depth review of finite block length-oriented and CSI-driven strategies employed in URLLC/HRLLC. This review emphasizes state-of-the-art robust and adaptive CSI-based security frameworks that address channel estimation errors. The Novel Idea of this study is to introduce a unified design oriented PLS frame work that integrates FBL communication theory and Practical CSI limitations in wireless networks Finally, the survey discusses several key challenges and identifies open research directions in joint FBL-CSI optimization, secure training signal design, and energy-efficient secrecy protocols for future 6 G wireless networks."

    "abstract": "To improve the accuracy and robustness of fault diagnosis with limited identically distributed labeled data and unknown diagnostic targets, this paper proposes a fault diagnosis method that integrates Classifier Prediction Consistency with Domain Generalization (CPC-DG). First, unlike traditional DG-based fault diagnosis, which primarily focuses on aligning global feature distributions and neglects inter-class boundary ambiguity, our method employs a dual-classifier adversarial training strategy, which refines the decision boundary by maximizing prediction divergence between classifiers on boundary samples and guides the shared feature extractor to learn more discriminative features, specifically keeping robust under shifted target domain. Second, to mitigate the noise associated with traditional pseudo-labeling techniques, which typically rely on the confidence outputs of a single classifier, we develop a pseudo-label generation and validation technique based on dual-classifier consensus. This approach assigns pseudo-labels only to unlabeled samples exhibiting high prediction consistency between classifiers by iterative updates to filter out unreliable labels that could impair model performance. Third, the boundary refinement and high-quality pseudo-labeling mechanisms are integrated with a global alignment strategy based on Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) to minimize distribution discrepancies across multiple source domains. Lastly, extensive experiments on the CWRU and PU bearing benchmark datasets verify that the proposed method achieves superior diagnostic accuracy in scenarios characterized by label scarcity and an unknown target domain."

    "abstract": "Research has shown that providing external arm weight support increases the arm’s range of motion, and training with graduated weight support can help break abnormal movement patterns. Arm rehabilitation robots can be used for training with adaptive arm weight support, but they tend to be complex and bulky for use in small clinics or homes. Passive arm weight support devices, on the other hand, can be used in small clinics or homes but require manual adjustments of springs/rubber bands for de-weighting the arm and do not measure arm movements to provide feedback. To this end, we propose a simple robot with a single actuator and four degrees of freedom: MARS (Motorized Arm Support), which can provide adaptive arm de-weighting and measure arm movements to provide gamified feedback for in-clinic and at-home use. This article presents the mechanical design of MARS, the algorithms for estimating human arm joint kinematics from the robot’s data, and the characterization of the Challenge Point Controller that adapts the weight support based on the success rate of task completion. A three degrees-of-freedom mechatronic model of the human arm was used in the characterization of MARS. The results indicate that (1) the human arm joint kinematics can be estimated with high accuracy (median error <2.5°) without any external sensors, and (2) MARS can maintain a desired success rate (mean error <13.3%) during training by adapting the weight support. We believe the simple approach proposed here can lead to a compact, cost-effective tool with significant benefits for both in-clinic and home-based hand rehabilitation."

SWD framework performs weed-crop classification based on sugarcane leaf area index (LAI) estimation, and predicts yield. The SWD framework consists of customers convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with pre-trained architectures such as ResNet18, VGG16, and MobileNetV2 to classify sugarcane weeds such as grassy weeds, broad leaved weeds and sedges from UAV-based multispectral and RGB images. LAI based weed detection in sugarcane fields combines the radiometric correction, vegetation index computation (NDVI, GNDVI), sequential land cover masking, and empirical LAI modelling. SWD framework segments the soil background and improves the accuracy in heterogeneous regions in sugarcane field. Proposed SWD measures yield prediction through using environmental parameter such as rainfall, temperature, soil nutrient concentration, and pesticide application.

To overcome these limitations, this study proposes an automated method for bridge crack identification and quantitative analysis utilizing an improved YOLOv7 model and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The approach integrates high-resolution UAV-based imaging with deep learning, incorporating key optimizations in three areas: (1) the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) to enhance feature extraction of fine cracks; (2) the adoption of a focal loss function and an adaptive data augmentation strategy to improve generalization in complex environments; and (3) the design of a lightweight network architecture to enable real-time processing on embedded UAV platforms. Experimental results on a dataset of 500 bridge crack images demonstrate that the improved model achieves a mean Average Precision (mAP@0.5) of 98.7%. The average measurement errors for crack length and width are 1.5 mm and 0.3 mm, respectively.

    "abstract": "Crop diseases pose a significant threat to global food security by negatively impacting agricultural productivity and quality. Traditional methods of disease detection and diagnosis often rely on visual inspection by experts, leading to delays in identification and treatment. Machine learning (ML) techniques offer a promising solution to automate the diagnosis and detection of agricultural diseases. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of recent advancements in ML-based strategies to address this critical agricultural challenge. The research explores the potential of Artificial Intelligence Markup Language (AIML) for developing models that detect and diagnose crop diseases. AIML is used to construct complex patterns and templates that capture distinctive features differentiating various genders and age groups, akin to rule-based programming. These AIML components serve as the foundation for classifiers designed to infer crop diseases from diverse input sources, including images and videos. Additionally, the study evaluates the adaptability of AIML models across different contexts, domains, and languages. The resulting insights offer a thorough understanding of AIML's capabilities as a versatile tool for crop disease detection, potentially overcoming linguistic barriers and complex domain-specific nuances. The project highlights the potential of data science to advance intelligent systems for various real-world applications by proposing a robust and ethical approach to visual analysis. Emphasizing transparency and interpretability is prioritized to build trust and facilitate the model's integration into practical applications."

This paper examines the voltage and frequency behavior of power systems integrating wind power plants and battery energy storage systems (BESS) with the grid under disturbance events. Through case studies, the response of each technology is analyzed to assess their performance over time and identify potential benefits based on their integration. Results demonstrate that BESS enhance power system performance due to their rapid response during frequency and voltage events.

    "abstract": "Edge computing stands out as a pivotal technology in enhancing the performance and efficiency of various applications, including online gaming, autonomous vehicles, smart cities, and more. This model expands the reach of cloud paradigm to the periphery of the network, closer to data sources, thus reducing delay, conserving bandwidth, and enhancing privacy. However, it introduces significant challenges in resource management and task offloading due to the diverse and dispersed nature of edge devices. To tackle these challenges, this paper advocates the use of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) techniques to handle heterogeneous task in dynamic environment. DRL's adaptive and predictive capabilities make it an ideal solution for dynamically managing tasks in an edge environment, optimizing Quality of Service (QoS) aspects such as delay, energy usage, and resource allocation. We present a comprehensive framework, explore various DRL algorithms, and simulate the environment to evaluate the proposed methods' effectiveness. This study aims to contribute significantly to the field of edge computing by enhancing the QoS, thereby supporting the robust development of real-time, distributed applications."

Stochasticity improves robustness and generalisation by adding unpredictability in ViT. At the same time, dynamic token selection allows the model to process the inter-patch informative tokens, concentrating on essential face regions like the mouth, nose, and eyes. Our method achieves notable accuracy gains on the TALFW dataset, a benchmark for face recognition in adversarial scenarios. We have evaluated our method on face recognition benchmarks to demonstrate the model's robustness in different scenarios such as pose, occultation, and age invariance.

    "abstract": "Agentic AI systems that can pursue complex goals with minimal direct supervision-should show to be generally advantageous if we can successfully integrate them into our culture. Numerous sources and manifestations of algorithmic harm have been identified by research in the areas of fairness, accountability, transparency, and ethics. These include policing, recommendations, health care, and finance. It will take considerable work to mitigate the enormously harmful impact of such systems, especially those having an especially disproportional adverse impact on disadvantaged communities. AI systems relying on machine learning are emerging with incredibly swift speeds that change our day-to-day experience, but disadvantages as well exist. In both private and public sector contexts, scholars from diverse disciplines have increasingly raised concerns regarding algorithmic systems' privacy, transparency, bias, discrimination, exploitation, and exclusion. Focusing on the need to ensure fairness in automated consumer profiling, this research examines bias discovery and mitigation in agentic AI-driven target marketing. Initial investigation found strong biases in AI models, driven by factors such as geographic location and prior purchases, which closely map onto stored features like race and socioeconomic status. The findings of the current study substantiate existing work and demonstrate that bias in agentic AI is a persistent and multifaceted problem that requires a multi-pronged solution. The article highlights the importance of continuous audits, transparency, and crossdisciplinary collaboration in countering bias. The implications are vast for marketers, AI practitioners, and policymakers, as they point to the necessity of ethical AI use in supporting legal obligations and consumer confidence. The approach reduces bias in AI-based marketing frameworks, contributes to the wider debate on AI ethics, and promotes fairness."

    "abstract": "Providing electrical power to utility points is crucial for development in all areas. In light of the constraints and limited as well as restrictions on utilization of fossil fuels, there is an interest shifted towards the advancement of power generation through renewable energy sources. Nonetheless, the provision of high-quality power remains a challenging aspect within the power system. Fortunately, with the advent of power electronics components, the conversion and transmission of electric power have become significantly easier when appropriate controllers are selected based on our specific requirements. The idea of multilevel converter is widely recognized in various power electronics applications. The utilization of multilevel converters in power production from renewable energy sources is increasingly gaining popularity with the advent of new technologies. Nevertheless, the primary disadvantage of multilevel inverters is the rising quantity of switches as the level increases. Furthermore, the control methods become more complex as the levels in multilevel inverters increase. Therefore, it is necessary to minimize the number of switches in order to configure multilevel inverters for improved performance. This paper proposes a new configuration combined with an innovative control methodology for a photovoltaic (PV) power production system. The proposed controller allows for the regulation of voltage at the load, making this configuration suitable for various applications that require adjustable voltage. Comprehensive results based on MATLAB/Simulink are provided to substantiate the proposed system."

    "abstract": "4H-SiC MESFETs are employed across a wide range of applications, including residential, industrial, and other sectors. There are several techniques available for analyzing the models of 4H-SiC MESFETs. However, studying the direct current characteristics of MESFETs poses a significant challenge. This paper highlights three critical factors that influence these characteristics: surface trapping, thermal effects, and substrate trapping. By exploring these factors, we aim to deepen the understanding of the DC behavior of MESFETs. The current-voltage (I- V) characteristics model we propose is based on the Caughey-Thomas configuration. This model effectively addresses electron trapping in the substrate through various deep-level trapping mechanisms, takes into account the field-dependent mobility of electrons, and provides a comprehensive analysis of the two-dimensional charge distribution beneath the MESFET gate. Our proposed approach is holistic, considering all significant thermal effects and material imperfections, including traps. The task of solving the intricate mathematical equations that define the 4H-SiC MESFET and deriving its I-V characteristics across different regions is notably challenging due to the inherent complexity of these equations. To address this challenge, the Modified Grey Wolf Optimization (MGWO) Algorithm is employed, which effectively resolves the multiple complex equations associated with the 4H-SiC MESFET, thereby ensuring the accuracy of the I- V characteristics. As a result, the performance of the proposed analytical model closely aligns with that of an actual 4H-SiC MESFET. Furthermore, various behavioral traits are extracted and assessed using the MATLAB programming package, allowing for a comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance."

    "abstract": "Identifying conflicting requirements is a key challenge in software requirement engineering, often overlooked in automated solutions. Most existing approaches rely on handcrafted rules or struggle to generalize across different domains. In this paper, we introduce S3CDA, a two-phase algorithm designed to automatically detect conflicts in software requirements. Our method first identifies potentially conflicting requirement pairs using semantic similarity, and then validates them by analyzing overlapping domain-specific entities. We evaluate S3CDA on five diverse real-world datasets and compare it against popular large language models like GPT-4o, Llama-3, Sonnet-3.5 and Gemini-1.5. While LLMs show promise, especially on general datasets, S3CDA consistently performs better in domain-specific settings with higher performance. Our findings suggest that combining Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques with domainaware insights offers a practical and effective alternative for conflict detection in requirements."

However, existing approaches still face several limitations and challenges. In this study, we propose an enhancement to the XLNet Method to improve the accuracy of wind speed and direction forecasting through a regression-based approach. The main innovations include the cyclical feature encoding using sine and cosine transformations, as well as the addition of a custom regression head that enables the method to recognize and map complex patterns in meteorological time-series data. Experimental results using wind data from Banyuwangi indicate that the modified XLNet Method achieved a MAE of 0.0320, RMSE of 0.0439, and MAPE of 0.1665. These results highlight a substantial improvement in forecasting accuracy, with the method outperforming benchmark methods such as SVR, CNN, ANN, and LSTM, especially in reducing mean and squared errors. This research confirms that XLNet can effectively handle non-textual numerical forecasting tasks, supporting the broader application of AI in renewable energy and other sectors."

Due to high efficiency, compact designs, and consistency in operation, brushless DC (BLDC) motors have been the choice of propelling electric vehicles. Nevertheless, it is difficult to have accurate control over speed and torque at different load conditions and road conditions. The paper provides an optimization method (Genetic Algorithm (GA) based) of tuning parameters of a PID controller in a BLDC motor drive. This GA approach proposed automatically changes the controller gains to ensure that the speed error is minimized and the system dynamic performance is enhanced. It has been demonstrated through simulation studies in MATLAB / Simulink that the GA-tuned PID controller has lower response time and overshoot as well as lower steady-state error than a conventional PID control. These findings qualify the control strategy based on GA, as it improves the efficiency and stability of BLDC motor drives, and hence is suitable in the nextgeneration electric vehicles."

As a consequence, the traditional IDS techniques usually suffer from high false positive rates and are not flexible enough to cater for new attacks, which introduce the requirement of more advanced techniques. Utilizing the advances in deep neural networks (e.g. convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks), this work is expected to provide more reliable, faster, and more specific detection and identification of threats. Extensive experimental results on several benchmark datasets show that the deep learning models can achieve efficient performance in learning complex attack patterns and classifying various threats, comparing with traditional machine learning methods. The study also conducts experiments on feature extraction and selection that improve the performance and computation costs of the model. High-order features are learned for subtle anomalies and complex temporal dependencies within network traffic data by integrating sophisticated methods including autoencoders and attention mechanisms. The work also handles class imbalance issues and signature changes as the novel approach considers data augmentation and transfer learning technique. The results show that the deep learning model can effectively be adjusted to various evolving cyber security scenes and offer acceptable high detection rate and low false positive alarm. In summary, this paper presents extensive research into the potential to reinvigorate IDS through deep learning, allowing for more accurate and scalable threat classification, with the goal of improving the security of contemporary network infrastructures."

At ultra-high field (UHF, ≥ 7T), it becomes increasingly challenging due to the higher operational frequency ( ≥ 297 MHz) required for excitation, where conventional volume resonators fail to produce a homogeneous transmit field over the electrically large human body because of standing-wave effects. Traveling-wave (TW) excitation based on metallic circular waveguides offers a promising alternative, yet its clinical application has been hindered by low transmission efficiency and inhomogeneous field distribution caused by suboptimal waveguide modes, radiation losses, as well as phase-velocity mismatches. While high-permittivity dielectric waveguides have been proposed to enhance TW performance, their practical implementation is limited by the availability of suitable natural materials. Water-based dielectric waveguides offer improved field confinement and transmission efficiency, but they introduce MRI signal artifacts and are susceptible to long-term degradation, thereby limiting their reliability and clinical applicability. In this study, we present an artificial dielectric waveguide engineered to replicate the electromagnetic properties of a water-based dielectric waveguide while mitigating high weight and undesired MRI signal of the latter.

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL), as a distributed machine learning paradigm, enables clients to upload model updates rather than local data to enhance privacy. However, directly sharing model updates still risks privacy breaches. While Differential Privacy (DP) is commonly employed to mitigate privacy issues by injecting noise to perturb model updates, existing mechanisms often overlook the critical impact of time variation in privacy protection, namely Age of Information (AoI). Meanwhile, without reasonable incentives, clients are unwilling to join the FL under privacy risk. In this paper, we propose a novel age-aware incentive mechanism for differentially private FL. The FL uses the AoI-dependent DP, where the privacy budget dynamically decreases over time to reflect the diminishing privacy leakage of model updates. We formulate the incentive-design problem as a Stackelberg game, where the server acts as the leader and chooses the incentive, while clients act as followers and adjust their time-varying privacy budgets. Theoretical analysis confirms that the game can reach a unique equilibrium. Simulation results demonstrate that with the proposed mechanism, the server achieves the highest utility while enforcing age-aware privacy guarantees for the clients."

This paper presents a time-controlled encryption system that provides privacy and confidentiality of patient records only within a specified time. The suggested system relies on the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES-256) to encrypt patient data on attribute level to provide end-to-end data confidentiality when transmitting and storing data. In order to increase security control, limited time decryption key mechanism is used, in which the decryption keys are dynamically generated, timed, and automatically revoked after the allocated validity time. This will ensure that it is not accessed on a long-term basis or by unauthorized persons even after the expiry of the session by authorized users. The framework incorporates a secure key management facility that stores encryption keys, duration of validity and identity of users in an immutable datastore that is capable of providing traceable and auditable access control. Through experimental analysis, it is shown that applicability of the suggested encryption and timedkey validation system is well-resistant to replay and brute-force attacks and that it has low-computational overhead. The design creates a base on which machine learning-based authorization can be added in the future. In particular, the CatBoost algorithm will be introduced to the next stage and will allow providing adaptive, context-dependent access control according to user behavior and the sensitivity of the data. In general, this framework offers a solid and scalable methodology towards the attainment of fine-grained, time-sensitive, and smart security in electronic health record management systems."

For this purpose, the system applies Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) are deep learning algorithms. To automatically recognize complex and subtle patterns in the data that can inform about depression. Traditional methods fail to notice these patterns which makes this approach more efficient in detecting students at risk. The dataset is trained on a wide and complete dataset that integrates fully various emotional and behavioral factors to offer a sturdy and exact model. We measure these systems using important factors like how often they are right, how many relevant cases they get right, how few they miss, and their combination of both precision and recall to make sure they work well. We want to help schools get a tool that can find signs of depression in students early and reliably, to act more quickly and provide timely support.

The system is controlled using fuzzy logic to adaptively adjust the charging current according to the battery's condition. Test results show that the battery can be fully charged in 50 minutes with low current ripple of 5.92%.

As well as the failure to prioritize the riskiest sites, more than 70% of the cases were not treated promptly. So the present technologies are not effective in prioritizing the emergency calls from the victims and are not able to provide real-time feeds of high-risk areas, which makes rescue delayed and inefficient. The Disaster Management Ecosystem (DME) fills important gaps in the existing system. This system combines a low-cost emergency communication device, a highly capable surveillance drone, and a Machine Learning (ML) model. The drones made it possible to identify high-risk areas using a live aerial feed of the disaster site, which gives a detailed geographical impact and a survey of the site. The emergency communication device has been made for communication and location tracking, leading to a quicker and more effective rescue effort. The ML model prioritizes emergency calls by severity, facilitating targeted rescue operations in affected areas. This integrated method aims to dramatically increase survival rates in future calamities by maximizing situational awareness and response times."

Conventional forms of irrigation typically rely on some quantifiable measure of manual control or a timed irrigation schedule to determine when to water, typically resulting in overwatering, loss of water, or inconsistent soil moisture status. Our Smart Irrigation System uses soil moisture sensors, temperature and humidity sensors, a microcontroller unit connected to wireless cellular network, and some logic, to generate a continuous cycle of acquiring environmental data from the field and making the appropriate irrigation decision in real-time. Our Smart Irrigation System is able to automatically turn on/off water flow through solenoid valves using information from the sensor data, while providing separate irrigation for different zones of the crop. Data is visualized using a cloud-based dashboard interface that allows a farmer to monitor and even control irrigation anytime and anywhere. Our experimental results indicate water savings and an overall improved crop yield consistency compared to conventional irrigation methods. Finally, it is a practical solution that is cost-effective and easily scalable while also being energy efficient, therefore providing a salient means of addressing agricultural irrigation in modern and precision farming contexts."

    "abstract": "In cloud computing, where workloads are constantly changing and resources are limited, efficient task scheduling is a major challenge that requires significant solutions to maximise performance and minimise expense. When dealing with sensitive or dispersed datasets, traditional centralised schedulers frequently encounter problems with data privacy and scalability. This research offers a new approach to cloud computing scheduling by using Federated Learning (FL) to facilitate decentralised, pre-decentralised collaboration among cloud nodes, which should help with these issues. This architecture allows numerous users or cloud servers to secure sensitive workloads or resource data while training a shared scheduling model. To solve significant problems, including significantation efficiency, model convergence, and non-IID (non-independent and identically distributed) data, the suggested system uses cutting-edge FL approaches. Before this, ECSA–the Enhanced Crowd Search Algorithm–was responsible for allocating cloud computing resources to minimise makespan and task utilisation. The solution guarantees efficient allocation of tasks, faster execution times, and better use of resources by incorporating resource-aware scheduling rules into the FL paradigm. Test results in virtualised cloud environments show that the framework may improve scheduling efficiency while protecting user data. This study demonstrates how federated learning can transform cloud computing by implementing intelligent scheduling solutions that are secure, scalable, and federated. Future studies will optimise communication protocols, expand the framework to accommodate heterogeneous cloud settings, and enhance decision-making capabilities through reinforcement learning approaches. This research highlights FL's significance as a game-changing technique for improving cloud computing infrastructure."

Only the uploader possesses the unique encryption key required to reconstruct and decrypt the file, preventing unauthorized access and eliminating single points of failure. Designed as a lightweight, education-focused framework, DeSecShare avoids the complexity of blockchain components seen in platforms like IPFS or Storj, while still demonstrating the essential principles of decentralized storage. Its modular chunk-handling process, transparent encryption workflow, and flexible node-level storage control make it accessible for students and researchers. This minimal- infrastructure design provides a practical environment for understanding decentralized concepts without requiring full peer-to-peer networking or token-based mechanisms, with potential future enhancements such as blockchain-based metadata management for transparent and immutable access control."

This research is using Purposive Sampling Method by using structured questionnaire that distributed to 451 respondents in Indonesia from February to June 2025, with 445 eligible participants from the JABODETABEK (Indonesia) region who have used generative AI tools for academic purposes, the data was also analyzed with SmartPLS 4. The outcome indicates that ASE significantly correlates to academic stress and critical thinking, as well as performance expectations. On the other hand, stress on academics has a significant association on generative AI, while critical thinking does not significantly correlate with AI dependency. AI trust in generative AI and positive experiences are also highly related with the dependencies. Interestingly, performance expectation and academic self-efficacy do not significantly related to AI dependency, suggesting that emotional and behavioral factors may be more influential than rational expectations."

    "abstract": "Sustainable fabrication routes are essential for developing the next generation of chemical sensors, particularly for environmental monitoring applications. This study presents the pH-sensing performance of ZnO-Chitosan (ZnO:CS) composites fabricated via a water-based screen-printing method as a green technology approach. Zinc Oxide (ZnO), a non-toxic and chemically stable semiconductor, was combined with chitosan (CS), a biodegradable natural polymer, to enhance film uniformity, adhesion, and ionic conductivity. Structural and morphological characterizations were conducted using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). XRD results confirmed the hexagonal wurtzite structure of ZnO and the formation of an amorphous ZnO:CS composite, while SEM revealed a uniform film morphology with a thickness of approximately $60 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ and strong adhesion to the substrate. Three ZnO:CS ratios $(1: 2,1: 4$, and $1: 8)$ were tested in buffer solutions of pH 4, 7, and 10. All sensors exhibited excellent linearity, with sensitivities ranging from $-1.1 \\mathrm{mV} / \\mathrm{pH}$ to $-1.95 \\mathrm{mV} / \\mathrm{pH}$. The ZnO:CS 1:2 composition demonstrated the fastest response time $(22.2 \\mathrm{~s})$ and consistent potential stability. These results highlight the potential of the ZnO:CS composite as a low-cost, eco-friendly, and reliable material system for potentiometric pH sensors, supporting the advancement of green technology for sustainable, real-time water quality monitoring."

    "abstract": "The safety of women has become a very big issue in the present time due to the increasing cases of violence and harassment. Available safety gear, like helplines and manual distress calls, is typically constrained by slowness in responding and their dependence on external help. The proposed Safety Alert System to Women in this paper combines a mobile application that activates a sound anomaly detection and a live location sharing feature as its basic functionalities. The system is made in such a way that the mobile application automatically identifies the presence of strange or harmful sounds, such as screams or distress calls. After this, the system instantly triggers an alert and notifies registered guardians of the current position of the user in real-time. Both automated outlier-detection and continuous location monitoring ensure faster responses are ensured as well as enhancing surveillance, giving the women a more secure and reliable application to use to protect themselves."

    "abstract": "Proper prediction of gold prices is essential as a risk management tool, portfolio optimization, and strategic financial planning- Gold is one of the most prominent assets in global financial markets because of its status as a safe-haven, inflation-hedge, and long-term value holding asset. To solve the intrinsic instability of large fluxes and a complex dynamic of the gold prices, the given paper proposes a complex pattern of a gold price prediction with the help of a Super Learner ensemble model which is the system based on several algorithms and able to take advantage of the strengths of each separately and reduce the drawbacks of each. The model integrates five different learners- Linear Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), Support Vector Regression (SVR), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) each having its own strength in terms of predictivity of the model owing to the types of assumptions that they make as well as their predictive algorithms. indexes, stock market indexes, and exchange rates. Each entity base learner would be trained on this augmented database, where the non-linear patterns and linear relations were capture, and the metalearner of the ensemble would cumulative these estimations in a stacking design with cross-validation to decrease overfitting and raise the degree to which it would represent the general population. The performance of the Super Learner uses extensive evaluation metrics, such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Rsquared ($\\mathbf{R}^{\\mathbf{2}}$), thereby validating the greater effectiveness of ensemble learning to address complex forecasting requirements within a financial setting."

The computational cost of classic optimization and decision-making methods increases rapidly with the number of alternative resource deployments, limiting their real-time applicability for short control loops typical in 5G/6G environments with rapid demand fluctuations. This letter introduces quick Analytic Hierarchy Process (qAHP), a modification of AHP formulation that preserves the ranking consistency of AHP while reducing the priority vector computation to linear time with respect to the number of alternatives. We formally prove this complexity reduction, achieving identical decision outcomes to classic AHP, and we validate it through proof-of-concept experiments showing that qAHP enables real-time autoscaling, mitigates over-and under-provisioning, and achieving up to two orders of magnitude lower execution time compared to classic AHP."

One of the important components in these vehicles is the Battery Management System (BMS), which requires a user interface to convey technical information in real-time and easily understood. This study aims to identify and classify informative dashboard features that influence user satisfaction using the Kano Model approach, as well as develop a battery condition monitoring feature to support driving efficiency and safety. A total of 17 dashboard features were analyzed and classified into several Kano categories. The analysis results show that no features are included in the Must-be category. Approximately 29% of features such as the speedometer and SOC gauge are categorized as One-Dimensional, which impacts user satisfaction. 47% are categorized as Attractive, such as mileage estimation and interactive maps, while 18% are categorized as Indifferent, which are features that do not have a significant influence on satisfaction. In addition, a prototype of the BMS balancing feature integrated with the Human Machine Interface (HMI) was developed. This feature allows users to monitor the condition of battery cells in real-time for more effective management. The results of this research are expected to form the basis for developing an electric vehicle dashboard that is informative, adaptive to user needs, and supports sustainable transportation."

    "abstract": "Weed growth around trees in orchards negatively affects tree health by competing for essential soil nutrients and providing shelter for rodents that damage tree roots. Traditional orchard weed control systems rely on tractor-mounted mechanical tools or chemical herbicides, both of which present operational and environmental drawbacks. In this paper, we present the design and control of an autonomous weed-cutting robotic system tailored for structured orchards. The proposed system integrates an autonomous mobile robot and a weedcutting mechanism attached to the robot with a photoelectric sensor and real-time velocity feedback from the robot’s autonomous navigation stack. When a tree is detected in the robot’s path, the mechanism executes a controlled circular retreat trajectory around the tree to remove weeds precisely in the problematic area. Unlike conventional mechanical systems, which rely on physical contact sensors and hydraulic actuators, our approach is fully electric, contact-free, and dynamically adapts its motion based on the robot’s instantaneous velocity. The system has been validated in an apple orchard environment, demonstrating its ability to autonomously remove weeds around trees during intrarow navigation without human intervention. This work represents a step toward sustainable and precise mechanical weed control in smart farming applications."

A U-Net model for segmentation was trained on MRI data to generate tumor masks. Morphological and statistical features of these masks were extracted and given as input for classification. The LightGBM classifier was used to classify the tumors into 4 categories - Glioma, Meningioma, Pituitary, and No tumor. Although image preprocessing using ADF+CLAHE was performed for visualization purposes, it was not included in the automated-pipeline. Additionally, for hardware acceleration, the convolution block of the U-Net model was implemented using the Vitis HLS toolchain and the IP block design was viewed in the Vivado suite. Our system shows promising accuracy and offers a balance between software flexibility and hardware efficiency."

    "abstract": "This study presents a structured methodology based on the Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP) to identify and rank the most relevant criteria for the planning and execution of green hydrogen projects in Colombia. Drawing from a comprehensive literature review and the input of 129 experts from academic, industrial, governmental, and research sectors, five primary criteria-economic, environmental, technical, social, and risk - and 40 sub-criteria were assessed using surveys and fuzzy pairwise comparison matrices. The results show that the economic criterion is the most influential, with a normalized weight of 42.84 %, followed by environmental (28.06 %) and social (10.91 %) criteria. At the sub-criteria level, the most critical factors were operation and maintenance costs, return on investment, and the use of renewable energy sources to power electrolyzers. These findings reflect the prevailing priorities of stakeholders within Colombia's energy sector. The novelty of this study lies in its contextualized application of FAHP, which integrates expert judgment and fuzzy logic in emerging regions characterized by high uncertainty. Key contributions include the development of a replicable hierarchical model, empirical validation of decisive factors, and a decision-support tool to guide strategic planning. The model is recommended for informing public policies and investment strategies aimed at advancing green hydrogen deployment. Its adaptability further supports application in other Latin American countries with similar regulatory and infrastructural contexts."

    "abstract": "Targeted and sophisticated attacks can be collected using honeypots. Among them, the binary samples can also be collected on honeypots. However, the detection and classification of binary samples, as well as their attribution to cyber threat actors, are well-known research problems. Widely used signature-based approaches are unable to detect unknown malware attacks, which could be clean or suspicious files. Hence, those files need to be analyzed and labeled to prevent future cyberattacks. This paper proposes a new architecture for malware detection and classification that utilizes malware instruction sets and incremental machine learning. The proposed model is fully automated and integrated with a collection framework for identifying novel malware attacks via clustering and populating the unknown samples into these clusters. A prototype is selected to represent the entire cluster, and categorization of new binary samples is performed by labelling the prototype only. Detection of newly classified malware binary samples is performed by labeling the prototype of the entire cluster. It can be modeled as <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$f$</tex> = n * p, where n is the given malware sample and p is the prototype of the cluster to which it is assigned. The proposed EMIST-ML model is validated using two datasets: i) Malheur, and ii) Real-world malware samples. The EMIST-ML model achieves 99.1 % accuracy using the Malheur dataset and 83 % accuracy using real-world malware datasets, demonstrating remarkable performance. The proposed EMIST-ML can detect unknown binaries that are not detected by anti-virus scanners, producing promising results in a live malware defense system."

The merits of nonconventional energy systems are low cost of implementation, very low ecological pollution, high sustainability unlike fossil fuels, very low harmful gas emissions, cheap cost, plus creating more jobs. Also, these systems are independent of the main grid. However, the main issue of these sources is less continuity in energy production. Here, the Solid Oxide Fuel Module (SOFM) is recommended to start energy production for hydrogen vehicles. The merits of this fuel module involvement are better energy production rate and convergence efficiency. Also, this fuel module operates a wide range of fuels, with less pollutant emissions, high scalability, plus more security in energy supply. However, the fuel module obtained output characteristics are nonlinear. So, the achieving of maximum voltage from the SOFS is quite difficult. Here, the most predominant Genetic Optimization fuzzy is referred to for catching the peak voltage point of the solid oxide electrolyte device. The features of this technology are low oscillations of voltage, high peak voltage identification speed, moderate design complexity, less convergence time, plus suitable standalone, and micro grid application. The proposed topology performance is studied by following the MATLAB environment."

Traditional word clouds fail to convey hierarchical relationships, while treemaps, though efficient in spatial partitioning, are limited in expressing semantic features such as word importance. To address this issue, we propose WordTree, a novel visual design that combines word clouds with treemap layouts to represent hierarchical text data. By embedding word frequency visualization within the spatial structure of a treemap, WordTree effectively communicates both multi-level hierarchical structures and the relative importance of words within the dataset. Compared with traditional word clouds or treemaps, WordTree offers improved space efficiency, supports hierarchical exploration, and enables direct visual comparison across categories or subgroups. We demonstrate the effectiveness of WordTree through several case studies involving textual datasets such as news corpora and topic hierarchies. User feedback suggests that WordTree enhances understanding of data structure while maintaining a strong visual appeal."

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of artificial intelligence, intelligent manufacturing factories usually deploy various deep learning models on some heterogeneous edge devices to process data or tasks generated by sensors. Scheduling these tasks in such a resource-constrained and heterogeneous edge cluster to satisfy their real-time requirements is challenging. Existing task deployment frameworks for edge clusters optimize at the model-level, lacking fine-grained resource awareness and concurrency control, where the urgent tasks are frequently blocked and miss their deadlines. Therefore, we propose a multi-level collaborative deployment framework Coconut for real-time deep learning tasks in the typical heterogeneous edge GPU cluster. Coconut collaboratively optimizes model deployment and fine-grained concurrency control. To address the high complexity of multi-level collaborative optimization, we employ an efficient learning-based search algorithm. Based on the operator-level information, we also pre-train an accurate latency predictor for each device, enabling centralized optimization to further accelerate the search. We implemented and validated Coconut on a real-world case of intelligent steel structure manufacturing. Compared with the advanced task deployment framework, Coconut improves the deadline satisfaction rate by more than 27% and the cluster GPU utilization by more than 18%. Coconut is an offline optimization framework with almost no additional runtime overhead."

    "abstract": "Current computing systems require ever-increasing reliability, particularly as memory technology needs to cater for data-intensive and mission-critical applications. As the sizes of transistors are reducing and the densities of memory are increasing, the probability of memory cells being affected by transient faults, soft errors, and bit flips has dramatically increased. Even an error that is left uncorrected can cause catastrophic failures in the systems used in aerospace, automotive, medical devices, and cloud infrastructure. Error-Correcting Codes (ECCs) have become a key mechanism for protecting data integrity as well as system stability in hostile operating environments. In this work, we precisely focus on self-transition-induced errors, which are a growing class of faults related to internal instability in highly scaled memory cells. To overcome these challenges, we propose a Row-Wise Hamming scheme that significantly reduces redundancy through efficient row-level encoding and decoding. The design attains 100 % correction efficiency of burst errors up to the maximum of 5 bits, alleviating the localized and self-transition faults. Synthesis results show an impressive 82.35 % area reduction and 98.99% power saving, making our solution an efficient and scalable alternative to traditional ECC architectures of future memories. The whole design was carried out in Verilog HDL and used in the ModelSim environment. In addition, synthesis was performed using the Cadence Genus tool."

Although conventional modeling techniques exist, such as compartmental or agentic models, supporting tools are not necessarily standardized. Consequently, learning a new tool may take a significant amount of effort. In this work, we explore the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) as a means to quickly transition from requirements, in the form of graphical model representations and initial parameters, to a software-aided modeling platform with simulation and verification capabilities. Our methodology employs a metamodelbased language specification for prompt engineering, combined with multimodal inputs comprising textual descriptions and epidemiological diagrams. We evaluated LLM performance in three epidemiological models of varying complexity: a simple SIR compartmental model, a COVID-19 pandemic model, and an HIV transmission model. Initial results demonstrate the potential of LLMs to significantly reduce manual modeling effort while maintaining accuracy in structural representation and parameter extraction. The study provides insights into optimal input configurations and identifies key challenges in automated epidemiological model generation."

In its current version, UR-OS allows modeling virtual memory management algorithms, like First-in-First-out (FIFO), Least Recently Used (LRU), among others. The main characteristic of this simulator is that it is a very simple tool to work with and modify, and it is freely available for academic activities and research. In this work, two new virtual memory algorithms are introduced: Second-chance Least-Frequently-Used (SCLFU) and Least Recently/Frequently Used (LRFU).

To optimize the prediction results, the algorithm ensemble technique was used, specifically a stacking ensemble, in which the outputs of previously trained algorithms are combined to generate a more optimized prediction. The data used to implement the prediction algorithms were a combination of two information repositories: a SCADA system for active power data and weather data from the GIOVANNI satellite (NASA), from which meteorological variables were extracted from the same geographic location and measurement period. The best results for power prediction were obtained with the stack regressor and ensemble average models."

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) necessitates that edge devices conduct local training and communicate with a parameter server, resulting in significant energy consumption. A key challenge in practical FL systems is the rapid depletion of battery-limited edge devices, which limits their operational lifespan and impacts learning performance. To tackle this issue, we implement energy harvesting techniques in FL systems to capture ambient energy, thereby providing continuous power to edge devices. We first establish the convergence bound for the wireless FL system with energy harvesting devices, illustrating that the convergence is affected by partial device participation and packet drops, both of which depend on the energy supply. To accelerate the convergence, we formulate a joint device scheduling and power control problem and model it as a Markov decision process (MDP). By solving this MDP, we derive the optimal transmission policy and demonstrate that it possesses a monotone structure with respect to the battery and channel states. To overcome the curse of dimensionality caused by the exponential complexity of computing the optimal policy, we propose a low-complexity algorithm, which is asymptotically optimal as the number of devices increases. Furthermore, for unknown channels and harvested energy statistics, we develop a structure-enhanced deep reinforcement learning algorithm that leverages the monotone structure of the optimal policy to improve the training performance. Finally, extensive numerical experiments on real-world datasets are presented to validate the theoretical results and corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms."

The fluid antenna system (FAS) offers position flexibility, significantly reducing its dependency on channel-state-information (CSI) spatial adaptation with only a single RF chain. However, most existing FAS studies remain theoretical and lack experimental validation. This paper presents two fully implemented fluid-antenna prototypes featuring dynamically position-flexible radiators. Enabled by surface-wave launchers, 3D-printed fluidic channels, and a fluid-control system, a single-channel and a double-channel fluid antenna are simulated, fabricated, and measured. The measured <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$S_{11}$</tex-math></inline-formula> confirms operation within the 24-30 GHz 5G mmWave band, and the radiation patterns exhibit spatial variations as the radiator position changes. Crucially, the novelty of this work does not lie in improving traditional antenna parameters such as gain or isolation; rather, it introduces a new communication mechanism in which position-flexible radiation reshapes the wireless channel to escape deep fading-something fixed antennas fundamentally cannot achieve. The results demonstrate that compact fluid-antenna designs provide a practical solution for future mmWave systems requiring reconfigurability and spatial adaptability."

    "abstract": "Conventional subdomain methods face challenges in calculating the stray magnetic field of surface-mounted permanent magnet synchronous motors (SPMSMs) under eccentric conditions due to their inability to handle complex boundaries, leading to low computational efficiency. To address these issues, this paper proposes a cell-based Schwarz-Christoffel (SC) mapping method and a stage-wise calculation strategy to improve computational efficiency while maintaining accuracy. First, an analytical model (AM) integrating equivalent surface current, conformal transformation method is established. Based on magnetic field superposition, the load air-gap magnetic field is derived. Second, a stage-wise subdomain-based computational strategy is employed to decouple the magnetic field calculations for the air-gap region and the outer air region. The stray magnetic field is analytically modeled using SC mapping and separation of variables. Finally, the proposed method is validated through experiments on an 8-pole 18-slot interior-rotor SPMSM with mixed eccentricity. Results show that the TM achieves a computational error of only 3.49% and that the computational speed is 136 times faster than that of the finite element method (FEM)."

    "abstract": "This paper develops a unified and distributionally complete characterization of the discrete-time M/G/1 queue. Both the discrete-time Pollaczek-Khinchine formula for Bernoulli arrivals and the discrete Residual Lifetime Theorem are comprehensively addressed through a new proposed probability distribution, referred to as Infinite Mixture of Discrete Uniforms (IMDU), which provides an intuitive and mathematically consistent representation of the residual service time. For the waiting time distribution analysis, it is first shown that the idle period is identically distributed to the geometric interarrival time. Building on this identity, the Laplace Transform of the waiting-time distribution for Bernoulli arrivals with general service times is derived. Then, exact functional relationships between the moments of the waiting time and those of the discrete residual service time are obtained. Furthermore, using the distributional Little’s law, non-closed structural relation between the moments of the queue length and those of the waiting time is derived. The non-closedness is due to the staircase-like behavior of the expected number of arrivals in an ordinary renewal process. To make this relation tractable, the stepped-like function is approximated by a straight line whose slope and x-interception are determined minimizing the mean-square difference. Simulation and approximate analytical numerical results of the second (third) factorial moment of the queue length for deterministic, discrete uniform, and shifted Poisson service time show differences smaller than 0.242% (2.17%); in contrast to the substantially larger errors, up to 15.67% (42.4%), incurred by the Poisson arrival process approximation (x-interception at origin)."

    "abstract": "The occurrence of rice leaf diseases will seriously threaten rice yield and quality. Timely and accurate disease detection is crucial for formulating effective prevention and control measures. Existing rice leaf disease detection methods have problems such as low variety detection accuracy, complex modeling process, and poor real-time performance on mobile devices. Based on these considerations, this paper proposes a lightweight rice leaf disease detection method based on an improved YOLOv8 network. First, the YOLOv8 network is optimized, and a lightweight convolution module and a channel attention mechanism are added to reduce model parameters and computational complexity. Secondly, spatiotemporal data enhancement technology and transfer learning strategies are used to enhance the model's adaptability to complex backgrounds and disease types. Then, in order to improve the detection experience, multi-scale feature fusion and adaptive anchor frame mechanisms are used. The improved model has an average detection accuracy (mAP) of 98% on a self-built rice leaf disease dataset, and can achieve real-time detection at 54 FPS. This method is an effective method for rapid and accurate detection of rice leaf diseases, and has important practical application value."

Transferring data directly between two devices without the use of a server or central hub is known as D2D communication. In D2D communications, wireless fading significantly affects the quality and dependability of the communication link, leading to a number of problems, including lower signal quality, higher latency, lower throughput, and reduced coverage. In this context, it is important to propose a robust deep learning (DL) framework that can widely capture varying fading scenarios in D2D networks. In this work, a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) is employed to assess the signal quality of the considered dataset (RadioML2016.10a) over D2D fading networks, acronymized as D2D-SignalAI. In addition, the proposed approach is compared with some well-known conventional algorithms on different performance metrics, such as accuracy and loss, to validate the efficacy of the proposed approach."

    "abstract": "Super-enhancers (SEs), comprising clusters of transcriptional regulatory elements, play essential roles in gene expression regulation and cell fate determination. Current computational methods for identifying SEs from genomic sequences face challenges in prediction accuracy and cross-species generalizability. This study introduces TransSE, a deep learning framework combining convolutional and recurrent neural networks with cross-species transfer learning for SE prediction. TransSE employs a two-phase strategy: pre-training on combined human and mouse data to learn conserved regulatory features, followed by species-specific fine-tuning to capture organism-specific patterns. Evaluation on human and mouse datasets demonstrates that TransSE achieves superior accuracy compared to existing methods including SENet, DeepSE, and transformer-based models (DNABERT, Enformer), with AUC values of 0.828 (human) and 0.832 (mouse). Ablation studies confirm that convolutional blocks are essential for feature extraction, while transfer learning and recurrent layers provide meaningful performance improvements. Feature analysis reveals that TransSE distinguishes SEs from typical enhancers based on learned sequence representations, achieving 10.4-fold improvement in clustering metrics. The model demonstrates effective cross-species prediction capability, maintaining AUC <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\gt $</tex-math></inline-formula> 0.79 when trained on one species and evaluated on another.

In the present investigation, P&O and the HC approach for MPPT are modelled and simulated using the Buck Boost converter. Numerous strategies have been put out to maximise the electricity that photovoltaic modules can generate under a variety of meteorological circumstances. A MPPT technique for the solar system based on perturbation and observation was proposed in this work. MATLAB/SIMULINK is utilized to model and analyse the solar panel. A system of photovoltaic is linked to a DC-DC BBC. The MPP is the operational point at which a solar panel can generate its maximum power. The MPP of the PV panel stays constant despite variations in solar irradiation and cell temperature. Then, to maximise a PV system's power output, methods of MPPT are employed. As a result, P&O-based MPPT is created, and simulation results show that the P&O-based controller produces more consistent power."

This study takes a closer look at how research in this area has evolved, using a bibliometric approach to map the trends, tools, and key contributors shaping the field. Drawing on 103 peer-reviewed articles published between 2015 and 2024 and sourced from the Scopus database, the study found a 650 % increase in AI-in-education publications between 2015 and 2021, underscoring a sharp rise in global research activity. Despite this growth, there remains a lack of consolidated insight into who is leading this work, what technologies are being explored, and where the field is headed. To fill that gap, this study applies the PRISMA framework to ensure a systematic selection process and uses tools like VOSviewer and Biblioshiny to analyze author networks, research themes, and citation patterns. The results show that countries like China and the United States are leading the way in AI and education research. Common themes include adaptive learning systems, machine learning, intelligent tutoring, and realtime feedback tools. Chatbots and virtual classrooms are among the emerging technologies gaining attention. However, the findings also point to ongoing challenges, such as ethical concerns, teacher preparedness, and digital inequality.

The common type is Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma, related to an increase in the intraocular pressure where nerve damage can occur. There’s a significant genetic aspect to POAG. This study presents a deep learning system designed to classify diseased images from normal images using retinal fundus images. The images are first modified to $128 \\times 128$ pixels. Then they are normalized to fit the model’s requirements. The dataset is categorised into training and testing sets. To improve the detection, a Convolutional Block Attention Module is added to the modified VGG16 architecture. Using a modified classification head with L2 regularized dense layers and dropout added to prevent overfitting, the last eight convolutional layers are unfrozen to allow for additional model training. An Adam optimizer, complete with a learning rate scheduler and early stopping, is employed to fine-tune the model. To evaluate performance, accuracy was measured, the confusion matrix and classification report were analyzed, the training curves were visualized, and stratified 5-fold cross-validation was employed. This approach with deep transfer learning models demonstrates attention mechanism’s capacity to assist in glaucoma diagnosis by utilizing the optic nerve head features, characteristics of the retinal nerve fiber layer, distinctions based on intraocular pressure (IOP), and automated classification."

The study focuses on two distinct categories which are defective (all fail) conditions and non-defective (all pass) conditions, based on three key features namely flange thickness, flange height, and flange inclination (Qr). A Random Forest (RF) classifier was employed, and both datasets were evaluated under the same experimental pipeline using standard classification metrics including accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score. To enable a direct comparison, synthetic data was generated using Kernel Density Estimation (KDE), which produced additional samples for both classes while preserving the original statistical distribution. Results show that the classifier achieved 100% performance in both classes, indicating that the original dataset was already highly informative. However, KDE-based synthetic data augmentation is a preferred approach as it effectively addresses data scarcity and imbalance, thereby enhancing the reliability and future readiness of predictive models in railway maintenance systems."

    "abstract": "The major core infrastructure that is utilized in the complex industrial settings of today is known as SCADA systems, which is an acronym that stands for supervisory control and data acquisition. They keep a close eye on critical processes in a wide range of industries, such as manufacturing, water treatment, and energy transportation, to name just a few of the many sectors that they monitor. Some of the industries that they keep an eye on include. At this point in time, these systems are significantly more vulnerable to intrusions as a consequence of the fact that they are becoming increasingly connected to the networks of organizations and the internet. It is because of the fact that they are becoming increasingly connected to the internet that this trend is occurring. Protocol discrepancies and control signal tampering have been brought to everyone’s attention as two of the most severe hazards that might potentially occur. This information has been brought to everyone’s immediate attention. They are capable of altering the direction in which operations are carried out, causing physical processes to become chaotic, and causing considerable harm. Using labeled datasets that are obtained from SCADA communications, the research presents a comprehensive architecture that is used for the purpose of training supervised models that are able to discern between normal and aberrant communication patterns. This is presented for the goal of training supervised models. During the training process, the supervised models are taught to differentiate between normal and abnormal patterns of communication. This enables the creation of models that are capable of educating themselves using their own knowledge, which is a significant advancement. In order to identify errors at the protocol level as well as unauthorized changes in control signals, the framework makes use of techniques such as Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Gradient Boosting. These techniques are applied in order to discover defects. By utilizing these many ways, this objective can be successfully accomplished. In order to accomplish this specific goal, such methods are applied. These models are trained using real-world datasets, which include traffic from Modbus, DNP3, and IEC 60870-5-104. The training process itself takes place on these datasets. Performing this step is done in order to guarantee that the models are appropriate for the domain in which they are being utilized. A significant amount of attention is paid to the significance of feature engineering in this work."

This study aimed to build a prediction model for the risk factors of urinary calculi based on the nomogram in machine learning, providing a basis for the prevention and treatment of this disorder. The clinical data of 205 non-urinary calculi volunteers and 105 urinary calculi patients were finally included. The differences in basic clinical data between the control group (non-suffering) and the observation group (affected) were analyzed. Univariate and multivariate Logistic regression analyses were used to determine the risk and predictive factors of urinary uric acid calculi, and a prediction model for the risk factors of uric acid calculi was thus formulated. The calibration curve and ROC curve were used to evaluate the calibration and performance of the prediction model. The results showed that age, red blood cells, white blood cells, urate crystals, protein, ketone bodies, and platelets are the risk factors for urinary calculi. The area under the ROC curve of the prediction model is 1, indicating an ideal model. The calibration curve suggested that the predicted values of the independent predictive factors for urinary calculi are approximately consistent with the actual values. In conclusion, the prediction model constructed by age, red blood cells, white blood cells, urate crystals, protein, ketone bodies, and platelets has a high predictive value, which is beneficial for improving the early diagnosis ability of urinary calculi and achieving individualized prevention. Future studies can further explore the application of this model in clinical practice."

    "abstract": "The Great Lakes, the largest freshwater lakes in the world, are crucial to the development of various industries, including transportation, fishing, manufacturing, and tourism. Fluctuations in water levels can significantly impact the economic interests of these industries. This paper presents a seasonal index prediction model designed to forecast future water levels with high accuracy, providing valuable information for decision-making. To assess the potential effects of water level variations on different stakeholders, a fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method is employed, capturing the complexity of the issue. We need to establish different functional relationships for different populations to increase accuracy and reliability, and then introduce a multi-objective optimization model to determine optimal water levels to reduce negative effects while maximizing stakeholder satisfaction. The Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) control algorithm is applied to regulate the outflow of the dam, ensuring that the water levels of the Great Lakes are maintained at the optimal level. To evaluate the robustness of the proposed model, a sensitivity analysis is conducted to assess how sensitive the algorithm is to changes in environmental factors, such as rainfall and temperature. By introducing efficient and simple algorithms, this model not only supports early prediction of water levels but also aids in balancing the competing interests of different stakeholders, promote sustainable economic growth targetedly, and finally maximize the overall economic benefits."

This study presents the first comparative evaluation of four anatomically standardized MRI slice types axial lateral ventricle (ALV), coronal lateral ventricle (CLV), midbrain (MID), and anterior commissure-posterior commissure (AC-PC) aligned slices within a unified deep learning framework for multi stage AD classification. A lightweight CNN was trained separately for each slice type (ALV, CLV, MID, AC-PC) using 2D MRI data from 1,720 ADNI images spanning four diagnostic groups (CN, EMCI, LMCI, AD). The ALV slices achieved the highest balanced accuracy of 94.36%, while the AC-PC and MID slices also demonstrated strong performance with balanced accuracies of 94.10%. The CLV slices performed competitively as well, attaining an accuracy of 92.05%. These results highlight the value of anatomically informed slice selection for capturing early AD pathology. Furthermore, the findings validate that all four slice types ALV, AC-PC, MID, and CLV provide realistic and diagnostically meaningful representations for early stage Alzheimer's disease detection. This work demonstrates that slice-based Convolutional Neural Networks(CNNs) offer a scalable, interpretable alternative to volumetric models and provides practical guidance for integrating efficient, high performing neuroimaging strategies into real world AD screening workflows."

    "abstract": "In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in natural language processing tasks. Owing to their strong capabilities in language understanding and generation, they have been widely applied and increasingly deployed locally in domains such as education, healthcare, law, and classified information processing. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models enable the integration of local knowledge bases with general knowledge bases, thereby producing richer, more accurate, and contextually relevant outputs. However, in scenarios involving classified or sensitive data, local knowledge bases often contain highly confidential information, raising the critical challenge of ensuring usability while preventing leakage. To address this issue, we propose the Woodpecker Model, a large language model designed for sensitive information protection. Built on the RAG framework, the model combines BERT and rule-based regular expression matching to achieve sensitive information recognition, balancing effective content generation with robust security mechanisms. For evaluation, we constructed a test set consisting of 400 general texts and 200 sensitive texts. Experimental results show that the hybrid approach of BERT and regular expression matching achieves higher recall and F1 scores than either method used independently. Moreover, in expert-based evaluations on 50 queries related to a local knowledge base, the Woodpecker Model achieved an average score of 3.7, significantly outperforming baseline methods in generating useful information. These results confirm the effectiveness and practical value of the proposed model in sensitive information scenarios."

Energy limitation of mobile nodes is however a major problem on ensuring reliable and extended network operations. In this paper we introduce a new energy efficient optimization algorithm called Adaptive Bio-inspired Energy Optimization Algorithm (ABEOA), which is specifically bent towards MANET environment. The suggested ABEOA combines adaptive clustering, optimal routing and load balanced data delivery to minimise the amount of energy consumed and keeping network connectivity and performance at optimal levels. The results of simulation carried out with different mobility and node density show that ABEOA reduces the amount of energy consumed, packet delivery ration, accuracy, and end to end delay compared to traditional algorithms such as PSO and ACO. The suggested approach is a very effective approach in achieving energy efficiency and increases the lifespan of the systems used in the operation of IoT-enabled MANETs and an efficient and viable solution to real-time and scalable IoT deployments."

The main contributions of this work are three-fold. First, we introduce a CoCF-ISACNet with energy-efficient HBF architecture. To show the benefits of proposed CoCF-ISACNet, we propose to jointly design the HBF to maximize the network communication capacity while satisfying the constraint of beampattern similarity for radar sensing, which results in a highly dimensional and non-convex problem. Second, to facilitate the joint design, we propose a novel distributed optimization framework called Proximal grAdieNt Decentralized Alternating direction method of multipliers (PANDA). Third, we further adopt the proposed PANDA framework to solve the joint HBF design problem for the CoCF-ISACNet. By using the proposed PANDA framework, all access points (APs) optimize the HBF in parallel, where each AP only requires local channel state information and limited message exchange among the APs. Such framework reduces significantly the computational complexity and thus has pronounced benefits in practical scenarios. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm compared with the conventional centralized algorithm and show the remarkable performance improvement of radar sensing and communication by deploying CoCF-ISACNet."

Automatically assessing driver drowsiness via vital signs monitoring offers an objective way to boost driving safety. Optical fiber sensors, which are small, lightweight, and resistant to electronic interference, are widely used in medical vital signs monitoring and intelligent transportation systems (ITS). This study proposes a novel dual optical fiber sensor system based on fiber interferometer, featuring high sensitivity, light weight, compact structure, and anti-electromagnetic interference, which accurately acquires raw ballistocardiography (BCG) signals of drivers in various environments. A robust deep learning framework, VSMformer, is proposed for signal processing: its STL module extracts spatial-temporal features from HRV data for graph modeling; a dimension-segmented embedding method and two-stage attention module (ETA) capture cross-time and cross-dimensional correlations; a hierarchical encoder-decoder module (EDSM) generates outputs. VSMformer analyzes BCG signals, predicts long-term drowsiness, and matches it with real-time HRV. Experiments show the mean square error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE) and R-square (R<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">${}^{\\mathbf {2}}$</tex-math> </inline-formula>) of experiments reach 2.311, 1.145 and 0.9845, respectively, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches.

These nodes include standard Kalman filters (KF), extended Kalman filters (EKF), and particle filters (PF). Within each homogeneous filter group, the system applies a covariance-based fusion strategy. Between heterogeneous groups, it uses an adaptive fusion method driven by residuals. To reduce communication load, the framework avoids transmitting raw data. It also introduces a node activation mechanism based on trajectory nonlinearity. This mechanism decides which filter groups should run at each time. Simulation results show clear improvements. The method enhances accuracy and robustness. It also lowers computation and communication costs. These results show promise for real-world use and large-scale deployment."

Third, we complete both Java and generated C# code and prepare them to execute. Fourth, we apply automated unit testing to assess functional correctness and ensure the reliability of AI-generated code. Our results show that a fully automated LLM agent may be effective in bridging programming languages with human-in-the-loop.

The structure without compensation on the secondary side is very suitable for UAVs, which can further reduce the weight of the secondary side. Based on the mathematical model, the CPT system can achieve the load-independent constant voltage with receiver, and also can achieve a very low input current without receiver.

It is envisioned that in the future, an intelligent audio-visual noise reduction system integrating big data, AI, and intelligent agent technology will be optimized to achieve specialized noise elimination for different film and television programs. This innovative concept is expected to partially solve the noise problem in rail transit, enhance users' riding experience, and bring about business model innovation and certain economic benefits."

    "abstract": "Wavelength modulation spectroscopy (WMS) is widely used in various industrial applications to precisely detect gas concentrations, temperature, pressure, and other parameters because of its high sensitivity and signal fidelity. However, WMS has inherent limitations in specific scenarios such as residual modulation amplitude in harmonic signals, and is vulnerable to environmental changes. These restrict further improvements to the detection accuracy and stability. To address this issue, we develop a general detection framework for spectral signal analysis by implementing neural networks. The proposed architecture is extremely lightweight and suitable for easy deployment on embedded devices, such as field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). To demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of this approach, we built a wavelength-modulation photoacoustic spectroscopy (PAS) system and deployed the neural network on an FPGA for real-time inference. We conducted experiments by measuring SF<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">6</sub> gas samples with different concentrations. The accuracy and stability of the concentration predictions from the proposed neural network were validated against those derived from harmonic signals via the conventional WMS technique. The results demonstrate that our approach surpasses the detection limit of WMS by enhancing the technical performance by 57.2%."

Artificial Intelligence (AI) disrupts DevOps by adding automation, making deployments more effective, and optimizing software maintenance. This paper investigates how intelligent automation technological process driven by machine learning (ML) is revolutionizing software deployment and maintenance through speed, reliability and adaptability. It looks at how AI can help address historical issues of DevOps, including disjointed toolchains, lack of automation and delayed feedback cycles. An examination is conducted on major AI techniques and their functions in areas such as incident management, selfhealing systems, deep learning, reinforcement learning, supervised learning, and anomaly detection in predictive analytics. This study summaries the state-of-the-art applications, limits, and gaps in the present literature, which has also been thoroughly examined.

Initially, the research collected a large quantity of historical data during the chiller's operation, such as environmental temperature, cooling load, and cooling water flow. Relying on the random forest algorithm, this paper analyzes and constructs models for these data, and utilizes its powerful nonlinear fitting capacity to predict the energy consumption of the chiller. To confirm the validity of the model, a simulation system was devised to simulate the energy consumption of the chiller under different operating conditions. Through the precise data analysis of the simulation results, the model can effectively predict the energy consumption, and the prediction error is less than 5%. Furthermore, the random forest algorithm is more precise and stable compared with the traditional one. It is demonstrated that the data-driven random forest model can be utilized to optimize the energy efficiency of chillers."

    "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus is a frequent cause of transtibial amputation, requiring precise fitting of the prosthesis to avoid ulcers and complications. The lack of diagnostic tools to identify critical pressures increases clinical risk and costs. In countries such as Peru, the price of a silicone prosthetic liner can exceed US$300, making it difficult to acquire. Faced with this reality, a wireless sensorized system capable of detecting pressure points effectively and affordably is proposed. The system acts as direct interface between the residual limb and the prosthesis, simulating real conditions of use. It uses FSR 402 sensors encapsulated in vacuum-cured medical silicone, connected to an ESP32 microcontroller that transmits data via WiFi to an interface developed in MATLAB. The platform allows visualizing pressures on a 3D model of the liner, identifying risk zones and recording data in CSV files. The results validate the technical feasibility of the prototype. The use of an operational amplifier increased the signal similarity to an ideal step by <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$58 \\%$</tex>, improving stability. The silicon coated sensors showed a reduction in pressure values compared to the sensors without encapsulation. Even so, both cases presented a good fit to the logarithmic model, with low RMSE errors (24.20 with silicone and 25.25 without silicone) preserving a stable behavior. In addition, the average latency was <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$101.8 \\pm 6.0 \\text{ms}$</tex>, below the human perceptible threshold, allowing a real-time response.

This work presents the results obtained from analyzing data collected in an experimental test campaign conducted on 15 healthy voluntary participants. Participants were not assigned a predefined task sequence but were observed during their normal office routine; this included activities such as typing on a keyboard, working at a computer, writing by hand, and using a mobile phone, to capture physiological and environmental signals in realistic working conditions. Data recording was performed in a room of 42 m2 while wearing a smartband (Emotibit) collecting diverse physiological signals (e.g., photoplethysmogram and electrodermal activity); furthermore, a multiparametric environmental sensor was positioned in the room. A survey on comfort (thermal, acoustic, and air quality) and related individual perception and affect (positive and negative) was administered to the participants at regular intervals. A BIM-based platform was used to perform the tests, administer the surveys, and collect all the signals from all the sensors (even when multiple subjects were present in the room). All the collected data were post-processed; after specific cleaning operations, relevant features were extracted from both physiological and environmental signals and used to train Machine Learning modEIS to predict the subject's multidomain comfort sensation; also, synthetic indices combining multiple spheres of comfort were defined to depict the global subject's comfort status. The proposed measurement approach can be applied to regularly monitor indoor multidomain comfort, enabling timely interventions in case needed, also providing early warnings and suggesting actions for improvement."

Tested on RevLib benchmarks mapped to the 20-qubit IBMQ Tokyo topology, DIRSH outperformed three LightSABRE variants across different time budgets, achieving shorter depths and fewer swaps.

    "abstract": "With the development of smart grids and energy internet, the demand for energy storage in power systems is gradually increasing. Flywheel energy storage is irreplaceable in high-frequency, high-power, and fast-response scenarios, making it particularly suitable as an “energy storage buffer” for power grids, industries, and high-reliability facilities. It complements long-duration energy storage technologies such as batteries, promoting the efficient and stable operation of clean energy systems. Among these, the situation awareness technology of flywheel energy storage is the core to ensuring the safe and efficient operation of the system, as well as a key technology for maintaining safety, stability, and efficiency. This paper uses Matlab/Simulink to construct a simulation model of a flywheel energy storage unit and conducts simulation analysis on the power signal tracking capability during the charging and discharging processes. The results show that the flywheel energy storage unit model established in this paper can respond quickly to changes in power signals while ensuring that the output power consistently follows the given power, aligning with the operational characteristics of actual flywheel energy storage systems. This verifies the feasibility of the proposed method."

    "abstract": "Modern soft real-time applications (SRTAs) impose heavy computational demands on embedded devices. While offloading workloads to Edge Computing (EC) resources is attractive, task scheduling remains challenging due to strict timing constraints, a vast search space, multiple conflicting objectives, and highly dynamic environments. Conventional heuristic and meta-heuristic algorithms struggle to adapt to these conditions. Although reinforcement learning (RL) suits dynamic environments, single-agent RL converges slowly on mediumand large-scale problems due to enormous action spaces and excessive exploration. We present Agile Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (A-MARL), which enhances Multi-Agent PPO by replacing conventional exploration with entropy-guided rule-based exploration. When policy entropy is high, A-MARL employs Shortest Processing Time (SPT) to guide exploration toward promising action space regions. This adaptive mechanism accelerates convergence and delivers schedules better suited for SRTAs in EC environments. Experiments on representative scenarios show A-MARL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across all evaluated metrics, demonstrating its effectiveness for SRTA task scheduling in EC."

    "abstract": "The implementation of fifth-generation (5G) networks has posed new challenges regarding infrastructure deployment and the coexistence of different technologies. To understand how electromagnetic waves propagate in the frequency bands assigned by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for 5G networks, it is necessary to study the path-loss (PL) models proposed by some researchers and standardization organizations. The transmitted signal is greatly affected by propagation scenario conditions. Therefore, it is necessary to develop versatile simulation tools that can predict and compare PL behavior in different scenarios. This paper presents the performance of PL versus the transmitter (Tx) and receiver (Rx) separation distance at 28 GHz, for urban microcell (UMi) environments under non-line-of-sight (NLOS) conditions. The paper discusses PL models proposed by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), the Millimeter-wave European Total Integration Solution (METIS) and the Millimeter-Wave Based Mobile Radio Access Network for 5G Integrated Communications Project (mmMAGIC). We also describe the behavior of PL versus distance and frequency, taking the UMi NLOS case given by 3GPP in the FR1 frequency range as a reference. These results were obtained through the development of a software tool that simulates PL models for 5G networks in urban, suburban, and indoor environments. The tool offers an intuitive and functional interface with which users can configure parameters such as frequency, distance, antenna height, and type of environment."

    "abstract": "As a more affordable and environmentally friendly option to traditional automobiles, electric vehicles, or EVs, are growing in popularity. But the transportation industry also faces additional difficulties as a result of electric vehicle (EV) adoption, particularly with regard to the provision of sufficient and dependable charging infrastructure. Through their own networks or alliances with other stakeholders, EV charging operators are the organisations that offer charging services to EV owners. Since they make electricity available and accessible to EVs, e-charging operators are essential to the EV ecosystem. Smart charging that supports renewable energy targets, overcomes infrastructure constraints, and advances sustainable mobility by enhancing user experience, reducing costs, and increasing confidence in electric vehicles becomes a feasible option through the use of IoT, AI, and big data analytics. This study aims to create a better Generative Adversarial Network model to create a synthetic electric vehicle data set. That will then be fed into ensemble machine learning algorithms that will predict the energy needed to charge electric vehicles. For synthetically created data for a few urban cities in Odisha, India, the upgraded Temporal Charge Generative adversarial network model yields Skewness and Kurtosis values of − 0.045 and − 0.170, respectively. These values are extremely similar to the city's fourwheeler electric vehicle charging data."

Because wearable technologies for respiratory health monitoring indirectly estimate the tidal volume according to different dimensions, we have considered surrogates in terms of displacement, diameter, perimeter, and area. We have shown that with increasing amplitude, the tidal volume estimated by vertical motion and antero-posterior diameter progressively overestimates the relative changes of volume variations, while the tidal volume estimated by perimeter and cross-sectional area progressively underestimates the relative changes of volume variations. These results need to be confirmed by a larger population to provide insights into the potential of wearable technology for respiratory health monitoring."

    "abstract": "The growing prevalence of intelligent systems has heightened the importance of Human-Machine Interaction (HMI), yet the relationship between HMI design and user trust remains poorly understood. Current trust assessment methods, often reliant on subjective or post-hoc measures, struggle to capture trust dynamics in high-risk scenarios. To address the challenges of subjectivity and quantitative modeling, this paper introduces a deep learning-based method for predicting and calibrating user trust in HMIs. Our approach establishes a trust calibration model that identifies key metrics via the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and evaluates risk scenarios using a developed SRD function. A Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) generates datasets of design features, which are processed by a Bayesian updating-based calibration algorithm that implements both trust-enhancement and suppression strategies. A prototype for complex intelligent machinery demonstrates the proposed method. This study offers a novel solution for real-time trust measurement and provides theoretical and practical insights for data-driven HMI design."

In this paper, a Discrete Model-Based Predictive Control (DMPC) method with input magnitude and rate of variation constraints is proposed, which prevents the phase-shifting control signal from changing too quickly, causing the rectifier bridge to enter discontinuous conduction mode (DCM) in LCC-S WPT system, effectively mitigate the output current dead-zone phenomenon in resonant networks and achieves superior reference tracking performance for the load voltage. Furthermore, in order to better deal with the nonlinearity of the control variables, the Hammerstein model is used to characterize the system dynamics. Simulation outcomes demonstrate the efficacy and benefits of the proposed approach."

    "abstract": "Brain tumors present a major clinical challenge because of their diverse structures and rapid growth. This makes it crucial to interpret MRIs accurately and consistently for effective diagnosis and treatment planning. Traditional manual analysis can be quite labour-intensive and often varies between different observers, which is why there’s a pressing need for automated and reliable computational tools. In this study, we introduce a comprehensive deep learning framework that combines an enhanced U-Net for tumor segmentation with a specialized CNN classifier to predict WHO grades using multi-modal MRI data. The segmentation module uses attention mechanisms, batch normalization, and residual connections to better define tumor subregions, including the Whole Tumor (WT), Tumor Core (TC), and Enhancing Tumor (ET). The identified regions are then classified into Grades II, III, and IV using a lightweight CNN designed for clinical efficiency. We applied extensive data augmentation techniques like intensity normalization, rotation, and elastic deformation to enhance generalisation, especially with limited training samples. Experiments conducted on the BraTS 2021 dataset show that our hybrid model achieves a Dice Similarity Coefficient of 0.925 for WT segmentation and a 93 percent accuracy in tumor grading. These findings underscore the framework’s potential to offer a robust, fully automated, and clinically viable solution for brain tumor analysis."

    "abstract": "Powerline Communication (PLC), where both data and power are allowed to be transmitted via the same channel, has applications in smart grids, home automation, and IoT devices. But due to the increase in data rates, it is affected by noises such as Impulsive Noise (IN), Cyclostationary Noise (CN), and Narrowband Interference Noise (NIN). These noises are responsible for the increase in Bit Error Rate (BER) of a system and, as a result, reduce the strength of the signal. This paper provides a review of PLC and how it evolved over the years. It includes the characteristics of noise in PLC, describes the different noise sources that occur in the system, and the reasons for the occurrence of each noise type. It is followed by the noise mitigation techniques that are applied to certain noise levels based on the nature of the noise. Additionally, it includes a summary of the mitigation techniques, which provides information about the selection of specific methods with respect to the type of noise that occurs in the system. A comparison section is also included that compares the mitigation techniques based on their characteristics. The novelty of this survey is the development of a noise-based selection of mitigation techniques that reduce the particular type of noise effectively instead of reducing all types of noise partially. As a result, the reader can learn about the evolution of PLC systems and advancements in noise-mitigation techniques, which help PLC devices work efficiently in changing noisy environments."

Using the Scopus database, 637 articles were initially gathered based on keywords related to AI, architecture, and housing. After filtering by date range (2005-2024), language, and subject relevance, 106 articles were selected for detailed analysis. The PRISMA framework helped guide a transparent and structured selection process. To better understand the landscape, tools like VOSviewer and Biblioshiny were used to analyze keywords, citations, authorship patterns, and institutional contributions. Results showed a major spike in research activity around 2018, followed by a gradual decline. Common themes included architectural design, BIM (Building Information Modelling), machine learning, and generative design. China emerged as a major contributor, with universities like the Macau University of Science and Technology and Tsinghua University leading the way. The most influential articles often focused on combining BIM with AI, exploring deep learning models for design automation, and developing generative design solutions. Keyword and co-citation analysis revealed two main clusters one tied to traditional design methods and the other to AI-driven innovation indicating a growing connection between architecture and emerging technologies."

    "abstract": "With the acceleration of global urbanization and the continuous improvement of residents' living standards, modern people have put forward unprecedentedly high requirements for the quality of their living environment and the expression of their individuality. Indoor space is no longer merely a place to fulfill basic living functions; it has become a core carrier that carries an individual's lifestyle, aesthetic preferences, and emotional needs. At the same time, the demands of user groups are becoming increasingly diverse and refined. However, the core challenge in meeting such highly personalized needs lies in the fact that indoor layout is essentially a complex multi-objective optimization problem. An ideal layout plan must coordinate numerous interrelated and even conflicting dimensions within a limited space: it not only needs to ensure basic safety and functionality, but also take into account environmental comfort and psychological feelings. To address this challenge, this paper designs and implements an adaptive intelligent indoor layout system based on a multi-constraint rule engine and an improved genetic algorithm. The core idea of this system lies in encoding the professional knowledge and design norms of human designers into a structured and computable multi-dimensional rule base, and through an efficient multi-objective optimization algorithm, automatically generating layout schemes for users that not only meet hard constraints but also conform to personalized soft requirements."

    "abstract": "Multi-temporal change detection has become an important in remote sensing technology, helping to monitor the environment and manage natural resources more effectively. It plays a key role in areas like city planning, farming, and responding to natural disasters. Existing methods, such as change vector analysis, pixel-based differencing, thresholding techniques on vegetation indices like Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and post-classification using support vector machines, have been used for years. However, these approaches often struggle to capture the full picture because they analyzes each pixel separately and ignore the surrounding pixel patterns. As a result, it may lead to less accuracy when detecting or classifying changes in satellite images. Therefore, this study aims to implement an efficient and advanced deep learning network-based change detection model using multi-temporal satellite images for determining the climatic impacts on the environment. The satellite images are collected from standard databases. Then, the collected satellite images are considered for the change detection with the development of an advanced deep learning network named Spatio-Temporal Attention based ResNet (STA-RNet) based encoder and decoder architecture. By analyzing satellite images taken at different times, it identifies and quantifies changes in the surface, helping us understand how climate change is affecting various aspects of the environment. The experimental analysis is carried out to analyze the proposed model's efficiency by comparing it with conventional techniques."

This paper explores the evolution of game AI, from basic production rule systems and decision trees to the widespread use of Finite State Machines (FSMs). We discuss the advantages and limitations of each approach, highlighting how the complexity and scalability of game AI have led to the adaptation of modular systems, which offer greater flexibility and maintainability. Furthermore, we examine how these AI techniques contribute to the gameplay experience and the challenges faced by developers in meeting the increasing demands of players and game engines."

In numerous urban environments, this system fails to operate efficiently. The process of altering traffic signals requires a significant amount of time, which can result in delays for ambulances. A prior research study employed the YOLOv3 model for traffic management based on vehicle density; however, its accuracy was found to be suboptimal. In contrast, the project utilizes the YOLOv8 model, which provides enhanced accuracy and expedience in ambulance detection. The development of the project was carried out using the Python programming language. The findings indicate that YOLOv8 surpasses YOLOv3 in terms of accuracy and prioritizing emergency vehicles, thereby facilitating faster arrival times for ambulances. The infrastructure of smart cities is being advanced by this program. Traffic lights are set up to change automatically when an ambulance is successfully detected, giving the vehicle an unobstructed path while minimizing delays."

A total of 80 antenna samples were analyzed, 40 in each group, using return loss and standing wave ratio as the primary performance metrics. Statistical evaluation was conducted using a predefined alpha level of 0.05, beta level of 0.2, and a test power of 80 percent. The simulation results showed that the fractal-based antenna significantly outperformed the conventional design. The novel antenna achieved a return loss of minus 30.2889 decibels and a standing wave ratio of 1.0631, compared to minus 19.1511 decibels and 1.2479 for the standard configuration. The performance differences were statistically significant with p values less than 0.005. These findings indicate that the 8 by 8 fractal array antenna provides better impedance matching and lower signal reflection, making it more suitable for S band wireless communication applications."

To bridge these limitations, this project proposes ForenXplorer, an integrated digital forensic triage platform that unifies disk imaging, file-level investigation, and network behavior analysis within a single automated framework. A central capability of the system is its Support Vector Machine (SVM) model, trained on the CSE-CIC-IDS 2018 dataset, which identifies abnormal patterns in network traffic extracted from pcap files. Alongside this, the tool provides forensic disk imaging with SHA-256 hash verification, advanced file analysis with metadata extraction, signature validation, and malicious behavior detection. Developed using React.js for the frontend and Flask for the backend, ForenXplorer offers investigators a responsive and scalable environment for incident handling. By consolidating multiple functions into one intelligent platform, it minimizes reliance on disparate tools, accelerates investigation workflows, and enhances detection precision. Additionally, the system automatically compiles findings into a downloadable PDF report, outlining attack indicators, forensic insights, and recommended remediation steps. ForenXPlorer thus modernizes digital forensic practices by combining automation with machine Learning driven intelligence, offering a robust framework for faster and more reliable cybersecurity investigations."

This article gathers available evidence that the oculomotor system, a motor system believed to be the blueprint for all other motor systems, is supported by an internal model that subserves the internal model principle. An adaptive internal model design from the literature is then applied to recover the behaviors of this system. The cerebellum is also known to be responsible for training reflexes—adaptive feed forward inputs used for disturbance rejection. A two-time scale control architecture is presented to explain how the brain trains reflexes. The design highlights a broader principle of energy management in the brain: multiple controllers trade off their steady-state work to achieve optimal steady-state regulation. The article focuses on optimal steady-state regulation in which adaptive feed forward inputs and adaptive state feedback can offload the steady-state cost of operation of adaptive internal models."

    "abstract": "Accurate classification of hyperspectral images (HSI) is crucial for earth observation and agricultural production analysis, yet remains challenging due to high dimensionality, spectral variability, and limited training samples. Traditional approaches often struggle to effectively balance computational complexity with the ability to capture spatial-spectral relationships of observation targets. To address this challenge, we propose OmniMamba, a novel omnidirectional state space model that adopts a collaborative alternation strategy integrating single-scale and multi-scale feature processing with omnidirectional scanning mechanisms. Four complementary scanning patterns (row, column, zigzag, and snake) are employed in the omnidirectional scanning mechanism to transfer 2D spatial data into 1D spatially structured feature sequence, which preserves directional sensitivity while achieving global dependency modeling with only linear complexity. This avoids the quadratic complexity bottleneck inherent in self-attention mechanisms. Our collaborative alternation strategy coordinates fine-grained spectral signatures with hierarchical spatial contexts through cascaded processing stages, addressing the spectral-spatial feature fusion challenge in HSI classification. Extensive experiments conducted on four benchmark datasets validate the superiority of OmniMamba, achieving a mean overall accuracy of 99.28%, significantly outperforming existing methods. Remarkably, our model accomplishes the performance with only 246 K parameters and 0.04 GFLOPs, demonstrating dramatically low computational complexity than the state-of-the art conventional CNN and transformer-based architectures."

    "abstract": "Vehicular edge computing (VEC) emerges as a critical enabler of low-latency and computation-intensive vehicular applications by offloading tasks from vehicles to edge servers. However, the dynamic nature of vehicular networks introduces significant uncertainty in task characteristics and network conditions, posing challenges for efficient resource allocation. This paper proposes a robust task offloading scheme for VEC within the open radio access network (O-RAN) architecture. Leveraging mixed-timescale optimization, the proposed approach integrates large-timescale computational resource allocation (CRA), moderate-timescale task partitioning, and small-timescale radio resource allocation (RRA) using O-RAN's hierarchical control framework. The robust optimization model minimizes the network-wide resources while meeting the deadline of individual task execution latencies under demand uncertainty. We employ the cutting-set method to address the demand uncertainty in the large-timescale CRA. We obtain a closed-form solution to the optimal task partitioning problem. We adopt both the Lyapunov optimization and a heuristic approach for the small-timescale RRA, wherein we adopt the concave-convex procedure to resolve the non-convexity of the data rate expression. The efficiency of the proposed method is shown through extensive simulations. The results show that the small-timescale RRA succeeds to counteract the demand uncertainty at the large-timescale CRA, that is, no outage occurs when demands are in the assumed uncertainty set, whereas the non-robust scheme exhibits as high as <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$50 \\%$</tex-math></inline-formula> outage probability. Moreover, our heuristic scheme is less conservative and consumes less resources than the Lyapunov optimization, and it consumes about <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$40 \\%$</tex-math></inline-formula> less bandwidth than the conventional non-slotted robust solution."

    "abstract": "When using existing standards and methods of interpretation of Dissolved Gas Analysis (DGA) in transformers (e.g., IEEE, IEC, Doernenburg and other two-gas ratios), more than half of transformers get classified above status 1, requiring closer monitoring, too many for the limited resources of maintenance personnel. Furthermore, CIGRE TB 771 has shown that these standard methods do not consider the type of fault, which greatly affects the percentile values used as gas limits. The new DGA interpretation method proposed in this paper uses gas limits L1 and L2 specific for each type of fault and thus significantly reduces the percentage of analyses requiring closer surveillance. It also provides more precise information on the severity and location of faults occurring in the transformers, using advanced versions of the Duval Pentagons (2b, Unified) and Triangles (1b, 5b and 4) to identify sub-types of arcing faults in paper and in oil, and of carbonization of paper in specific places in the transformer. This allows users to assess the risk to transformers more precisely and take more appropriate action, such as removing or keeping the transformer in service. Free software is available to apply this new method automatically on any DGA database."

    "abstract": "In the sector of healthcare equipment supply chain, the consumer initially requests quotations from multiple vendors through tenders and gives an order to the selected quotation. In this process, there is involvement of a third party which leads to favoring a few vendors, getting tenders in an unbiased or illegal manner which may result in high cost to the consumer. To overcome these challenges, in this paper, Oracles integrating with a blockchain framework have been proposed in which Oracles will select quotations from the database with a moderate price. The selected quotation details will be sent to the blockchain to track the supply chain through Smart Contract. The blockchain will track the supply chain of healthcare equipment and machinery from manufacturer to diagnostic centers, healthcare clinics, and hospitals. The proposed framework provides unbiased quotation selection and moderated price with a secure environment for the healthcare equipment supply chain. The manufacturer, supplier, distributor, and retailer are first authorized to participate in the supply chain network and later participants can trace the status of the order. To search the status of equipment, a webbased application integrated with the blockchain network has been deployed. The proposed framework has been evaluated on parameters: throughput, latency, and gas consumption."

The suggested system analyzes waste and divides it into groups that are either biodegradable or non-biodegradable using image processing based on Python. The technology employs voice commands to route waste to the appropriate dustbin after it has been classified. In addition to trash segregation, the system incorporates temperature and gas sensors to measure temperature variations and monitor environmental conditions in the waste bins. This helps to reduce dangers by ensuring that harmful gases, such as methane, are identified in time.The bin's design also includes a notification system that alerts users when it is time for disposal or when the bins are nearing the capacity. By integrating these features, the smart waste management system used to promotes recycling and also enhances public health and safety in urban environment. The bin's fill level is checked by an ultrasonic sensor, and all sensor data is sent to an IoT platform for real-time tracking that tracks the data and prompt waste pickup. By increasing resource recovery from garbage, this automated system lowers human error, increases waste management efficiency, and supports environmentally friendly practices."

In order to bridge the semantic gap between language and visual representation, this study investigates the construction of an automated text-to-image creation system using Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL), a state-of-the-art diffusion-based deep learning model. The suggested approach uses a pre-trained SDXL model to generate high-fidelity (1024xl024) graphics with scalable efficiency by methodically processing textual suggestions from a structured CSV input. The system enables heterogeneous execution across CUDA and CPU contexts and incorporates sophisticated memory management strategies, such as attention slicing, to maximize computational performance. Future modifications, including fine-tuning for domain-specific applications, are made easier by a modular ar-chitecture's assurance of extensibility. To guarantee traceability, reproducibility, and robustness across the pipeline-from model inference to output storage-rigorous logging techniques are in-tegrated. Empirical validation highlights the system's usefulness in creative design, synthetic media generation, and human-AI collaborative art by proving its capacity to generate a variety of semantically coherent visuals. In addition to offering a useful tool for generative tasks, this work encourages more investigation into the interpretability, controllability, and ethical aspects of large-scale diffusion models by making the implementation open-source."

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have changed how computers read and write text. They are trained on vast amounts of data and can provide clear answers and perform multiple tasks. Rather than just expanding these models, researchers have recently begun including tools, retrieval techniques, and step-by-step reasoning. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), tool-using agents like Toolformer and ReAct, and planning techniques like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Tree-of-Thought (ToT) are a few examples. Models are made lighter and faster with the use of Mixture of Experts (MoE) and effective fine-tuning techniques such as QLoRA and AWQ. Multiple levels of reasoning that function at varying speeds are added by Hierarchical Reasoning Models (HRMs). This paper gives a clear explanation and comparison of these ideas. Additionally, it examines actual application cases in various Indian fields, including local languages, healthcare, law, education, agriculture, and governance. The study covers the benefits and drawbacks of multiple strategies. The key ideas are: (1) LLMs remain essential as the fundamental language engine; (2) tools and retrieval help in error reduction; and (3) hierarchical plans improve model thinking but increase system complexity. We conclude with suggestions for adapting AI to Indian languages and future research concerns."

    "abstract": "Gait analysis plays a crucial role in understanding human locomotion, with applications in biomechanics, rehabilitation, and clinical diagnostics. Optical motion capture systems represent the gold standard in the field of gait analysis providing accurate information about human movement although they have the limit to be expensive, time-consuming and limited to the laboratory. Recently, wearable sensors, based mainly on inertial measurement units (IMUs), have emerged as a promising alternative to optoelectronic systems, enabling real-world gait monitoring and in a simpler, faster and cheaper way. However, variations in sensor placement and in the type of inertial signal used to detect gait events can impact on the accuracy of gait parameter estimation. This study presents a novel algorithm for computing spatiotemporal gait parameters using angular velocity signals around the mediolateral axis acquired from two IMUs paced on the ankles. The algorithm was validated comparing its measures with the ones computed using a commercial wearable inertial system based on foot-mounted IMUs. Thirty healthy participants performed a 7-meter walkway protocol wearing IMUs on the lower limbs according to the specification of both methods. Gait events, including toe-off, mid-swing, and heel-strike, were identified, and five spatiotemporal parameters (cadence, gait cycle time, stance phase, swing phase, and double support phase) were calculated. The validation study was carried out using two-tailed paired test and Bland-Altman analysis. The results showed the presence of constant systematic errors in estimating the following parameters: cadence, stance phase, swing phase, and double support phase; while gait cycle time showed a good agreement between the two methods. However, a constant systematic error can be simply corrected by zeroing of the bias through a subtraction operation. In conclusion, the proposed algorithm can be considered a valid tool for gait assessment even if further refinements are needed to remove the constant systematic errors that occur in the spatiotemporal parameters estimation. Future development, considering all the components of both acceleration and angular velocity signals acquired from the two IMUs placed on the ankles, might improve the reliability of the proposed algorithm to compute spatiotemporal parameters."

Firstly, an efficient time series analysis algorithm is used to accurately predict and analyze real-time data to capture instantaneous changes in the market. Secondly, a multi-level economic model is constructed, which integrates factors such as market behavior, supply and demand dynamics, and price fluctuations. Then, the prediction ability of the model is optimized through machine learning algorithms, and trading strategies are adjusted in real time. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is superior to traditional models in both prediction accuracy and response speed, and can adjust trading strategies in real time, improve the accuracy of market trend prediction and the execution efficiency of trading decisions. In the simulation test, the model using this method achieved a prediction accuracy of more than 85%, which is 15% higher than the traditional method. At the same time, the optimization of trading strategies has increased the back test yield by 20%."

This paper talks about a unified deep learning framework that combines a number of smart functions, such as spotting objects and fire hazards, recognizing human actions, spotting drones and intruders, and flagging strange behaviour like falls or suspicious activity. We use models like YOLO, EfficientDet, MobileNetV2, ResNet-101, CNN-LSTM, ConvLSTM2D, LRCN, and I3D to learn about and study behaviour over time and space. The system can respond quickly and effectively, even in crowded or complicated scenes, thanks to attention mechanisms, skeletal tracking through Mediapipe, and edge computing. Testing in the real world shows that the system can recognize human activity with more than 98% accuracy and very few false alarms. In general, this method shows that there is a reliable and scalable way to meet the security needs of smart environments with intelligence and speed."

Although access to advanced diagnostic services is still restricted, particularly in settings with limited resources, early diagnosis improves developmental outcomes. By examining children's behavioral patterns from audio and video inputs, current research investigates artificial intelligence, in particular deep learning, for early ASD screening. A review of the literature combines models for feature extraction that combine gaze tracking, speech signal analysis, and facial emotion analysis. Multimodal analysis is made possible by open-source datasets, such as TESS/DE-ENIGMA (voice) and Aff-Wild2 (facial expressions). Important behavioral indicators like gaze aversion, flat affect, and delayed speech are recognized by CNNs and LSTMs. The results demonstrate that combining audio and video modalities improves detection, sometimes reaching over 85% accuracy.

    "abstract": "In integrated sensing and communications (ISAC)-enabled vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) scenarios, vehicles are modeled as extended targets, which causes an angle mismatch between the directions of the echo signal and the communication signal, necessitating accurate beam tracking. However, the rapidly changing propagation environment in V2I scenarios, along with the use of directional beams, makes beam tracking highly challenging. To overcome the above challenges, this paper presents a dual-stage reinforcement learning (DSRL)-based beam-tracking method for ISAC-enabled V2I scenarios. Specifically, in the first stage, the vehicle of interest is modeled as an extended target, and the codebook is designed by comprehensively considering the vehicle length, the antenna spacing, the beam angle, etc. Then, considering the mobility of the vehicle, a dynamic quality value (Q)-learning-based method is proposed for coarse beam selection, which aims to guarantee that the target vehicle is covered. In the second stage, considering the angle offset between the directions of the vehicle center and the aligned beam from the first stage, the deep Q-network (DQN) algorithm is designed to solve the fine beam-tracking problem. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed beam-tracking method outperforms existing methods in terms of the achievable rate and tracking time."

Decoy accounts, service principal names, and bait resources create a controlled environment that captures attacker interactions with high fidelity. Experimental evaluation using simulated intrusions demonstrates sub- 3 -second detection latency, zero false positives, and complete visibility into attacker intent and sequence of actions.

Despite the proliferation of virtual reality-based interventions, current assessment instruments often present several limitations, as they typically focus on isolated aspects or were originally designed for conventional interfaces. This paper presents the development of the User Experience questionnaire for Virtual Reality application in Healthcare (UXVR-H), a novel questionnaire specifically designed to evaluate user experience when users interact with virtual reality applications in clinical settings. The multi-phase development process combined literature analysis, user-centered design approach, and expert consultation. We first conducted a comprehensive review of existing assessment tools, identifying eight crucial dimensions of virtual experiences in healthcare: usability and functionality, aesthetics of design, engagement, emotional state, motivation and intention of use, side effects, realism of environments, and presence. An initial pool of 271 items was systematically refined through two key phases: (i) a reformulation technique involving older adults to ensure item clarity and comprehension, and (ii) content validation by eight independent user experience and methodology experts. This rigorous process resulted in a final 24-item instrument with a 5-point Likert scale. This work represents the first critical step toward a fully validated assessment tool to establish reliability and construct validity. The UXVR-H addresses a significant gap in the field by providing a specialized assessment instrument that can enhance the design and implementation of virtual reality-based interventions in healthcare settings once fully validated."

    "abstract": "Affective state estimation seeks to identify emotional responses using physical or physiological cues. In the political context, emotional responses are particularly impactful, as political figures and events can evoke strong feelings that shape public opinion, voting behavior, and civic engagement. The analysis of physiological signals can be a reliable method to estimate affective reactions to political information. This pilot study proposes a method for estimating affective arousal. Physiological signals were acquired from 20 subjects while they viewed images of Colombian politicians. Two signals were recorded: PPG and GSR using a wearable sensor. These signals were analyzed in the frequency and time domains, and various classification models were evaluated. The best model was found to be SVM, with an accuracy higher than 70 % for arousal estimation. The results of this pilot study demonstrate that the proposed method can be effective in estimating affective responses that could be used to predict voting behaviour or political opinions."

    "abstract": "Water quality monitoring systems provide critical data on environmental parameters such as temperature, pH, and dissolved oxygen (DO), which are essential for assessing and managing aquatic ecosystems. However, these systems are often affected by missing values caused by environmental stress, sensor drift, or transmission errors, potentially compromising data reliability and leading to biased analysis or suboptimal decision-making. To address this challenge, this study evaluates the performance of the Kalman Filter (KF) and Kalman Smoother (KS) for imputing missing water quality sensor data. Synthetic datasets were constructed with artificially injected gaps following the Missing Completely at Random (MCAR) mechanism at $\\mathbf{1 0 \\%}$ and 20% missing rates. The reconstructed data were assessed using Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). Results show that while both methods effectively handle missing values, KS consistently achieves higher accuracy, producing smoother and more reliable reconstructions. These findings highlight KS as a promising approach for improving the reliability of water quality monitoring data."

Spectral, non-linear, and temporal features were extracted to identify differences in PC strategies based on gender and age group (Over40 vs. Under40). For comparisons across phases, the Friedman test was performed, followed by the Wilcoxon rank sum test as a post hoc analysis. To assess differences within each experimental phase, the Mann-Whitney U test or the t-test were used, depending on data normality. No significant gender differences were found within the phases (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$p$</tex>>0.05). Age-related differences in postural control were significant during the PRE and POST phases (p<0.001), with greater sway and reduced stability in the Over40 group. Some instability measures in the Over40 group persisted after the perturbation, showing sustained balance challenges. These findings demonstrate the utility of the BioVRSea system and both spectral and conventional CoP analyzes to detect age-related PC changes and support their use in balance assessment for aging populations."

    "abstract": "As large language models (LLMs) proliferate in scale, specialization, and latency profiles, the challenge of routing user prompts to the most appropriate model has become increasingly critical for balancing performance and cost. We introduce CARGO (Category-Aware Routing with Gap-based Optimisation), a lightweight, confidence-aware framework for dynamic LLM selection. CARGO employs a single embedding-based regressor trained on LLM-judged pairwise comparisons to predict model performance, with an optional binary classifier invoked when predictions are uncertain. This two-stage design enables precise, cost-aware routing without the need for human-annotated supervision. To capture domain-specific behavior, CARGO also supports category-specific regressors trained across five task groups: mathematics, coding, reasoning, summarization, and creative writing. Evaluated on four competitive LLMs (GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, DeepSeek V3, and Perplexity Sonar), CARGO achieves a top-1 routing accuracy of 76.4 % and win rates ranging from 72 % to 89 % against individual experts. These results demonstrate that confidence-guided, lightweight routing can achieve expert-level performance with minimal overhead, offering a practical solution for real-world, multi-model LLM deployments."

The system simulates real medical diagnosis scenarios through virtual reality technology, and combines machine learning algorithms to provide personalized learning experience and dynamically adjust teaching content. The algorithm uses convolutional neural networks (CNN) to simulate student diagnosis, and uses machine learning to evaluate the student's learning progress and diagnostic ability in real time, and feedback to adjust the teaching difficulty. In addition, the system uses RL algorithms to dynamically recommend learning content based on the student's performance to ensure that students can receive the most suitable training at different stages. The system is verified using real medical imaging data sets and virtual patient data. Experimental results show that compared with traditional medical teaching methods, the VR-ML-Diagnosis system can effectively improve the student's diagnostic accuracy, reduce the misdiagnosis rate, and significantly improve learning efficiency in a short period of time. In electronic medical records and imaging diagnosis, the student's accuracy rate increased by more than 15%, and the learning time was reduced by an average of 20%. This system demonstrates the great potential of combining virtual reality and machine learning in medical education, and can provide students with a more immersive, interactive and personalized learning experience, which can be expanded to more complex medical scenarios in the future."

Most recently, generative AI has been used to create human-like audio, such as deepfake speech or AI music. This application of AI has led to significant ethical concerns since human creators whose work is used for training are rarely credited. It is currently an open debate how such models can be used ethically and who is responsible for ensuring human creators receive appropriate attribution. We observe that a similar challenge has been encountered before - over a decade ago, when AI in autonomous driving led to similar questions about responsibility and ethical use of AI. In this paper, we draw parallels to the five levels of autonomy in driving to propose five levels of attribution in generative AI. We establish which properties ethical and responsible attribution should exhibit at each level. Then, we apply the proposed level structure to a range of existing techniques for ethical and responsible use of generative AI. We show that existing techniques for attribution in AI music reach up to level 4. However, no approach achieves the highest level of responsible attribution, demonstrating the need to further develop such methods."

This algorithm aims to simultaneously improve detection accuracy and accelerate model inference speed, achieving a lightweight design suitable for edge device deployment. The DWR-YOLO introduces the DWR attention module to enhance model performance while reducing computational overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DWR-YOLO performs exceptionally well on the UA-DETRAC-G2 dataset, achieving a recall of 62.4% and a mean average precision (mAP) of 66.5%, marking improvements of 2.4% and 2.6%, respectively, over YOLOv8. Furthermore, when deployed on the NVIDIA Jetson TX2, the model achieves a projected frame rate of 18 FPS, realizing lightweight deployment while outperforming other state-of-the-art object detection models. The experimental results validate that DWR-YOLO meets the real-time and low-power requirements of edge devices without compromising critical detection performance."

    "abstract": "In the evolving landscape of smart grids, Intelligent Electronic Devices (IEDs) are critical for automating and controlling substation operations, significantly enhancing grid stability and reliability. However, increased digital interconnectivity exposes these devices to sophisticated cyber threats. Compromise of IEDs can result in unauthorized control of critical equipment, causing operational disruptions and cascading blackouts. Despite the severity of this risk, current frameworks rarely focus explicitly on IED-level impact assessment within substations. This study proposes a novel, bottom-up impact assessment framework that integrates Graph Theory with Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) methodologies, specifically employing an entropy-weighted Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) model to identify and prioritize IEDs based on their criticality if compromised. Initially, substation component dependencies are represented as a network graph, and the model then ranks IEDs by their potential to disrupt grid operations. Through simulation-based analysis on real-world substation architectures, the approach effectively identifies high-risk IEDs, providing actionable insights to guide proactive cybersecurity and resilience planning This framework is substation agnostic and does not require tailormade adjustments as compared to other assessment frameworks and tools."

Using this case study, we demonstrate how scenario-driven analysis captures functional workflows, architectural constraints, and quality attributes, enabling the derivation of a layered reference architecture.

Although Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTM), Deep Neural Networks (DNN), etc, had been used for the healthcare data, they fail to capture the inter-feature dependencies in structured datasets. To overcome this limitation, we propose the DeepGCN-DynamicStack, a new heterogeneous model incorporating a deep feature extraction provided by fully connected neural networks, GCNs for capturing feature dependence, and a dynamic stacking meta-classifier. The deep feature extraction component learns high-level interactions, which are non-linear in nature, whereas GCN captures the structure of the relationships existing between these features. In fact, the meta-classifier makes a dynamic adjustment to the weights of models depending on their performance. We used DeepGCN-DynamicStack to interpret and predict the brain stroke dataset, which has a class imbalance, and resolved it through SMOTE-ENN. The model was compared with other modern architectures of CNN, LSTM, and DNN. Other competitor models that were considered as baselines are CNN, which had the following metrics: accuracy 88.0%, precision 87.7%, recall 87.2%; and DNN, which had the following metrics: accuracy 89.0%, precision 87.8%, recall 87.5%. Integration of GCN and dynamic meta-learning leads to interpretability and addresses the flexibility issue in the decision process for DeepGCN-DynamicStack when used in stroke prediction. This approach has the potential of being applied in other areas of health care, especially where the relationship of features is crucial. Subsequent studies will consider a generalization of the model to the big and various data sets."

    "abstract": "Background: Falls are common and harmful in people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS), especially during daily movements. Stepping impairments contribute significantly to fall risk but stepping-focused interventions are limited and rarely target those with higher disability. Mixed reality (MR) offers a promising, adaptive, and safe solution for stepping training even without supervision. This project aims to develop and test a closed-loop, AR-based system to assess and improve dynamic balance in PwMS. Methods: This observational study on PwMS consists of three milestones: (1) development and validation of a near-fall detection algorithm using head-worn sensors during multidirectional stepping; (2) design of an MR enviroment for personalized, adaptive, stepping training; and (3) testing the usability, reliability, and neural responses of the MR system in PwMS and healthy controls. Results: This project will advance precision rehabilitation in PwMsby developing the first closed-loop MR system for unsupervised, personalized multidirectional stepping training and assessment. Discussion: Volitional stepping training should be a core component on effective fall prevention interventions in PwMS and its effectiveness can be further enhanced through an head mounted display MR system."

    "abstract": "Efficiently coupling light from optical fibers into photonic integrated circuits is a key step toward practical photonic devices. While a notable coupling can be achieved by out-of-plane couplers such as grating couplers, their basic planar geometry typically tends to be sensitive to the polarization of light. This is partly due to the fact that the design spaces of such grating structures—typically fabricated with techniques such as electron-beam lithography—are only two-dimensional with a simple extrusion into the vertical dimension. This makes it challenging to optimize for both polarizations simultaneously, as performance typically degrades when trying to achieve high efficiency in both. As a result, conventional approaches either suffer from increased losses or require additional filtering components to account for different polarizations. In this work, we present a fully three-dimensional, polarization-insensitive grating coupler which has a highly efficient simulated coupling efficiency of over <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\bf {80\\%}$</tex-math></inline-formula> in both polarizations. This performance matches that of state-of-the-art couplers that are performant for one polarization only. This comes at the cost of a moderately larger size due to the lower refractive index materials typically available in 3D nanoprinting. Our design method uses density-based topology optimization with a multi-objective approach that combines electromagnetic simulations with a fictitious heat-conduction model acting as a soft constraint to promote structural integrity. This ensures that the designed structures are feasible for fabrication. Our work opens new possibilities for robust 3D photonic devices, enabling advanced integration, fabrication, and applications across next-generation photonics and electronics."

In this paper, three-diode models are preferred other than one-diode circuit model and two-diode circuit model due to their optimal accuracy in extracting solar output power. The three-diode model is integrated with traditional MPPT techniques like the Perturbation method, Incremental gradient technique, and Neural Network (NNW) to trace the highest power point of solar output power.

In this work, we report a novel low-cost chemiresistive free-chlorine sensor that is constructed using graphene oxide (GO)-poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) composites. The sensor was manufactured on an alumina substrate by a thick-film screen printing technique for the electrode patterns and with a drop-casting process for transferring the active sensing layer. Graphene oxide (GO) was prepared by the modified Hummers method from graphite flakes, and then its structure/chemical nature was characterized using FTIR and XRD. The GO-PEDOT:PSS composite was subsequently used to coat the active area of the sensor. Performance was tested against sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) solutions of $1,5,10,20$, and $30 \\mathrm{mg} / \\mathrm{L}$ free chlorine concentrations: the sensor showed a fast and reproducible response with a well-defined relation between electrical characterization and analyte concentration. This work highlights the combined benefit deriving from GO and PEDOT:PSS on sensor improvement and demonstrates thickfilm screen printing as an economically attractive and scalable manufacturing method for the large-scale production of chemical sensors."

Bayesian Networks allow for the integration of expert knowledge and past analogue data while let Transforms forecast temporal risk development, providing opportunities for adaptive and proactive risk mitigation interventions. The framework supports the utility of project manager decision-makers by providing explanation of interdependencies and innovative risk trajectories across project life cycles. The performance experiments demonstrated a high-level prediction accuracy (98.1%) and robustness for risk score forecasting accuracy, providing strong support for the practical application of the framework. The potential system and framework addresses making plausible interpretation actionable to the same extent as predictive strength in allowing project managers to mitigate project risk."

It evaluates the correlation of 13 features through Pearson correlation analysis and selects 7 key features using principal component analysis. A random forest is then employed to build a classification model that successfully identifies 20 sine waves, 44 triangular waves, and 16 trapezoidal waves. Subsequently, features such as temperature, frequency, excitation waveform, and core material are extracted, and their contribution is ranked by a random forest.

Four key issues are proposed: the contradiction between large-sized sensors and the aerodynamic performance of the UAV platform; the contradiction between the deformation of the radar antenna and the lightweight requirement of the aircraft; the contradiction between the antenna performance and the complex aerodynamic shape of the platform; and the contradiction the occlusion of the fuselage components and the omnidirectional detection of the radar. By breaking through the integrated aerodynamic configuration and optimization technology, conformal design and compensation technology, and integrated structure design technology, the mutual constraints between the payload and the platform in the implementation of sensor aircraft can be solved, and comprehensive optimization of flight time, range, and mission system capabilities can be achieved."

The results indicate a highly cohesive educational network characterized by small-world properties and the presence of central student actors, but limited connectivity to executives, institutions, and commercial stakeholders. The analysis reveals underutilized brokerage potential, particularly among faculty actors, and a lack of crosssector integration that may constrain innovation diffusion and partnership formation. The study contributes to the literature on innovation networks in emerging economies by highlighting the relevance of actor-level positioning in early-stage ventures and offering practical guidance for strengthening strategic communication and stakeholder engagement. Recommendations are provided to improve institutional linkages and expand outreach to underrepresented segments of the ecosystem. Future research directions include longitudinal network analysis, comparative studies across Latin American startups, and integration of network data with innovation performance indicators."

Communication between physical and digital layers is managed using lightweight IoT protocols, specifically MQTT, which enables synchronized operation and user feedback. To validate the architecture, two guitar effects pedals, a distortion and a chorus pedal, were digitally twinned and controlled through the CPS. A third case study simulates an effects chain to demonstrate the system's scalability and applicability in more complex, real-world performance environments. The integration of UML diagrams, activity diagrams, component models, and state machines supports the architectural design and facilitates the formalization of interactions between system components, enhancing its replicability and adaptability. The architecture leverages opensource tools and low-cost hardware, aligning with key requirements for adaptability, remote access, transparency, and cost-effectiveness in musical applications.

It can be considered an alternative to radio communication, especially in short-range indoor environments. Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) is one of the most well-known modulation techniques used in many, if not all, modern wireless communication systems. Since the acoustic channel shares similar characteristics with the radio channel, it is a strong candidate for implementing high data rate AAC systems. However, for robust and effective OFDM-based implementation, the effect of the acoustic channel on the signal should be analyzed comprehensively. This work focuses mainly on analyzing and quantifying the acoustic channel effects that can degrade the performance of the OFDM system in a typical indoor environment. Specifically, it analyzes the spreading delays of multipath fading and frequency offset (Doppler shift). The work reports a maximum delay spread ($\\tau_{\\max }$) of 32.7 ms and a maximum average frequency shift of less than 30 Hz. Unlike previous works that do not provide detailed channel analysis, this work provides the necessary insights that can help in designing more robust systems and selecting appropriate design parameters for future work."

Unlike conventional absorbers that have polarization-sensitive or polarization- insensitive behavior of MMA, the proposed device exhibits extra, polarization- controllable behaviour. This is achieved by the single top patch which is formed by grouping of two triangles. When the impact beam field of electricity (e-field) is chosen across the equal direction, three peak forms of absorption are mostly acquired; when the field of charge is chosen along the straight direction, three more spots are subsequently identified. This triple-band terahertz absorber is made up of a metallic basis on the bottom plate and a star-shaped patch on the top. The top model and the bottom ground plate were separated by a 0.125 mm -thick dielectric polyimide substrate. Electric current, magnetism, and area current distributions are used to analyse the physical mechanism of the polarization-controlled MMA. The polarisation type and digestion process in the present investigation were compared with those described in other studies. For large incidence degrees and polarisation angles up to 90 facets, the intended structure performs well. The selection, detection, maintenance, and functionality of polarization-sensitive gadgets should all be broadly applicable."

It will cause severe gate driver voltage fluctuations which affects normal switching process by increasing switching loss and voltage stress on power transistors. However, this phenomena was never discussed by prior arts. To address this important issue, this paper aims to reveal the mechanism of periodic CM noise coupling and propagation in IsoPs. The coupling mechanism of periodic CM noise through two different sampling approaches is discussed. The characteristics of the propagation of CM noise are firstly analyzed. Linear stages, such as op-amp and filters, are analyzed using super-positions of transfer functions. Nonlinear PWM modulation stage is investigated via double Fourier transform to elucidate the complex harmonics sideband generated by periodic CMI. The relationship between CMI frequency fCM and IsoP operating frequency f<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">sw</sub> is examined. The periodic CM noise discussed in this article comes from pulsating switching of power transistor and the analysis presented in this article are not limited to sinusoidal signals. Results show that as fcm approaches f<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">sw</sub> and its harmonics, low-frequency (LF) sidebands are intensified and become harder to filter, significantly enlarging LF fluctuations in the output voltage. When fcm aligns with f<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">sw</sub> or its harmonics, most serious fluctuations will happen with the peak-to-peak variations exceeding 10% of the average value of the output voltage. The basic law revealed in this article is validated through experiments on flyback IsoP with periodic CMI at different frequencies and amplitudes."

    "abstract": "Objective: Emerging technologies for electromagnetic interference (EMI) elimination have enabled radio frequency (RF) shielding-free magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), significantly reduced costs and increased accessibility. Existing methods often rely on multiple external sensors for EMI elimination, which can degrade with fewer sensors. Our goal is to develop a method that robustly eliminates EMI with fewer or no sensors. Methods: We propose a method for multi-channel electromagnetic interference elimination in shielding-free MRI using null operations (MEENO). This approach fully exploits the inter-channel correlation across all RF receiving and EMI sensing channels. The method was comprehensively evaluated through simulation studies and human brain imaging. Results: The MEENO approach effectively eliminates EMI artifacts, outperforming existing methods, particularly with a limited number of sensors. It shows superior performance in terms of signal-to-noise ratio and residual EMI levels. Conclusion: We introduce a method for EMI elimination in multi-channel MRI using null operations, which fully leverages inter-channel correlation and surpasses existing approaches, especially with limited sensors. Significance: This work offers a solution for EMI elimination with fewer or no external sensors, providing a more cost-effective and robust approach for shielding-free MRI."

    "abstract": "The increase in the need to have intelligent aerial surveillance has required the creation of real-time, correct, and scalable target tracking systems for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). The older methods of doing so generally include Kalman filters, LSTM-based trackers, and convolutional graph networks; however, they tend to face problems with scalability, generalizability to new environments, and fast real-time operation under dynamic missions. To address these gaps, we propose a GraphSAGE-based inductive learning framework customized for real-time UAV surveillance and multi-target tracking. The system can be understood as a dynamic graph with UAVs, targets, and communication areas corresponding to nodes and their relationships to each other as edges. Then, the node embeddings are updated continuously using GraphSAGE neighborhood aggregation. The framework facilitates building online graphs and making decisions so that the drone does not need retraining to adjust to new arrangements. On experimental analysis, our model displays 94.4% tracking accuracy with minimum average error (12.5 m) and a complete 100 percent interruption recovery rate, which surpasses baseline advanced baselines, such as GAT and DGCNN, by a significant margin. Besides high accuracy, the system is high-performance, with inference occurring in real-time and at low energy consumption, making it ideal for embedded applications on edge UAV systems. The given GraphSAGE solution is not only state-of-the-art in air/aural surveillance but also creates a scalable and robust architecture that can learn and adapt in real-time, multi-agent, and mission-critical processes. The study presents a new and practical perspective on AI systems utilizing UAVs, serving as a starting point for implementing intelligent graph-based control in next-generation aerial surveillance operations."

    "abstract": "The performance, reliability, and longevity of battery systems used in electric vehicles (EVs) have emerged as key factors impacting user satisfaction and industry uptake as their adoption rates rise globally. Conventional Battery Management Systems (BMS) traditionally depend on an extensive array of physical sensors and predetermined models, which struggle to account for the intricate, non-linear, and time-sensitive nature of lithium-ion battery behavior under diverse operating conditions. In this research we propose a new framework that embeds Digital Twin (DT) technology in the BMS of an EV for the genesis of a real-time, high-fidelity, virtual representation of the real electrochemical/thermal battery system. Using advanced data analytics, machine learning algorithms, and sensor fusion, the digital twin is continually synchronized with the physical battery so that accurate prediction of the battery health is possible, allowing early fault detection, and therefore more efficient usage of the energy. This study explains the design architecture of a digital twin-based BMS, formulated interaction between the physical layer, the virtual model and communication protocols for realtime feedback loops. Furthermore, both experimental results and HIL (hardware-in-the-loop) validations show that the proposed digital twin technique can help mitigate the risk of thermal runaway, extend battery lifecycle by intelligent chargedischarge scheduling, and optimize overall energy efficiency by dynamic adjustment considering both driving behaviors and environmental factors. Additionally, the DT framework supports predictive maintenance and improved decisionmaking at the system-level by delivering insight into degradation patterns, state-of-charge (SoC), and state-of-health (SoH) with higher accuracy than legacy systems. This research provides a solution to the challenges of real time synchronization, computational complexity, and data security while deploying digital twins for EV applications. This proposed system can be integrated into commercial EV platforms as it is scalable and reliable by adopting a layered architecture backed by cloud-edge computing and secure communication protocols. The implications of these findings reinforce the revolutionary potential of digital twin technology in advancing BMS from a reactive controller to proactive intelligent systems. This development is a major breakthrough towards battery systems in the rapidly-evolving world of electric mobility that offer enhanced safety, efficiency, and life."

This important architecture, resnet50, is used for excellent classification of images, though it fails to recognize long-term relations and interactions within medical images. While Vision Transformer is good at understanding the entire image, it struggles to extract local details which is better handled by convolutional neural networks. Combining the advantages of ResNet50 and ViT in the hybrid model allows it to identify important details from different parts and the whole image at the same time. According to testing, this training method makes the model operate better, withstand difficulties and perform in more situations than just ResNet-50 or other single models. Spatial and contextual feature extraction helps significantly in automated medical image analysis, meaning that using both techniques is beneficial for discoveries in medical sciences."

    "abstract": "Traffic Wireless Sensor Networks (TWSNs) are a key enabling technology in intelligent transportation systems, supporting Infrastructure-to-Vehicle (I2V) sensing for applications such as roadside parking assistance, traffic flow optimization, and dynamic vehicle routing. In TWSNs, relay nodes are usually installed on existing infrastructure (e.g., street light poles). The problem we focus on is how to select the minimum set of relay node deployment locations to ensure full coverage of sensor nodes. Traditional WSN relay node deployment methods ignore the road network topology and spatial continuity of sensor node distribution, leading to excessive computational overhead and redundant relay placement. This work introduces RoadNet, a time-efficient relay node deployment algorithm that constructs road network graphs, reorders nodes using depth-first traversal to produce an approximately banded coverage matrix, and employs a sliding-window technique to select relay nodes based on the matrix's banded structure. We prove that RoadNet yields the optimal solution under ideal conditions with uniformly distributed sensor and relay nodes, and we establish upper and lower bounds for its performance under general conditions. Additionally, a software system for deployment of relay nodes in TWSNs has been developed. The experimental results indicate that the RoadNet algorithm reduces average deployment costs by 35.62%, 16.48%, and 1.66% compared to greedy, branch-and-bound, and genetic algorithms, respectively. Furthermore, RoadNet achieves over 99% improvement in time efficiency relative to branch-and-bound and genetic algorithms."

The neural network is used to learn the action of the expert for the state. The parameters of the neural network are updated to minimize the loss function between the expert data and the output of the training model. This research focuses on a four-wheeled mobile robot with non-holonomic constraints. This mobile robot has a turning radius limit. This study defines a narrow road as a path that a mobile robot with non-holonomic constraints cannot pass without turnabouts. Therefore, local path planning methods including turnabouts for narrow roads have been studied. As conventional methods, local path planning using reinforcement learning methods has generated a path planning according to the environmental information. However, these conventional methods based on reinforcement learning require a long learning time. To shorten the learning time, this study proposes the local path planning method with imitation learning. Simulation results show that the learning time was significantly reduced by using the proposed method. In addition, the proposed method achieved driving performance equivalent to that of the conventional method when driving on narrow roads. From these simulation results, the effectiveness of the proposed method was confirmed."

    "abstract": "Nowadays, production systems increasingly need to be reconfigured to cope with unforeseen disruptions in workflows or supply chains, dynamic market requirements and mass personalisation. Industry 4.0 technologies, through Cyber-Physical Production Systems (CPPS), offer opportunities to address these challenges by enabling real-time monitoring and adaptive control to manage dynamic environments and requirements. With the advent of Industry 5.0, which emphasizes human-centric production, Human-Cyber-Physical Systems (HCPS) integrate operators into decision-making loops, enhancing flexibility, resilience, and responsiveness. A key requirement for these systems is reconfigurability, which involves identifying reconfiguration needs, planning actions, and executing them. Although the initial two steps are occasionally automated to some extent, the execution phase is predominantly manual, leading to inefficiencies, higher workloads, and increased risk of errors. Enabling technologies of Industry 5.0, such as Extended Reality, offer new opportunities to overcome these challenges. This work, therefore, introduces a Mixed Reality-based framework that guides and assists operators in performing industrial tasks. The framework is developed following established guidelines from the literature and relevant industrial standards, and it adopts a modular and expandable architecture that facilitates the integration of new functionalities and use cases. The approach is implemented and validated through a case study on the execution of the reconfiguration process in a real-world production line within a research platform. A preliminary evaluation using the NASA-TLX indicates that the MR application reduces workload, mainly through improved performance and lower frustration."

This review unifies recent progress by addressing four guiding questions. How are rewards specified mathematically across scalar, token-level, and multidimensional regimes, and which shaping objectives support each? How are rewards built in practice through rule-based, data-driven, and hybrid workflows that combine heterogeneous supervision sources? How do rewards interact with optimization paradigms spanning reinforcement learning from human feedback, direct preference optimization, and incontext alignment? How are rewards assessed via benchmarks that probe robustness, generalization, safety diagnostics, and downstream impact? Organizing the field around these questions yields a taxonomy that links structural choices to practical trade-offs, highlights emerging trends such as hybrid supervision and reinforcement-learning-free alignment, and clarifies how the progression of large language model alignment can be viewed as a continuous refinement of reward design strategies, outlining research priorities for reliable, value-sensitive reward systems."

    "abstract": "In recent years, Federated Learning (FL) has gained a lot of attention as a distributed machine learning technique that safeguards data privacy. By merging the concept of contrastive learning, the MOON algorithm enhances the model's capacity for generalization in the non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data scenario. However, the Model-Contrastive Federated Learning (MOON) algorithm still has shortcomings in model performance and computing resource limitations. Knowledge distillation has become a mainstream model compression and optimization method in recent years. Consequently, this paper suggests MOON-KD, an enhanced MOON algorithm based on knowledge distillation, which enhances the algorithm's robustness and performance by integrating the global model's soft labels into the loss function to direct local model optimization. According to the results of the experiment, the MOON-KD algorithm outperforms both the MOON and the FedAvg algorithms. The experiment also further analyzes the impact of hyperparameters such as distillation loss coefficient and contrastive loss coefficient on model performance. The research in this paper provides a way of thinking for model optimization under the federated learning framework and points out the shortcomings and directions for improvement."

    "abstract": "Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have gained significant attention in recent years due to their wide-ranging applications in areas such as surveillance, delivery, and disaster response. However, achieving precise and stable attitude control for UAVs remains a critical challenge, particularly in dynamic and unpredictable environments. Traditional control methods often struggle to adapt to complex flight conditions and external disturbances. Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach for addressing these challenges, with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) being one of the most widely used algorithms due to its balance between performance and stability. Despite its advantages, standard PPO faces limitations in handling the high-dimensional and nonlinear dynamics of UAV systems. To overcome these limitations, this study proposes an Improved PPO (IPPO) algorithm, specifically designed for UAV attitude control. The IPPO incorporates adaptive learning rate adjustment, enhanced exploration strategies, and a refined reward function tailored to UAV dynamics. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed IPPO algorithm achieves superior performance in terms of convergence speed, control precision, and robustness to disturbances compared to the standard PPO. This work not only advances the application of RL in UAV control but also provides a foundation for developing more autonomous and adaptive aerial systems in complex operational scenarios."

However, assessing whether people with disability can drive safely on-road is not trivial, as it requires specifically adapted vehicles. Thus, it is often impossible to assess how much prolonged driving affects cognitive abilities and induces stress in presence of assistive aids and other road occupants. This work aimed at preliminarily assessing the sensitivity of physiological and subjective metrics in discriminating different driving conditions (i.e., steering wheel vs. driving aid), in terms of mental workload and stress, while driving on a simulator. Thirteen healthy young adults drove in a simulated environment for 10 minutes in each condition. We collected electroencephalography (EEG), heart rate variability (HRV), and electrodermal activity (EDA) data and extracted mental workload and stress-related outcomes. We administered NASA-TLX and SAM questionnaires after each condition. Both the virtual driving tasks induced measurable physiological responses. Mental work-load, cardiovascular response, and some EDA metrics increased with respect to the rest phase. The subjective measures showed a tendency toward an increase when using the driving aid, but differences were not significant. The current setup was thus able to capture the increased load and arousal during virtual driving. The lack of differences between the conditions may be due to the ease of use of the aid, which did not imply many changes to standard driving actions. In the future, it would be valuable to expand the study including additional assistive aids and enrolling individuals with disabilities."

The findings show that AI can move education beyond standardized models, creating adaptive pathways that boost motivation and deepen learning. Yet practical integration in Islamic contexts remains limited. To address this, we propose a conceptual case study for Quran memorization classes. This framework combines spaced repetition algorithms and speech recognition to support tajweed accuracy, alongside teacher dashboards that track each student's progress and needs. Such an approach could enhance retention, improve pronunciation, and allow teachers to focus on spiritual mentoring. However, challenges remain, including speech recognition accuracy across dialects, cultural sensitivities, and ethical safeguards to preserve teacher authority and human connection. This study bridges theory and practice, offering educators and policymakers a practical pathway for using AI meaningfully in Islamic education. It suggests that while AI holds transformative potential, its success depends on context-specific design, ethical grounding, and close collaboration between technologists and educators to truly enrich learning in ways that honour human and spiritual development."

However, it is very often afflicted with different types of diseases which badly affect the quality of yield of rice. The early detection of diseases in rice is crucial for maintaining sustainability in its production and ensuring global food security. It proposes a hybrid deep learning model for rice leaf diseases detection by including the InceptionV3 model along with a self-designed CNN model. The InceptionV3 model acts as a feature extractor and will help in capturing features from the input image with minute details; whereas, the custom CNN contributes to enhancing the discerning capability for different diseases. Our approach uses a carefully compiled dataset of rice leaves infected by three major diseases: Leaf Blight, Brown Spot, and Leaf Smut. With the help of this dataset and our hybrid model, we would like to present a reliable tool for early and accurate disease detection in rice plants that can contribute toward better agricultural practices and improved food security around the world."

We leverage a curated dataset derived from the MITRE ATT&CK knowledge base, augmenting technique descriptions with domain-specific features and textual embeddings. A Random Forest classifier is trained to predict the set of candidate mitigations for each observed technique; its feature importance scores are used to produce interpretable explanations for the top recommendations. To account for strategic interactions between attackers and defenders, we model the mitigation selection problem as a two-player game and compute Nash equilibria over a payoff matrix that captures cost, effectiveness, and attacker incentives. The resulting hybrid approach produces mitigation recommendations that are both data-driven and strategically stable. We evaluate the framework using cross-validation and ablation studies, reporting per-class precision, recall, and F1-scores, and compare the ML-only baseline with the hybrid ML+game-theory method. Results show that the hybrid method improves robustness in scenarios with incomplete information and reduces the rate of high-cost false positives. We discuss limitations related to dataset coverage and computational scalability, and we outline practical integration steps for Security Operations Centers (SOCs). Finally, we propose directions for future work including online learning from streaming threat telemetry and deployment of approximation methods for large-scale game computations."

The system employs CSRNet, a state-of-the-art crowd-counting algorithm, to analyze pedestrian movement and estimate density levels with high accuracy. It predicts potential congestion areas and suggests proactive interventions, such as rerouting pedestrian flow and issuing early warnings, to prevent dangerous overcrowding. One of the key advantages of this system is its adaptability to both indoor and outdoor environments, allowing for dynamic crowd control in confined spaces with limited movement pathways. A Python-based crowd flow simulator was also developed to test and refine congestion control strategies. The results demonstrate that AI-based crowd flow prediction significantly enhances safety and space utilization by providing real-time insights and automated decision-making support. This approach offers a practical solution for urban planners, facility managers, and security personnel, ensuring efficient and secure crowd management in high-density environments."

    "abstract": "Digital trade regulations that focus on cross-border data flow have given nations benefits in contemporary international competitiveness and collaboration. Nevertheless, due to the complexity of international legislation and the lack of adequate privacy legislation, developing nations like India face specific challenges in managing these flows. Digital trade tactics have undergone significant changes in tandem with the growth of communication technology and its impact on trade trends. Machine learning (ML) methods must be used to automate a variety of procedures and advance digital trade to adjust to these shifts. This study presents an ML-based system for identifying challenges in cross-border international digital trade that supports India's economic development. The system tackles the intricate problems in digital trade taxes by combining multilevel detection methods with sophisticated feature development approaches. This study has identified and created new corporate structures and behavioral paradigms through the analysis of cross-border company data. Claims to have substantial regulatory status and to have a 95.7% validation accuracy with a 4.4% FP. The large market variation of the border trade may be monitored in real time because of its 0.2-second transaction effectiveness. According to research findings, the system consistently performs well in detecting intricate financial fraud trends and is stable across a range of operating settings and anomalous kinds. As novel deception trends appear, the platform's adaptable learning algorithms guarantee its continuous efficacy. By offering revenue agencies flexible systems for tracking cross-border international digital trade, the study advances both conceptual knowledge and real-world uses in tax management for digital trade. Comprehensive validation of the system's efficiency confirms its usefulness in actual tax management situations."

Around the past few decades, the number of caesarean sections performed has been continuously rising. A Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) is required to advise the doctor in decision-making. In Artificial Intelligence-Driven CDSS (AI-CDSS), AI technologies are revolutionizing CDSS, and are used efficiently in healthcare decision-making. Therefore, in order to determine whether or not a caesarean section is required, we looked into Machine Learning (ML) models in this article. The following methods are used to predict C-Sections: Logistic Regression (LR), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), AdaBoost, Bootstrap AGGregatING (Bagging). The models are evaluated using well-known classification performance metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity (recall), specificity, false-positive rate, precision, F_{1}-score, and Geometric Mean (GM) to assess their performance. Finally, an Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) model, Local Interpretable Model Agnostic Explanations (LIME), is utilized to interpret the model's predictions and analyze the impact of various clinical features on C-Section classification."

Previous studies have primarily focused on attacks against communication channels while overlooking the critical threat posed by sensor-data tampering. This paper proposes a method for detecting and mitigating sensor-data tempering attacks that leverages redundant IVD sensing by utilizing both front and rear IVD measurements in conjunction with a model-based tamper detection observer (TDO). By estimating the expected IVD error using a vehicle dynamics model and comparing it with the actual sensor readings, the proposed method selects a more reliable sensor input to maintain safe control. Simulations using a ten-vehicle platoon demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively detect and mitigate FDI attacks on sensors, thereby ensuring platoon stability and safety."

    "abstract": "Accurate land cover classification from satellite images is a fundamental task in geographic information systems, with applications in agricultural management, forestry, and land use planning. However, this task is challenged by high intraclass variability, low interclass distinctions, and diverse land cover formations. To address these issues, we propose a Cascaded Residually Dilated Network for land cover mapping from very high spatial resolution satellite imagery. The network utilizes a hybrid architecture composed of residual and dilated modules to effectively capture multiscale contextual information while mitigating the effects of small-object details and boundary confusion. Additionally, a spatial attention block is integrated into the architecture to guide the network's focus toward more discriminative regions of the scene, and an intermediary supervision strategy is implemented to ease training and accelerate convergence. Experiments on the ISPRS Potsdam and ISPRS Vaihingen datasets show that the proposed Cascaded Residual Dilated Network consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving 90.73% and 90.51% overall accuracy, respectively. The results demonstrate the robustness and potential of the Cascaded Residually Dilated Network for large-scale land cover mapping."

Using three distinct industrial cases, the study analyses the impact of operator skills, availability, and allocation rules on the identification of bottlenecks. Case A (maintenance of railway bogies) illustrates an iterative sizing approach in the design phase, while Case B (maintenance of aero-engines) highlights the importance of modelling individual skills to plan training in the medium term. Case C (watch case maintenance) demonstrates the value of detailed modelling based on real data for reallocating flows in the short term. The DES models incorporate specifications such as hourly schedules, skill levels (technical and product), and task variability (deterministic or stochastic). Results show that performance indicators, such as operator occupancy rates, skills, or dual skills, can be used to identify bottlenecks and emphasise the importance of detailed operator modelling for effective human resource management in complex industrial contexts."

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the distributed quantized control problems of nonlinear multi-agent systems under cooperative-competitive networks, where all signals in the feedback channels and the communication channels are quantized. Since the quantized signals in the feedback channels and the communication channels are discontinuous, the stabilizing functions are also discontinuous. This leads to the unavailability of the backstepping technique that requires the stabilizing function to be differentiable. To this end, a universal smoothness approach is proposed to establish the smooth approximations of the quantized signals in both the feedback channels and the communication channels. Based on these smooth approximations, a distributed quantized control protocol is designed to achieve the cluster tracking when the communications among the agents involve both cooperative and competitive relationships. It is shown that the neighborhood errors are constrained within the prescribed performance bounds. Finally, two simulation examples and a real-world implementation are given to illustrate the validity of the proposed protocol."

We identify two key pieces of information, API directives and data information, that may be beneficial for API misuse detection and fixing. Using three LLMs and misuses from five data science libraries, we experiment with various prompts.

Using vertex-wise z-scored cortical area and thickness maps from MRI, we encoded features by separately modeling positive and negative deviations, and applied Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) independently to each hemisphere. Model stability was ensured by consensus clustering and false discovery rate filtering. We compared this directional encoding to the unsigned approach in both unsupervised clustering and supervised clinical prediction tasks. The sign-preserving approach yielded latent factors that separated diagnostic groups and cognitive phenotypes and enabled moderate predictive performance. SHAP analysis indicated that topic-derived features remained interpretable with respect to clinical variables. In contrast, the unsigned encoding resulted in slightly lower regression errors for some outcomes, but with reduced anatomical and biological specificity in the derived topics. Overall, the hemisphere-specific, sign-aware LDA provided a compact and interpretable summary of cortical pathology in genetic epilepsies and supported associations with clinical phenotypes."

Agent-based models (ABMs) incorporating evolutionary game theory (EGT) and Stackelberg games provide a mechanistic framework to capture these dynamics and enable virtual experimentation on tumor growth and treatment resistance. In this regard, we have developed a modular Python/Mesa implementation that frames cancer treatment as a Stackelberg game where the physician (leader) anticipates tumor cell (follower) responses. Our model reproduces untreated tumor expansion consistent with benchmarks and integrates two treatment strategies: cyclic application and Stackelberg optimization. Results demonstrate how treatment pressures alter evolutionary fitness landscapes, frequently leading to resistance that renders initially effective treatments obsolete. The Stackelberg optimization approach achieved up to approximately 28% reduction in cumulative treatment intensity while maintaining better tumor control compared to cyclic treatment. This Stackelberg framework offers new insights into therapy optimization by explicitly modeling the sequential nature of clinical decision-making and tumor adaptation."

One key aspect of the system, is the collaboration between humans and AI agents (AIs). In each team, humans and AIs make decisions as peers, and the optimality of each team decision depends, among other things, on mutual trust and personality, of both the human and AIs. We manipulated team composition and AIs' personality and investigated how these, and human trust in AI, affect individual and team performance. Our preliminary results suggest complex dynamics. There was a clear advantage for groups, compared to individual decision-making, as expected. However, even though humans trusted the “humanized” AI more than the non-humanized AI, performance did not necessarily benefit from it."

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and other traditional models perform well in spatial feature extraction but struggle to capture long-range relationships, which are crucial in complex situations. This study focuses on developing a deep learning framework that balances accuracy and computational efficiency for real-world use with the rising demand for efficient and practical models. MobileNetv1 and a hybrid model combining MobileNetv1 with Vision Transformer (ViT) are explored in this study. MobileNetv1 is a lightweight model that provides efficient and fast processing suitable for resource-constrained devices and real-time applications. On the other hand, Vision Transformers uses self-attention to model long-range relationships but it requires large and challenging datasets and high computational power, limiting their practicality in small-scale settings such as ARID v1.5. This hybrid model offers effective local feature extraction as well as global contextual understanding by combining the benefits of CNNs and Transformers. The model reduces overfitting on small datasets, provides high accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency, and allows for real-time deployment in real-world HAR environments by combining the strength of both architectures. Robust generalization is confirmed by experiments conducted for 10 epochs using Stratified 3- fold cross-validation on imbalanced datasets. MobileNetv1 achieves $99.65 \\%$ accuracy, while the hybrid model achieves $99.74 \\%$ on ARID v1.5, demonstrating enhanced accuracy, robustness to lowlight conditions, and better generalization in challenging indoor environments."

The paradigm combines both a deep residual CNN ResNet-50, used to classify images at the image level, and a state-of-the-art real-time object model YOLOv12, used to localize pathological regions in the pancreas, spatially. The classification branch utilizes transfer learning using a ResNet50 backbone that has been fine-tuned using a curated dataset of labeled samples of normal pancreas, pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer. The YOLOv12 that is used in the detection pipeline is optimized to provide both precision and inference speed in detecting localized lesions by giving them bounding boxes and a confidence score of their class. Generalization is enhanced by the use of data augmentation methods (contrast enhancement and affine transformations). The standard measures are used to evaluate the performance with mean Average Precision (mAP). The initial findings show that the classification accuracy and the strength of detection performance are high, which proves the possibility of the proposed system to assist early and non-invasive disease of the pancreas diagnosis. The suggested multi-model system can be integrated into the computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system to offer real-time decision-support in radiological processes to clinicians."

This raises serious copyright and ethical concerns. Music tracks inherently possess two core properties: the theoretical composition, and the distinctive recording style that brings the composition to life. In this paper, we show that existing latent-space-based techniques for measuring influence of original tracks on AI music fail to distinguish between these two concepts, obscuring proper attribution of either composition or recording rights. We propose a framework for obtaining robust metrics for detecting composition and recording similarities between original tracks and AI music. We show that the latent space predominantly captures recording style, while neglecting compositional elements. Finally, our analysis shows that state-of-the-art AI models exhibit strong composition and recording biases, drifting away from the inherent structure of the original tracks."

    "abstract": "Distributed ultra-short-term photovoltaic (PV) power forecasting plays a vital role in analyzing behind-the-meter (BTM) solar generation and enhancing grid stability. As federated learning (FL) is increasingly applied to distributed BTM PV forecasting on a large scale, its deployment is confronted with two major challenges, namely performance degradation arising from device heterogeneity and privacy risks associated with global communication. To address these challenges, a novel collaborative method, termed AWA-DDP-FL, is proposed, which integrates adaptive weight assignment (AWA) with reinforcement learning-driven dynamic differential privacy (DDP). Specifically, AWA mitigates the impact of device heterogeneity by strategically excluding underperforming clients and dynamically adjusting local model aggregation weights during training. Meanwhile, DDP enables each distributed PV client to autonomously adjust its privacy budget in real time according to data sensitivity, balancing privacy protection and model performance through dynamic noise injection. Experimental results on real-world PV datasets show that the proposed method obtains normalized root mean square error of 5.110% and normalized mean absolute error of 2.630%, indicating that the proposed algorithm achieves higher accuracy even under noise perturbations."

    "abstract": "The geometry-based point cloud compression algorithm achieves efficient compression and transmission for LiDAR point clouds with high sparsity. However, the low-bitrate mode results in severe geometry compression artifacts, which involve both point reduction and coordinate offset. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to directly enhance the geometry quality for compressed LiDAR point cloud (CLGE) in a post-processing manner. Our proposed method consists of two branches: cylindrical densification and adaptive refinement. The former adopts a multi-scale sparse convolution framework to effectively extract spatial features in the cylindrical coordinate system and generate dense candidate points quickly. Large asymmetric sparse convolution kernels are also designed to capture the shapes of different regions and objects. The latter branch refines the candidate points through several MLP layers, which takes the neighborhood features between the candidate points and the input points into account. Finally, the designed ring-based farthest point resampling serves as an effective alternative for achieving the target number while maintaining the geometry distribution. Extensive experiments conducted on several datasets verify the effectiveness of our approach under different compression artifact levels. Furthermore, our method is easily extended to upsampling and is robust to noise. In addition to the geometry signal quality improvement, the point cloud enhanced by our proposed method alleviates the performance degradation in object detection task due to compression distortion."

When exploring the virtual sample, which presents varied material properties, a vibrotactile actuator placed on the user's fingertip delivers naturalistic stiffness feedback in real-time. The information is processed through a neuromorphic approach, which implements the spiking behavior of the mechanoreceptors of the human skin, to trigger vibrations of the haptic interface. A psychophysical experiment confirmed that the proposed strategy and system enable the identification of different stiffness levels with an overall accuracy of 94% and a threshold of stiffness difference of 0.13 N/mm. These results provide preliminary evidence for the possibility to detect tumor inclusions in biological tissue through digital twins.

GTSAD models the IoT network as a communication graph, characterizing nodes by features like packet delivery ratio, consistency, and honesty. A composite trust score—based on direct, indirect, and historical data—is computed for each node. These trust-augmented features are processed by a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to classify nodes as legitimate, suspicious, or Sybil. Sybil nodes face trust penalties, while suspicious nodes are monitored. GTSAD is adaptable in real time and shows higher detection accuracy and trust evaluation performance than traditional methods, making it a scalable and secure solution for future IoT networks."

This mechanism could be modelled as a dynamic feedback control system, where the central nervous system played a crucial role in ensuring the postural balance in standing position over time. Therefore, this work would insightfully explore this multimodal mechanism by combining information resulted from the simultaneous acquisition of postural, muscle and brain activity signals. Ten healthy volunteers were asked to stand with feet shoulder-width apart on a stable surface while keeping their eyes open for 30 s and postural sway parameters, lower limb muscle surface-electromyography (sEMG), and electroencephalography (EEG) signals were simultaneously recorded. Six global acceleration-domain postural sway parameters and two time-domain sEMG parameters for each leg muscle were extracted, while the EEG signals were processed to compute the functional brain connectivity matrices and to extract four global network graph theory (NGT) metrics, i.e., clustering coefficient, global efficiency, mean participation and assortativity. Spearman correlations were calculated and statistically significant negative correlation between postural sway parameters and, respectively, assortativity <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$(\\mathrm{p}=_{-}0.794)$</tex> and global efficiency <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$(\\mathrm{p}= -0.673$</tex>) and between the muscle contraction of the soleus and the mean participation (respectively, <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathrm{p}=-0.685, \\mathrm{p}=-0.697$</tex> ) emerged. These results suggested the importance of having efficient organization and a rapid adaptive mechanism of the brain to ensure a good level of stability, as well as a highly interconnected network to determine a higher level of stability with lower muscular contractions. Further analysis on larger datasets, also considering the contribution of the different EEG bands separately and the extraction of local NGT metrics, could bring out newer and compelling links between brain organization and functioning and the adopted postural strategy."

However, in hostile scenarios (e.g., search-and-rescue in after-disaster environment, reconnaissance in urban anti-terrorism, etc), the first-responder’s hands are often occupied with tasks and tools, leading to the demand for extra hands-free non-verbal instrumentation to detect and tag vital environment information (e.g., task-relevant targets) to robots. Recent studies on hands-free non-verbal instrumentation have elucidated several practical challenges, such as un-naturalistic efforts and constrained paradigms. Here, we proposed a wearable gaze-brain-computer interface (BCI) instrumentation that can directly detect and tag task-relevant targets based on the fixation-related potential (FRP) component of EEG signals, without flickering visual stimuli or limiting the position/duration of the observation. The proposed instrumentation was validated in a dual-task paradigm that simulated a real-world application, where the human has to concurrently perform knot tying with both hands and target detection/tagging with the proposed instrumentation. The results show that the wearable gaze-BCI instrumentation exhibited only marginal performance degradation in dual-tasking, with a decrease of 0.61 % (95 % CI: 0.10-1.11) in target classification accuracy (ACC), 1.00 bits/min (95 % CI: 0.13-1.88) in information transfer rate (ITR), and an increase of merely 0.39 % (95 % CI: -0.83-1.61) in false positive rate (FPR), compared to the single-tasking target detection. It suggests that the proposed instrumentation retains applicable in dual-tasking with high cognitive load demand. Moreover, the minor accuracy decrease of knot-tying task implies that target detection with the proposed instrumentation has little impact on accuracy of at-hand task. These findings reveal the potential of gaze-BCI as an extra hands-free non-verbal instrumentation for hands-occupied, while sustaining the performance of at-hand tasks."

    "abstract": "Wi-Fi networks are the foundation of contemporary communication, but they are still more susceptible to behavior- based intrusions that get past traditional signature driven defenses, jamming, spoofing, and data-theft attempts. A potent tool for simulating intricate wireless behavior and identifying irregularities that indicate malicious activity is machine learning (ML). This study suggests a framework for intelligent Wi-Fi intrusion-detection and prevention that integrates automated mitigation, packet-level analytics, and supervised and unsupervised learning. The system exhibits increased accuracy, fewer false alarms, and quicker detection response when using AWID, NSL-KDD, and custom Wi-Fi traffic. The framework is appropriate for real-time wireless protection since integrated analytics improve administrator visibility."

    "abstract": "Modern mobile systems, while increasingly interactive, face a critical challenge of slow UI responsiveness (SUR), negatively impacting user experience. The lack of comprehensive studies on SUR has limited the understanding of its root causes due to challenges in measuring these events across massive mobile devices. In this paper, it present the first large-scale, long-term measurement study on SUR using data from 47 million Android devices. The findings reveal key contributors to SUR from four perspectives: device hardware, operating system, application design, and app market dynamics. Notably, the largest root cause stems from “hogging” apps-applications that disproportionately consume system resources by exploiting Android's optimistic process management design. To address this issue, it proposes a remodeled Android process management framework that incorporates time-sensitive transitions and the actual behavior of processes. This optimization achieves a 60 % reduction in SUR occurrences while also saving 10.7 % of battery consumption, demonstrating significant real-world impact. The work provides valuable insights into enhancing mobile system performance and improving user satisfaction."

Neuroplasticity, the brain's capacity to reconfigure itself by establishing new neural connections, is essential for post-stroke recovery. It proposes a system incorporating DQN s to evaluate patient data and modify rehabilitation regimens in real time, optimizing engagement and efficacy. The model utilizes reinforcement learning to evaluate the effects of different therapy approaches on motor function recovery, enabling personalized treatment strategies. Findings indicate that the DQN-based strategy significantly enhances motor skill learning relative to conventional rehabilitation techniques. The results demonstrate that AI may significantly enhance neuroplasticity, improving stroke patients' recovery outcomes. It highlights the possibility of integrating modern machine learning methodologies with neurorehabilitation to enhance recovery methods and elevate the quality of life for stroke-affected persons. Future work will enhance the model and broaden its application across other patient demographics."

    "abstract": "T-wave and R-peak irregularities are indicative of electrophysiological abnormalities in the cardiac cycle. These irregularities are key markers in an electrocardiogram (ECG) as they suggest the presence of congestive heart failure (CHF). Specifically, these anomalies reflect altered ventricular repolarization and abnormalities in the depolarization process, which are characteristic of the impaired cardiac function seen in CHF patients. In this work, a deterministic algorithm was developed with the aim of providing a timely and rapid indication of the presence of the pathology, thus allowing early intervention. The algorithm is based on the analysis of features extracted from T-waves and R-peaks in the ECG. The algorithm was tested on two datasets: the Fantasia Database and the BIDMC Congestive Heart Failure Database. After a band-pass filtering (0.5-15 Hz), modified Pan-Tompkins were used to detect R-peaks even in leads where they were negative. Subsequently, T-waves were identified. R-peaks and T-waves amplitudes were used for discriminating healthy and pathological subjects. These features were compared in terms of percentage error (PE), confusion matrix was computed and derivative index, such as True Positive Rate (TPR), Positive Predictive Value (PPV) and Accuracy (ACC), were extracted from it. The T-wave amplitude emerged as the most effective feature achieving a classification accuracy of 100 %. The promising results achieved by the developed algorithm indicate a substantial advancement in early detection of the disease during its initial stage. In practical applications, this would allow timely intervention by a physician, thereby enhancing patient care and management."

Through dynamic modeling and physical tests, the control effects of BP-PID and traditional PID are compared, and the improvement of system response characteristics and performance is evaluated. The experimental results indicate that the BP-PID control algorithm has significant advantages in enhancing the stability and response speed of the ROV system. After optimization, Pitch stabilizes after approximately 40 iterations, with the steady-state error controlled at about 4° and the maximum deviation also at about 4°; Roll stabilizes after 55 iterations, with the steady-state error at about 2° and the maximum deviation at 17°; Yaw stabilizes after 50 iterations, with the steady-state error at about 10° and the maximum deviation at 13°. These data suggest that the optimized system shows a shorter adjustment time before reaching the steady state and a significantly reduced steady-state error. In terms of dynamic performance, the overshoot of the system optimized by BP-PID is significantly reduced, and the recovery time is shortened, demonstrating superior anti-interference ability and robustness."

However, the mechanism of commutation failure has not been fully studied or clearly defined. Therefore, this paper delves into the analysis of the characteristics of induction motor loads and explores their relationship with power system stability. Finally, based on the HYPERSIM platform, a regional AC-DC system model is constructed, and simulation analyses under different load conditions are conducted to reveal the impact of this phenomenon on system stability."

Despite the increasing reliance on retrieval-based architectures such as open-domain question answering and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), there remains limited empirical work comparing different chunking strategies in a systematic, task-specific manner. In this paper, we present a comprehensive comparative study of widely used chunking methods—fixed-size chunking, sentence-based chunking, recursive chunking and semantic similarity-based chunking—evaluated within the context of retrieval performance across diverse document types. We analyze each strategy across multiple metrics including Precision, Recall, MRR(Mean Reciprocal Rank), and chunking efficiency, emphasizing how performance varies significantly with the structural and semantic characteristics of different document types. Our findings high-light key trade-offs between retrieval accuracy and chunking granularity, revealing that while finer-grained semantic chunking often improves precision, it may also introduce computational overhead, especially in certain document types. These insights provide practical guidelines for developers and researchers building retrieval-centric NLP pipelines and lay the groundwork for future work on adaptive and task-aware chunking mechanisms."

The proposed method was trained and validated on a publicly available database, which was increased in the training partition by using five data augmentation operations.

Also, it reached a successful classification result of F1-score = 0.966 on the test set, suggesting good generalization and ensuring the proposed method's output. The comparison against two previously developed state-of-the-art methods highlighted the proposed method's superior performance with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve score of 0.99. The proposed method leveraged the transfer learning strategy to minimize the need for extensive image data in the model's training process and increased the deployment opportunities by implementing a lightweight and scalable classification scheme, which can be considered as a potential tool for classifying Culicoides species in the field."

Motion data were used for automatic TUG segmentation via a hybrid convolutional neural network and long-short-term-memory model, which also allows the alignment and extraction of EEG epochs corresponding to each trial. EEG workload was quantified using the task load index (TLI), that quantifies cognitive workload defined as the ratio of the power spectral density (PSD) in theta (4–8 Hz) and alpha (8–12 Hz) bands. The model allowed accurate TUG segmentation, with a root-mean-squared-error (RMSE) of 0.42 s and 0.36 s for STm and DT, respectively. On the other hand, EEG-based assessment found a significant effect of condition in TLI, suggesting an increased trend in mental workload during the DT condition, with greater values in DT compared to STc for all the outcomes. The planned inclusion of additional participants is expected to help draw more robust conclusions regarding cortical dynamics in PwMS during DT performance."

Indeed, experimental findings have shown that these gains have been achieved from an average of 70-85% using conventional signal thresholding methods to up to 100% using TinyML-based classification. This was achieved in detecting high-concentration ethanol (99.9%) and distilled water, while maintaining strong performance across other gas types and conditions. Specifically, the TinyML-based system has been shown to reduce alerting time by almost half and achieve a higher classification accuracy, which represents a substantial added value in emergency situations. The adaptive modelling also enables robust performance despite fluctuating environmental parameters, underlining the potential of Tiny ML as a key technology for improving safety in high-risk areas and paving the way for the next generation of intelligent PPE solutions."

    "abstract": "The fast deployment of 5G networks has enabled new opportunities for real-time applications for critical areas such as autonomous driving, remote surgery, industrial automation, and mission-critical Internet of Things (IoT). Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communication (URLLC) is one of the most challenging features of 5G, with the requirement of transmission reliability higher than 99.999% and latency less than 1 ms. This paper investigates a candidate design framework to enhance URLLC by employing edge computing with artificial intelligence (AI) based optimization strategies. The primary goal is to reduce the and packet loss without degrading services reliability under dynamic and congested network. In its focus on edge as the subject of study, this paper presupposes from distributed computing architectures structures in which the distance between the source of data and the computation is reduced both physically and logically. This offloading leads to decreased duration of transmissions and provides the possibility of a more context-aware control located closer to the UE. For these purposes we exploit AI methodologies like reinforcement learning and deep neural networks, to make resource allocation, spectrum management and even predictive traffic scheduling, adapt in real-time. These techniques lead to proactive booth adaptive and guaranteeing the URLLC performance in time evolutions of network demands with no bottlenecks of centralized coordination. Comparison and simulation results show that the proposed model achieves significant performance gains compared to the conventional centralized methods. The system reduces the latency by as much as 42% and increases the reliability by more than 30% in highly varied environment. The integration of AI in edge-based URLLC orchestration also becomes beneficial for predicting future failure scenarios and avoiding unnecessary resource reallocation for the service continuity. This work is part of the ongoing efforts to evolve intelligent 5GSs that will support real-time and safety critical communications on a massive scale. Finally, the theoretical URLLC standards are connected with practical deployment through edge intelligence (EI) and machine learning (ML) in this work. The results confirm that the combined services of edge computing and AI not only satisfy the highly demanding URLLC requirements, but they also exceed it. Such integrated treatment sets a foundation of future adaptive 6G networks and extends the practical possibility of delay-sensitive applications in real-life scenarios."

    "abstract": "Many types of maximum power point tracking (MPPT) algorithms along with MPPT devices are used to extract maximum power from Photovoltaic (PV) systems worldwide for various applications. Due to numerous reasons, there will be a more possibility to effect many number of PV modules in the system by partial shading conditions (PSCs). In generally Perturb and Observe (P&O) technique is regularly used to identify the maximum power point location (MPPL). Unfortunately generalized P&O technique cannot reach global MPPL under PSCs due to existence of multiple peaks. Under these circumstances, optimization methods must be incorporated to identify the global MPPL among many power point peaks. There are several optimization methods existing for the MPPT operation of PV system under PSCs. However, due to many concerns those methods are having their own limits. A novel methodology such as Botox Optimization Algorithm (BOA) is implemented in this paper for the MPPT application. A four strings connected PV system is considered in this paper. Regarding convert of MPPT device, a high step-up non-isolated de to de converter is utilized due to its features over conventional boost converter. The proposed method presented in this paper is compared with Modified Invasive Weed Optimization (MIWO), Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) and Grey Wolf Optimization (MGWO) methods. OPAL-RT modules are used to establish a Hardware - in the - Loop (HIL) for presenting realistic responses under various operating conditions."

By updating only 0.39% of model parameters, the system reduces GPU memory usage, training time, and storage needs while maintaining performance. Deployed via a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline linked to curated pharma datasets, the model supports domain-specific, context-aware decision-making. Applications include predicting patient responses in clinical trials, automating market intelligence from regulatory and financial documents, and optimizing supply chain operations through logistics forecasting. The framework incorporates data anonymization and differential privacy to ensure compliance and security. Experimental results show high accuracy in di-verse pharma tasks.

    "abstract": "It is a fact that the performance of deep convolutional networks in different image classification benchmarks is almost consistently at the highest level but retain the mystery of a black-box for both users and professionals working in the same field. Explanatory methods like LIME and SHAP, for instance, produce visual attributions (masks or heatmaps), indicating the areas of an image that have influenced the prediction the most; however, the saliency maps that come along with the diffusion are often not very intuitive for non-expert users and are even sometimes not visually appealing. The current study provides an extensive comparison of the two methods LIME and SHAP on CIFAR-10 dataset with a human-centered critique and, at the same time, presents a visual enhancement pipeline that converts attribution maps into object-centered explanations that are precise. Our pipeline finds the crucial area(s) in an attribution map, it draws an unobtrusive highlight and contour around the focal object and then it applies a controlled Gaussian blur to the remaining background areas in order to create a more perceptually focused effect. We evaluate the approaches from the perspectives of both technical aspects (fidelity, spread, computational cost) and human-centered criteria (clarity, perceived trust), and this evaluation will be conducted by means of a combination of quantitative experiments and a user study. The results show that LIME gives rise to attributions that are more sparse and localized and in many cases very closely matching to the object regions, while on the other hand, SHAP produces attributions that are smoother and more evenly distributed. Our enhancement pipeline notably increases the human interpretability of the two methods, as evidenced by the increase in the clarity and trust scores in the user evaluations, the discovery of a fidelity vs. interpretability trade-off at the same time, and so on."

    "abstract": "Wi-Fi Channel State Information (CSI) has become a widely studied modality for device-free sensing as it captures fine-grained wireless channel variations that can be mapped to human motion and presence while avoiding the explicit visual disclosure typical of vision-based systems. CSI-based pipelines have been explored for human activity and gesture recognition, fall detection, gait analysis, pose-related inference, and indoor localization. Despite strong results in controlled settings, practical deployment remains difficult due to measurement noise, sensitivity to environmental dynamics, multi-user interference, and system-level constraints in data acquisition and real-time processing. This article surveys machine learning methods forWi-Fi CSI sensing and analyzes more than 65 representative models, connecting algorithmic design choices with implementable end-to-end system design. We introduce a hierarchical taxonomy that organizes the literature into classical machine learning approaches, deep learning architectures, and hybrid strategies. Beyond modeling, we describe the full sensing pipeline- from hardware and network interface card (NIC) selection to software tools, antenna configuration, and signal conditioning- highlighting the design trade-offs that affect robustness and reproducibility. We further compare methods across major application domains and summarize open challenges in generalization to dynamic environments, multi-user separation, and resource-efficient inference. Finally, we outline research directions toward robust generalization, scalable deployment, and privacy-aware learning to support broader real-world adoption."

This study realizes autonomous positioning and deviation correction of UAV clusters by constructing a triangulation model of the points to be measured and known points to process the position signals emitted by UAVs in real time. And at the same time, according to the initial polar position of the UAV circular formation during a flight training exercise, the optimal scheme for adjusting the UAVs to the standard position is given based on the triangulation model and greedy algorithm and the accuracy and feasibility of the scheme are proved through the error analysis. The accuracy and feasibility of the program is proved by error analysis. This study provides a real-time localization and position adjustment scheme for UAV circular formation, which autonomously adjusts the UAV cluster that deviates from the orbit within 12 meters to an on-orbit circular formation with an error of less than 0.5 meters after 7 iterations, which is of great significance for the application of UAV clusters in actual flight."

    "abstract": "In the increasingly interconnected digital landscape, cybersecurity threats have become more pervasive, sophisticated, and difficult to detect. As enterprises continue to invest heavily in complex Security Operations Center (SOC) infrastructures, there remains a pressing need for accessible, modular, and educationally oriented cybersecurity toolkits for smaller organizations, independent researchers, and academic learners. Traditional SOC platforms often demand significant technical expertise, financial investment, and dedicated infrastructure, placing them out of reach for a large segment of potential users. This research introduces safe Watch, a lightweight, open-source SOC simulation toolkit that addresses these limitations by providing essential threat investigation capabilities in a simplified, modular format. safe Watch is implemented as a dual-interface platform, consisting of a Chrome browser extension and a standalone Tkinter-based desktop application, both interacting with a Python Flask backend. The toolkit allows users to perform critical cybersecurity tasks such as DNS resolution, WHOIS lookups, URL sanitization, and reputation checks via the VirusTotal API, with emphasis on local execution and offline capability where possible. Designed with educational and operational flexibility in mind, safeWatch aims to empower users with hands-on cybersecurity experience without the complexity of traditional enterprise systems. Through real-time observables analysis, modular scripting, and an intuitive user interface, the toolkit serves as an ideal bridge between theoretical cybersecurity knowledge and practical application. Furthermore, safe Watch's modular architecture supports future expansion, allowing new threat intelligence modules and scanning capabilities to be integrated easily. This paper details the technical architecture, implementation methodologies, and practical case studies evaluating safe Watch's usability and effectiveness. The findings demonstrate that safe Watch can serve not only as a learning platform for students but also as a lightweight investigative tool for smaller operational teams, thereby contributing to broader efforts to democratize cybersecurity resilience in an era of increasing cyber risk."

This paper introduces a novel privacy-preserving logistics framework based on Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) and key derivation mechanisms, enabling users to protect their real-world identities by leveraging digital identities. Through selective disclosure, users can reveal only the minimum necessary information to each party involved in the delivery chain. We propose a dynamic key derivation method to enforce and audit disclosure control throughout the process. The security of the design is formally verified, and performance simulations demonstrate that the system achieves acceptable operational efficiency."

To overcome these limitations, we develop a one-layer neural network specifically designed for this class of problems. The proposed method first transforms the fuzzy optimization model into an interval-valued one, which is then reformulated as a single-objective optimization problem by integrating the midpoint-radius transformation with a weighted-sum strategy. Based on the Karush-Kuhn- Tucker (KKT) conditions, a neurodynamic model is constructed, and its global convergence and Lyapunov stability are rigorously established. Numerical simulations are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed approach."

Behavioral indices further supported these findings, indicating reduced physical and neurocognitive status in older adults and greater responsiveness to multisensory stimulation in younger participants. These variations across frequency bands and behavioral dimensions reflect distinct PC responses and underline age-related neural and musculoskeletal changes affecting balance. This approach supports the identification of potential biomarkers and can be extended to neurological populations. These findings underscore the importance of age when designing interventions to assess and improve balance, and they may contribute to the early detection of age-related postural deficits."

The primary pathological manifestation is the partial or complete loss of voluntary muscle control on one side of the face. Accurate diagnosis and treatment require precise 3D reconstruction of the affected facial region. However, reconstructing 3D faces for patients with facial paralysis presents a significant challenge due to the complex geometry and subtle expression details of a paralyzed face. As a result, this problem has rarely been studied so far. To tackle this challenge, we propose a supervised learning-based 3D facial reconstruction method, called AsymFaceDeformNet (AFDN) in this study to generate a high-precision 3D shape for the 2D facial palsy image. AFDN employs a three-layer fully connected neural network as its core structure and can learn complex facial deformations and transformation relationships to model latent shape variations. It is designed to accurately restore the 3D facial structure of patients with facial paralysis. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments validate the effectiveness and rationality of the proposed method."

In this study, we scrutinized how effectively various machine learning models can distinguish between people with Alzheimer's and those who don't have the disease, by using details about their health and daily habits. We examined five different models: Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest (RF), and Gaussian Naive Bayes, all using data from Kaggle. Among these, the Random Forest model-based experiment provided the best results, followed by SVM and Logistic Regression, which also performed well. Research-based results show that machine learning can help doctors diagnose AD more easily and at a lower cost, especially in areas where modern technology-based scans are not available.

    "abstract": "Tech agencies and scholars often use the term ‘autonomy' to describe conversational agents such as ChatGPT, Claude, and Llama. However, this term is borrowed from human characteristics—such as self-awareness, intentionality, and independent decision-making—that are not inherently present in AI systems. While, to some extent, these agents can perform tasks without direct human intervention, their actions are governed by predefined algorithms, training data, and probabilistic models rather than genuine self-directed reasoning. While tech companies are striving to develop fully autonomous agents, they often overlook the societal acceptance of different levels of autonomy. In this study, we aim to discuss the differentiation between human autonomy and AI autonomy, as well as the limitations in AI agents' autonomy, and why these AI agents cannot be called autonomous like humans. Our purpose is to raise scholars' awareness of the need to differentiate between human and AI autonomy."

    "abstract": "Although beamforming design enables port-starboard discrimination to some extent, it performs poorly under low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions and exhibits low port-starboard suppression, leading to potential misclassification. To address the challenge of port-starboard discrimination in underwater acoustic detection using dual linear arrays, this paper proposes a novel discrimination algorithm based on dual linear array processing. The proposed algorithm first utilizes the Linearly Constrained Minimum Variance (LCMV) criterion to construct a beamforming vector and calculate the spatial spectrum of the received data, thereby obtaining a coarse estimation of the target's azimuth. Building on the beamforming process, we construct a dictionary matrix to establish the relationship between the spatial spectrum and the spatial power distribution vector. Furthermore, to mitigate the impact of sidelobes in the spatial spectrum, we design a set of projection operators to process the spatial spectrum and dictionary matrix, thereby obtaining a cleaner spatial relationship. In addition, to enhance numerical stability, we incorporate a regularization term into the objective function using the noise subspace. Simulations and experimental demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves an exceptionally high port-starboard suppression ratio and superior azimuth resolution capability."

    "abstract": "Fifth generation of communication networks (5G) optoelectronic devices provide leapfrogging speed, latency and connectivity that are required for a variety of applications, such as smart cities, autonomous vehicles, and massive IoT ecosystems. Nonetheless, this development is also an alleged growing complexity of emerging threats, such as identity spoon, data manipulation, denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, or user privacy violation. Legacy cloud-centric security models are being complemented by localized security processing at the edge and individual cells, in part due to the fact that 5G is a distributed architecture with heavy reliance at the edge and on end user devices. In this study, we combat the emerging security challenges in 5G networks through a blockchain enhanced authentication framework with FL to provide secure access. The decentralized, immutable, and transparent property of blockchain is promising to protect identity verification, session integrity, and transaction logs in distributed 5G scenarios. Authentication requests are handled through smart contracts to maintain verifiability in a decentralized manner so that there are no single-point-of-failure risks. At the same time, federated learning is a privacy-preserving machine learning paradigm for the edge devices and UEs to collaboratively train on threat patterns without leaking raw data. This method enables sensitive feature information to be kept locally and to simultaneously to corporately improve defense capability of the whole system against new attacks. With the combination of FL and blockchain, the proposed model improves inaccurate threat detection, ensures safe authentication, and maintains the privacy of user data. We develop a comprehensive threat taxonomy to classify threats in 5G, where both inter-slice isolation attack, rogue gNodeB registration, and adversarial AI-based intrusion, and signaling storm are part of this taxonomy. The framework is verified on a simulation platform simulating a multi-slice 5G network and yields improved results for authentication latency, data privacy, and anomaly detection. By 35% faster validation time and 28% better anomaly detection than traditional authentication systems, hybrid model surpasses the traditional models. This study presents important progress towards a secure, distributed architecture for next-generation networks. The paper shows that how blockchain and federated learning could work together to resolve the key problems of the 5G security without compromising performance and privacy. This integration based on those methods provides a solution that looks ahead to an even future, from ultra-dense and hyper-dynamic communications that supports various ultra-dense and hyper-dynamic, cyber threat landscapes and future 6G deployment."

    "abstract": "Cloud Computing platforms, such as Kubernetes, provide elastic resource provisioning in a highly flexible and efficient manner. Its autoscaling capability dynamically deploys or terminates computational units called pods. The process is commonly referred to as horizontal pod autoscaling (HPA), which triggers pod scaling based on monitored performance metrics. While many studies have demonstrated that HPA can adjust resources according to workloads automatically, existing approaches generally omit the consideration of service-level agreements (SLAs) in autoscaling. The purpose of an SLA is to define a certain level of service that is expected from a supplier and serve as an significant factor for users when selecting service providers. This work proposes a DRL-based autoscaler, namely DRL-KubeScale, to optimize resource allocation for Kubernetes deployments with SLA-awareness. It employs continuous deep Q-learning with state space defined on pod-level metrics and CPU allocation and follows a Markov choice process (MDP) model to determine real-time scaling of pods. DRL-KubeScale is implemented on a prototype system and evaluated under a set of benchmark scenarios with widely used metric types. Testing results found that DRL-KubeScale exceed baseline approaches in terms of autoscaling efficiency and SLA satisfaction."

The dataset initially had 7,000 images, we augmented it to 13,500 images to make the model more generalize. We used binary classification approach with 70% of the dataset for the training and 30% for the testing. The results show the model's performance, it achieved 82% accuracy with good precision and recall. We used data augmentation, batch normalization and dropout regularization to optimize the performance.

    "abstract": "Fulfilling the science goals of the Simons Observatory, a state-of-the-art cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiment, has required deploying tens of thousands of superconducting bolometers. Reading out data from the observatory's more than 67,000 transition-edge sensor (TES) detectors while maintaining cryogenic conditions requires an effective multiplexing scheme. The SLAC microresonator radio frequency (SMuRF) electronics have been developed to provide the warm electronics for a high-density microwave frequency multiplexing readout system, and this system has been shown to achieve multiplexing factors on the order of 1,000. SMuRF has recently been deployed to the Simons Observatory, which is located at 5,200 m on Cerro Toco in Chile's Atacama Desert. As the SMuRF system is exposed to the desert's diurnal temperature swings, resulting phase drift in RF transmission lines may introduce a systematic signal contamination. We present studies of phase drift in the room-temperature RF lines of the Simons Observatory's 6 m large-aperture telescope, which hosts the largest deployment to date of TES microwave frequency multiplexing to a single telescope. We show that these phase drifts occur on time scales which are significantly longer than sky scanning, and that their contribution to on-sky in-transition detector noise is within the readout noise budget."

First, security is often achieved at the expense of visibility, which is incompatible with cloud service scenarios such as information preview and search. Second, there is a lack of design for hierarchical visual privacy for users with different security levels. For the above problems, a multi-level key mechanism is designed and integrated with the YoloV5 network, providing not only multi-level privacy protection for sensitive regions but also achieving a balance between visibility and security in these regions. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework can decrypt images with multi-level visual effects. Performance analysis shows that the framework achieves an adjustable balance between visibility and security, which users can modify by adjusting parameters. Compared to other visibility-security trade-off schemes, this approach offers advantages including strong reversibility, high image size compatibility, adjustable visual effects, and computational efficiency."

    "abstract": "Wind energy based electric power conversion models are popular in many places to produce electricity for various customers. Among many models, Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generator (PMSG) coupled wind energy conversion systems are attracting and utilized for many applications, especially under medium power ranges. In order to harvest maximum energy from wind turbine under every operating condition, a Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) device must be used. An efficient MPPT approach, controller and a power converter will be parts in MPPT device. Usually many converters especially DC to DC converters are used as a MPPT converter. But unfortunately they are suffering from lack of high gain which is unable to produce sufficient output especially under low wind speeds. Hence, a switched-capacitor based high gain non-isolated DC to DC step up converter is implemented in this paper to utilized as a MPPT converter. Further, two end control methodology is developed to regulate both voltage and current to achieve a fast response during the harvesting maximum power. The Perturb and Observe (P&O) algorithm is incorporated to the proposed control methodology. The proposed model can work effectively during lower wind speeds also due to its ability of high step-up gain. Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) is executed through the utilization of two OPAL-RT modules to demonstrate multiple responses of the suggested model across different operating scenarios."

E2Net extends the dual-network framework by integrating multiple fast learners and a single slow learner to improve predictive accuracy and generalization.

    "abstract": "Wireless network security is fundamentally based on encryption and authentication mechanisms that prevent unauthorized access to data and network resources. Among these, the Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) family of protocols, specifically WPA2 and its successor WPA3, are widely adopted standards designed to secure wireless communications through robust encryption and key-exchange methods. This study presents a practical evaluation of WPA2 and WPA3 against dictionary-based brute-force attacks using weak or common passwords. The experimental phase involved configuring two wireless networks under WPA2-Personal and WPA3-Personal security standards. For WPA2, Aircrack-ng and Hashcat were used to capture the four-way handshake and perform offline dictionary attacks. For WPA3, due to its resistance to offline attacks through the SAE protocol (Simultaneous Authentication of Equals), real-time attacks were conducted using Wacker. All experiments were carried out in a controlled Rocky Linux environment, recording key metrics such as cracking time and attack success rate. The results show that while WPA3 provides greater resistance to offline attacks, it remains vulnerable when weak passwords are used. These findings highlight the importance of proper credential management, even when modern security protocols are in place."

This paper suggests a hybrid model to address these limitations in load forecasting. First, the Complete Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition with Adaptive Noise (CEEMDAN) technique decomposes complex power load data into sub-series at diverse frequencies, mitigating mode mixing. Subsequently, the Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) model is leveraged to capture the long-term dependencies dynamic changes in power load. To overcome the limitations of BiLSTM in capturing complex coupling relationships, the Self-Attention mechanism strengthens the model's capacity to capture intricate temporal dependencies. Furthermore, a two-stage hyperparameter optimization algorithm, combining the Sparrow Search Algorithm (SSA) and Bayesian optimization, fine-tunes the hybrid model's hyperparameters. The proposed BASSA- CEEMDAN-BiLSTM-Self-Attention model is applied to a power load dataset from a southern power plant for validation. Experimental results demonstrate that the model achieves high accuracy on the training data, exhibits minimal prediction errors, and explains 98.3% of the data variability, demonstrating its strong predictive capabilities. Compared to other models, it improves R2 by 6.9%-33.4%, reduces RMSE by 33.7%-58.4%, and decreases MAE by 29.2%-62.4%, highlighting its advantages in accuracy and error reduction."

These networks are increasingly targeted by physical-layer attacks, particularly radio frequency (RF) jamming, which can disrupt safety-critical transmissions. However, the development of effective intrusion detection systems (IDS) is hindered by the limited availability of high-quality RF jamming data. Data collection is constrained by hardware complexity, legal restrictions, and environmental variability. To address this challenge, we propose a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CGAN) model for synthetic RF signal generation at <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$15 \\mathrm{m} / \\mathrm{s}$</tex> and <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$25 \\mathrm{m} / \\mathrm{s}$</tex> speeds.

We rigorously evaluate the generated data using Fréchet Inception Distance (FID), Kernel Density Estimation (KDE), and detailed statistical comparisons including mean, standard deviation, and percentile analysis. Results demonstrate that the CGAN-generated signals from our GRU-based generator closely replicate real jamming data, significantly improving IDS performance, especially when leveraging an LSTM-based discriminator.

Experiments using a leader-follower pair provide preliminary validation of core platooning functionalities, including lane detection, lane keeping, and control of intervehicle distance using layered PID controllers. Furthermore, the tested scenario leverages inter-vehicle communication for reference velocity sharing, as a way to improve safety in scenarios where sensor reliability is degraded, like when the cars move along curved paths. Availability of a high-performance embedded computing unit in each robot facilitates deployment and testing of sophisticated software stacks for perception, control, and communication.

    "abstract": "This study presents a state-of-the-art deep learning method for accurately identifying and classifying bone health states (normal, osteopenia, and osteoporosis) using knee X-ray images. Modern Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models (e.g., EfficientNetV2B3, ResNet152V2, and VGG19) are evaluated in detail in this study by means of transfer learning applied to the ImageNet dataset. An innovative feature fusion method is developed based on this research. It involves merging the features of the two top-performing pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and feeding them into a custom-built, fully-connected classification network. This fusion aims to increase significantly overall diagnostic accuracy and resilience by utilizing the complementary strengths of various architectures. The robust workflow includes careful image preprocessing, efficient class balancing, powerful regularization techniques (batch normalization, dropout, and advanced data augmentation), and an ideal learning rate schedule. Most importantly, by locating clinically significant areas in the X-ray images, Explainable AI (XAI) techniques—particularly Grad-CAM—are incorporated to visualize and explain the models' decision-making processes. According to experimental results, the suggested feature fusion model performs better than single models, providing a more precise and understandable multi-class osteoporosis diagnostic tool for knee X-ray images. In the treatment of osteoporosis, this tool can greatly enhance early diagnosis and patient outcomes."

The poem, which juxtaposes the caged existence of a tiger with its natural, untamed habitat, evokes a range of emotional undertones such as confinement, helplessness, and suppressed power. Through this comparison, we aim to evaluate how accurately AI algorithms can detect and interpret these nuanced emotional cues relative to human interpretation. The analysis highlights differences in contextual understanding, emotional depth, and thematic sensitivity, revealing both the strengths and limitations of artificial intelligence in literary sentiment analysis. Ultimately, the study provides insights into the potential for AI tools to assist, rather than replace, human literary analysis. We develop a mathematical framework to compare both the analysis. Further, we use weighted sentiments also in order to get a more deeper insight. We show the comparison by plotting the confusion matrix and accuracy."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a simplified optimization framework that uses a random search (RS) strategy for the optimal placement and sizing of fixed-step capacitor banks in distribution systems. The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model, combining discrete capacitor allocation decisions with nonlinear and non-convex power flow equations. Despite the model's complexity, the proposed RS algorithm efficiently explores the feasible solution space without the need for complex metaheuristic operators or parameter tuning. The optimization objective involves minimizing the total net present value of energy losses and investment-related costs over a multi-year planning horizon. Numerical validations conducted on the IEEE 33-bus distribution network—in both its radial and meshed configurations—demonstrate that the RS approach yields competitive cost reductions (up to 13.85%) when compared to more advanced metaheuristics. The results validate the potential of structured random sampling for practical, lowcomplexity applications in planning reactive power compensation."

An intuitive human-computer interaction interface is designed to enable pilots to quickly and accurately obtain key flight parameters in complex dynamic environments. In order to verify the effectiveness of the system, this paper selects typical flight scenarios, uses the Kalman filter to perform real-time filtering processing on flight parameters such as flight speed, position, and altitude, collects accurate simulation data, and evaluates the performance of the system in different environments. The simulation results show that under a variety of complex flight conditions, the system can effectively reduce information delays and improve the accuracy of the situation information provided by more than 15%. Especially in the emergency simulation test, the system significantly improves the pilot's perception of the flight status and the speed of decision-making response, achieving the expected optimization goals."

Twelve healthy adults were recruited to complete either a single-session trial or a five-session trial. Each session involved a neurofeedback protocol based on the P300 event-related potential (ERP), with cognitive performance assessed using a Random Dot Motion (RDM) task before and after training. The single-session trial demonstrated high feasibility and acceptability, with a full recruitment rate and an 8 % drop-out rate. Significant improvements in reaction time were observed post-training, and over 72 % of participants showed enhanced ERPs separability, particularly in P300 amplitude and reduced non-target responses during feedback. The five-session trial showed a 25 % drop-out rate but faced low recruitment (33 %), highlighting the challenge of sustaining participant engagement over time. Although positive trends in performance were observed, ERP changes across sessions were inconsistent, likely due to the small sample size for the long-term trial <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$(\\mathrm{n}=3)$</tex>.

    "abstract": "Recent studies, such as TongueNet and OpenTCM, have explored the application of multi-modal information, including images and text, in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) diagnostics. However, two major challenges remain: (1) the cross-domain acquisition of diverse Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system structures to bridge users' colloquial descriptions with formal medical terminology, and (2) the semantic fusion of these acquired structures to enable precise alignment of multimodal semantics, which is essential in high-stakes domains such as healthcare. To address these challenges, we propose a “Semantic Fusion Agent,” a versatile intermediate component that bridges users' multimodal inputs (e.g., speech, tongue images, and pulse signals) with downstream RAG retrieval systems. This agent understands the structural requirements of target RAG systems across domains and transforms user inputs into structured semantic representations compatible with diverse knowledge base formats. In this way, the agent enhances the transparency of medical terminology by automatically generating accessible explanations, thereby improving user comprehension and trust. It also supports cross-domain semantic translation (e.g., from TCM to Western medicine or psychological diagnostics). The primary contribution of this work is the introduction of a structured semantic fusion mechanism that significantly improves the retrieval precision and structured-generation quality of RAG systems in diagnostic scenarios; we do not claim clinical diagnostic accuracy."

This study explores the use of virtual reality (VR) as a distraction tool, combined with biosignal monitoring. Electro-dermal activity and heart rate variability (HRV) were recorded using wearable devices on four pregnant women. The acquisition protocol was divided into three phases: before, during, and after VR exposure. To complement the physiological data, the Visual Analog Scale was administered before and after each session. Participants were also asked to evaluate how effective they found the experimental treatment in helping them relax during labor, using a 1 to 10 scale. Results showed reduced sympathetic activity during VR, indicated by lower skin conductance and HRV features (heart rate and low-frequency/high-frequency ratio), suggesting a calming effect. In addition, participants manifested a 55.72% reduction in perceived anxiety and expressed positive appreciation for the VR treatment. Ongoing data collection will allow for deeper investigation of these trends, enabling more detailed analyses during individual contractions and facilitating correlation with subjective questionnaire responses. These findings highlight the potential of VR as a non-invasive, personalized approach to managing labor pain."

Traditional data retrieval and visualization methods often struggle to manage the scale, heterogeneity, and complexity of multi-source datasets such as temperature, salinity, and biogeochemical parameters stored in NetCDF formats. This study introduces FloatChat, an AI-powered conversational interface designed to simplify Argo data discovery and visualization through natural language interaction. By combining Large Language Models (LLMs) with semantic search and geospatial analytics, the system enables scientists and policymakers to query, analyze, and visualize ocean data intuitively. The framework supports realtime data interpretation and adaptive visualization, promoting inclusive access for both experts and non-specialists. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system improves data retrieval accuracy and reduces exploration time compared to conventional interfaces. Findings indicate that integrating AI-driven conversation with ocean data systems enhances user engagement, fosters better scientific understanding, and accelerates data-driven decision-making in ocean monitoring and climate research."

    "abstract": "Quantum computing and machine learning (QML) have emerged as a revolutionary per approach to solve complex computational problems that classical systems are unable to. The use of superposition, entanglement, and quantum parallelism helps analyze data up to ten times faster than in a non-quantum manner, enhancing optimization, pattern identification, and computational efficiency. This paper studies the potential of quantum algorithms and machine learning in areas of categorization, grouping, and regression in banking, healthcare, cybersecurity, and scientific simulations. QML shines when it comes to generalizing low cost over high-dimensional data spaces. State-of-theart quantum-enhanced algorithms (QSVMs, VQCs, QBMs) yield better solutions to complex pattern recognition problems. Quantum-inspired neural networks accelerate deep learning architectures by optimizing gradient descent and decreasing training periods. The following research explores how QML enables a potentially computationally efficient solution to combinatorial optimization problems in the realms of logistics, cryptography, and artificial intelligence through quantum annealing and hybrid quantumclassical models. QML is still not able to deploy for the hardware limitations, noise sensitive nature, and quantum decoherence, despite promising results. The study underscores the importance of error correction procedures, as well as noise-resilient quantum circuits, and ultimately their scaling to full computers to reconcile theoretical promise with real-world application. It explores the ability of hybrid quantum-classical models to provide near-term developed applications as a bridge to realizable quantum computation. In this article, researchers present a thorough overview of quantum algorithms, reduced computational complexity, and practical applications, furthering the field of quantumenhanced machine learning. Industries might be revolutionized with quantum computers and AI-based decision-making systems working together with unprecedented computational power. In particular, quantum algorithms, hardware, and quantum cloud computing platforms must be a research focus area to ensure that quantum will deliver the most significant advances in AI."

    "abstract": "Given the vast expanses of bare soil and sparse grassland in the Central and Western Tibetan Plateau (CWTP), the duration of precipitation serves as a critical control on key hydrological and geomorphological responses, such as runoff generation, soil erosion, and sediment transport. This study analyzes the spatial distribution of precipitation events with different durations (short-duration, medium-duration, and long-duration) across the Tibetan Plateau (TP). To explore the differences in precipitation duration between the central-western and eastern TP, we utilize hourly precipitation data from a newly established cross-sectional rainfall observation network (53 gauges) on the CWTP and the China Meteorological Administration (CMA) observation (145 gauges) on the eastern TP for comparison. The main conclusions are as follows: (1) Short-duration (1-3 hours) precipitation events contribute more than 50% of the total rainfall in the CWTP. In contrast, short-duration events contribute less than 30% in the eastern TP, where medium- and long-duration precipitation events dominate. (2) The reanalysis data ERA5 and the high-resolution atmospheric simulation data HAR2 tend to systematically underestimate (overestimate) the contribution of short-duration (long-duration) precipitation events. Specifically, they exhibit mean biases of 23% and 19% for short-duration precipitation, and 34% and 20% for long-duration precipitation, respectively. (3) The satellite remote sensing precipitation data IMERG perform well in estimating the contribution of precipitation events, with biases mostly within 30%. By comparing the original and gauge-calibrated satellite datasets, the results show that calibration with coarse temporal resolutions (daily or monthly) does not necessarily improve the identification of short-duration precipitation events. Our results not only enhance the understanding of precipitation characteristics and processes over the Tibetan Plateau, but also provide valuable guidance for hydrological modeling and the evaluation and improvement of satellite-based precipitation data."

    "abstract": "In predictive maintenance (PdM) applications, sensor signals are often affected by various forms of noise that can degrade model accuracy and reliability. While many studies use Gaussian noise to simulate environmental disturbances, real-world sensor data is typically impacted by a broader range of noise types, including impulsive, frequency-dependent, and drift-based distortions. This paper presents a modular noise injection framework designed to augment PdM datasets with diverse synthetic and measured noise signals. The framework simulates realistic sensor and system-level disturbances and is evaluated on vibration data from an online shaft monitoring test stand. We assess the impact of noise-based augmentation on both limited and comprehensive datasets using six machine learning models. Results demonstrate that properly designed noise injection can substantially enhance model robustness and performance, particularly in data-constrained settings. Notably, we observed that models trained on raw time-domain data, while offering greater potential for learning rich signal characteristics, also exhibit higher sensitivity to aggressive augmentation. Our findings highlight the importance of carefully tuning noise augmentation strategies to match the measurement context and model architecture."

    "abstract": "Untethered magnetic devices (UMDs) hold significant clinical potential for removing blood clots. However, in the complex intravascular environment, their locomotion may be disturbed. Such disturbances can lead to variations in the magnetic gradient force exerted on the UMD, increasing the risk of vascular damage. Therefore, evaluating the magnetic gradient force acting on the UMD under worst-case conditions is essential for risk mitigation. In this paper, we propose a novel method to estimate the upper and lower bounds of the worst-case magnetic gradient force acting on the UMD, with actuation provided by two synchronized rotating magnetic dipoles. To assess the robustness of the algorithm, we conducted a Monte Carlo simulation in which the dipole directions of the two synchronized rotating magnetic dipoles and the dipole direction of the UMD were randomly varied 1000,000 times in the three-dimensional (3D) space to simulate all possible scenarios that may be encountered by the UMD in intravascular environments. The simulation results indicate that the worst-case magnetic gradient force remains below the upper bound predicted by the proposed algorithm, thereby validating its effectiveness."

In these situations, getting timely medical help can make a life-saving difference. This paper introduces PulseAid, a mobile app designed to automatically detect car crashes using the sensors already built into most smartphones, such as accelerometers, gyroscopes, and microphones. PulseAid uses a clever, step-by-step approach to detect when a crash may have occurred: monitoring for abrupt jolts, abrupt turns, and unusual movements. If it detects something serious, it acts immediately. The app immediately contacts emergency contacts via multiple communication methods, ensuring someone knows you may need assistance and can act quickly. At the same time, it pulls up real-time information about nearby hospitals-showing their exact location, the kind of care they offer, whether they're equipped for trauma cases, and how crowded their emergency rooms are-so you can get the right help as quickly as possible. The app is powered by an intelligent hospital database with geospatial indexing, which helps it quickly find the most suitable hospital based on various factors. In real-world tests, PulseAid successfully identified crash events with 92<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">%</sup> sensitivity and 94% specificity.

The major research goal is to come up with and test a real-time AI-powered anomaly detection system that will accurately detect and block potential financial fraud without incurring a high rate of false positive detections. Our approach comprises the integration of ensemble machine learning, such as Isolation Forest, LSTM neural networks, as well as gradient boosting algorithms along with real time streaming, Apache Kafka and distributed computing systems. A large transaction dataset with more than 2.5 million entries, including simulated fraud trends and actual transactions was used to test the system. Experimental results shown assert that the proposed system obtained 97.3% accuracy, 94.2% recall, and 93.8% precision in fraud detection with an average of 1.2 seconds in detecting fraud per transaction. The system shows much better results than investing in the known rule based systems or separate machine learning models, resulting in the decease of false positive rates by 40% in comparison with the currently available interventions. This study would not only help move financial security systems one step further but allow it to create the framework of real-time fraud prevention that could be applied in different financial institutions and with different types of transactions."

    "abstract": "This paper introduces an advanced architectural framework integrating Virtual Reality, Artificial Intelligence, and sophisticated 3D reconstruction techniques. The architecture employs photogrammetry and terrestrial laser scanning to generate highly detailed and realistic virtual environments, providing seamless interaction through natural language commands. Central to the system is a conversational AI assistant powered by a locally hosted Large Language Model (LLM), enhanced by a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture, which ensures precise and contextually coherent responses. As a practical demonstration, the architecture is applied to digitally explore three historically significant rock churches in Matera, Italy. These churches feature intricate architectural and morphological characteristics such as steep terrain, narrow entrances, and uneven surfaces, which are meticulously reconstructed using Unreal Engine to create immersive, high-fidelity virtual representations. The system infrastructure is local, ensuring minimal latency and robust data privacy. The conversational AI component was rigorously evaluated through heritage-specific queries using RAG Assessment (RAGAS) metrics, including Context Precision, Entity Recall, and Faithfulness. The results confirm the system's robust performance and effectiveness, highlighting its capability to accurately convey detailed architectural and cultural knowledge. This approach demonstrates the considerable potential of integrating conversational AI and eXtended Reality technologies in detailed virtual explorations of complex heritage sites."

    "abstract": "Portfolio optimization remains a critical challenge in modern investment management, particularly as traditional methods like Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) and Value at Risk (VaR) show limitations in addressing complex, multi-dimensional investment objectives. This paper presents a novel approach to portfolio optimization using genetic algorithms (GAs), designed to overcome the constraints of conventional optimization methods while accommodating diverse investor preferences and market conditions. Our methodology implements a flexible, multi-factor optimization framework that processes multiple input parameters, including but not limited to asset prices, volatility, correlations, sustainability ratings, and regional preferences. The system employs a fitness score calculation mechanism that aggregates weighted factors across three primary categories: risk/return metrics, portfolio constraints, and asset characteristics. Through extensive validation testing across 8,000 different test cases, our GA-based approach demonstrated an average 30% improvement in portfolio fitness scores compared to initial portfolios. Notable results include successful optimization of sustainability-focused portfolios, with targeted allocations achieving 60.4% median weighting for sustainable assets when specified. The framework's ability to handle multiple objectives while maintaining computational efficiency (8–10 second response time) represents a significant advancement in personalized portfolio management. Our findings (accuracy of 91%, AUC score of 92%, and Log loss of 0.27) suggest that genetic algorithms offer a more robust and adaptable approach to portfolio optimization compared to traditional methods, particularly in addressing the growing demand for personalized investment solutions and specialized investment criteria such as ESG considerations."

Specifically, these concerns derive from the inherent nature of datasets, which often hold confidential information. Even with stringent safeguards in place, the formidable processing capabilities of ML algorithms can inadvertently lead to the identification of individuals or, in the most severe scenarios, catas-trophic data breaches. In this work, we delve into the capabilities of the cryptography library ConcreteML, a groundbreaking tool designed to uphold privacy throughout the ML training by harnessing the power of Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE). Moreover, through a series of rigorous experiments, we explore the delicate balance between privacy preservation and data utility using real-world datasets. Our findings reveal that ConcreteML not only maintains robust privacy protections but also delivers encouraging results in terms of data utility, striking an impressive balance that showcases its potential in safeguarding sensitive information while maximizing analytical insights."

The experimental results show that the proposed protection system is significantly superior to traditional methods in terms of accuracy, response speed and anti-attack capability. Specifically, the attack detection accuracy rate is increased by 20%, the response time is reduced by 15%, and the anti-attack capability is improved by 18%.

Based on the periodic nonlinear noise (PNN) method, fractional spurs caused by the loop nonlinearity can be predicted if the nonlinearity model and the probability mass function (PMF) of the divider controller are confirmed. We demonstrate that the divider controller with an ideal bimodal PMF distribution inherently suppresses fractional spurs induced by the piecewise linear (PWL) nonlinearity. The proposed divider controller exhibits great improvement in suppression capability under PWL nonlinearity compared to the conventional MASH-SR scheme. To achieve this, the PMF of the MASH-SR is analytically derived to characterize spurs, and the state transition matrices are systematically optimized to approximate the bimodal distribution. Simulations demonstrate a 17-dB improvement in fractional spurs. To further reduce the fractional spurs, charge-pump(CP) bleed calibration and multimodulus divider (MMD) step reduction are employed herein.

This paper introduces a novel quantum-inspired algorithm for GRL, utilizing hybrid Quantum-Classical Walks to overcome these limitations. Our approach combines the benefits of both quantum and classical dynamics, allowing the walker to simultaneously explore both highly local and far-reaching connections within the graph. Preliminary results for a case study in network community detection shows that this hybrid dynamic enables the algorithm to adapt effectively to complex graph topologies, offering a robust and versatile solution for GRL tasks."

    "abstract": "Induction motor drives are grabbing attention from many researchers due to its features and applications. Among many available control methods of the induction motor drives, Direct Torque Control (DTC) is a powerful technique and it is having a wide range of applications in industries. In the conventional DTC method, only one controller is utilized to obtain reference torque where reference flux becomes constant. Hence, speed control of induction motor under DTC having its limitation on flux region. Consequently, a second controller is included in this paper to manage the flux by generating a reference flux derived from the discrepancy between the motor speed and its reference. However, conventional PI or PID controllers are unable to deliver its output effectively under rapid variations in the system. Hence, Fractional Order Proportional-Integral-Derivative (FOPID) controllers are incorporated in the proposed DTC method where utilized two FOPID controllers to regulate both torque and flux simultaneously. Further, Space Vector Pulse Width Modulation (SVPWM) is also included in the proposed control method to produce accurate and instant pulses for achieving accurate responses. In this study, the inverter is utilized with two FOPID controllers alongside the SVPWM technique. The proposed control method can effectively minimize ripples in both flux and torque. OPAL-RT modules based Hardware - in the - Loop (HIL) system is developed for presenting various outcomes to enhance the presented control."

In this paper, an intelligent inspection method based on the YOLOv10 algorithm for X-ray images of transmission line clamps is proposed and applied to the UAV platform to improve the inspection efficiency. The method focuses on the typical crimping defect characteristics of tension-resistant wire clips, has good detection accuracy, and significantly reduces the manual intervention and workload.

This architecture as opposed to conventional ones designs the encoding stacks to deploy based on the priorities of various domains; military communications, medical data protection, digital watermarking, secure journalism, forensic storage, and covert social messaging included. Evaluation of the framework is done on three types of lossless images, TIFF, BMP, and PNG with 14 technical measures of visual fidelity, capacity, and robustness points. The stego images are evaluated regarding its adaptability to detection by the classical models of machine learning as well as lightweight deep learning models.

Accurately characterizing the MNP’s magnetization dynamics dominated by Brownian relaxation is crucial for achieving high-precision temperature estimation. However, the lack of a readily applicable analytical expression remains a major obstacle to the advancement of magnetic nanoparticle hyperthermia (MNPH). In this paper, the perturbation method was applied to derive analytical expressions from the Fokker-Planck equation, which characterized MNP’s magnetization behaviors under the AC and DC magnetic fields. Numerical simulations were conducted to validate the accuracy of the analytical expressions and to explore the correlation between temperature and the magnetization. Then, a temperature analysis model based on magnetization harmonics was constructed. The first to second harmonic ratios and first harmonic phases were used to calculate MNP’s temperature, respectively. The experimental results demonstrate that within 310 K to 320 K, the estimation error of the temperature using the amplitude ratio of the first to second harmonics is below 0.02 K, while the error using the first harmonic phase is below 0.03 K. The derived analytical expressions are expected to enhance the accuracy of MNP temperature measurements and facilitate their broader applications in MNPH and MNP imaging."

In this paper, we propose a method, based on eye tracking, to easily process RGB videos captured with widely used devices (like smartphones and tablets) to recognize horizontal nystagmus and its direction. The proposed pipeline is designed to work in flexible conditions, without requiring specific recording configurations. We train and evaluate the system on real videos and report an AUROC of 88.7% for nystagmus detection and 76.5% for direction classification.

Firstly, it describes the technical foundation of large-scale language models, including the mainstream architectures such as Transformer architecture and multi-head attention mechanism, as well as the training process based on large-scale text corpus with common algorithms and parameter tuning. Then, we describe in detail the process of automated interpretation of classical Marxist literature, covering the pre-processing of literature, such as text cleaning and annotation, as well as the steps of understanding and interpretation generation after inputting into the model, and take the chapter of Capital as an example to show the actual effect. Subsequently, it is critically analyzed, pointing out that there are problems of understanding bias and misinterpretation when dealing with technical terms and complex concepts, and the lack of historical background understanding, one-sidedness due to the influence of data statistics, and the risk of over-reliance and misinformation dissemination. In order to address these problems, we propose to introduce domain knowledge fine-tuning model and combine historical and cultural databases as improvement strategies. The study shows that although there are limitations at present, with the development of technology, large-scale language models are expected to bring new opportunities and breakthroughs for Marxist theory research and promote its innovative development."

Although continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems may alert the patient of impending high or low glucose levels, they still lack efficient and specific algorithms enabling a safe hypoglycemia prediction prior exercise. Deep learning (DL) and machine learning (ML) approaches now represent potential solutions for the development of clinical decision support systems in the field of diabetes. Thus, this study examined CGM time series preceding the exercise and evaluated the use of DL and feature-based ML approaches to predict hypoglycemia occurring from the start of exercise until the following morning. We analyzed 47 CGM recordings pertaining to T1D young patients that performed a controlled exercise on a treadmill. Recordings were labelled as HYPO or NO-HYPO, based on the occurrence or absence of hypoglycemic episodes, respectively. A Bidirectional-Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) model was trained using raw CGM time series and validated through leave-one-out cross validation. Data augmentation techniques were applied to enhance the small and unbalanced dataset. Results were compared to those previously obtained with ML approaches based on clinically relevant CGM features extracted from the same data.

    "abstract": "This study investigated degradation behaviors and failure mechanisms of Schottky-type p-GaN gate high electron mobility transistor (SP-HEMT) under long-term power cycling tests (PCTs). The device exhibited degradation at both the chip level and the package level with electrical parameters deteriorating. After 320k cycles, increases in gate leakage current and subthreshold swing (SS), as well as a positive shift in threshold voltage of the device were characterized. It was speculated that the electrothermal stress during power cycling may have caused the gate degradation. Low-frequency noise (LFN) measurements identified an increase in trap density of gate during PCT. Obviously, a sharp increase in drain leakage current of the device was observed after 520k cycles. Cracks in the GaN layer below the source, detected by scanning electron microscope (SEM), revealed that new leakage paths had formed in the chip due to thermomechanical stress under long-term PCT. Furthermore, the results based on X-ray and scanning acoustic microscope (SAM) showed that solder fatigue after PCT, which led to an increase in device thermal resistance. It finally triggered thermal runaway and resulted in device burnout."

Implicit-function-based approaches model object motion as dielectric variations but require fine discretization of the motion domain, increasing computational cost. This study proposes a voxel-based implicit modeling method that constructs a voxel domain conforming to the sample shape and assigns electromagnetic and thermal properties through inside–outside boundary identification, enabling mesh refinement only within the sample region while keeping the voxel domain fixed and representing motion through equivalent cavity deformation. The simulations of a small sample, validated at discrete positions and compared with experiments, show that the proposed method reduces computation time to 16.4% of that of the ray-casting method (RCM) while maintaining high accuracy; additionally, the effects of rotation and lifting speeds on heating performance are analyzed."

The proposed Quantum Transfer Learning (QTL) framework integrates a classical neural network with a parameterized quantum circuit, training both components end-to-end to enable synergistic learning. For baseline comparison, we evaluated a standalone Quantum Neural Network (QNN) trained directly on raw credit risk data and a conventional classical neural network. Although the standalone QNN demonstrates theoretical feasibility, it suffers from poor recall and unstable convergence due to the lack of feature preprocessing and high computational demands. Experimental evaluations on a real-world normalized credit risk dataset show that the proposed co-trained QTL model significantly outperforms the baselines. In particular, it achieves a higher area under the ROC curve (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\text{AUC}=0.9134$</tex>) and improved recall (0.73) for the minority class (defaults), underscoring its effectiveness in addressing class imbalance while remaining feasible under current quantum hardware constraints."

This work presents a comparative evaluation of four preprocessing techniques for foggy image enhancement: Dark Channel Prior (DCP), CLAHE, Multi-Scale Retinex (MSR), and AOD-Net. The methods were tested on 61 images from the DAWN dataset. Three no-reference visual quality metrics (NIQE, BRISQUE, PIQE) and average processing time were used as evaluation criteria. Results show that CLAHE offers the best trade-off between quality and efficiency, making it suitable for real-time applications. AOD-Net demonstrates greater robustness and stability, but at a higher computational cost. In contrast, DCP and MSR exhibit limitations in either stability or execution time. The findings highlight that no single technique is universally optimal. The selection should depend on specific system requirements, balancing visual quality, robustness, and efficiency."

The neural correlates of PC remain incompletely understood, especially in dynamic environments. EEG microstate analysis provides a powerful framework for investigating the temporal dynamics of large-scale neural activity at rest and has been increasingly used in task-based experiments. In this study, we applied EEG microstate analysis to the BioVRSea paradigm. This PC task integrates a moving platform and a virtual reality (VR) system to deliver both motor and visual stimuli. Sensory stimulation was modulated across distinct phases in both congruent and incongruent ways, allowing us to examine neural dynamics under varying PC conditions. EEG data were collected from 12 healthy male sailors immediately after a 3-week maritime deployment. Participants underwent a resting-state recording followed by the BioVRSea task. EEG signals were then segmented into five microstates using a K-means clustering algorithm, and microstate temporal dynamics (Duration, Occurrence, and Coverage) were extracted by backfitting the grand mean maps onto the EEG signal. A linear mixed-effect model was employed to assess differences in microstate temporal parameters between resting-state and task conditions. Our findings reveal significant modulations in microstate properties, suggesting that neural dynamics during PC differ substantially from those observed at rest."

    "abstract": "Pedestrian detection has become a significant research focus in autonomous driving. Many investigation mechanisms have developed detection techniques using simple camera devices, which can affect the performance of detection as they produce low-quality images, such as RGB, especially in cases of imbalanced illumination and a lack of texture. The images produced by a thermal camera can retain quality for better detection in complex scenes. Popular works attained maximum accuracy in the detection of pedestrians in a few scenarios. However, there is scope to improve the efficiency of detection in critical scenarios, such as daytime and nighttime, as well as densely populated regions. To address this issue, this article presented Enhanced Pedestrian Detection for Autonomous Driving Using Multimodal Spatio-Contextual Deep Networks to enhance detection accuracy in broad scenarios. This approach is developed in the combination of multimodal data and deep networks. The useful features can be extracted during the pipeline process, which can improve detection accuracy. All input images are normalized into a standard $640 \\times 640$ resolution. The contrast of the image is enhanced with the help of CLAHE. Further, the objects are detected using a pretrained R-CNN framework, and the latter model is adjusted with user-defined threshold values for improving the confidence of detection. This investigation was implemented in a user-friendly web application built using the Flask web framework. The web page allows researchers to upload and investigate the detection summary. The proposed approach can be further investigated in real-world applications."

Such interference often results in systematic errors, including the substitution of the mid-close back unrounded vowel [ɤ] for the schwa [ә], alongside challenges in mastering consonant variations such as linking and assimilation. This study introduces a theoretical framework that integrates the Dual Phonetic Transcription Teaching Method, using the PRAAT speech analysis software to enhance EFL instruction. DPTTM concurrently presents standard pronunciations (e.g., “want to” as <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$[{}^{\\prime}\\text{want tu}:])$</tex> alongside their natural, colloquial variants (e.g., “wanna” as [‘wanә]), thereby targeting enhancements in vowel accuracy and the handling of consonant modifications. Furthermore, spectrograms generated via the PRAAT software (e.g., contrasting the [x0264] in the Chinese morpheme “歌” with the [x0259] in the English word “about”; the [e]-like vowel in “月” versus the [e] in “bed”; and the palatalization from /t j/ to /ʧ/ in phrases such as “nice to meet you”) deliver visual feedback crucial for correcting negative first language transfer and optimizing articulatory refinement. The framework also supports interactive exercises, leveraging cognitive psychology principles and offers scalable solutions for diverse learners, with future work exploring empirical validation and applications."

    "abstract": "In recent years, with deep learning development, research based on medical image data has received widespread attention. However, deep learning algorithms require model training on a large number of annotated datasets. Access to medical image data is strictly regulated due to the high cost of acquiring and legal, ethical, and privacy considerations. All these reasons lead to the fact that it is often difficult to obtain large-scale medical image datasets. How to expand the existing data by generating simulated medical images through deep learning methods has become an urgent issue. Here, we propose a generation model for 3D medical CT images based on VQGAN and DDPM. Our algorithm employs DDPM to fit the distribution of latent space data of VQGAN, which realizes the generation of CT images at the 3D level and effectively preserves the consistent coherence among CT slices. We conducted experimental validation using the MICCAI FLARE 2022 dataset and comparative experiments for the parameters used in the VQGAN training process. Our proposed model's 3D average slice FID coefficient reaches 20.79, and the FVD coefficient reaches 252.97 in <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$128\\times 128\\times 64$</tex> dimensions.

However, the photovoltaic plant that supplies power to the center lacks an real-time monitoring system for its batteries, which represents a critical challenge that can compromise the efficiency and sustainability of the power supply. For this reason, this project proposes the creation of an IoT system for monitoring the status of batteries in a solar power system, applied to the Wasakentsa health center. Various technologies were analyzed and a Heltec WiFi LoRa 32 V2 microcontroller was chosen, along with voltage, temperature and humidity sensors, in addition to the ThingsBoard platform for visualization of the data collected in real time. The methodology included laboratory tests followed by verification in situ, ensuring that the findings accurately reflect actual system conditions. The system enabled real-time monitoring of parameters of both the batteries and the environment in which they are installed, optimizing energy management and extending system life. The visualization of the data on the ThingsBoard platform facilitated the early detection of possible failures, reducing downtime and improving operational efficiency. Initial experiments, conducted at the Salesian Polytechnic University, demonstrated the functionality of the system, the effectiveness of which was subsequently validated at Wasakentsa. This system is a replicable solution for other isolated communities around the world."

Subsequently, the problem is modeled as a combinatorial optimization instance, solvable through a classical-quantum approach based on the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA). Thanks to its hybrid structure, QAOA enables the simultaneous exploration of a vast solution space and, through a classical optimizer, updates the parameters of the quantum circuit to converge toward high-performing solutions.

To circumvent this obstacle, we propose a novel multi-scale topological structure-based graph contrastive learning framework (TopoGCL) that explicitly integrates complementary path-based and neighborhood-based structural information. We introduce a symmetric InfoNCE contrastive loss function enhanced by dual temperature coefficients, enabling the model to adaptively balance the discrimination between inter-view and intra-view negative samples. The experiments conducted on benchmark citation networks show that our TopoGCL model achieves competitive or superior performance compared to several state-of-the-art baselines in node classification tasks. Temperature coefficients analysis and ablation studies further validate the critical role of the dual temperature contrastive strategy and multi-view structural augmentation, highlighting their distinct advantages in improving embedding quality and model robustness."

However, the highly dynamic operational environment, along with potential configuration and software errors, makes identifying the root causes of failures challenging. To address this issue, this paper proposes an adaptive and automated method called AS-Rank, which consists of three components: anomaly quantification, root cause service localization, and root cause indicator localization. Initially, anomaly quantification evaluates the current state data of the microservices system to generate anomaly scores. Subsequently, a weighted service dependency graph is constructed using these scores and service dependencies. Root cause services are then identified by considering both node and edge weights. Finally, key indicators are selected based on the identified service and analyzed using causal inference techniques. Experimental results demonstrate that AS-Rank accurately identifies root causes in both single and multiple root-cause scenarios."

    "abstract": "With the development and application of machine learning, attackers can eavesdrop on the traffic of users browsing websites through malicious relays on Tor user links, and conduct traffic analysis on them, thus carrying out de-anonymization attacks on Tor users. Therefore, identifying malicious relays is critical to ensuring the anonymity of the Tor network. Previous studies have shown that malicious relays usually have similar relay configuration information and go online and offline at the same time, so the nearest neighbor ranking algorithm is designed to measure the similarity of relays. Then according to the seed relays, the malicious relays are screened out. However, this algorithm regards the relay configuration information as a unified string information and adopts a unified distance calculation method, which leads to inaccurate similarity analysis of relays. In order to solve this problem, this paper considers the difference of the configuration information of relays, improves the distance calculation method, and uses the improved distance calculation method to cluster relays based on the K-Mediods algorithm, so that the relays with similar configurations can be clustered together. The experimental results show that the improved distance calculation method has better clustering effect on relays, which is conducive to further identification of malicious relays."

    "abstract": "This paper presents an efficient numerical approach for solving nonlinear DC power flow problems in radial distribution networks using the multivariate Traub method. Two distinct mathematical formulations of the DC power flow equations are analyzed, both derived from the nodal conductance matrix and incorporating constant-power loads. The Traub method, which exhibits cubic convergence and requires only one Jacobian evaluation per iteration, is applied to each formulation and benchmarked against the classical Newton-Raphson method. Numerical experiments on standard 33-bus and 69-bus test systems demonstrate that the Traub-based solver achieves faster convergence, reduced computational time, and improved numerical stability. These findings highlight the potential of the Traub method as a scalable and accurate alternative for power flow analysis in modern DC distribution systems."

This study investigates cortical complexity and spectral properties in episodic migraine using EEG-derived resting-state networks (RSNs) analysed with power spectral density (PSD) and Higuchi's fractal dimension (HFD). EEG data from 22 migraineurs and 25 healthy controls were processed using Independent Component Analysis (ICA) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) spatial filters to extract functionally relevant brain networks. PSD analysis revealed increased low frequency (delta, theta) and decreased high frequency (beta, gamma) power in migraineurs, suggesting disturbed oscillatory activity. HFD analysis showed significantly higher complexity in several RSNs, indicating irregular neural dynamics. Notably, HFD scores correlated with the age of migraine onset and duration, highlighting potential effects on disease progression. These findings suggest widespread dysregulation of brain network dynamics in migraine and support EEG complexity measures as potential biomarkers for diagnosis and treatment monitoring."

    "abstract": "An essential component of urban governance is municipal waste management, requiring efficient, transparent, and sustainable solutions. Blockchain technology offers transformative potential in addressing challenges such as inefficiency, lack of transparency, and data integrity in waste management systems. The paper presents a blockchain-based decentralized solution to overcome these challenges. A blockchain-based framework for solid waste management in smart cities, integrating smart contracts and authenticated data structures (ADS) to ensure transparency, automation, and data integrity is proposed in this paper. A decentralized blockchain network is integrated to record waste collection, processing, and disposal activities in an immutable ledger. Smart contracts automate key processes such as servicelevel agreements, incentive distribution, and compliance verification, reducing manual intervention and enhancing operational efficiency. An algorithm for authentic verification is used. This verification process will be used by both, user at time of waste pickup service and by waste collector at time of waste disposal, to promote a proper disposal process. This makes the system more secure due to its dual verification process. Track of waste from generation to disposal, ensures that there is no illegal dumping. A mathematical formalization is done for route optimization which will help to reduce the time taken to provide waste pick-up service and minimize the cost. A key solution for effective waste disposal is presented, where the waste is pre-segregation (the user), into different categories such as organic, inorganic, and plastic. The users then fill the details of their segregated waste, schedule the waste pickup service. This is a simple yet powerful system that can greatly benefit waste collection and disposal process. An integrated incentive model is also utilized to reward and maintain the sustainable disposal practices."

    "abstract": "Network graph theory (NGT) provides a powerful framework for characterizing the topological organization of brain networks and understanding functional integration and segregation within the brain. However, the estimation of NGT metrics is inherently dependent on the definition of network nodes, which is also determined by the choice of brain parcellation atlas. This dependency raises critical concerns about the comparability, reliability, and interpretability of graph-derived metrics across studies, particularly in clinical populations such as patients with Parkinson's Disease (PD). The present study aimed to systematically evaluate the influence of parcellation scheme on NGT metrics computed from EEG-based functional connectivity (FC) data in a cohort of PD patients. Specifically, the objective was to identify which metrics are robust to parcellation choice and thus potentially more reliable for use as biomarkers in clinical neuroscience. EEG recordings were acquired from 18 PD patients using a 64-channel wearable EEG cap during resting-state conditions. Source reconstruction was performed using a Boundary Element Model and cortical time series were extracted using two parcellation atlases: the anatomically defined Desikan-Killiany 56-region atlas obtained from Desikan Killiany 68 and the functionally defined Schaefer 100-region atlas. FC matrices were computed using the Phase Locking Value, and seven key NGT metrics were extracted from each matrix: clustering coefficient, participation coefficient, characteristic path length, global efficiency, strength, transitivity, and assortativity. The agreement between metrics derived from the two parcellations was assessed first using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, followed by Bland-Altman analysis to evaluate systematic bias and/or other types of errors. Statistical analysis revealed significant differences across most metrics between the two atlases, indicating that parcellation choice can meaningfully affect the topological characterization of functional brain networks. However, two metrics characteristic path length (CPL) and participation coefficient (P) exhibited strong agreement between parcellations, with non-significant Wilcoxon test results (p = 0.913 for CPL; p = 0.055 for P) and Bland-Altman plots showing no trends and 95 % confidence intervals of the bias including the zero line. These findings suggest that CPL and P are robust to parcellation scheme and may serve as stable indicators of global network integration and inter-modular connectivity, respectively underscoring the methodological sensitivity of NGT metrics to the choice of brain atlas. Nevertheless, the observed robustness of CPL and P suggests that certain global integration metrics may provide reliable markers for assessing brain network organization in PD, regardless of parcellation strategy. These findings have important implications for the standardization of brain network analyses and the development of reproducible, generalizable biomarkers. Future studies with larger cohorts and matched healthy control groups are warranted to validate these observations and extend them to broader clinical applications."

This work proposes the MobileNet-Unet model for fast and precise retinal vessel segmentation. MobileNet, as the encoder, employs depthwise separable convolutions to lower computational demands, making it ideal for mobile and embedded applications. The Unet decoder progressively upsamples features, using skip connections to retain spatial information. Together, they deliver high segmentation accuracy with reduced resource usage. Experiments on benchmark retinal datasets show that MobileNet-Unet surpasses existing methods in performance. Its balance of efficiency and precision supports real-time clinical deployment, while its flexible design allows extension to other segmentation tasks, such as medical imaging and autonomous navigation."

Advancements in computer vision and natural language processing in the field of deep learning have made great improvements. This work demonstrates a deep learningbased approach that effectively integrates Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) with Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to generate meaningful captions. The CNN component of the model utilizes InceptionV3 architecture which is used to extract complex-level features from the images. These features are then passed to the LSTM network, a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), which excels at predicting and learning long-term dependencies-making it suitable for generating contextually accurate captions from images. Flickr8k dataset is used for both training and testing, which consists of 8000 images, each annotated with five different captions. One of the most important part of the process is data preprocessing, which includes cleaning the text, tokenizing, and converting images into suitable feature vectors. The model is trained over multiple epochs and performance is calculated using standard evaluation measures like METEOR. The findings indicate that the model generates accurate and context-aware captions. The evaluation scores improve significantly with additional training, which indicates effective learning over time. This study shows the potential of combining CNNs and LSTMs for solving the image captioning problem and contributes in the ongoing research in multi-model deep learning."

Keeping in view the advantages of FS and thus of SVAFS, we are studying the SVAFS in more details and to see the applicability of it to address different kind of problems. In this paper, we are addressing the entropy measure of SVAFS. Thus, the entropy based on distance measures of SVAFS is proposed. Then, this proposed entropy measure is applied to the Power Grids (PGs) classification. Validation of results are carried out with considering some of the existing studies in the domain of SVAFS.

Then, the graph self-learning module is used to encode this information into the graph adjacency matrix, and then the optimal graph adjacency matrix is constructed. Secondly, through the spatio-temporal graph convolutional neural network model based on temporal attention mechanism, this paper effectively improves the accuracy of traffic flow prediction. The proposed model outperforms traditional methods in traffic flow prediction considering price factors and can more accurately reflect the spatio-temporal change law of road traffic flow, providing new theoretical support and practical methods for data-driven differentiated toll pricing."

    "abstract": "Event logs underpin both process mining and digital forensic analysis. Yet turning unstructured case narratives into wellformed logs remains a non-trivial task. Much of the work to date has relied on bespoke Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipelines or transformer-based stacks, which are solutions that can be effective but are also engineering-intensive. This study asks a straightforward question: can large language models (LLMs) (ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini, produce structured, XES-compatible event logs directly from forensic narratives? We examine eight case files and assess the outputs along four dimensions that matter in practice: temporal consistency, redundancy, schema compliance, and classification performance. The results are instructive. ChatGPT generated timelines that were fully consistent and adhered to the schema in all cases. Claude performed well overall but showed slightly lower consistency and compliance. Gemini achieved near-perfect temporal alignment, though its outputs varied more across cases. Pairwise comparisons indicate small but meaningful gaps in consistency. Taken together, these findings suggest that LLMs are a potential alternative to custom pipelines for event log generation. Even so, the forensic context warrants caution: outputs should be validated carefully before use, with attention to case details and downstream impact."

Traditional methods of power generation scheduling, such as Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP), often struggle to accommodate the variability and uncertainty associated with RES. This study addresses these challenges by developing an Artificial Neural Network (ANN)-based unit commitment optimization model to enhance the efficiency and reliability of power generation scheduling while incorporating solar and wind energy. A comprehensive dataset covering one year of wind power, solar power, and load profiles was collected to train the ANN model. This dataset was further supplemented with detailed operational attributes, cost coefficients, and generator constraints to improve model accuracy and performance. The proposed model is tested on a modified IEEE-14 bus system across various planning intervals: one-day, one-week, and one-month. For further evaluation, the ANN-based approach is compared with the traditional MILP method. The results demonstrate that the ANN-based unit commitment model can effectively schedule generator outputs across different timeframes in the presence of renewable intermittency and achieves a cost saving of approximately $ 51 compared to the MILP approach. These findings underscore the potential of AI-based models for efficient and flexible scheduling in renewable-integrated power systems."

Furthermore, Explainable AI (XAI) is integrated to provide transparency and interpretability in model decisions-enhancing clinical trust. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves superior structural similarity (SSIM) and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) compared to state-of-the-art approaches, while significantly reducing noise and maintaining diagnostic quality.

Each agent in the system is specialized in interpreting specific data types-such as heart rate, movement, and sleep patterns-and collaborates with others to provide a holistic understanding of the user's health status. Importantly, the behavior and decision-making of each agent are dynamically personalized based on the unique data, preferences, and evolving health conditions of each user. The system also facilitates communication between seniors, coaches, and healthcare professionals, promoting shared decision-making and continuous support. Preliminary results show the system's potential in enhancing user engagement, improving care coordination, and enabling scalable, personalized coaching in AAL settings."

    "abstract": "Enterprise resource planning (ERP) solutions, such as SAP, have emerged as essential digital backbones for commerce and logistics operations as a result of the rapid transition to digital supply chains that has taken place all over the world. This change has resulted in the introduction of ERP solutions. On the other hand, this modification has also resulted in an increase in the susceptibility of cybersecurity, particularly in areas of SAP digital supply chains that are integrated with one another. This can be seen in the fact that the vulnerability has increased. Because these systems deal with sensitive information in networks for procurement, logistics, and inventory, they are becoming increasingly enticing targets for cyber attacks, ransomware, and threats that originate from within the business. This is because these systems deal with information that should be kept confidential. The purpose of this research is to investigate the developing concerns regarding cybersecurity that are observed within the context of SAP digital supply chains. For the objective of ensuring that data is exchanged in a secure manner and that processes are transparent, special attention is devoted to the prevention of invasions, the reduction of data breaches, and utilization of blockchain technology. The purpose of this research is to provide an advanced architecture that makes use of the decentralized trust model that blockchain technology will enable. This architecture was developed to ensure that data cannot be manipulated, to improve traceability, and to tighten access control among stakeholders in distant supply chains.

    "abstract": "Precise and time-efficient sensing of tremor dynamics is essential for developing personalized, adaptive stimulation strategies for movement disorders such as Parkinson’s Disease (PD) and Essential Tremor (ET). Existing modalities—such as inertial measurement units (IMUs) and surface electromyography (EMG)—lack muscle specificity and are prone to stimulation artifacts. To address these limitations, we fabricated and applied a Wearable Ultrasound Sensing (WUS) system, featuring dual flexible 64- element transducer arrays with center frequency of 6 MHz conformed over the flexor carpi radialis (FCR) and extensor carpi radialis (ECR) muscles for simultaneous antagonist muscle monitoring. A machine learning (ML) pipeline was introduced to estimate tissue displacement (TD) from raw ultrasound signals. Across three participants and multiple trials, the WUS system achieved tremor frequency detection within 10 %variation relative to commercial B-mode and IMU sensors, and met statistical equivalence thresholds based on two one-sided test (TOST) analysis. The TD estimation models demonstrated high predictive accuracy, with overall Pearson correlation coefficients between predicted and actual values ranging from 0.88 to 0.97, normalized RMSE values below 10 %, and offline model building times under 800 seconds. Compared to classical B-mode speckle tracking, the proposed WUS-ML pipeline reduced offline model building time by 75 % (from 3095 sec to 792 sec). In real-time performance tests, it reduced frame-level latency from 3700 ms to 17 ms and achieved effective processing rates exceeding 50 Hz, well above the Nyquist threshold for tremor analysis. These results demonstrate the feasibility of dual-array wearable ultrasound for accurate, low-latency tremor tracking and lay the groundwork for future closed-loop afferent stimulation systems in both clinical and at-home environments."

    "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to the interconnection of numerous computationally, memory, communication, and energy-constrained objects over the Internet and local communication technologies by leveraging unicast and multicast routing solutions. These device and network limitations have resulted in several challenges for IoT routing protocols, leading to the standardization of RPL; the Routing Protocol for Low-power and Lossy Networks (LLNs). Nonetheless, while RPL addresses some hardware and software limitations, its decisions still rely on basic hand-crafted algorithms. The recent success of machine learning in several domains has motivated us to consider intelligent algorithms based on Reinforcement Learning (RL) as a solution to this problem. Therefore, we contribute in this paper three Q-learning-based algorithms for intelligent information dissemination and routing in IoT networks, named SMART, TRAP, and TRAST. SMART focuses on the intelligent suppression of unnecessary messages, TRAP dynamically adapts communication intervals to the network's needs, and TRAST combines the two. These proposals have been integrated into RPL, evaluated through extensive simulations on dedicated IoT platforms, and validated via real experiments on the publicly available large-scale IoT-Lab testbed. The obtained results demonstrate the performance of our solutions compared to the state of the art in terms of energy consumption, load balancing, and end-to-end delay."

    "abstract": "Proper maintenance of Induction Machines (IM) is essential to ensure suitable performance, extend their service lifespan, and minimize the risk of catastrophic failures. Bearing failures are the most common failure mode in induction machines reported in industrial applications, and vibration signal monitoring has become an effective technique for their detection. However, accurate interpretation of these signals requires high expertise to differentiate between normal and faulty operating conditions. In this context, supervised artificial intelligence algorithms have emerged as promising tools for pattern classification in vibration signals. This study presents an innovative approach that integrates the energy levels of Discrete Wavelet Transform coefficients as inputs to train two classification models, a Fully Connected Neural Network (FCNN) and a Bayesian Neural Network (BNN), together with the uncertainty assessment of the inferences. The BNN, in particular, allows for the quantification of epistemic uncertainty, providing a measure of confidence in the predictions. The FCNN architectures were optimized using a random search algorithm in Python, while the BNN parameters were tuned through variational inference with normal distributions for the weights. Results demonstrated high accuracy performance, but the BNN model shows the lowest epistemic and aleatory uncertainty compared to the FCNN method. The results prove the ability to use BNNm models with high confidence in diagnostic and condition monitoring for IM applications."

    "abstract": "The design of responsive and green networks necessarily entails the optimisation of multiple conflicting objectives with strategic, tactical, or operational decisions. This paper addresses a bi-objective green p-hub centre routing problem with hub location-allocation decisions and vehicle routing decisions. In their respective routes, vehicles may only travel using one selected speed between each node pair. The objectives are the minimisation of the worst service time and the environmental costs incurred during the transportation of all necessary demand flows, respectively. Since the studied problem is NP-hard, a meta-heuristic approach based on the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II meta-heuristic is proposed. Additionally, min-max location and sequential allocation-routing method is developed to generate initial solutions. Furthermore, problemspecific crossover and mutation operators are implemented to efficiently explore the search space. Whereas, a novel rankbased speed selection procedure is devised to determine the appropriate travel speeds for generated off-springs based on their relative ranks in current population. Computational experiments are performed on the Australian Post (AP) dataset, and results indicate that our proposed heuristic approach provides good solutions in competitive CPU times. Finally, a discussion on the obtained Pareto frontier approximations is offered, and analysis is conducted on the effects of key decision parameters such as the number of located hub nodes, and the number of vehicles available at open hubs."

    "abstract": "Product safety and traceability have become increasingly important issues worldwide. To tackle challenges in the agri-product sector from a technical standpoint, it is essential to have a reliable traceability system. Such a System should be capable of tracking and monitoring the whole lifecycle of product production, with raw cultivation or breeding, processing, transportation, warehousing, and retail distribution. We propose a trusted, selfmanazing, open, and ecological product traceability system built by blockchain technology. Blockchain, kind a form of distributed ledger technology (DLT), shows data immutable and enhances asset traceability. It is characteristics can greatly improve conventional agri-product supply chains by increasing transparency and building consumer trust in the products they purchase and their origins. Unlike processed goods, agricultural raw products typically do not come with expiry dates. To estimate their edible lifespan, we leverage blockchain technology. The current literature lacks a comparative analysis of both the benefits and limitations of blockchain applications in the agriproduct sector. Therefore, this study introduces a combination of big data and blockchain technologies, incorporating Geographic Information System (GIS) tools for precise location tracking. To boost system efficiency, we integrate Internet of Things (IoT) devices such as RFID tags, which automate data collection and verification, minimizing human involvement. The study may aims to address existing gaps by examining the current state of blockchain applications in agriculture, particularly in the context of product traceability. We review key contributions from existing research and explore how blockchain technology can help solve traceability challenges. Consumer demand for higher quality agricultural products has grown considerably. The proposed system combines blockchain technology with IoT and big data approaches. Overall, blockchain offers a highly promising path for enhancing product traceability, though further effort is needed to support its full adoption and development."

    "abstract": "Hydraulic systems are repairable systems widely used in industry. Accurately predicting their remaining useful life (RUL) is critical to ensuring efficient and safe production. Most existing RUL prediction methods for repairable systems rarely consider degradation variability and failure heterogeneity among components of the same type across systems simultaneously. To address this problem, a trivariate joint model approach for the RUL prediction is proposed, which fuses system condition monitoring data, recurrent event data, and failure event data. Firstly, the system condition monitoring results are analyzed to identify multi-stage condition monitoring indicators; recurrent events and failure events are identified based on the multi-stage monitoring results and by utilizing maintenance threshold and failure threshold. Secondly, trivariate joint models with different association structures are constructed, considering various characteristic function forms of condition monitoring data. Finally, the trivariate joint model with the optimal association structure is identified, and its prediction performance is evaluated. In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, the solenoid valve full life test platform is established and a case is conducted by using the collected full life dataset. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method."

    "abstract": "The sheer growth of Internet of Things (IoT) systems poses monumental challenges in safeguarding personal data and enforcing regulations like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The major concern lies in the lack of transparency and explainability in the existing black-box security models, which makes it difficult to prove compliance and secure user rights. To address this issue, the project suggests an Artificial Intelligence-Enhanced Glass Box Security Guard (GBSG) framework that would promote GDPR compliance in IoT settings by employing mechanisms that are transparent, auditable, and accountable. The policy-based access control, automatic check for compliance, logging, and auditing are integrated in this solution for maintaining GDPR ideals while also supporting user rights in terms of access, correction, and deletion of the data. The solution uses MATLAB simulations and is tested using the NSL-KDD dataset and allows real-time monitoring and tracking, anomaly identification, and compliance enforcements. The novelty in this approach is the replacement of the obscure black-box models by a glass-box framework wherein explainability and compliance validation coexist and bridge IoT functionality and legal privacy obligations."

    "abstract": "Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) swarms are increasingly important for establishing adaptive and versatile wireless communications infrastructure, especially in scenarios where traditional infrastructure is not present or damaged. UAV swarms employ autonomous mobility as well as dynamic line-of-sight (LoS) communication link establishment for enhanced coverage, dependability, and versatility. Most existing UAV swarm communication topologies, however, are based on centralized coordination schemes, which place significant constraints like high communication latency, vulnerability to single points of failure, and inefficient energy waste through centralized control overhead. This project suggests a new, fully decentralized communication topology for UAV swarms, based on the ESP32-based microcontroller platform and the capabilities of Wi-Fi mesh networking. Based on the ESP-NOW protocol, the system enables direct, low-latency peer-to-peer communication by UAV nodes without any centralized access point or infrastructure. Our solution includes significant features including dynamic peer discovery for node mobility adaptation, efficient multi-hop routing for optimal communication paths, real-time hop-count monitoring for network diagnosis, and accurate monitoring of latency for on-time data delivery. Under extensive experimental testing, e.g., under different node mobility and failure scenarios, the system is shown to exhibit stable and consistent performance with zero communication delay. These findings confirm the system's feasibility in mission-critical applications with fault-tolerant, infrastructure-less communication-such as search and rescue, environmental monitoring, disaster relief, and remote surveillance-where timely and fault-tolerant data exchange in UAV swarms is essential."

To solve the problem, one may employ existing surrogate-assisted algorithms that typically update their surrogate models whenever a new observation is obtained. However, this updating process can face challenges such as out-of-memory issues, high computational costs, or imbalanced data due to excessive exploitation.

If the model fails to provide useful information to identify a suitable solution vector, the algorithm defaults to functioning as the original controlled random search without using the model. We tested our algorithm and compared it with existing algorithms using numerical functions and a case study in semiconductor manufacturing. The results demonstrate that our algorithm empirically outperforms existing algorithms regarding computational efficiency and estimation accuracy."

While recent studies have focused primarily on developing advanced classification models, the impact of systematic dataset optimization has received comparatively less attention. This study investigates the role of dataset preprocessing in improving malware classification performance across heterogeneous malware domains. A unified preprocessing pipeline is proposed that integrates class balancing, feature normalization, and supervised feature selection. Specifically, Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) is employed to address class imbalance, Min–Max normalization is applied to stabilize feature scales, and a Genetic Algorithm–based feature selection strategy is used to identify discriminative feature subsets. The proposed pipeline is evaluated using multiple benchmark malware datasets covering network traffic, executable files, Android applications, and memory forensics. Experimental results demonstrate that systematic dataset optimization leads to consistent performance improvements while significantly reducing feature dimensionality across different classifiers. Comparative analysis with standard feature selection methods and an automated machine learning baseline further highlights the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The study emphasizes the importance of preprocessing in malware detection pipelines and identifies zero-day detection and real-time deployment as directions for future work."

We use the Error-Level Analysis (ELA) to identify artefacts and the Grad-CAM to visualize the activations of discriminative regions that the model uses to make predictions (and thereby to ensure dataset integrity and to improve interpretability). AgriSight-Net, which was conditioned on 12-classes and more than 4,000 pest images, attains a test accuracy of 87.90% and high levels of precision, recall, and F1-score in most classes. The intensive mapping of confusion matrices and analytics-based on classes is not only used to show the power of the system, but also shows the edge cases where similar species visually speaking are used. Fusing ELA with explainable AI will enable the enhancement of the transparency and the rise of confidence in the predictions of the model.

Orthogonal Time Frequency Space (OTFS) modulation, a core technology against this effect, still suffers from Fractional Doppler Shift (FDS), causing an error floor at high Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNRs). Furthermore, existing Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) optimization, focused on signal enhancement, fails to suppress the dominant FDS interference in this regime. To address this, we propose an optimization framework that Maximizes the Target Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (MTSINR). Our framework is the first to explicitly incorporate interference leakage into the objective function, shifting the optimization paradigm from “signal enhancement” to “interference suppression”. The RIS is optimized to reshape the channel, coherently combining the target signal while destructively combining adjacent interference. Simulations validate that our scheme suppresses Inter-Doppler Interference, eliminates the error floor, and enhances system reliability without increasing OTFS frame length, proving its suitability for latency-constrained V2X systems."

    "abstract": "Accurate estimation of angular velocity in threedimensional (3D) space is critical for enhancing the performance of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) in modern navigation and geospatial applications. This study proposes a novel framework for angular velocity prediction from GPS measurements by integrating machine learning techniques with a 3D computational algorithm. The approach begins by converting latitude, longitude, and altitude into Cartesian coordinates using the DOVETAIL transformation, providing a robust geometric foundation for deriving angular velocity. The initial angular velocity values computed from the DOVETAIL-based coordinate system are subsequently refined using a machine learning model designed to adapt dynamically to varying navigational conditions. By utilizing features such as position, velocity, and temporal information, the model learns system behavior in real time, thereby improving the accuracy, stability, and reliability of angular velocity estimation."

A key novelty is the adoption of a custom-designed coupled-line structure to replace traditional waveguide-based hybrids, which achieves effective signal combining and isolation between the local oscillator (LO) and radio frequency (RF) ports <sc xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">on</small>-chip. Measured at room temperature, the mixer exhibits a single-sideband (SSB) conversion loss (CL) of less than 11 dB from 204 to 228 GHz, with a minimum of 8 dB at 220 GHz. The isolation between the RF signal and the second harmonic of the LO signal is greater than 25 dB. This work demonstrates a compact and low-cost solution for terahertz integrated systems."

    "abstract": "In the current landscape, the wireless sector is witnessing a substantial surge in demand for enhanced capacity and high-speed data services. The rising number of users primarily fuels this increase and the growing volume of traffic, which is a result of a significant shift in technology aimed at supporting Internet applications. This shift is largely attributed to the escalating importance of Broadband Wireless Access (BWA). The 2.40GHz licensed frequency band supports a diverse array of application, while the 5850 to 5925MHz band is specifically allocated for automotive radar uses. Within the electromagnetic field, smart antenna arrays are becoming increasingly popular due to their ability to assign high capacity by dynamically managing intrusion in real-time scenarios, such as those encountered in automotive movement and aerodynamics. This is achieved through the adjustment of weights, separations, and phase settings. Furthermore, these arrays hold promise for various spatial signal processing applications, including direction of arrival (DOA) estimation, adaptive beam forming, and a range of digital signal processing (DSP) tasks. A cutting-edge hybrid genetic algorithm, referred to as the Hybrid Lamarckian-Baldwinian System is tested and shown to be effective in solution of practical problems. Moreover, a new equalization method designed to reduce multipath effects in Rayleigh fading environments has been investigated, showing benefits over traditional minimum mean square error (MMSE) and zero forcing equalization methods. The ability to modify the radiation patterns-covering aspects such as side lobes, beam width, main beam direction, nulls-will be a focal point of research for many years."

The central hypothesis is that combining the predictive capabilities of the Smith Predictor with the robustness of SMC and the optimization power of bioinspired algorithms can produce a controller that maintains high performance. Experimental tests on the TCLab platform, which add significant delays, confirm this. The results show that the proposed strategy effectively manages reference changes, outperforming traditional tuning methods.

We present NeuroSubNet, a deep learning model based on a graph attention ideas that aims to tackle both, ASD detection at an early stage and its subclassification as well. NeuroSubNet creates a brain graph with each participant’s ABIDE rs-fMRI scan by treating each of the ROIs as nodes, and using their correlation as weighted links. A series of multi-head Graph Attention Network learn images of ROIs as they relate to each other temporally, while also adjacently focusing on ROIs during the application as it outlines the rows that appear meaningful. The resulting latent representations are clustered to see the fitted representations with a Gaussian Mixture Model to see if the ASD subtype are identifiable. Across the 823 ABIDE participants, NeuroSubNet attains an accuracy of 86.25%, which is more than GCN, CNN, and SVM baseline models. These subtypes differ in cognitive, behavioral, severity and age of the person with ASD and then it aligns it with ADOS and SRS measures, offering an interpretable route to ASD profiling.."

No obvious “crackling” discharge sound was found with the aid of auscultation monitoring, and no corona or sparks were found when observed in the dark. The transformer was shut down for inspection, and it was found that the fasteners of the transformer were not loose. Measure the transformer winding insulation and DC resistance, and the iron core is insulated from the ground, and the test results are normal. After the insulation professionals arrived at the site, they inspected and comprehensively analyzed various conditions during operation and during shutdown. Finally, it was determined that the rectifier dry-type transformer ferromagnetic resonance occurred in the public I-section system, and the harmonic resonance was the factor that caused the increase of abnormal sound. At the same time, relevant suggestions are given to provide experience for dealing with similar incidents."

It addresses limitations of monolithic large language model (LLM) agents by introducing a modular eight-layer architecture that spans from cloud infrastructure up to operations and governance. Each layer encapsulates a key concern (from networking and communication protocols to tooling, cognitive reasoning, longterm memory, user interaction, and oversight), providing a structured foundation for building autonomous AI “agent societies.” The need for such an architecture is motivated by current LLM wrappers' shortcomings in memory, tool-use, and governance. An illustrative use case in code conversion demonstrates how multiple specialized agents can collaborate using NeuroStack to perform complex tasks (e.g. code translation and verification) that single agents handle poorly."

    "abstract": "The changing and delicate nature of pregnancy calls for an approach to continuously monitor the health of both the baby and the mother. The current standard practices, which mainly rely on clinic visits, fail to provide timely and essential data for proactive healthcare management. Most existing wearable devices are designed with a fitness focus, neglecting the needs related to physiology and activity during pregnancy. The presented study introduces an IoT-based health monitor that operates on low power and utilizes the ESP32 microcontroller's capabilities. The device includes a high-quality pulse sensor for monitoring heart rate and maternal and fetal well-being gauge. An accelerometer monitors activity levels, offering insights into complications or changes in daily activities. An OLED screen makes Real-time data display possible, giving mothers instant feedback on their health status. This design can incorporate emergency notification features as needed. In certain situations, future versions could integrate communication modules to send health data or alerts to specified contacts, e.g., spouses or healthcare providers. Taking this proactive stance nurtures a healthcare system focused on patients, which allows for identifying dangers, supports prompt actions, and ultimately protects the well-being of both mother and baby. This initiative advances health monitoring tools and sets the stage for tailored and thorough pregnancy care."

The dimensionality of the data has been reduced by Principal Component Analysis (PCA). By k-means clustering, an unsupervised categorization of the fatigue states has been carried out. The classification has been carried out by a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier and an exceptional accuracy could be achieved with 99.84% for the training data set and 99.58% for the validation data set. These results demonstrate the potential of sEMG signals and machine learning techniques to effectively assess muscle fatigue and provide important input to decisions in rehabilitation strategies."

    "abstract": "Preeclampsia is a complex pregnancy condition characterized by high blood pressure, often leading to damage to organs and tissues. Early detection and management of preeclampsia significantly reduce the risk of serious complications including seizures, liver failure and heart disease in both mother and baby. This paper aimed to provide tracking of blood pressure levels in high-risk pregnant women. The solution serves as a valuable tool in supporting pregnant women at high-risk for preeclampsia, enabling early detection and effective management of the condition. Using K-fold cross-validation, the proposed model achieved clinically acceptable prediction accuracy, with systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) values estimated within an average error margin of approximately 0.414 mmHg (MAE) and a validation loss of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\text{0. 5 4 4}$</tex> (MSE) for ResNet50, compared to <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\text{0. 4 1 9 ~ m m H g}$</tex> (MAE) and <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\text{0. 5 4 2}$</tex> (MSE) for EfficientNetB0. The results indicate that ResNet50 achieved slightly better prediction accuracy in terms of mean absolute error, suggesting that its deeper residual connections capture more discriminative features, whereas EfficientNetB0 achieved a marginally lower overall validation loss, due to its compound scaling and stronger regularization. Both models, however, yielded negative <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathrm{R}^{2}$</tex> values (-0.291 for ResNet50 and -0.309 for EfficientNetB0), indicating poor variance explanation and performance below a naive baseline. The novelty of this study resides in its end-to-end integration of a CNN-based blood pressure estimation algorithm with a mobile application specifically built for preeclampsia support. Unlike existing remote blood pressure monitoring techniques that rely on wearable equipment or human input, this system offers non-contact, camera-based assessment with typical smartphones while including clinical context."

From this, we built algorithmic models to recommend robust fungal strains and forecast remediation efficacy over time. Experimental validation using Trametes versicolor demonstrated successful decolorization under varied real-world conditions and confirmed predictive accuracy (Root Mean Square Error as low as 0.03). A followup hydroponic trial showed healthy plant growth in remediated water, supporting the method's biological safety. This research bridges AI and experimental science, offering an open-source, replicable solution to industrial dye pollution and a foundation for further innovation in bioremediation at scale."

To address this issue, this paper introduces generative artificial intelligence technology to explore its enabling role in the positive design of fitness equipment for the elderly. Based on the physiological characteristics, psychological needs, and usage scenarios of elderly users, this paper constructs an integrated framework of “demand - technology - design”.

    "abstract": "As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in high-stakes applications, the challenge of explaining uncertainty in natural language generation has become both a technical and moral imperative. Traditional approaches rely on probabilistic methods that are often opaque, difficult to interpret, and misaligned with human expectations of transparency and accountability. In response to these limitations, this paper introduces a novel framework based on rule-based moral principles-simple, human-inspired ethical guidelines-for responding to uncertainty in LLM-generated text. Drawing on insights from experimental moral psychology and virtue ethics, we define a set of symbolic behavioral rules such as precaution, deference, and responsibility to guide system responses under conditions of epistemic or aleatoric uncertainty. These rules are implemented declaratively and are designed to generate adaptive, context-sensitive explanations even in the absence of precise confidence metrics. The moral principles are encoded as symbolic rules within a lightweight Prolog-based engine, where each uncertainty tag (low, medium, high) activates an ethically aligned system action along with an automatically generated, plain-language rationale. We evaluate the framework through scenario-based simulations that benchmark rule coverage, assess fairness implications, and analyze trust calibration. An interpretive explanation module is integrated to reveal both the assigned uncertainty level and its underlying justification in a transparent and accessible way. We illustrate the framework through hypothetical yet plausible use cases in clinical and legal domains, demonstrating how rule-based moral reasoning can enhance user trust, promote fairness, and improve the interpretability of AIgenerated language. By offering a lightweight, philosophically grounded alternative to probabilistic uncertainty modeling, our approach paves the way for more ethical, human-aligned, and socially responsible natural language generation."

    "abstract": "In the context of secondary education, the search for innovative strategies that promote autonomous learning has become a priority, especially in subjects like Chemistry, where conceptual understanding poses a challenge. However, limitations persist in the implementation of active methodologies that strengthen student autonomy while simultaneously being evaluated using rigorous analytical tools. Faced with this problem, the current research analyzes the flipped classroom strategy as a teaching methodology, applying data mining and dimensionality reduction techniques, specifically Principal Component Analysis (PCA), to identify significant patterns in student perceptions. The study was conducted with a non-probabilistic sample of 108 high school students, using a Likert scale-based questionnaire. The validity and reliability of the instrument were verified using Cronbach's Alpha coefficient, obtaining a value of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\alpha=0.89$</tex>, which indicates high internal consistency. Subsequently, PCA was employed to reduce data complexity, and the Pearson correlation coefficient was applied to analyze the relationship between the methodology, didactic strategies, and student autonomy. The results show a strong positive correlation between the implementation of the flipped classroom and the development of skills such as leadership, self-management, collaborative work, and learning orientation. It is concluded that the combination of the flipped classroom with analytical techniques like PCA not only optimizes the evaluation of pedagogical strategies but also promotes more autonomous and effective learning processes."

    "abstract": "The current quantum technology depends on hardware/time-dependent features that render quantum calculations highly error-prone. Having faulty calculations generally requires redoing them, which induces an economic/computational overhead by using quantum machines/simulators. This can be problematic due to unaffordable fees, machine unavailability, or loss of quantum advantage. An alternative can be performing the calculations when the machines are in their most suitable state. This work presents a pipeline based on Machine Learning (ML), allowing users to choose the appropriate moment to perform a given computation based on the estimation of the JensenShannon divergence between the noisy and ideal distributions of quantum sampling. This includes (I) an extract-transform-load data module, (II) an ML unit for quantum features forecasting and error prediction, and (III) a web-based visualisation unit. The pipeline was built/tested using 3.5 months of calibration data from three real 127-qubit IBM quantum machines. The results confirmed the applicability of the proposal in realistic scenarios."

Traditional toll systems, based on static pricing and physical toll booths, are insufficient to manage dynamic traffic conditions and often exacerbate congestion during peak hours. This paper proposes an IoT-enabled dynamic tolling system designed to adjust rates in real time based on vehicle density and traffic flow, aiming to improve road efficiency. The system architecture relies on traffic data collected from virtual sensors integrated within a SUMO (Simulation of Urban Mobility) environment, managed via the TraCI interface. Through a digital twin model, various tolling strategies are simulated under different traffic scenarios, and their impact on vehicle performance, waiting times, and emissions is analyzed. The results demonstrate that dynamic tolling significantly reduces congestion levels compared to static pricing schemes, validating the effectiveness of the proposed system. This study provides a replicable simulation framework for evaluating intelligent transportation policies prior to realworld implementation."

In this article, a modified ZVS-SVM scheme is proposed to reduce the CM voltage (CMV) generated by the inverter. Circuit working principles under the proposed scheme are illustrated. Besides, CM behavior and performance of the proposed method are compared with the traditional method. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by simulation and experiments."

    "abstract": "The growing interest in Five Phase Induction Motors (FPIMs) can be attributed to their diverse range of applications, which encompass electric vehicles, advanced compressor systems, and marine propulsion, among others. Among many available drive control systems, Direct Torque Control Method (DTCM) is a powerful strategy to regulate speed, torque and flux within permissible limits of induction motors. However, conventional DTCMs are failed to regulate flux and speed in smoothly under drastically changes in the system due to not regulating flux with any controllers. Hence, the reference flux is obtained through a controller in proposed methodology presented in this paper. Moreover, conventional PI/PID controller cannot produce accurate output due to its fixed gains, hence TSK-Fuzzy controllers are used in this paper. Two TSK Fuzzy controllers are employed in the proposed DTCM where one is to produce reference torque and other is for reference flux. Additionally, the space vector pulse width modulation (SVPWM) technique is employed to generate the appropriate pulse sequence for a five leg inverter used in motor drive applications. A detailed design of TSK Fuzzy controller is also incorporated in this paper. In order to make speed sensorless controller, mathematical modeling is included to estimate speed of the motor to avoid physical sensor. Hardware - in the - Loop (HIL) technique is implemented on OPAL-RT platform to present various results similar to real time responses."

This work presents a metrology-based method for measuring the environmental impact of industrial machinery. The proposed approach is structured in three steps. The first involves the creation of a checklist identifying the relevant components of the machinery to be considered for environmental impact evaluation. The second step entails the individual measurement of the environmental impact associated with each identified component. The third step aggregates these measurements to derive an overall assessment of the machinery's environmental impact. A key feature of the method is its ability to decouple the environmental impact attributable to the machine's operational phase from that associated with the idle phase, during which the machine is powered on but not actively used. As a case study, the method was applied to an industrial press. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach enables a reliable estimation of avoidable emissions linked to idle energy consumption, providing valuable insights for sustainability-oriented process optimization."

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a multi-sensor fusion method based on error entropy optimization for target positioning and tracking. Error entropy approximates the unknown noise distribution characteristics caused by random outliers, non-Gaussian noise, etc., thereby improving the accuracy of fusion tracking. During the fusion process, the system calculates the error entropy value of each sensor observation data in real time to measure the uncertainty of measurement and estimation, thereby adaptively adjusting the noise error covariance matrix in the filtering process to avoid interference from outliers or unreliable data on target state estimation. The method proposed in this paper breaks through the a priori assumptions of noise distribution in traditional algorithms, uses error entropy to approximate unknown noise characteristics from the data level, and builds an adaptive fusion mechanism without a clear noise model. Moreover, a sequential random finite set filtering (RFS) fusion method based on error entropy is proposed, and an iterative solution method is given. This method can still maintain high-precision target positioning and tracking in the face of random outliers and non-ideal observation conditions. By combining error entropy with the filtering framework, this method can effectively deal with the dynamic changes of random noise and enhance the tracking performance of the system in complex environments."

    "abstract": "Cross-project defect prediction (CPDP) is an important task in software engineering, where data from external projects is used to identify defect-prone modules in a target project that lacks sufficient historical information. However, CPDP remains challenging due to substantial distributional disparities between source and target projects. Many existing methods fail to select appropriate source data for a given target project, which hinders knowledge transfer and degrades predictive performance. To address this challenge, we propose CDA-DANN, a novel framework that combines compatible source project selection with domain-adversarial learning. It introduces a composite similarity metric that jointly captures structural relationships, measured by the Frobenius norm of feature correlation matrices, and distributional divergence, quantified using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. This composite similarity metric guides the selection of the source project that is most compatible with the target. The selected data is subsequently used to train a domain-adversarial neural network (DANN) augmented with a gradient reversal layer, which facilitates the learning of domain-invariant features to improve generalization across projects. We conduct comprehensive experiments on 22 widely used software projects. The results show that CDA-DANN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art CPDP methods, achieving improvements in AUC ranging from 5.48% to 11.59%, and in MCC from 20% to 57.89%. These findings highlight the effectiveness of combining source selection with adversarial feature alignment in achieving reliable and transferable cross-project defect prediction."

Author information was extracted from the SCOPUS database, and Korean names were segmented into syllables to construct a “Korean Name Embedding” using Sentence-BERT (sBERT). A co-occurrence network analysis revealed clusters of Korean names showing more than 5% similarity with names from other Asian countries (e.g., China, Taiwan, Malaysia). The dataset was subsequently used to finetune an sBERT-based baseline model for nationality classification. Evaluation was conducted on 1,005 author names extracted from the Web of Science (WoS) database. The proposed model achieved 89.6% accuracy, substantially outperforming the open-source name2nat package (75.9%) and a tf-idf + logistic regression baseline (77.1%). The findings highlight the feasibility of using name-based embeddings for automated monitoring of researcher inflows and outflows, which are essential for national innovation capacity assessment. Limitations remain due to the globalization of Korean names and potential misclassification risks. Future work will integrate auxiliary features such as institutional affiliation and country of birth into multimodal frameworks."

Synthetic data is also useful for clinical practitioners to address imbalances in datasets or to augment existing data. However, this increased demand for datasets places an additional burden on the communication infrastructure, adding to the existing traffic. T his n ot o nly impacts t he performance o f t he network but also negatively affects sustainability. In this work addresses these issues by introducing a new paradigm, which shifts away from transmitting entire datasets and focuses on local data generation and optimization instead. While this approach has been desirable for a long time, recent developments in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in NLP, have made it now feasible by empowering end-users without technical expertise to perform data optimization. As an exemplary use case, this work demonstrates a large language model (LLM) curated data optimization using synthetic smart insole gait data. Several low-weight LLMs are tasked to assist the curation. It is shown that local light-weight models, which can be deployed even with low-cost clinical IT infrastructure, can support non-experts with the local optimization process of otherwise insufficient synthetic data."

    "abstract": "Agriculture is just one of several industries that has been profoundly impacted by the IIoT’s ability to facilitate data-driven decision-making, real-time monitoring, and improved operational efficiency. But, systems are vulnerable to a variety of cyber threats, such as illegal access, data breaches, and service interruptions, due to the rapid integration of IIoT devices, which also provides substantial cybersecurity risks. The goal of this project is to improve cybersecurity for industrial internet of things (IIoT) devices in agricultural settings by creating and deploying solutions powered by deep learning. The study aspires to enhance threat detection and response mechanisms, therefore providing a solid defense against growing cyber threats, by utilizing advanced neural network designs. The proposed cybersecurity solutions examine massive volumes of data produced by IIoT devices in agricultural settings using deep learning techniques like CNNs and RNNs. We train these algorithms on attack data from the past and regular operational trends so that we may detect anomalies and forecast security breaches in realtime. The goal of this research is to build a proactive cybersecurity framework that can see attacks and make the system more resilient by combining these deep learning models with current security solutions. With an emphasis on agricultural case studies, this research demonstrates the real-world applications of deep learning in securing essential IIoT components such as smart sensors, drones, and automated machinery. When compared to more conventional security measures, early results show that deep learning solutions considerably improve threat detection accuracy while decreasing false positives. Furthermore, the study reveals critical risk avoidance strategies that agricultural businesses may implement to protect their IIoT systems from cybercriminals. This report offers useful insights into the development of effective risk management strategies by producing a thorough overview of the challenges and opportunities related to IIoT cybersecurity in agriculture. Stakeholders can use the conclusions as a roadmap to build strong cybersecurity safeguards that protect the availability, integrity, and security of IIoT systems in agriculture."

This paper adopts a deep edge-centric approach, minimizing reliance on cloud and non-deep edge platforms to improve data privacy, reduce latency and power consumption, and support real-time decision-making. This strategy involves designing lightweight, resource-efficient algorithms that operate on energy -constrained and low -cost deep edge devices, such as the sensors which are essential components to serve metrology purposes. The work is focused on devising on-(ultra tiny)device learning techniques, enabling continuous adaptation to changing conditions while meeting strict power consumption requirements such as the sensor's one. A key contribution is the TinyRBF model, a deeply constrained dynamic Radial Basis Function network tailored for edge devices. TinyRBF addresses the limitations of existing on-device learning methods by balancing prediction accuracy with memory and computational efficiency. Experimental results collected in a challenging agricultural testbed demonstrate its low resource usage and robust performance, making it a scalable solution for real-world applications."

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting, as a next-generation explicit 3D representation paradigm, has emerged as a significant technical pathway for 3D reconstruction in recent years, owing to its highly efficient parallel rendering capabilities. However, existing research indicates that the performance advantages of 3DGS heavily depend on high-quality input images and precise point cloud initialization. In scenarios with low-quality observation data (e.g., motion blur, noise interference), the discrete nature of explicit representations makes the model prone to overfitting observational noise. In such cases, the rendering quality of 3DGS may degrade to levels even worse than the baseline performance of NeRF, significantly limiting its application potential under complex imaging conditions. To address these challenges, this chapter proposes a deblurring 3D Gaussian Splatting framework that integrates frequency-domain information and a masking mechanism. The framework constructs a Transformer-based frequency-domain attention network to extract and discriminate effective frequency-domain features, focusing on refining blurred regions. Additionally, a masking mechanism is introduced to fuse pixel information from blurred and non-blurred regions, enabling fast and clear deblurring for 3D reconstruction. Experimental results demonstrate that our method not only enhances scene rendering efficiency but also effectively removes scene blur, achieving state-of-the-art performance."

The approach centres on a human-centred design process, which is broken down into three key stages: inspiration, ideation, and implementation. This issue has become urgent due to widespread debates on social media, particularly concerning the rise of AI and its potential threat to the creative industry. An ethical framework for AI must emphasise the following principles: utilitarianism—focused on the consideration of pleasure or pain as consequences of actions; rights—the inherent rights of individuals and groups; and virtue—moral actions that shape one's character. These ethical foundations should guide humans before engaging in creative work using AI, to ensure that ethical boundaries in design are not violated. To arrive at the recommended framework, a project-based research method was employed in the creation of 3D character models. The creative process began with original character sketches, followed by style transformation into 3D rendered models using OpenAI ChatGPT. The prototyping phase utilised the AI-based tool Meshy, and the evaluation was conducted through the 3DS Max 3D Editor software.

    "abstract": "Machine learning has great opportunities in early detection of diseases and better patient health treatment. This paper provides a predictive model of medical conditions based on a Kaggle healthcare dataset of demographic, clinical and lifestyle variables. The most important health indicators are age, glucose level, blood pressure, BMI, oxygen saturation, cholesterol, triglycerides, HbA1c, and behavioral indicators, including smoking, alcohol use, and physical exercises. Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree, and Random Forest were four classification models that were considered to determine the most effective model. Accuracy, F1-Score, and ROCAUC were the model performance metrics. The accuracy of the Logistic Regression was 91.37%, Decision Tree $\\mathbf{8 4. 1 6 \\%}$, Random Forest $\\mathbf{9 1. 6 3 \\%}$ and KNN 81.53\\%. The results of ROC-AUC showed a great predictive ability in all models and Logistic Regression and KNN had AUC values exceeding 0.95 in most conditions of significance. Random Forest also presented AUC values over 0.95 in all disorders of significance and especially difficult to classify multi-class disorders, like cancer, diabetes and asthma. The results suggest that ensemble-based approaches could be effective in comparison with traditional classifiers, in dealing with non-linear and high-variance healthcare data. All in all, the suggested predictive models have high potential regarding clinical decision support and preventive healthcare use."

    "abstract": "Human-Machine interaction plays a pivotal role in contemporary industrial and civil environments. Among other sensing technologies, Leap Motion Controller is a non-contact and reliable one to be used for gesture recognition. In this paper, a dataset composed of more than two thousand samples is presented. The data have been collected by 17 subjects performing multiple repetitions of 26 gestures based on the Italian sign language alphabet. The “LEAP-SDGest: Leap Motion static & dynamic gestures” dataset can be adopted for the development of algorithms for both gesture recognition and user identification, for example, in industrial control applications. An architecture leveraging the MQTT protocol is proposed for this purpose, embedding gesture recognition and access control by exploiting classifier models and MQTT topics structure. In order to validate the dataset and proposed methodology, Machine Learning and Deep Learning models for both control tasks were developed. After a preliminary analysis, the Multi-Layer Perceptron proved to be the best solution and was optimized through grid-search. The resulting models reached 91.6% accuracy for user recognition and 97% accuracy on gesture recognition through very lightweight models and reduced pre-processing. Under strong authentication conditions, an end-to-end success rate of 91% was achieved for the entire system that includes access control and user recognition."

    "abstract": "Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks remain a persistent threat to network infrastructure, particularly in cloud-native, IoT, and SDN environments. While traditional machine learning (ML) models offer fast and lightweight classification of anomalous traffic, they often lack transparency and actionable guidance for mitigation. In this research, we propose a novel hybrid architecture that combines the efficiency of traditional ML models (e.g., Random Forest) for real-time DDoS detection with the interpretability of Large Language Models (LLMs) for attack summarization and automated rule generation. The ML part identifies traffic using flow-level characteristics derived from the NetFlow and NSL-KDD data sets, whereas LLMs provide natural language explanations of detected risks and provide mitigation rules suited for fire-wall or SDN-Controllers. We test our approach on the NSL-KDD and CIC-DDoS2019 data-sets(Standard data-set for training and testing DDoS attacks), attaining 96.2% detection accuracy with Random Forest and showing that LLMs can generate consistent, humanaligned interpretations with over 91 % accuracy in rule development. This design strikes a compromise between detection speed and explanation, making it ideal for use in operational security situations. Our findings show that integrating conceptual ML detection and LLM-driven insights can considerably improve the reliability, interpretability, and reactivity of contemporary DDoS defensive solution."

In an increasingly digital and interconnected world, it is essential to discuss the dangers of computer viruses and the measures that may be taken to protect against them among users of personal computers. We applied various machine learning algorithms to detect malware or dangerous threats. A high detection ratio meant that the most accurate algorithm had been chosen to be used within the system. One benefit of the confusion matrix was that it quantified the quantity of false positives and false negatives, which gave more insight into how effectively the system performed. Specifically, it was shown that the results of malware analysis and detection with machine learning algorithms to compute the difference in correlation symmetry integrals could be used to detect harmful traffic on computer systems, thereby improving the security of computer networks. The findings demonstrated that DT (98%), CNN (92.76%), and SVM (93.41%) performed well in terms of detection accuracy when compared to other classifiers. In a specific dataset, the malware detection performances of the DT, CNN, and SVM algorithms on a modest FPR (DT = 2.01%, CNN = 3.97%, and SVM = 4.63%) were examined. These findings are noteworthy since harmful software is growing more prevalent and sophisticated."

    "abstract": "The rapid advancement in Quantum Computing, particularly through Noisy-Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices, has spurred significant interest in Quantum Machine Learning (QML) applications. Despite their potential, fully-quantum algorithms remain impractical due to the limitations of current NISQ devices. Hybrid quantum-classical neural networks (HQNNs) have emerged as a viable alternative, leveraging both quantum and classical computations to enhance machine learning capabilities. However, the constrained resources of NISQ devices, particularly the limited number of qubits, pose significant challenges for executing large-scale quantum circuits. This work addresses these current challenges by proposing a novel and practical methodology for quantum circuit cutting of HQNNs, allowing large quantum circuits to be executed on limited-qubit NISQ devices. Our approach not only preserves the accuracy of the original circuits but also supports the training of quantum parameters across all subcircuits, which is crucial for the learning process in HQNNs. We propose a cutting methodology for HQNNs that employs a greedy algorithm for identifying efficient cutting points, and the implementation of trainable subcircuits, all designed to maximize the utility of NISQ devices in HQNNs. The findings suggest that quantum circuit cutting is a promising technique for advancing QML on current quantum hardware, since the cut circuit achieves comparable accuracy and much lower qubit requirements than the original circuit.

SSIW is formed by punching metallized via holes in the intermediate guide band of the SCPW and the corresponding metal strip. Meanwhile, MCSCPW can simultaneously transmit quasi-TEM mode and TE<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">10</sub> mode at both high and low frequencies. To verify the advantages of the transmission line and the feasibility of its application, a dual-band filtering antenna with a high frequency ratio is proposed based on MCSCPW. The high- and low-frequency filtering antennas are, respectively, realized through the integration method and cascading design method. The proposed dual-band filtering antenna with high frequency ratio works at 5.03/34.4 GHz with a fractional bandwidth of 8.6%/2.9% and a maximum gain of 7.74/2.12 dBi, respectively, while implementing a frequency ratio of 6.84.

    "abstract": "Automatic Optical Inspection (AOI) systems are crucial for quality control in Surface Mount Technology (SMT). Their detection accuracy directly affects the yield and reliability of high-density Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs).However, existing methods still face typical industrial challenges, such as high false negative rates and inconsistent responses to similar components when detecting miniature elements. This paper addresses the specific requirements for PCB component detection in industrial AOI, particularly in scenarios involving small targets and densely parallel distributions. We propose an adaptive integration and optimization of existing frequency-domain and coordinate-aware methods, introducing a Frequency-Coordinate Collaborative Network (FC-YOLO). The model features a dual-branch detection framework, which processes image information in parallel across two dimensions. The coordinate branch uses the CPIE mechanism for high-frequency coordinate encoding, enhancing the model’s spatial invariance and fine detail perception, thereby improving the consistency of responses for parallel components. The frequency-domain branch introduces frequency-domain features and designs the FPDConv module, employing learnable differential convolution kernels to adaptively suppress frequency-domain noise and amplify key frequency components, thus improving detection performance for small targets. The features from both branches are efficiently fused via the FCFF module, and their synergistic effect enhances the detection accuracy and response consistency of miniature components. Experimental results on the public PCBWACV dataset and the self-constructed EAPCB dataset show that the proposed method achieves a 4.5% improvement in mAP50 and a 4.1% improvement in mAP50–95 compared to YOLO11. After deployment on an EAOI system with an RTX 4060Ti GPU, the system achieves real-time detection at 206 FPS. It outperforms existing methods in both false positive and false negative rates, showcasing its potential for engineering applications."

The absence of a logical correlation between corrected depths and extreme off-nadir configurations suggests that Agisoft Metashape does not utilize all available aligned images for dense cloud generation.

Theoretical analysis confirms that nadir flight configurations provide the most reliable results when the photogrammetry software lacks specific camera angle support."

Two RIS configuration strategies are implemented and compared. The first is a partitioning-based approach, primarily adopted in many existing theoretical RIS-NOMA studies but lacking experimental validation, where each user is served by a distinct subset of RIS elements. The second is a proposed weighting-based approach, which leverages power-domain NOMA and successive interference cancellation (SIC) principles to iteratively maximize the weighted sum of the received signal powers, expressed in the dB domain, across all users according to their power allocation coefficients. The performance of both strategies is experimentally evaluated under real-time conditions in terms of bit error rate and further validated through Monte Carlo simulations. The results demonstrate that the proposed weighting-based approach achieves 8-9 dB power improvement and 1-2 dB performance gain over the partitioning-based approach at high signal-to-noise ratios."

    "abstract": "Positron emission tomography (PET) image synthesis is a highly ill-posed problem that requires auxiliary priors to 1) alleviate the loss of high-quality (HQ) information in low-quality (LQ) inputs, and 2) impose additional constraints to reduce mapping uncertainty. However, existing auxiliary priors in PET image synthesis often provide inadequate guidance due to inaccurate prior information or limited prior expressiveness. To overcome the aforementioned limitations, the vector-quantized (VQ) codebook prior is employed as a promising solution. By learning discrete latent feature representations of HQ images through deep models, the VQ codebook prior encompasses accurate HQ information and possesses great expressiveness. Building upon this, we propose a novel two-stage framework, VQPET, that introduces the VQ codebook prior for PET image synthesis. In the first stage, it pretrains a VQGAN on an additional large-scale HQ PET dataset, encoding intrinsic HQ features as code items in the VQ codebook. The VQ codebook prior is thus derived from the high-level features obtained from the pretrained VQGAN and serves as an additional constraint for downstream synthesis. In the second stage, it develops a codebook-prior-guided network (CPGNet) that effectively exploits the VQ codebook prior to produce realistic outputs. Specifically, CPGNet progressively incorporates the VQ codebook prior at multiple decoding levels, providing reliable guidance for HQ synthesis. Compared to previous works, VQPET innovatively leverages additional large-scale HQ datasets to transfer pretrained prior knowledge for enhanced synthesis and functions as a general framework applicable to any encoder-decoder network. Extensive experiments demonstrate the substantial effect and robust generalizability of VQPET."

The proposed approach introduces intentional feedback delays to cancel forward delays without requiring vehicle or delay models, making it robust against modeling errors. Simulations confirm that the proposed method achieves stable acceleration and IVD responses with or without modeling errors in vehicle dynamics, outperforming the Smith predictor in the presence of modeling errors."

    "abstract": "The convergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Mixed Reality (MR) is redefining the landscape of immersive technologies, enabling more adaptive, interactive, and intelligent user experiences. However, while AI continues to shape MR systems, critical human-centered dimensions such as transparency, user control, and ethical design are often overlooked. This scoping review investigates the current state of research at the inter-section of Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HCAI) and MR. Through a structured PRISMA-ScR methodology, several academic studies incorporating human-centered principles into artificial intelligence-driven MR systems have been identified, revealing a fragmented but promising landscape. In addition, non-academic design guidelines developed by major technology companies were also analyzed. The findings highlight a significant gap: existing HCAI frameworks were not conceived with MR in mind and thus fall short of addressing its unique demands, such as immersion, embodiment, and multimodal interaction. Drawing on reusable design patterns and ethical principles from both research and industry, this review lays the groundwork for a dedicated framework, HCAIMR, that can guide the development of immersive systems that are not only intelligent, but also transparent, inclusive, and truly human-centered."

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) now write with a fluency and persuasiveness that can subtly steer users' choices. When their outputs lack clear and comprehensible explanations, this persuasive power risks undermining human decision-making capacity, raising serious ethical concerns. Current explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques focus primarily on technical transparency for epistemic purposes (how a model works); they are rarely intended to reveal to the user the kind of influence they are subject to. Drawing on the Indifference View of manipulation, we advance a preliminary framework that reconceives explainability as both an epistemic and an ethical imperative. The core idea is based on explanatory metadata: layered annotations that accompany model outputs with four complementary types of explanation-informative, justificatory, causal, and precautionary-which give models the ability to detail the reasons underlying the influence they exert. Doing so shifts the XAI goal from mere transparency to responsible influence. It positions explanations as a safeguard against the manipulative behavior of generative AI systems, laying the groundwork for future methods that measure, audit, and actively constrain ethically problematic influence."

    "abstract": "Recommender systems are increasingly vital in e-commerce and social media, yet traditional collaborative filtering and deep learning methods still face challenges in fine-grained interest modeling and data sparsity. Large language models (LLMs), with strong semantic understanding and reasoning capabilities, excel in cold-start and long-tail scenarios. However, the modality gap between low-dimensional collaborative signals and LLMs’ contextual embeddings leads to fusion difficulties and semantic distortion. To address this, we propose SemAlignRec, a unified recommendation framework that enhances fusion through a model-agnostic collaborative–semantic alignment mechanism. Specifically: 1) <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">deep semantic encoding and graph structural enhancement</i>: leveraging LLMs to encode user and item textual attributes into high-quality semantic embeddings, which are further refined by a multilayer deep semantic encoder; a graph enhancement module incorporating residual connections, node attention, and graph perturbations strengthens collaborative embeddings and facilitates their fusion with semantic embeddings; and 2) <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">transmodal fusion and self-supervised optimization</i>: integrating multihead attention, gated fusion, and contrastive self-supervision to achieve precise fusion of collaborative and semantic embeddings. Experiments on multiple datasets show that SemAlignRec delivers substantial performance gains, achieving an overall average improvement of about 6.6% over the compared baselines. In particular, compared with the latest baseline DALR, SemAlignRec obtains an average gain of approximately 9.8% on key metrics for the Amazon and Yelp datasets, demonstrating its strong practical potential."

Therefore, a major evaluation criterion of TTS outputs is their naturalness, usually measured through a Mean Opinion Score (MOS). Naturalness is not a well-defined property, however. This paper decomposes naturalness into eight specific dimensions, based on how judges define the term. We then evaluate the outputs of the systems submitted to the Blizzard 2025 Challenge based on these new dimensions and compare the results with alternative evaluations of naturalness. This includes recent subjective human evaluations that were performed by the 2025 Blizzard Challenge organizers, as well as various automatic MOS methods. Based on this analysis, we propose to use five dimensions in place of a single, primitive notion of naturalness: Clarity, Fluency, Human-vs-Computer, Pronunciation, and Understandability. We propose that these would serve as the basis of a better evaluation framework for advanced TTS systems."

    "abstract": "The fast pace of development in cyber threats and the growing complexity of digital infrastructures require the creation of robust and new solutions. Quantum computing together with machine learning lead to the development of quantum-enhanced intelligent systems, which holds exceptional promise in overcoming the limitations of contemporary cybersecurity paradigms. This research investigates the prospects of Quantum Machine Learning (QML) to improve cybersecurity, exploiting quantum computing’s capability of handling significantly larger datasets at a considerably faster rate than classical systems. Through its examination of quantum computing paradigms, this research aims to inform the future of cybersecurity solutions and advance safeguards against quantum-enabled adversarial entities, with a focus on ethics, transparency, security, and scalability. Quantum Computing is considered as the future of decryption as the accessible state-of-the-art decryption methods can be broken in the quantum world. For example, quantum cryptographic protocols like quantum key distribution techniques (QKD) will enable theoretically unbreakable encryption and thus help in securing sensitive data. In the meantime, quantum-enhanced models for machine learning have the potential to understand complex patterns through cybersecurity data, which will lead to more accurate threat detection and decreased false positives. We also elucidate the ethical implications of quantum cybersecurity systems, addressing fairness, privacy, and transparency in algorithmic decisions. Furthermore, the study emphasizes the need to design scalable quantum algorithms to enable practical applications in large-scale cybersecurity. This study demonstrates the potential of quantum-enhanced intelligent systems in transforming cybersecurity by enabling stronger defenses against dynamic cyber threats while assuring transparency and ethical use of AI methodologies. The research also details challenges, including the current hardware limitations of quantum computers and the need for regulatory frameworks to oversee AI developed using quantum processes. Our world is facing many challenges and quantumenhanced intelligent systems might precisely be the change that can reshape the future of secure, scalable and ethical cybersecurity infrastructures by addressing them."

In this study, multi-channel EEG signals corresponding to different MI classes were acquired from various subjects by placing sensors on the scalp. The acquired EEG signals were initially decomposed into five frequency sub-bands (EEG rhythms), by segmenting into 2-second overlapping windows. For each rhythm, a multi-layer functional brain network (FBN) has been constructed utilizing WVG, and the resulting functional brain connectivity matrices (FBC) were mapped into RGB images, which were further classified through a lightweight custom ConvNeXt model. In this work, subject independent evaluation was performed using a leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) protocol with stratified 10-fold cross-validation. Experimental validation on two datasets- BCI Competition IV-2a and High Gamma Dataset (HGD), yielded accuracies of 90.20% and 96.1%, respectively. The analysis reveals physiological meaningful connectivity patterns such as contralateral <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">β</i>-band connectivity in BCI IV-2a and enhanced inter-hemispheric <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">γ</i>-band integration in HGD.

    "abstract": "Orbital pursuit–evasion games have attracted increasing attention in recent years. Most existing studies focus on extremely close-range continuous maneuvering scenarios, while medium- and long-range impulsive maneuvering problems are often studied under simplified assumptions, such as synchronous decision-making and maneuver execution, or fixed information measurement delays. In practice, however, satellite maneuver execution typically lags behind decision-making due to control delays and decision validation processes, and the measurement of orbital information is also subject to non-fixed delays caused by environmental and operational factors. To account for this characteristic, this paper considers a non-fixed-duration turn-based orbital pursuit–evasion game setting, in which decision-making and maneuver execution do not occur synchronously and the execution delay is determined by the spacecraft itself. Within this setting, a History-aware and Predictive Result Reward Proximal Policy Optimization (HPRR-PPO) method and an alternating reinforcement learning training scheme are developed. By introducing a predictive result reward and a history-aware terminal reward, the proposed method provides more informative learning signals under non-fixed-duration turn-based interactions. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves better task performance and training efficiency than several baseline methods in the considered orbital pursuit–evasion scenarios."

    "abstract": "Cloud computing has developed as an effective computing system for both business organizations and cloud consumers. Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) create the data centers and computing resources with better effectiveness for stratifying the requirements of the cloud consumers. The consumers mainly concentrate on the duration of response, while the CSPs are disturbed during revenue creation. Effective and accurate resource allocation has the capacity to offer better user satisfaction and improve resource usage. Moreover, the most accurate outcome in resource allocation is attained via an active load-balancing model to balance the workload. It can also assist in preventing bottlenecks and reducing resource usage; therefore, identifying optimal scheduling techniques is still hard. To overcome these challenges, an efficient optimal resource allocation for the load balancing method is designed. In the cloud, optimal resource allocation helps to manage workloads successfully, guaranteeing that significant applications obtain the required resources. In this proposed model, the optimization of resources is done with the help of a Ring Toss Game (RTG)--based optimization algorithm. Finally, to increase the load ability, objective functions like makespan, execution time, throughput, delay, success rate, and average resource utilization are considered. The main aim of optimization is to reduce the number of active servers and to improve the scalability of the cloud system. Thus, this developed model reduces the risk of overloading by minimizing the specific resources, leading to increased system stability and reliability. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed network is investigated by employing several performance measures."

In experimental analysis, the lesson-completion rate has improved by 23%, the number of repetitive errors reduced by 19% and the number of active daily uses increased by 28% relative to static sequencing. These findings indicate that reinforcement learning can be important in boosting efficiency as well as long-term engagement. It finishes with conclusions of scalable applications in a variety of linguistic settings and defines routes of wider educational application."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a geometric approach for facial motion transfer, utilizing Delaunay triangulation and affine transformations to animate a static source image using motion extracted from a driving video. By leveraging MediaPipe’s FaceMesh for real-time detection of 478 facial landmarks, the method partitions the face into triangular regions and applies affine transformations to align these regions with the driving video’s motion. A Savitzky–Golay filter ensures temporal smoothness, mitigating jitter and enhancing visual coherence. Evaluated on the VoxCeleb dataset, the approach demonstrates superior structural fidelity, identity preservation, and temporal consistency compared to deep learning methods like First Order Motion Model (FOMM) and Thin Plate Spline Motion Model (TPSM). The method’s transparency and computational efficiency make it ideal for controlled facial animations in applications such as virtual storytelling, avatar creation, and educational visualizations."

    "abstract": "Water pipeline leakages create significant environmental challenges worldwide. Machine learning (ML) is widely used for leakage detection, often based on time and frequency features. However, feature selection is time-consuming and challenging for both binary (leak/no leak) and multi-class (leak type) classification. The Wavelet Scattering Transform (WST) provides translation-invariant, deformation-stable features automatically, but the effect of parameter selection on classifier performance remains underexplored. This study investigates how key WST parameters, specifically the number of wavelets per octave and the invariance scale, influence the performance of a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier using acceleration, pressure, and hydrophone data from a benchmarking laboratory dataset. Manual features were also extracted, selected with the minimum redundancy maximum relevance algorithm, and evaluated using SVM, Decision Tree (DT), and Random Forest classifiers. Optimizing WST parameters improved accuracy by 9.65% over prior work, reaching 99.16% with acceleration data in branched topology using 2 wavelets per octave and an invariance scale of 0.04. In contrast, manual features peaked at 82.5% with DT and 15 features. Classifier performance also varied with feature quantity, averaging 8.42% across modalities. Overall, WST-based features outperform manual extraction for leakage classification, supporting more robust data-driven leak detection systems."

The biological inspiration enables such algorithms to enhance routing tactics and resource sharing along with message scheduling procedures in DTNs and, therefore, ensures the provision of an increased network throughput with enhanced packet delivery ratios, together with minimized latency. The research develops novel DTN routing algorithms based on bio-inspired optimisation techniques to address issues of mobility, intermittent connection, and reduced power consumption. This research has both simulated trials and real-world DTN deployments for determining the effectiveness of new protocols and comparing their execution against existing ones to show how bio-inspired approaches increase DTN reliability and stability.

Among NTN platforms, high altitude platform stations (HAPSs) have emerged as a promising solution to provide Internet connectivity to underserved regions, including rural areas, islands, and maritime zones, where traditional infrastructure deployment is costly and challenging to deploy. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of large-scale HAPS deployment to connect island and maritime users, considering real-world shadowing effects on part of HAPSs caused by the presence of island building clusters. We first analyze the coverage performance of onshore (island) and offshore (remote sea) users, in which the channels between HAPSs and the user follow the shadowed Rician distributions and Rician distributions, respectively. Next, we introduce an evaluation method for nearshore users in a hybrid channel environment with HAPSs, and propose approximations that can reduce computational complexity. Based on the simulation results, we discuss how the distance from the island boundary (i.e. the relative remoteness of maritime users) affects coverage performance under different HAPS densities. We also emphasize the importance of choosing a balanced HAPS density or an advanced HAPS deployment scheme."

    "abstract": "Nonstabilizerness is a fundamental resource for quantum advantage, as it quantifies the extent to which a quantum state diverges from those states that can be efficiently simulated on a classical computer, the stabilizer states. The stabilizer Rényi entropy (SRE) is one of the most investigated measures of nonstabilizerness because of its computational properties and suitability for experimental measurements on quantum processors. Because computing the SRE for arbitrary quantum states is a computationally hard problem, we propose a supervised machine-learning approach to estimate it. In this work, we frame SRE estimation as a regression task and train a Random Forest Regressor and a Support Vector Regressor (SVR) on a comprehensive dataset, including both unstructured random quantum circuits and structured circuits derived from the physics-motivated one-dimensional transverse Ising model (TIM). We compare the machine-learning models using two different quantum circuit representations: one based on classical shadows and the other on circuit-level features. Furthermore, we assess the generalization capabilities of the models on out-of-distribution instances. Experimental results show that an SVR trained on circuit-level features achieves the best overall performance. On the random circuits dataset, our approach converges to accurate SRE estimations, but struggles to generalize out of distribution. In contrast, it generalizes well on the structured TIM dataset, even to deeper and larger circuits. In line with previous work, our experiments suggest that machine learning offers a viable path for efficient nonstabilizerness estimation."

    "abstract": "Precise pointer information is essential for dataflow analysis. While flow-sensitive pointer analysis yields highly precise results, it introduces more computations. To provide a better trade-off between precision and performance, prior work has developed LEVPA, a pointer analysis that processes pointers according to their pointer level, generally accelerating the analysis. However, LevPA still performs redundant computations for intermediate variables that are generated during Static Single Assignment (SSA) transformation. For real-world programs, we have observed that those variables may constitute up to 87 % of all analyzed variables. These unnecessary computations cause LEVPA to timeout for large programs. To address these limitations, we present Level-based Intermediate variable Skipping Pointer Analysis (LisPA), an enhancement of LevPA that operates on a def-use graph without computing points-to set of intermediate variables introduced during SSA transformation. The key insight behind LISPA is that intermediate variables do not introduce new pointers into the analysis, because they always alias with variables in the original program. Therefore, there is no need to compute their points-to set in a fixed-point computation. Across 27 real-world C/C++ programs, we show that LISPA is on average <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$2.14 \\times$</tex> faster than LevPA, while using <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$2.38 \\times$</tex> less memory."

To address these challenges, we investigate secure online offloading of large-scale dependent tasks in distributed edge-assisted IoV environments and develops a blockchain-assisted multi-level feedback queue framework that ensures transparent task registration, tamper-proof execution logs, and fairness among vehicular nodes. To optimize the offloading strategy under dynamic and uncertain system states, the problem is formulated as a multi-stage mixed-integer nonlinear program, and a trust-aware blockchain reinforcement learning algorithm (TaBRL) is developed. The blockchain consensus layer provides verifiable feedback to guide adaptive learning and strengthen decision reliability.

In the circuit design, the bridge amplification circuit and filter circuit are combined based on the output characteristics of the half-bridge circuit. The millivolt-level output voltage of the Wheatstone bridge is amplified to the volt level, and a second-order RC filter is employed to effectively suppress high-frequency noise and ensure signal integrity. In the design of the amplification circuit, different amplification factors are applied to the three-dimensional force channel and the three-dimensional torque channel, and signal enhancement is achieved through a two-stage amplification scheme. In the design of the analog-to-digital conversion module, the MAX11254 chip is selected, which features an 8x gain and a pre-amplification circuit to form a two-stage amplification structure, thereby realizing high-precision analog-to-digital conversion. Finally, the STM32F103 series microprocessor is used as the main control processing module to implement data acquisition and transmission functions. This design not only ensures measurement accuracy but also significantly reduces system costs and power consumption, providing reliable technical support for the practical application of the six-dimensional force sensor."

Security Operations Center (SOC) analysts are tasked with monitoring and analyzing this vast data to identify potential threats and take preventive actions to protect enterprise assets. However, the diversity among SIEM platforms, such as Palo Alto Networks Qradar, Google SecOps, Splunk, Microsoft Sentinel and the Elastic Stack, poses significant challenges. As these systems differ in attributes, architecture, and query languages, making it difficult for analysts to effectively monitor multiple platforms without undergoing extensive training or forcing enterprises to expand their workforce. To address this issue, we introduce SynRAG, a unified framework that automatically generates threat detection or incident investigation queries for multiple SIEM platforms from a platform-agnostic specification. SynRAG can generate platformspecific queries from a single high-level specification written by analysts. Without SynRAG, analysts would need to manually write separate queries for each SIEM platform, since query languages vary significantly across systems. This framework enables seamless threat detection and incident investigation across heterogeneous SIEM environments, reducing the need for specialized training and manual query translation. We evaluate SynRAG against state-of-the-art language models, including GPT, Llama, DeepSeek, Gemma, and Claude, using Qradar and SecOps as representative SIEM systems. Our results demonstrate that SynRAG generates significantly better queries for crossSIEM threat detection and incident investigation compared to the state-of-the-art base models."

This paper presents an automated way to create academic schedules, using a combination of the latest optimization techniques and a scalable web-based design to produce consistent schedules without any conflicts. The method of scheduling used in this work is called “blended” since it involves the use of both binary decision-making methods (odds/evens) represented by a mathematical model and evolutionary search techniques using a Constraint Solving API that allow for the use of a variety of methods to determine the best schedule given specific academic requirements, such as instructor availability, classroom capacity, program arrangement, and student needs. The architecture for this scheduling system includes Angular as a means of allowing for an interactive experience for users, while the Spring Boot technology enables the rapid generation of schedules that support both on-campus and hybrid format instructional delivery. Real data from a university’s departments demonstrated that the system significantly decreases schedule conflicts, provides better use of classroom and staff time, and provides schedules that are more closely aligned with the university’s overall priorities than schedules produced with current scheduling methods. Thus, the results of this project indicate that universities may benefit from using this type of scheduling framework as they seek to modernize their scheduling practices by integrating advanced decision-making support into academic planning processes."

    "abstract": "The rapid proliferation of unmanned aerial vehicles has created new challenges in surveillance, defence, and air-traffic safety. Conventional radar or vision-based systems fall short under poor lighting, occlusion, or low radar cross-section, hence motivating the need for acoustic detection. Drone rotors generate unique harmonic and broadband signatures that can be captured through microphones, but these signals are easily masked by ambient environmental noise. We propose MR-CA-AST, a Multi-Resolution Channel-Attention Audio Spectrogram Transformer that effectively combines local convolutional denoising and global Transformer-based temporal modelling. The model employs two convolutional branches running on high and low-resolution Melspectrograms, further empowered by a channel-attention mechanism suppressing irrelevant frequency bands. The combined embeddings are then tokenised using patch embedding and processed by a Transformer encoder to learn from long-range temporal correlations. Experimental results on the Drone Audio Detection Samples dataset (DADS) with 180,320 samples show that the proposed architecture attained a test accuracy of 99.57%, F1-score of 0.995, and ROC-AUC of 0.998, outperforming existing CNN, CRNN, and AST baselines. This method exhibits strong robustness under conditions with heterogeneous noise and forms a promising basis for further integration with distributed acoustic sensing systems in covert drone tracking."

    "abstract": "Micro Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS) are miniature devices that integrate electrical and mechanical components, typically operating at the micrometer scale. Due to their compact size and lightweight nature, MEMS are particularly advantageous for applications in the medical field, supporting system miniaturization. One significant application is the microgripper, a MEMS device used for manipulating, holding, and transferring microparticles. Specialized microgrippers are designed to address the challenges of handling micro-optical and micro-electrical components at the nano or micrometer level. During the gripping process, reactive forces are generated between the microgripper arms and the object being held. For objects with curved or rounded surfaces, these response forces act perpendicularly. The behavior of the object during the gripping motion is typically influenced by these forces. Various microgripper designs have been developed for micro-assembly applications using polypropylene material and a mechanical actuator. Under an applied pressure of 5000 $\\boldsymbol{\\mu} \\mathbf{P a}$, the gripper structures exhibit displacements of $\\mathbf{1 6 6. 5 6 ~} \\boldsymbol{\\mu} \\mathbf{m}$, $130.09 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$, and $31.598 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$. The design and analysis of the microgrippers were conducted using COMSOL Multiphysics software."

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the performance of low-power Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) communication systems employing Radio Frequency Energy Harvesting (RFEH) over Rayleigh fading channels under Imperfect Channel Estimation (ICE). A closed-form expression for the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) probability density function (PDF) is derived by incorporating the EH power splitting ratio ($\\beta$) and the channel estimation error parameter (B). Using this formulation, average bit error rate (ABER) is analytically evaluated for both coherent and non-coherent modulation schemes. In addition, channel capacity is analyzed as a key performance metric to assess spectral efficiency. The results show that increasing the EH power splitting factor ($\\beta$) significantly improves system performance by reducing ABER and enhancing channel capacity, even in the presence of estimation errors. However, the interaction between modulation type and ICE introduces trade-offs that critically impact system performance, particularly in low-power environments such as Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). The proposed analysis provides valuable insights for optimizing EH-based MIMO systems operating under practical constraints of limited energy and imperfect Channel Side Information(CSI)."

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a machine learning-based assessment algorithm for evaluating safety and interest aspects of toilet spaces in rural kindergartens. The algorithm employs a multi-modal feature fusion approach that combines visual features, environmental sensor data, and spatial attributes through an attention-based mechanism. We designed a two-branch neural network architecture incorporating modified ResNet-50 for visual feature extraction and LSTM networks for processing temporal environmental data. The assessment model utilizes an adaptive weighting mechanism to balance different feature types and adjust to varying environmental conditions. To validate our approach, we collected data from 15 rural kindergartens over six months, including 3,000 spatial images and 180,000 environmental sensor readings. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves 94.2% accuracy in space assessment, outperforming traditional approaches by 5.9-10.7%. The system maintains stable performance across different lighting conditions and occupancy levels, with only a 2.3% accuracy drop under challenging conditions. Real-world testing confirms the system's effectiveness in providing consistent and reliable assessments while maintaining real-time processing capabilities."

    "abstract": "Developing controllers for physiologically accurate musculoskeletal models is a significant challenge due to the morphological mismatch between generic motion data and specific models. This paper proposes a data-driven pipeline to generate high-fidelity reference motions for a target musculoskeletal model. The proposed pipeline optimizes an anatomical skeleton's shape to match the target model, significantly reducing the initial root-aligned Mean Per-Joint Position Error (MPJPE) by 67% (from 45.90 mm to 15.19 mm). This shape-aligned skeleton is then utilized to retarget motion data, generating tailored reference motions via inverse kinematics. Subsequently, this processed data is used to train control policies for a complex lower-body model with 86 muscle actuators. On walking and sit-to-stand tasks, the trained policies achieve low tracking errors, with the best performance reaching a global MPJPE of 28.27 mm and 26.82 mm, respectively. A comparative analysis of Proximal Policy Optimization and Soft Actor-Critic demonstrates that the proposed framework enables stable and accurate motion imitation in this high-dimensional control context."

    "abstract": "Human emotion is at the heart of all that makes a person human. It forms our choices, fuels our creativity, and, in the ultimate respect, defines our relationships. Human emotions shape how one would act, judge, or even communicate. With Emotion AI, an alleged subset of artificial intelligence said to make it possible for it to replicate the human ability of detecting, understanding, and then reproducing emotions, machines can truly have a more meaningful and organic form of chat. The paper tackles the implementation of psychological theories of emotion in AI research and development, especially within the main frameworks of the basic emotions of Paul Ekman, Plutchik's wheel of emotions, and dimensional models such as valence-arousal. Such models were the pillars of developing intelligence systems into recognizing emotions from faces, pitch of voice, and analyzing text. What if these machines learned emotions? And we get into it in this paper. This paper reveals how emotion theories in psychology-from Ekman's six basic emotions to Plutchik's colorful wheel-are redoing the future of AI. From the interpretation of delight in a smile to empathizing through conversation, these models are the heart and soul of emotionally intelligent AI systems. Our journey discusses their real-world impact, the challenges we face, and the ethical lines we have to carefully tread."

    "abstract": "Detecting and categorizing defects should be addressed as distinct issues within the domain of artificial vision. With the increasing demand for surface quality assurance in industrial automation, automated defect detection using computer vision has gained significant interest. Recent advances in visual inspection techniques for structural surfaces that enabled their use in efficient and adaptable manufacturing environments. Nevertheless, formulating a global inspection framework based on manually extracted features remains a considerable challenge, especially for both uniform and irregularly textured surfaces. To overcome such existing issues, a novel attention-based model is introduced for detecting visual defects in industrial automation. Primarily, the input images are gathered from the benchmark datasets. Consequently, the collected images are fed as input to the Multihead Attention-based Convolutional Vision Transformer (MA-ConvViT) for classifying the visual defects. At last, the performance of the system is examined using different evaluation metrics and compared with other baseline methodologies. Therefore, the better results demonstrate that the proposed work has the potential to effectively classify the visual defects."
