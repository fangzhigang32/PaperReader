    "abstract": "This paper documents our efforts in releasing the printed and audio book of the translation of the famous novel The Little Prince into the Chakavian dialect, as a computer-readable, AI-ready dataset, with the textual and the audio components of the two releases now aligned on the level of each written and spoken word. Our motivation for working on this release is multiple. The first one is our wish to preserve the highly valuable and specific content beyond the small editions of the printed and the audio book. With the dataset published in the CLARIN.SI repository, this content is from now on at the fingertips of any interested individual. The second motivation is to make the data available for various artificial-intelligence-related usage scenarios, such as the one we follow upon inside this paper already -- adapting the Whisper-large-v3 open automatic speech recognition model, with decent performance on standard Croatian, to Chakavian dialectal speech. We can happily report that with adapting the model, the word error rate on the selected test data has being reduced to a half, while we managed to remove up to two thirds of the error on character level. We envision many more usages of this dataset beyond the set of experiments we have already performed, both on tasks of artificial intelligence research and application, as well as dialectal research. The third motivation for this release is our hope that this, now highly structured dataset, will be transformed into a digital online edition of this work, allowing individuals beyond the research and technology communities to enjoy the beauty of the message of the little boy in the desert, told through the spectacular prism of the Chakavian dialect."

    "abstract": "This paper elaborates on the implications of the relationship between the Second and Third Laws and provides a comprehensive formal and historical justification for the logical redundancy of the Nernst heat theorem. By revisiting the Nernst-Einstein debate, the underlying hypotheses that lead to the traditional view of the Third Law as an independent postulate are examined. It is argued that the historical rejection of Nernst's proof -- motivated by Einstein's insistence on the practical non-performability of cycles at absolute zero -- overlooks the fact that a universal Second Law already precludes such cycles, rendering an independent Third Law an unnecessary complexity. Ultimately, the Nernst theorem is shown to be an essential consistency regulator rather than an independent physical discovery."

    "abstract": "Cognition is increasingly framed in terms of information processing, yet most fMRI analyses focus on activation or functional connectivity rather than quantifying how information is stored and transferred. To remedy this problem, we propose a framework for estimating measures of information processing: active information storage (AIS), transfer entropy (TE), and net synergy from task-based fMRI. AIS measures information maintained within a region, TE captures directed information flow, and net synergy contrasts higher-order synergistic to redundant interactions. Crucially, to enable this framework we utilised a recently developed approach for calculating information-theoretic measures: the cross mutual information. This approach combines resting-state and task data to address the challenges of limited sample size, non-stationarity and context in task-based fMRI. We applied this framework to the working memory (N-back) task from the Human Connectome Project (470 participants). Results show that AIS increases in fronto-parietal regions with working memory load, TE reveals enhanced directed information flows across control pathways, and net synergy indicates a global shift to redundancy. This work establishes a novel methodology for quantifying information processing in task-based fMRI."

    "abstract": "With the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), general-purpose agents have seen fundamental advancements. However, evaluating these agents presents unique challenges that distinguish them from static QA benchmarks. We observe that current agent benchmarks are heavily confounded by extraneous factors, including system prompts, toolset configurations, and environmental dynamics. Existing evaluations often rely on fragmented, researcher-specific frameworks where the prompt engineering for reasoning and tool usage varies significantly, making it difficult to attribute performance gains to the model itself. Additionally, the lack of standardized environmental data leads to untraceable errors and non-reproducible results. This lack of standardization introduces substantial unfairness and opacity into the field. We propose that a unified evaluation framework is essential for the rigorous advancement of agent evaluation. To this end, we introduce a proposal aimed at standardizing agent evaluation."

    "abstract": "The escalating scale of Large Language Models (LLMs) necessitates efficient adaptation techniques. Model merging has gained prominence for its efficiency and controllability. However, existing merging techniques typically serve as post-hoc refinements or focus on mitigating task interference, often failing to capture the dynamic optimization benefits of supervised fine-tuning (SFT). In this work, we propose Streaming Merging, an innovative model updating paradigm that conceptualizes merging as an iterative optimization process. Central to this paradigm is \\textbf{ARM} (\\textbf{A}ctivation-guided \\textbf{R}otation-aware \\textbf{M}erging), a strategy designed to approximate gradient descent dynamics. By treating merging coefficients as learning rates and deriving rotation vectors from activation subspaces, ARM effectively steers parameter updates along data-driven trajectories. Unlike conventional linear interpolation, ARM aligns semantic subspaces to preserve the geometric structure of high-dimensional parameter evolution. Remarkably, ARM requires only early SFT checkpoints and, through iterative merging, surpasses the fully converged SFT model. Experimental results across model scales (1.7B to 14B) and diverse domains (e.g., math, code) demonstrate that ARM can transcend converged checkpoints. Extensive experiments show that ARM provides a scalable and lightweight framework for efficient model adaptation."

    "abstract": "This paper explores effective numerical feature embedding for Click-Through Rate prediction in streaming environments. Conventional static binning methods rely on offline statistics of numerical distributions; however, this inherently two-stage process often triggers semantic drift during bin boundary updates. While neural embedding methods enable end-to-end learning, they often discard explicit distributional information. Integrating such information end-to-end is challenging because streaming features often violate the i.i.d. assumption, precluding unbiased estimation of the population distribution via the expectation of order statistics. Furthermore, the critical context dependency of numerical distributions is often neglected. To this end, we propose DAES, an end-to-end framework designed to tackle numerical feature embedding in streaming training scenarios by integrating distributional information with an adaptive modulation mechanism. Specifically, we introduce an efficient reservoir-sampling-based distribution estimation method and two field-aware distribution modulation strategies to capture streaming distributions and field-dependent semantics. DAES significantly outperforms existing approaches as demonstrated by extensive offline and online experiments and has been fully deployed on a leading short-video platform with hundreds of millions of daily active users."

We investigate how maternal breastfeeding during this period has shaped offspring health and human capital outcomes in the UK. We use a within-family design, comparing children who were breastfed to their sibling(s) who were not. Our results show that breastfeeding increases adult height, as well as fluid intelligence, but does not affect educational attainment, nor adult BMI. In further analyses, we examine whether and how this impact varies with individuals' genetic \"predisposition\" for these outcomes, proxied by the outcome-specific polygenic index. We find that the \"height-returns\" to breastfeeding are larger among those genetically predisposed to be taller, with no genetic heterogeneity for the other outcomes, though we note that power in the within-family GxE analysis is more limited. Overall, our estimates suggest that breastfeeding plays a non-negligible role in child development."

However, high-performance trackers often suffer from slow processing speeds, making them impractical for deployment on resource-constrained devices. To alleviate this issue, we propose FARTrack, a Fast Auto-Regressive Tracking framework. Since autoregression emphasizes the temporal nature of the trajectory sequence, it can maintain high performance while achieving efficient execution across various devices. FARTrack introduces Task-Specific Self-Distillation and Inter-frame Autoregressive Sparsification, designed from the perspectives of shallow-yet-accurate distillation and redundant-to-essential token optimization, respectively. Task-Specific Self-Distillation achieves model compression by distilling task-specific tokens layer by layer, enhancing the model's inference speed while avoiding suboptimal manual teacher-student layer pairs assignments. Meanwhile, Inter-frame Autoregressive Sparsification sequentially condenses multiple templates, avoiding additional runtime overhead while learning a temporally-global optimal sparsification strategy. FARTrack demonstrates outstanding speed and competitive performance. It delivers an AO of 70.6% on GOT-10k in real-time. Beyond, our fastest model achieves a speed of 343 FPS on the GPU and 121 FPS on the CPU."

Recent advances in monocular depth estimation have demonstrated the potential of low-cost cameras as depth sensors; however, their adoption in field robotics remains limited due to the absence of reliable scale cues, ambiguous or low-texture conditions, and the scarcity of large-scale datasets. To address these challenges, we propose a depth completion model that trains on synthetic data and uses extremely sparse measurements from depth sensors to predict dense metric depth in unseen field robotics environments. A synthetic dataset generation pipeline tailored to field robotics enables the creation of multiple realistic datasets for training purposes. This dataset generation approach utilizes textured 3D meshes from Structure from Motion and photorealistic rendering with novel viewpoint synthesis to simulate diverse field robotics scenarios. Our approach achieves an end-to-end latency of 53 ms per frame on a Nvidia Jetson AGX Orin, enabling real-time deployment on embedded platforms. Extensive evaluation demonstrates competitive performance across diverse real-world field robotics scenarios."

    "abstract": "High-harmonic generation (HHG) from liquids offers a potential pathway to attosecond spectroscopy in chemically complex and disordered environments, yet fundamental questions remain open: whether liquid harmonic emission preserves well-defined attosecond synchronization, and whether harmonic emission can involve simultaneous contributions from multiple quantum trajectories with distinct excursion times despite strong disorder and scattering. Here, we address these issues experimentally by resolving the trajectory-dependent temporal structure of liquid HHG. By optimizing the laser focusing geometry, we achieve clear spatial discrimination of short- and long-trajectory contributions, providing direct evidence for the existence of multiple quantum trajectories in liquids. Using a phase-controlled two-color driving field, we independently retrieve the attochirp associated with each trajectory and demonstrate opposite energy-time correlations for short and long trajectories, establishing a trajectory-resolved energy-time mapping in liquid HHG. All observations are well reproduced by semiclassical recollision simulations. These results place liquid HHG on the same conceptual footing as gas- and solid-phase HHG and establish a robust foundation for attosecond-resolved spectroscopy of ultrafast electronic and chemical dynamics in liquid environments."

While group algebras are known to be symmetric over any field, it is natural to ask whether this property extends to Hecke algebras. To study this, we introduce the new concepts of $p$-$S$-permutation groups (for a prime $p$) and $S$-permutation groups. A \\emph{ $p$-$S$-permutation group} is a transitive permutation group whose associated Hecke algebra is symmetric over every field of characteristic $p$. An \\emph{ $S$-permutation group} is a transitive permutation group that is a $p$-$S$-permutation group for all primes $p$. In this paper, we study Hecke algebras from a group-theoretical perspective and we show that several classes of permutation groups are $p$-$S$-permutation groups and $S$-permutation groups in our sense. This result represents a substantial extension of earlier work by Li and He.

    "abstract": "Understanding the mechanism of turbulent skin-friction drag (TSD) generation is of fundamental and practical importance for designing effective drag reduction strategies. However, many previous studies adopted correlation analysis to reveal the causal map between turbulent motions and TSD generation, an approach that is potentially risky as correlation does not necessarily imply causation. In this study, a novel causal inference method called Liang-Kleeman information flow (LKIF) is utilized for the first time to identify the velocity-induced causal structures related to TSD generation in a turbulent channel flow. The statistical properties of the causal structures are comprehensively investigated. The positive and negative causal structures, defined by their signs and respectively associated with an increase and decrease in TSD information entropy, promote and suppress the generation of extreme TSD. Particularly, we find that the underlying physics of causal structures is essentially associated with the processes of streamwise streaks and rolls approaching or receding from the extreme events. Results indicate that the physics-informed LKIF framework can reveal a more explicit and interpretable causal relationship than correlation analysis."

While recent deep networks achieve high-quality restoration, their full-precision designs remain costly for deployment. Binarization offers an extreme compression regime by quantizing both activations and weights to 1-bit. Yet, it has been rarely studied for demoiréing and performs poorly when naively applied. In this work, we propose BinaryDemoire, a binarized demoiréing framework that explicitly accommodates the frequency structure of moiré degradations. First, we introduce a moiré-aware binary gate (MABG) that extracts lightweight frequency descriptors together with activation statistics. It predicts channel-wise gating coefficients to condition the aggregation of binary convolution responses. Second, we design a shuffle-grouped residual adapter (SGRA) that performs structured sparse shortcut alignment. It further integrates interleaved mixing to promote information exchange across different channel partitions. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed BinaryDemoire surpasses current binarization methods. Code: https://github.com/zhengchen1999/BinaryDemoire."

In each round, an agent chooses among $K$ candidate links/servers (arms) whose performance is a stochastic $d$-dimensional vector (e.g., throughput, latency, energy, reliability). The key interaction is \\emph{probe-then-commit (PtC)}: the agent may probe up to $q>1$ candidates via control-plane measurements to observe their vector outcomes, but must execute exactly one candidate in the data plane. This limited multi-arm feedback regime strictly interpolates between classical bandits ($q=1$) and full-information experts ($q=K$), yet existing multi-objective learning theory largely focuses on these extremes. We develop \\textsc{PtC-P-UCB}, an optimistic probe-then-commit algorithm whose technical core is frontier-aware probing under uncertainty in a Pareto mode, e.g., it selects the $q$ probes by approximately maximizing a hypervolume-inspired frontier-coverage potential and commits by marginal hypervolume gain to directly expand the attained Pareto region. We prove a dominated-hypervolume frontier error of $\\tilde{O} (K_P d/\\sqrt{qT})$, where $K_P$ is the Pareto-frontier size and $T$ is the horizon, and scalarized regret $\\tilde{O} (L_φd\\sqrt{(K/q)T})$, where $φ$ is the scalarizer. These quantify a transparent $1/\\sqrt{q}$ acceleration from limited probing. We further extend to \\emph{multi-modal probing}: each probe returns $M$ modalities (e.g., CSI, queue, compute telemetry), and uncertainty fusion yields variance-adaptive versions of the above bounds via an effective noise scale."

Our algorithm promotes efficient exploration of the target distribution by combining global sampling mechanisms with a delayed weighting procedure. The proposed weighting mechanism plays a key role by enabling rapid resampling in regions where the proposal distribution is poorly adapted to the target. Our sampling algorithm is shown to be geometrically convergent under mild assumptions and is illustrated through various numerical experiments."

Value-based approaches offer a more principled path, yet three gaps persist: extraction often ignores hierarchical structure, evaluation detects presence but not calibrated intensity, and the steerability of LLMs at controlled intensities remains insufficiently understood. To address these limitations, we introduce VALUEFLOW, the first unified framework that spans extraction, evaluation, and steering with calibrated intensity control. The framework integrates three components: (i) HIVES, a hierarchical value embedding space that captures intra- and cross-theory value structure; (ii) the Value Intensity DataBase (VIDB), a large-scale resource of value-labeled texts with intensity estimates derived from ranking-based aggregation; and (iii) an anchor-based evaluator that produces consistent intensity scores for model outputs by ranking them against VIDB panels. Using VALUEFLOW, we conduct a comprehensive large-scale study across ten models and four value theories, identifying asymmetries in steerability and composition laws for multi-value control. This paper establishes a scalable infrastructure for evaluating and controlling value intensity, advancing pluralistic alignment of LLMs."

    "abstract": "Stars with masses between roughly 1 and 8~$M_\\odot$ end their lives on the asymptotic giant branch (AGB), when intense mass loss takes place. The outflows are generally accepted to be driven by radiation pressure acting on dust grains that form in the dense extended atmospheres created by the action of convection and stellar pulsations. The complex physics underlying convection, stellar pulsations, and dust nucleation precludes predicting AGB mass loss from first principles. We investigated the evolution of two lobes observed to be expanding away from the AGB star Mira~A using images of polarized light obtained at six epochs using SPHERE on the VLT and of molecular emission at two epochs obtained with ALMA. While dust seems confined to the edges of the lobes, gas fills the lobes and displays higher densities than expected at the observed radii based on the large-scale mass-loss rate of Mira~A, with a total gas mass in the lobes of $\\sim 2 \\times 10^{-5}~M_\\odot$. We find the expansion of the lobes to be consistent with both a constant velocity (ejection time in 2010 or 2011) or a decelerating expansion (ejection time in 2012). If ejection events with a similar magnitude happen periodically, we derive periods between 50 and 200~years to account for the mass-loss rate of Mira~A. This periodicity is uncertain because the average mass-loss rate of Mira A on larger scales is uncertain. We find abundances in the lobes of $\\sim 1.5 \\times 10^{-6}$ and $\\sim 2.5 \\times 10^{-6}$ for SO and SO$_2$, respectively, and of $2\\times10^{-10}$, $6.5\\times10^{-10}$, and $4\\times10^{-7}$ for AlO, AlF, and PO. The strong variation in brightness of the different features identified in the polarized-light images is puzzling. We suggest that an asymmetric stellar radiation field preferentially illuminates specific regions of the circumstellar envelope at a given time, producing a lighthouse-like effect."

    "abstract": "Misinformation on social media poses a critical threat to information credibility, as its diverse and context-dependent nature complicates detection. Large language model-empowered multi-agent systems (MAS) present a promising paradigm that enables cooperative reasoning and collective intelligence to combat this threat. However, conventional MAS suffer from an information-drowning problem, where abundant truthful content overwhelms sparse and weak deceptive cues. With full input access, agents tend to focus on dominant patterns, and inter-agent communication further amplifies this bias. To tackle this issue, we propose PAMAS, a multi-agent framework with perspective aggregation, which employs hierarchical, perspective-aware aggregation to highlight anomaly cues and alleviate information drowning. PAMAS organizes agents into three roles: Auditors, Coordinators, and a Decision-Maker. Auditors capture anomaly cues from specialized feature subsets; Coordinators aggregate their perspectives to enhance coverage while maintaining diversity; and the Decision-Maker, equipped with evolving memory and full contextual access, synthesizes all subordinate insights to produce the final judgment. Furthermore, to improve efficiency in multi-agent collaboration, PAMAS incorporates self-adaptive mechanisms for dynamic topology optimization and routing-based inference, enhancing both efficiency and scalability. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that PAMAS achieves superior accuracy and efficiency, offering a scalable and trustworthy way for misinformation detection."

    "abstract": "Deeply stacked KANs are practically impossible due to high training difficulties and substantial memory requirements. Consequently, existing studies can only incorporate few KAN layers, hindering the comprehensive exploration of KANs. This study overcomes these limitations and introduces the first fully KA-based deep model, demonstrating that KA-based layers can entirely replace traditional architectures in deep learning and achieve superior learning capacity. Specifically, (1) the proposed Share-activation KAN (SaKAN) reformulates Sprecher's variant of Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, which achieves better optimization due to its simplified parameterization and denser training samples, to ease training difficulty, (2) this paper indicates that spline gradients contribute negligibly to training while consuming huge GPU memory, thus proposes the Grad-Free Spline to significantly reduce memory usage and computational overhead. (3) Building on these two innovations, our ALL U-KAN is the first representative implementation of fully KA-based deep model, where the proposed KA and KAonv layers completely replace FC and Conv layers. Extensive evaluations on three medical image segmentation tasks confirm the superiority of the full KA-based architecture compared to partial KA-based and traditional architectures, achieving all higher segmentation accuracy. Compared to directly deeply stacked KAN, ALL U-KAN achieves 10 times reduction in parameter count and reduces memory consumption by more than 20 times, unlocking the new explorations into deep KAN architectures."

However, existing financial benchmarks are largely single-turn and rely on a narrow set of question formats, limiting comprehensive evaluation in realistic application scenarios. To address this gap, we propose FinMTM, a multi-turn multimodal benchmark that expands diversity along both data and task dimensions. On the data side, we curate and annotate 11{,}133 bilingual (Chinese and English) financial QA pairs grounded in financial visuals, including candlestick charts, statistical plots, and report figures. On the task side, FinMTM covers single- and multiple-choice questions, multi-turn open-ended dialogues, and agent-based tasks. We further design task-specific evaluation protocols, including a set-overlap scoring rule for multiple-choice questions, a weighted combination of turn-level and session-level scores for multi-turn dialogues, and a composite metric that integrates planning quality with final outcomes for agent tasks. Extensive experimental evaluation of 22 VLMs reveal their limitations in fine-grained visual perception, long-context reasoning, and complex agent workflows."

Recent advances in generative models, such as conditional diffusion and few-shot NeRFs, offer a new paradigm for data augmentation by synthesizing data with significantly greater diversity and realism. However, unlike traditional augmentations like cropping or rotation, these methods introduce substantial changes that enhance robustness but also risk degrading performance if the augmentations are poorly matched to the task. In this work, we present EvoAug, an automated augmentation learning pipeline, which leverages these generative models alongside an efficient evolutionary algorithm to learn optimal task-specific augmentations. Our pipeline introduces a novel approach to image augmentation that learns stochastic augmentation trees that hierarchically compose augmentations, enabling more structured and adaptive transformations. We demonstrate strong performance across fine-grained classification and few-shot learning tasks. Notably, our pipeline discovers augmentations that align with domain knowledge, even in low-data settings. These results highlight the potential of learned generative augmentations, unlocking new possibilities for robust model training."

In this work, we study two approaches aimed at improving the symmetry properties of such an approximation scheme: one based on a quadrature rule for the Haar measure on the compact Lie group encoding the continuous symmetry of interest and one based on a random sampling of that Haar measure. We demonstrate both theoretically and empirically that the quadrature augmentation leads to exact symmetry preservation in polynomial models, while the random augmentation has only square-root convergence of the symmetrization error."

    "abstract": "AI agents that autonomously interact with external tools and environments show great promise across real-world applications. However, the external data which agent consumes also leads to the risk of indirect prompt injection attacks, where malicious instructions embedded in third-party content hijack agent behavior. Guided by benchmarks, such as AgentDojo, there has been significant amount of progress in developing defense against the said attacks. As the technology continues to mature, and that agents are increasingly being relied upon for more complex tasks, there is increasing pressing need to also evolve the benchmark to reflect threat landscape faced by emerging agentic systems. In this work, we reveal three fundamental flaws in current benchmarks and push the frontier along these dimensions: (i) lack of dynamic open-ended tasks, (ii) lack of helpful instructions, and (iii) simplistic user tasks. To bridge this gap, we introduce AgentDyn, a manually designed benchmark featuring 60 challenging open-ended tasks and 560 injection test cases across Shopping, GitHub, and Daily Life. Unlike prior static benchmarks, AgentDyn requires dynamic planning and incorporates helpful third-party instructions. Our evaluation of ten state-of-the-art defenses suggests that almost all existing defenses are either not secure enough or suffer from significant over-defense, revealing that existing defenses are still far from real-world deployment.

While modified phase-field equations have been developed to mitigate volume loss, their effectiveness has not been systematically assessed in the context of fully developed turbulent flows. In this work, we first evaluate the performance of several representative volume-corrected phase-field models in direct numerical simulations of droplet-laden homogeneous isotropic turbulence. Our results reveal that, at sufficiently high Weber numbers, none of the existing models provides satisfactory droplet-volume preservation. To address this limitation, we then propose a simple yet effective modification of the conservataive Allen-Cahn equation by incorporating a curvature-dependent counter-diffusion correction. Direct numerical simulations in turbulent regimes demonstrate that the proposed model achieves conservation of droplet volume in a statistical sense, while avoiding common adverse effects, such as numerical instability, violation of global mass conservation, increased computational cost, artificial coarsening, or enhanced spurious velocities."

Motivated by our formative study of speech referencing patterns, we characterize recurring ways people specify targets (Direct Attribute, Relational, Remembrance, and Chained) and ground them to our object-centric relational graph. Given an utterance, referent cues are parsed and rendered as persistent in-situ AR visual guidance, reducing iterative micro-guidance (\"a bit more to the right\", \"now, stop.\") during remote guidance. We demonstrate the use cases of our system with remote guided assistance and intent disambiguation scenarios.

The latter incurs no energy cost, but rather the reset occurs at the cost of angular momentum from a spin bath that acts as the thermal spin reservoir. The SHE represents an important first step toward demonstrating heat engines that operate beyond the conventional paradigm of requiring two thermal reservoirs, paving the way to harness quantum coherence in arbitrary conserved quantities via similar machines."

    "abstract": "The rapid growth in the parameter scale of large language models (LLMs) has created a high demand for efficient compression techniques. As a hardware-agnostic and highly compatible technique, low-rank compression has been widely adopted. However, existing methods typically compress each layer independently by minimizing per-layer reconstruction error, overlooking a critical limitation: the reconstruction error propagates and accumulates through the network, which leads to amplified global deviations from the full-precision baseline. To address this, we propose Self-Adaptive Error Suppression SVD (SAES-SVD), a LLMs compression framework that jointly optimizes intra-layer reconstruction and inter-layer error compensation. SAES-SVD is composed of two novel components: (1) Cumulative Error-Aware Layer Compression (CEALC), which formulates the compression objective as a combination of local reconstruction and weighted cumulative error compensation. Based on it, we derive a closed-form low-rank solution relied on second-order activation statistics, which explicitly aligns each layer's output with its full-precision counterpart to compensate for accumulated errors. (2) Adaptive Collaborative Error Suppression (ACES), which automatically adjusts the weighting coefficient to enhance the low-rank structure of the compression objective in CEALC. Specifically, the coefficient is optimized to maximize the ratio between the Frobenius norm of the compressed layer's output and that of the compression objective under a fixed rank, thus ensuring that the rank budget is utilized effectively. Extensive experiments across multiple LLM architectures and tasks show that, without fine-tuning or mixed-rank strategies, SAES-SVD consistently improves post-compression performance."

In practice, however, geometric descriptions can be under-specified or internally inconsistent: critical dimensions may be missing and constraints may conflict. Existing fine-tuned models tend to reactively follow user instructions and hallucinate dimensions when the text is ambiguous. To address this, we propose a proactive agentic framework for text-to-CadQuery generation, named ProCAD, that resolves specification issues before code synthesis. Our framework pairs a proactive clarifying agent, which audits the prompt and asks targeted clarification questions only when necessary to produce a self-consistent specification, with a CAD coding agent that translates the specification into an executable CadQuery program. We fine-tune the coding agent on a curated high-quality text-to-CadQuery dataset and train the clarifying agent via agentic SFT on clarification trajectories. Experiments show that proactive clarification significantly improves robustness to ambiguous prompts while keeping interaction overhead low. ProCAD outperforms frontier closed-source models, including Claude Sonnet 4.5, reducing the mean Chamfer distance by 79.9 percent and lowering the invalidity ratio from 4.8 percent to 0.9 percent.

At larger heights, diffracted fields from the square edges dominate and convert the lattice into a Bloch-type configuration. Over a range of intermediate heights, crossover between the evanescent SPP and edge diffraction gives rise to rich rapid topology evolutions. The switching is accompanied by nucleation of off-boundary vortex-anti vortex pairs in the in-plane spin phase, producing height-dependent fractional site charges. Our findings are analytically formulated by linear superposition of SPPs in the plasmonic regime and Stratton-Chu model in diffraction regime and confirmed via full-wave finite-difference time-domain simulations."

Superconducting qubits are commonly realized using Al/AlO$_{\\text{x}}$/Al Josephson junctions operating in the tunneling regime, where even minor variations in device geometry can lead to substantial performance fluctuations. In this work, we develop a quantitative model for the variability of the Josephson energy $E_{J}$ induced by interface roughness at the Al/AlO$_{\\text{x}}$ interfaces. The roughness is modeled as a Gaussian random field characterized by two parameters: the root-mean-square roughness amplitude $σ$ and the transverse correlation length $ξ$. These parameters are extracted from the literature and molecular dynamics simulations. Quantum transport is treated using the Ambegaokar--Baratoff relation combined with a local thickness approximation. Numerical simulations over $5,000$ Josephson junctions show that $E_{J}$ follows a log-normal distribution. The mean value of $E_{J}$ increases with $σ$ and decreases slightly with $ξ$, while the variance of $E_{J}$ increases with both $σ$ and $ξ$. These results paint a quantitative and intuitive picture of Josephson energy variability induced by surface roughness, with direct relevance for junction design."

    "abstract": "Large language model (LLM)-powered multi-agent systems (MAS) demonstrate remarkable collective intelligence, wherein multi-agent memory serves as a pivotal mechanism for continual adaptation. However, existing multi-agent memory designs remain constrained by two fundamental bottlenecks: (i) memory homogenization arising from the absence of role-aware customization, and (ii) information overload induced by excessively fine-grained memory entries. To address these limitations, we propose LatentMem, a learnable multi-agent memory framework designed to customize agent-specific memories in a token-efficient manner. Specifically, LatentMem comprises an experience bank that stores raw interaction trajectories in a lightweight form, and a memory composer that synthesizes compact latent memories conditioned on retrieved experience and agent-specific contexts. Further, we introduce Latent Memory Policy Optimization (LMPO), which propagates task-level optimization signals through latent memories to the composer, encouraging it to produce compact and high-utility representations. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks and mainstream MAS frameworks show that LatentMem achieves a performance gain of up to $19.36$% over vanilla settings and consistently outperforms existing memory architectures, without requiring any modifications to the underlying frameworks."

    "abstract": "We report a revised spectroscopic redshift for the dusty massive galaxy S1, previously inferred with an exceptionally high baryon-to-star conversion efficiency from NIRCam slitless grism data at $z_{\\rm grism}=5.58$. Our new JWST/NIRSpec IFU observations reveal multiple rest-frame optical and NIR emission lines, yielding a secure spectroscopic redshift of $z_{\\rm spec}=3.2439\\pm0.0002$. We show that the earlier grism-based redshift resulted from contamination by a nearby galaxy whose dispersed spectral trace overlaps with S1, illustrating a known challenge of slitless spectroscopy when only a single dispersion angle and single emission feature are available. In addition, we present new ALMA 1 mm observations, which robustly detect dust emission ($S_{\\rm 1mm}=0.99\\pm0.03$ mJy) and show a dust half-light radius ($R_{\\rm e,1mm}=0.73\\pm0.10$ kpc) slightly smaller than the stellar size ($R_{\\rm e, F444W} = 0.97\\pm0.01$ kpc). Using the revised redshift and compiled multi-wavelength photometry, we update the UV-to-FIR SED and find that S1 is less extreme than previously inferred, yet remains a very massive (log$M_{\\star}/M_{\\odot}\\sim10.6$), heavily obscured star-forming galaxy. The updated SED modeling reveals S1 to be a very dust- and gas-rich system with a moderate star formation rate and a long gas depletion time ($τ_{\\rm dep} \\sim 1.4$ Gyr), deviating from SMGs and OFGs, but more closely resembling typical massive main-sequence galaxies. We note that, although this revision reduces the number of ultra-massive galaxies reported in Xiao et al. 2024, it does not alter the main conclusions of that work. Overall, our study clarifies the nature of S1 and underscores the importance of multi-line spectroscopic confirmation, slitless observations at multiple position angles, and IFU data for robust redshift and physical characterization of rare massive galaxies in the early Universe."

In this work, we introduce the Consistency Deep Equilibrium Model (C-DEQ), a novel framework that leverages consistency distillation to accelerate DEQ inference. We cast the DEQ iterative inference process as evolution along a fixed ODE trajectory toward the equilibrium. Along this trajectory, we train C-DEQs to consistently map intermediate states directly to the fixed point, enabling few-step inference while preserving the performance of the teacher DEQ. At the same time, it facilitates multi-step evaluation to flexibly trade computation for performance gains. Extensive experiments across various domain tasks demonstrate that C-DEQs achieves consistent 2-20$\\times$ accuracy improvements over implicit DEQs under the same few-step inference budget."

We develop an improved member-selection technique based on a k-nearest neighbor algorithm applied to the color-color-magnitude diagram (CCMD), enabling reliable candidate identification down to $i_{2,0} < 23.5$. Photometric metallicities derived from NB395 colors agree with previous measurements, supporting the robustness of our calibration. While modest residual contamination and possible offsets - potentially driven by variations in light-element abundances - may remain beyond 10 arcmin, the metallicity distribution of high-probability inner members matches the known mean metallicity of NGC 5466, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method. The spatial distribution of NB395-selected stars clearly delineates the tidal stream. Beyond the tidal radius, the azimuthally averaged radial surface density profile follows a power law with slope $α= -4.53_{-0.14}^{+0.13}$. We also detect a power-law component perpendicular to the stream, suggestive of multiple apogalactic passages. A density gap is identified at a projected distance of $\\sim200$ pc from the cluster center, consistent with eTidal N-body predictions and possibly associated with a recent pericentric passage or Galactic disk interaction. Analysis of the main-sequence mass function reveals a strong negative radial gradient in the slope within the tidal radius, whereas the slope along the outer stream is relatively flat, consistent with preferential tidal stripping of low-mass stars. These results highlight the power of HSC/NB395 photometry for identifying metal-poor populations and deriving photometric metallicities, underscoring its value for future wide-field surveys."

Recent studies intuitively identify the high-frequency structure and low-frequency texture to be extracted by CNNs from the encoder, and subsequently for a desirable upsampling recovery. However, the existing arts inevitably overlook the information loss for both structure and texture feature maps during the convolutional downsampling process, hence suffer from a non-ideal upsampling output. In this paper, we systematically answer whether and how the structure and texture feature map can mutually help to alleviate the information loss during the convolutional downsampling. Given the structure and texture feature maps, we adopt the statistical normalization and denormalization strategy for the reconstruction guidance during the convolutional downsampling process. The extensive experimental results validate its advantages to the state-of-the-arts over the images from low-to-high resolutions including 256*256 and 512*512, especially holds by substituting all the encoders by ours.

This suppression in radiative heat transfer is directly correlated with mode localization, as revealed by the mode decomposition of the transmission coefficient, which serves as evidence of Anderson localization. Furthermore, we elucidate the dependence of radiative thermal conductance reduction on interparticle spacing and material damping rates, uncovering the interplay between intrinsic Ohmic losses, mode localization, and long-range many-body interactions. Our findings advance the understanding of wave-mediated thermal transport in disordered photonic structures and suggest strategies for tailoring nanoscale heat management via engineered disorder."

The network architecture of CGSTAE combines two components: a correlation graph structure learning module based on spatial self-attention mechanism (SSAM) and a spatial-temporal encoder-decoder module utilizing graph convolutional long-short term memory (GCLSTM). The SSAM learns correlation graphs by capturing dynamic relationships between variables, while a novel three-step causal graph structure learning algorithm is introduced to derive a causal graph from these correlation graphs. The algorithm leverages a reverse perspective of causal invariance principle to uncover the invariant causal graph from varying correlations. The spatial-temporal encoder-decoder, built with GCLSTM units, reconstructs time-series process data within a sequence-to-sequence framework. The proposed CGSTAE enables effective process monitoring and fault detection through two statistics in the feature space and residual space. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of CGSTAE in process monitoring through the Tennessee Eastman process and a real-world air separation process."

    "abstract": "Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) can perform both communication and sensing tasks using the same frequency band and hardware, making it a key technology for 6G. As a low-cost implementation for large-scale antenna arrays, reconfigurable holographic surfaces (RHSs) can be integrated into ISAC systems to realize the holographic ISAC paradigm, where enlarged radiation apertures achieve significant beamforming gains. In this paper, we investigate the tri-hybrid holographic ISAC framework, where the beamformer comprises digital, analog, and RHS-based electromagnetic (EM) layers. The analog layer employs a small number of phase shifters (PSs) to provide subarray-level phase control for the amplitude-modulated RHSs. Tri-hybrid beamforming provides a pathway for low-cost large-scale holographic ISAC. However, compared to conventional ISAC systems, it is challenging to achieve joint subarray-level phase control via PSs and element-level radiation amplitude control via RHSs for holographic ISAC. To address this, we present a tri-hybrid holographic ISAC scheme that minimizes sensing waveform error while satisfying the minimum user rate requirement. A joint optimization approach for PS phases and RHS amplitude responses is designed to address inter-layer coupling and distinct feasible regions. Theoretical analyses reveal that the optimized amplitude responses cluster near boundary values, i.e., 1-bit amplitude control, to reduce hardware and algorithmic complexity. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme achieves a controllable performance trade-off between communication and sensing tasks. Measured RHS beam gain validates the enhancement of holographic beamforming through subarray-level phase shifting. Moreover, as the number of RHS elements increases, the proposed approach exceeds the performance of conventional hybrid beamforming while significantly reducing the number of PSs."

Recent progress in Gaussian-based representations has significantly improved real-time rendering quality, yet existing methods still struggle to maintain a balance between long-term static and short-term dynamic regions in both representation and optimization. To address this, we present SharpTimeGS, a lifespan-aware 4D Gaussian framework that achieves temporally adaptive modeling of both static and dynamic regions under a unified representation. Specifically, we introduce a learnable lifespan parameter that reformulates temporal visibility from a Gaussian-shaped decay into a flat-top profile, allowing primitives to remain consistently active over their intended duration and avoiding redundant densification. In addition, the learned lifespan modulates each primitives' motion, reducing drift in long-lived static points while retaining unrestricted motion for short-lived dynamic ones. This effectively decouples motion magnitude from temporal duration, improving long-term stability without compromising dynamic fidelity. Moreover, we design a lifespan-velocity-aware densification strategy that mitigates optimization imbalance between static and dynamic regions by allocating more capacity to regions with pronounced motion while keeping static areas compact and stable. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while supporting real-time rendering up to 4K resolution at 100 FPS on one RTX 4090."

In this paper, we propose a calibration-free, dynamic-programming-optimal, and hardware-friendly framework called Non-uniform Linear Interpolation (NLI). NLI is capable of efficiently approximating a variety of nonlinear functions, enabling seamless integration into LLMs and other deep neural networks with almost no loss in accuracy. NLI ingeniously recasts cutpoint selection as a dynamic-programming problem, achieving the globally minimal interpolation error in O(MxN2) time via Bellman's optimality principle. Based on the NLI algorithm, we also design and implement a plug-and-play universal nonlinear computation unit. Hardware experiments demonstrate that the NLI Engine achieves more than 4x improvement in computational efficiency compared to the state-of-the-art designs."

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly becoming critical infrastructure for enterprise applications, driving unprecedented demand for GPU-based inference services. A key operational challenge arises from the two-phase nature of LLM inference: a compute-intensive \\emph{prefill} phase that processes user input, followed by a memory-bound \\emph{decode} phase that generates output tokens. When these phases share GPU resources, prefill tasks throttle the processing speed of concurrent decodes, creating state-dependent contention. This contention is further complicated by workload heterogeneity, as different applications exhibit vastly different input and output lengths. We develop a stochastic control framework for scheduling heterogeneous LLM workloads across large GPU clusters. We formulate LLM inference as a multiclass many-server queueing network with state-dependent service rates, grounded in empirical iteration-time measurements. We analyze the fluid approximation of this system and solve steady-state linear programs that characterize optimal resource allocation. We design gate-and-route policies that regulate prefill admission and decode routing, and prove that they are asymptotically optimal in the many-GPU limit under both bundled and separate token-pricing schemes. We further extend the framework to incorporate Service Level Indicators (SLIs) such as latency and fairness, providing a general approach to constrained scheduling. Numerical experiments calibrated to empirical iteration-time data demonstrate that our policies outperform standard serving heuristics."

    "abstract": "High-fidelity digital twins rely on the accurate assimilation of sensor data into physics-based computational models. In structural applications, such twins aim to identify spatially distributed quantities--such as elementwise weakening fields, material parameters, or effective thermal loads--by minimizing discrepancies between measured and simulated responses subject to the governing equations of structural mechanics. While adjoint-based methods enable efficient gradient computation for these inverse problems, the quality and stability of the resulting estimates depend critically on the choice of sensor locations, measurement types, and directions. This paper develops a rigorous and implementation-ready framework for Fisher-information-based sensor placement in adjoint-based finite-element digital twins. Sensor configurations are evaluated using a D-optimal design criterion derived from a linearization of the measurement map, yielding a statistically meaningful measure of information content. We present matrix-free operator formulas for applying the Jacobian and its adjoint, and hence for computing Fisher-information products $Fv = J^\\top R^{-1} Jv$ using only forward and adjoint solves. Building on these operator evaluations, we derive explicit sensitivity expressions for D-optimal sensor design with respect to measurement parameters and discuss practical strategies for evaluating the associated log-determinant objectives. To complement the general framework, we provide analytically tractable sensor placement results for a canonical one-dimensional structural model, clarifying the distinction between detectability and localizability and proving that D-optimal placement of multiple displacement sensors yields approximately uniform spacing."

Yet it remains unclear whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can support this kind of reasoning. In this work, we introduce SNIC (Situated Norms in Context), a human-validated diagnostic testbed designed to probe how well state-of-the-art LLMs can extract and utilize normative principles relevant to NBRR. SNIC emphasizes physically grounded norms that arise in everyday tasks such as cleaning, tidying, and serving. Across a range of controlled evaluations, we find that even the strongest LLMs struggle to consistently identify and apply social norms, particularly when norms are implicit, underspecified, or in conflict. These findings reveal a blind spot in current LLMs and highlight a key challenge for deploying language-based systems in socially situated, embodied settings."

TRACE demonstrates effective spatial localization with over 90% grounding accuracy, establishing a foundation for this challenging new task.

Motivated by these findings, we propose $\\text{Nüwa}$, a two-stage token pruning framework that enables efficient feature aggregation while maintaining spatial integrity. In the first stage, after the vision encoder, we apply three operations, namely separation, alignment, and aggregation, which are inspired by swarm intelligence algorithms to retain information-rich global spatial anchors.

Using the same set of laser beams as required for the initial Doppler laser cooling operation, we detune the laser frequencies to produce a narrow two-photon dark resonance. The process achieves a 1/e cooling time constant of 108(8) $μ$s, ultimately reducing the mean thermal axial mode occupation from 72(23) to 1.5(3) in 800 $μ$s as measured by resonantly probing an electric quadrupole transition near 729 nm. A parametric drive is applied to the trap electrodes which coherently exchanges the axial mode occupation with that of each radial mode, allowing for three-dimensional sub-Doppler cooling using only the axially-propagating laser beams. This sub-Doppler cooling is achieved for an axial oscillation frequency of $ω_z = 2π~\\times~$221 kHz, which places the motion well outside of the Lamb Dicke confinement regime at the Doppler laser cooling limit. Our measured cooling rate and final mode occupation are in good agreement with a semiclassical model which combines a Lindblad master equation solution for ion-photon interactions with classical harmonic oscillator motion of the trapped ion."

    "abstract": "Prior work on fairness in large language models (LLMs) has primarily focused on access-level behaviors such as refusals and safety filtering. However, equitable access does not ensure equitable interaction quality once a response is provided. In this paper, we conduct a controlled fairness audit examining how LLMs differ in tone, uncertainty, and linguistic framing across demographic identities after access is granted. Using a counterfactual prompt design, we evaluate GPT-4 and LLaMA-3.1-70B on career advice tasks while varying identity attributes along age, gender, and nationality. We assess access fairness through refusal analysis and measure interaction quality using automated linguistic metrics, including sentiment, politeness, and hedging. Identity-conditioned differences are evaluated using paired statistical tests. Both models exhibit zero refusal rates across all identities, indicating uniform access. Nevertheless, we observe systematic, model-specific disparities in interaction quality: GPT-4 expresses significantly higher hedging toward younger male users, while LLaMA exhibits broader sentiment variation across identity groups. These results show that fairness disparities can persist at the interaction level even when access is equal, motivating evaluation beyond refusal-based audits."

Through symmetry analysis and first-principles calculations, we identify a number of point groups and 2D material candidates (e.g., BiF$_3$, ZnI$_2$, and Ru$_4$Se$_5$) that host this quantum Christoffel nonlinear magnetization. More importantly, this nonlinear magnetization allows the quantum Christoffel symbol to be probed by optical techniques such as magneto-optical Kerr spectroscopy or transport measurements such as tunneling magneto-resistance. This quantum Christoffel nonlinear magnetization gives a paradigm of how geometry dictates physics."

    "abstract": "In this work, we focus on the Partial Constraint Satisfaction Problem (PCSP) over control-flow graphs (CFGs) of programs. PCSP serves as a generalization of the well-known Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP). In the CSP framework, we define a set of variables, a set of constraints, and a finite domain $D$ that encompasses all possible values for each variable. The objective is to assign a value to each variable in such a way that all constraints are satisfied. In the graph variant of CSP, an underlying graph is considered and we have one variable corresponding to each vertex of the graph and one or several constraints corresponding to each edge. In PCSPs, we allow for certain constraints to be violated at a specified cost, aiming to find a solution that minimizes the total cost. Numerous classical compiler optimization tasks can be framed as PCSPs over control-flow graphs. Examples include Register Allocation, Lifetime-optimal Speculative Partial Redundancy Elimination (LOSPRE), and Optimal Placement of Bank Selection Instructions. On the other hand, it is well-known that control-flow graphs of structured programs are sparse and decomposable in a variety of ways. In this work, we rely on the Series-Parallel-Loop (SPL) decompositions as introduced by~\\cite{RegisterAllocation}. Our main contribution is a general algorithm for PCSPs over SPL graphs with a time complexity of \\(O(|G| \\cdot |D|^6)\\), where \\(|G|\\) represents the size of the control-flow graph. Note that for any fixed domain $D,$ this yields a linear-time solution. Our algorithm can be seen as a generalization and unification of previous SPL-based approaches for register allocation and LOSPRE. In addition, we provide experimental results over another classical PCSP task, i.e. Optimal Bank Selection, achieving runtimes four times better than the previous state of the art."

    "abstract": "Unconventional superconductivity presents a defining and enduring challenge in condensed matter physics. Prevailing theoretical frameworks have predominantly emphasized electronic degrees of freedom, largely neglecting the rich physics inherent in the lattice. Although conventional phonon theory offers an elegant description of structural phase diagrams and lattice dynamics, its omission of nuclear quantum many-body effects results in misleading phase diagram interpretations and, consequently, an unsound foundation for superconducting theory. Here, by incorporating nuclear quantum many-body effects within first-principles calculations, we discover a lattice quantum disordered phase in superconductors H3S and La3Ni2O7. This phase occupies a triangular region in the pressure-temperature phase diagram, whose left boundary aligns precisely with Tc of the left flank of the superconducting dome. The Tcmax of this quantum disordered phase coincides with the maximum of superconducting Tc, indicating this phase as both the origin of superconductivity on the dome's left flank and a key ingredient of its pairing mechanism. Our findings advance the understanding of high-temperature superconductivity and establish the lattice quantum disordered phase as a unifying framework, both for predicting new superconductors and for elucidating phenomena in a broader context of condensed matter physics."

Motivated by the observation that the limit system is well-posed in Lp-based spaces for p\\in[2, \\infty), we extend the low-frequency analysis to this full range, thereby providing a more unified framework for studying such relaxation limits. The core of our proof consists in establishing refined product and commutator estimates describing sharply the interactions between the high, medium, and low-frequency regimes. A key observation underlying our analysis is that the product of two functions localized at low frequencies generates only interactions between low and medium frequencies, never purely high-frequency ones. Consequently, for a suitable choice of frequency threshold, the high-frequency projection of the product of two functions localized low frequencies vanishes."

We investigate the relationship of mm and extreme ultraviolet (EUV) emission with variations in the temperature and coronal plasma emission measure obtained from SDO/AIA and GOES data. The results show that the enhanced mm emission at the post-impulsive phase of the flare coincides with the increase of EUV emission, indicating a connection with moderately hot (~1 MK) plasma.

We present EarResp-ANS, the first system enabling fully on-device, real-time RR estimation on commercial earphones. The system employs LMS-based adaptive noise suppression (ANS) to attenuate ambient noise while preserving respiration-related acoustic components, without requiring neural networks or audio streaming, thereby explicitly addressing the energy and privacy constraints of wearable devices. We evaluate EarResp-ANS in a study with 18 participants under realistic acoustic conditions, including music, cafeteria noise, and white noise up to 80 dB SPL. EarResp-ANS achieves robust performance with a global MAE of 0.84 CPM , reduced to 0.47 CPM via automatic outlier rejection, while operating with less than 2% processor load directly on the earphone."

    "abstract": "In this work, we study sequential contracts under matroid constraints. In the sequential setting, an agent can take actions one by one. After each action, the agent observes the stochastic value of the action and then decides which action to take next, if any. At the end, the agent decides what subset of taken actions to use for the principal's reward; and the principal receives the total value of this subset as a reward. Taking each action induces a certain cost for the agent. Thus, to motivate the agent to take actions the principal is expected to offer an appropriate contract. A contract describes the payment from the principal to the agent as a function of the principal's reward obtained through the agent's actions. In this work, we concentrate on studying linear contracts, i.e.\\ the contracts where the principal transfers a fraction of their total reward to the agent. We assume that the total principal's reward is calculated based on a subset of actions that forms an independent set in a given matroid. We establish a relationship between the problem of finding an optimal linear contract (or computing the corresponding principal's utility) and the so called matroid (un)reliability problem. Generally, the above problems turn out to be equivalent subject to adding parallel copies of elements to the given matroid."

    "abstract": "While Dynamic Gaussian Splatting enables high-fidelity 4D reconstruction, its deployment is severely hindered by a fundamental dilemma: unconstrained densification leads to excessive memory consumption incompatible with edge devices, whereas heuristic pruning fails to achieve optimal rendering quality under preset Gaussian budgets. In this work, we propose Constrained Dynamic Gaussian Splatting (CDGS), a novel framework that formulates dynamic scene reconstruction as a budget-constrained optimization problem to enforce a strict, user-defined Gaussian budget during training. Our key insight is to introduce a differentiable budget controller as the core optimization driver. Guided by a multi-modal unified importance score, this controller fuses geometric, motion, and perceptual cues for precise capacity regulation. To maximize the utility of this fixed budget, we further decouple the optimization of static and dynamic elements, employing an adaptive allocation mechanism that dynamically distributes capacity based on motion complexity. Furthermore, we implement a three-phase training strategy to seamlessly integrate these constraints, ensuring precise adherence to the target count. Coupled with a dual-mode hybrid compression scheme, CDGS not only strictly adheres to hardware constraints (error < 2%}) but also pushes the Pareto frontier of rate-distortion performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CDGS delivers optimal rendering quality under varying capacity limits, achieving over 3x compression compared to state-of-the-art methods."

    "abstract": "Matryoshka Quantization (MatQuant) is a recent quantization approach showing that a single integer-quantized model can be served across multiple precisions, by slicing the most significant bits (MSB) at inference time. This enables a single checkpoint to cover a wide range of memory and latency budgets, but renders quantization much more challenging. In particular, the initial MatQuant relies on expensive quantization-aware training (QAT) variants, rather than fast one-shot post training quantization (PTQ), and lacks open-source and kernel support. We address all of these limitations by introducing Post-Training Matryoshka Quantization (MatGPTQ), a new PTQ pipeline that produces a single parent model jointly optimized for multiple target precisions in one-shot, based on a small calibration set. MatGPTQ casts Matryoshka quantization as a multi-precision objective with bit-slicing and cross-bit error compensation, resulting in an algorithm that produces a multi-bit-width, \"sliceable\" model in a single pass. We also incorporate a new budget-aware search for heterogeneous per-layer bit-witdhs and provide efficient kernels that implement slicing and mixed-precision execution. Across standard LLMs and benchmarks, MatGPTQ preserves high-bit accuracy while substantially improving performance at low-bit-witdh settings. Overall, we establish a new state of the art for Matryoshka-style post-training quantization and make single-checkpoint, multi-precision deployment open and practical.

D3PIA incorporates Neighborhood Attention (NA) to both encode the lead sheet and condition it for predicting note states in the piano accompaniment. This design enhances local contextual modeling by efficiently attending to nearby melody and chord conditions. We evaluate our model using the POP909 dataset, a widely used benchmark for piano accompaniment generation. Objective evaluation results demonstrate that D3PIA preserves chord conditions more faithfully compared to continuous diffusion-based and Transformer-based baselines. Furthermore, a subjective listening test indicates that D3PIA generates more musically coherent accompaniments than the comparison models."

To address this, we propose FaithRL, a general reinforcement learning framework that directly optimizes reasoning faithfulness. We formalize a faithfulness-maximization objective and theoretically show that optimizing it mitigates over-confidence. To instantiate this objective, we introduce a geometric reward design and a faithfulness-aware advantage modulation mechanism that assigns step-level credit by penalizing unsupported steps while preserving valid partial derivations. Across diverse backbones and benchmarks, FaithRL consistently reduces hallucination rates while maintaining (and often improving) answer correctness. Further analysis confirms that FaithRL increases step-wise reasoning faithfulness and generalizes robustly. Our code is available at https://github.com/aintdoin/FaithRL."

However, prior RPG approaches have been predominantly restricted to Gaussian policies, limiting their performance and failing to leverage recent advances in generative models. In this work, we identify that flow policies, which generate actions via differentiable ODE integration, naturally align with the RPG framework, a connection not established in prior work. However, naively exploiting this synergy proves ineffective, often suffering from training instability and a lack of exploration. We propose Reparameterization Flow Policy Optimization (RFO). RFO computes policy gradients by backpropagating jointly through the flow generation process and system dynamics, unlocking high sample efficiency without requiring intractable log-likelihood calculations. RFO includes two tailored regularization terms for stability and exploration. We also propose a variant of RFO with action chunking. Extensive experiments on diverse locomotion and manipulation tasks, involving both rigid and soft bodies with state or visual inputs, demonstrate the effectiveness of RFO. Notably, on a challenging locomotion task controlling a soft-body quadruped, RFO achieves almost $2\\times$ the reward of the state-of-the-art baseline."

    "abstract": "Malware detection and classification into families are critical tasks in cybersecurity, complicated by the continual evolution of malware to evade detection. This evolution introduces concept drift, in which the statistical properties of malware features change over time, reducing the effectiveness of static machine learning models. Understanding and explaining this drift is essential for maintaining robust and trustworthy malware detectors. In this paper, we propose an interpretable approach to concept drift detection. Our method uses a rule-based classifier to generate human-readable descriptions of both original and evolved malware samples belonging to the same malware family. By comparing the resulting rule sets using a similarity function, we can detect and quantify concept drift. Crucially, this comparison also identifies the specific features and feature values that have changed, providing clear explanations of how malware has evolved to bypass detection. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method not only accurately detects drift but also provides actionable insights into the behavior of evolving malware families, supporting both detection and threat analysis."

    "abstract": "LLM routing aims to achieve a favorable quality--cost trade-off by dynamically assigning easy queries to smaller models and harder queries to stronger ones. However, across both unimodal and multimodal settings, we uncover a pervasive yet underexplored failure mode in existing routers: as the user's cost budget increases, routers systematically default to the most capable and most expensive model even when cheaper models already suffice. As a result, current routers under-utilize small models, wasting computation and monetary cost and undermining the core promise of routing; we term this phenomenon routing collapse. We attribute routing collapse to an objective--decision mismatch: many routers are trained to predict scalar performance scores, whereas routing decisions ultimately depend on discrete comparisons among candidate models. Consequently, small prediction errors can flip relative orderings and trigger suboptimal selections. To bridge this gap, we propose EquiRouter, a decision-aware router that directly learns model rankings, restoring the role of smaller models and mitigating routing collapse. On RouterBench, EquiRouter reduces cost by about 17\\% at GPT-4-level performance compared to the strongest prior router. Our code is available at https://github.com/AIGNLAI/EquiRouter."

Electron-phonon coupling (EPC) analysis suggests that LiMgZr2H12 reaches a superconducting critical temperature (Tc) of 60.8 K at ambient pressure. Compared with MgZrH6, Li doping significantly increases the contribution of hydrogen atoms to the electron density of states near the Fermi level (EF) and enhances the EPC constant of the LiMgZr2H12 structure.

However, their effectiveness is often limited by high false-positive rates and incomplete coverage of vulnerability classes. At the same time, developers frequently document security-related shortcuts and compromises as Self-Admitted Technical Debt (SATD) in software artifacts, such as code comments. While prior work has recognized SATD as a rich source of security information, it remains unclear whether -and in what ways- it is utilized during SAT-aided security analysis. OBJECTIVE: This work investigates the extent to which security-related SATD complements the output produced by SATs and helps bridge some of their well-known limitations. METHOD: We followed a mixed-methods approach consisting of (i) the analysis of a SATD-annotated vulnerability dataset using three state-of-the-art SATs and (ii) an online survey with 72 security practitioners. RESULTS: The combined use of all SATs flagged 114 of the 135 security-related SATD instances, spanning 24 distinct Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) identifiers. A manual mapping of the SATD comments revealed 33 unique CWE types, 6 of which correspond to categories that SATs commonly overlook or struggle to detect (e.g., race conditions). Survey responses further suggest that developers frequently pair SAT outputs with SATD insights to better understand the impact and root causes of security weaknesses and to identify suitable fixes. IMPLICATIONS: Our findings show that such SATD-encoded information can be a meaningful complement to SAT-driven security analysis, while helping to overcome some of SATs' practical shortcomings."

    "abstract": "Code generation has advanced rapidly with code-focused large language models (LLMs), especially on snippet-level tasks. However, application-level generation requires producing a runnable multi-file repository with correct structure, dependencies, and end-to-end executability, and real-world software must satisfy both functional correctness and non-functional quality (e.g., maintainability, security). Existing benchmarks provide a limited execution-based assessment of these requirements at the application level. We ask: Can current LLMs generate application-level repositories that meet both functional and non-functional criteria? We propose RAL-Bench, a benchmark and evaluation framework for application-level code generation. For each task, we distill a concise natural-language requirement from a high-quality reference project, build black-box system tests covering functional and non-functional attributes, and keep only tests that pass on the reference repository to ensure a sound oracle and an end-to-end executable suite. Functional correctness is measured by system-test pass rate. Non-functional quality is measured along five ISO/IEC 25010-inspired dimensions and aggregated with an Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP)-derived weight vector, with per-dimension diagnostics and baseline-normalized scoring using reference measurements. Across 16 LLMs evaluated zero-shot with greedy decoding, functional correctness is the dominant bottleneck: no model exceeds a 45% functional pass rate under our requirement-driven, reference-validated tests. We release RAL-Bench at https://github.com/Wwstarry/RAL-Bench. ."

    "abstract": "Warm Dense Matter lies at the frontier between condensed matter and plasma, and plays a central role in various fields ranging from planetary science to inertial confinement fusion. Improving our understanding of this regime requires experimental data that can be directly compared with theoretical and numerical models over a broad range of conditions. In this work, a pulsed-power experiment is described in which thin metallic foils, confined within a sapphire cell, are Joule-heated to achieve the expanded warm dense matter regime. Designing such an experiment is challenging, as it requires simultaneously predicting the electrical response of the pulsed-power driver and the hydrodynamic evolution of the heated material. To tackle this challenge, a modeling framework has been developed that couples an electrical description of the pulsed-power system, including the driver, the switching stages and the load with a one-dimensional hydrodynamic code. This coupling allows the electrical energy deposition and the load thermodynamic evolution to be consistently linked through the material electrical conductivity. This approach takes advantage of the simplicity of a 1D geometry while retaining the essential physics and allowing to reproduce various measurements with good accuracy, such as expansion velocity, current and voltage. This numerical approach therefore constitutes a robust and efficient method for designing and optimizing future Warm Dense Matter experiments using pulsed-power facilities."

However, existing methods often suffer from identity inconsistency and limited compositional control, as they rely on diffusion models to implicitly associate text prompts with reference images. In this work, we propose Hierarchical Concept-to-Appearance Guidance (CAG), a framework that provides explicit, structured supervision from high-level concepts to fine-grained appearances. At the conceptual level, we introduce a VAE dropout training strategy that randomly omits reference VAE features, encouraging the model to rely more on robust semantic signals from a Visual Language Model (VLM) and thereby promoting consistent concept-level generation in the absence of complete appearance cues. At the appearance level, we integrate the VLM-derived correspondences into a correspondence-aware masked attention module within the Diffusion Transformer (DiT). This module restricts each text token to attend only to its matched reference regions, ensuring precise attribute binding and reliable multi-subject composition. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the multi-subject image generation, substantially improving prompt following and subject consistency."

This study aims to develop and evaluate a hybrid electromagnetic (EM) simulation framework for efficient and accurate assessment of such interactions. Methods: A hybrid EM strategy integrating the Huygens' Box (HB) method with sub-gridding was implemented in an FDTD solver (Sim4Life). RF coil models for mouse and rat head were simulated with and without intracortical (IC) and epicortical (EC) graphene-based micro-transistor arrays. Three-dimensional multi-layered probe models were reconstructed from two-dimensional layouts, and transmit field ($B_{1}^{+}$), electric field ($E$), and specific absorption rate (SAR) distributions were evaluated. Performance was benchmarked against conventional full-wave multi-port (MP) simulations using Bland-Altman analysis and voxel-wise percentage differences. Results: HB simulations reduced computational time by approximately 70-80%, while preserving spatial patterns of $|B_{1}^{+}|$, $|E|$, and SAR, including transmit-field symmetry and localized high-field regions. Deviations from MP were minimal for $|B_{1}^{+}|$ (median $Δ$% 0.02-0.07% in mice, -3.7% to -1.7% in rats) and modest for $|E|$ and SAR, with absolute SAR values remaining well below human safety limits. Graphene-based arrays produced negligible effects on RF transmission and SAR deposition. Conclusion: The HB approach enables computationally efficient, high-resolution evaluation of EM interactions involving microscopic probes in MRI environments, supporting simulations that are otherwise impractical with full-wave MP modeling."

    "abstract": "To handle ambiguous and open-ended requests, Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly trained to interact with users to surface intents they have not yet expressed (e.g., ask clarification questions). However, users are often ambiguous because they have not yet formed their intents: they must observe and explore outcomes to discover what they want. Simply asking \"what kind of tone do you want?\" fails when users themselves do not know. We introduce DiscoverLLM, a novel and generalizable framework that trains LLMs to help users form and discover their intents. Central to our approach is a novel user simulator that models cognitive state with a hierarchy of intents that progressively concretize as the model surfaces relevant options -- where the degree of concretization serves as a reward signal that models can be trained to optimize. Resulting models learn to collaborate with users by adaptively diverging (i.e., explore options) when intents are unclear, and converging (i.e., refine and implement) when intents concretize. Across proposed interactive benchmarks in creative writing, technical writing, and SVG drawing, DiscoverLLM achieves over 10% higher task performance while reducing conversation length by up to 40%. In a user study with 75 human participants, DiscoverLLM improved conversation satisfaction and efficiency compared to baselines."

Existing defenses focus exclusively on text-based distillation, leaving the important logit-based distillation largely unexplored. In this work, we analyze this problem and present an effective solution from an information-theoretic perspective. We characterize distillation-relevant information in teacher outputs using the conditional mutual information (CMI) between teacher logits and input queries conditioned on ground-truth labels. This quantity captures contextual information beneficial for model extraction, motivating us to defend distillation via CMI minimization. Guided by our theoretical analysis, we propose learning a transformation matrix that purifies the original outputs to enhance distillation resistance. We further derive a CMI-inspired anti-distillation objective to optimize this transformation, which effectively removes distillation-relevant information while preserving output utility. Extensive experiments across multiple LLMs and strong distillation algorithms demonstrate that the proposed method significantly degrades distillation performance while preserving task accuracy, effectively protecting models' intellectual property."

    "abstract": "Unsupervised object-centric learning models, particularly slot-based architectures, have shown great promise in decomposing complex scenes. However, their reliance on reconstruction-based training creates a fundamental conflict between the sharp, high-frequency attention maps of the encoder and the spatially consistent but blurry reconstruction maps of the decoder. We identify that this discrepancy gives rise to a vicious cycle: the noisy feature map from the encoder forces the decoder to average over possibilities and produce even blurrier outputs, while the gradient computed from blurry reconstruction maps lacks high-frequency details necessary to supervise encoder features. To break this cycle, we introduce Synergistic Representation Learning (SRL) that establishes a virtuous cycle where the encoder and decoder mutually refine one another. SRL leverages the encoder's sharpness to deblur the semantic boundary within the decoder output, while exploiting the decoder's spatial consistency to denoise the encoder's features. This mutual refinement process is stabilized by a warm-up phase with a slot regularization objective that initially allocates distinct entities per slot. By bridging the representational gap between the encoder and decoder, SRL achieves state-of-the-art results on video object-centric learning benchmarks.

While hierarchical approaches mitigate this issue by decomposing tasks, most existing methods rely on separate high- and low-level networks and generate only a single intermediate subgoal, making them inadequate for complex tasks that require coordinating multiple intermediate decisions. To address this limitation, we draw inspiration from the chain-of-thought paradigm and propose the Chain-of-Goals Hierarchical Policy (CoGHP), a novel framework that reformulates hierarchical decision-making as autoregressive sequence modeling within a unified architecture. Given a state and a final goal, CoGHP autoregressively generates a sequence of latent subgoals followed by the primitive action, where each latent subgoal acts as a reasoning step that conditions subsequent predictions. To implement this efficiently, we pioneer the use of an MLP-Mixer backbone, which supports cross-token communication and captures structural relationships among state, goal, latent subgoals, and action. Across challenging navigation and manipulation benchmarks, CoGHP consistently outperforms strong offline baselines, demonstrating improved performance on long-horizon tasks."

We show how to control the bias accumulated by the surrogate gradients and use techniques from random reshuffling to prove a convergence theorem for PPO that sheds light on PPO's success. Additionally, we identify a previously overlooked issue in truncated Generalized Advantage Estimation commonly used in PPO. The geometric weighting scheme induces infinite mass collapse onto the longest $k$-step advantage estimator at episode boundaries. Empirical evaluations show that a simple weight correction can yield substantial improvements in environments with strong terminal signal, such as Lunar Lander."

Existing prediction models, despite strong benchmarking performance, often remain disconnected from planning constraints such as collision avoidance and dynamic feasibility. We introduce Plan TRansformer (PTR), a unified Gaussian Mixture Transformer framework integrating goal-conditioned prediction, dynamic feasibility, interaction awareness, and lane-level topology reasoning. A teacher-student training strategy progressively masks surrounding agent commands during training to align with inference conditions where agent intentions are unavailable. PTR achieves 4.3%/3.5% improvement in marginal/joint mAP compared to the baseline Motion Transformer (MTR) and 15.5% planning error reduction at 5s horizon compared to GameFormer.

Although significant progress has been made in existing methods, their optimization rely solely on the supervision from voxel labels and face the challenge of voxel sparsity as a large portion of voxels in autonomous driving scenarios are empty, which limits both optimization efficiency and model performance. To address this issue, we propose a \\textit{Multi-Resolution Alignment (MRA)} approach to mitigate voxel sparsity in camera-based 3D semantic scene completion, which exploits the scene and instance level alignment across multi-resolution 3D features as auxiliary supervision. Specifically, we first propose the Multi-resolution View Transformer module, which projects 2D image features into multi-resolution 3D features and aligns them at the scene level through fusing discriminative seed features. Furthermore, we design the Cubic Semantic Anisotropy module to identify the instance-level semantic significance of each voxel, accounting for the semantic differences of a specific voxel against its neighboring voxels within a cubic area. Finally, we devise a Critical Distribution Alignment module, which selects critical voxels as instance-level anchors with the guidance of cubic semantic anisotropy, and applies a circulated loss for auxiliary supervision on the critical feature distribution consistency across different resolutions.

The influence of the halo on black hole thermodynamics is analyzed through the mass function, entropy, Hawking temperature, heat capacity, and Gibbs free energy, allowing us to assess both local and global thermodynamic stability of the black hole-dark matter system. Our results show that the presence of a Dehnen-type halo not only stabilizes the otherwise thermodynamically unstable Schwarzschild black hole but also induces phase transitions. In addition, we study null geodesics to examine photon motion, the shadow radius and the optical appearance of the system. The dark matter halo modifies the effective potential, leading to observable changes in the photon sphere and the apparent size of the shadow. We also explore the instability of circular null geodesics and its relation to quasinormal modes in an eikonal limit. These findings highlight the significant role of realistic dark matter distributions in shaping both the thermodynamic behavior and the observable signatures of black holes, providing further insight into the interplay between dark matter halos and central black holes in galaxies."

To address this limitation, we propose to study ranking fairness when the provider utility is influenced by other contextual factors and is neither equal to nor proportional to item exposure. We give a formal definition of Income Fairness and develop a corresponding measurement metric. Simulated experiments show that existing-exposure-fairness-based ranking algorithms fail to optimize the proposed income fairness. Therefore, we propose the Dynamic-Income-Derivative-aware Ranking Fairness algorithm, which, based on the marginal income gain at the present timestep, uses Taylor-expansion-based gradients to simultaneously optimize effectiveness and income fairness.

Although topological phononic metamaterials have recently been demonstrated as a promising paradigm for confining and guiding elastic waves through robust bound states, achieving ultrahigh-Q topological resonance with enhanced energy conversion efficiency remains a challenge. In this work, we propose a synthetic-dimensional higher-order topological insulator by engineering the flexural bands of elastic metamaterials, featuring highly localized topological hinge states in the bulk bands. This topological hinge mode stems from the nonzero combination of the bulk polarization and the Chern number in the synthetic-dimensional band structure, thus giving rise to a strong elastic-to-electric energy conversion at the corner of the phononic plate. Through numerical simulations and experimental validations, straightforward evidence of the localized modes with robust protection and consequent abilities in activating the light-emitting diodes (LEDs) array have been demonstrated. Our findings open a new avenue for topological-physics-enabled ultrasonic devices and present promising prospects for applications in weak-signal detection and self-powered sensors."

Here we study how non-collinear spin arrangement affects the magnon contribution to thermal conductivity. As a paradigm system, we consider the most basic non-collinear magnet with a spin spiral ground state. Spin noncollinearity leads to anharmonic terms, resulting in magnon fusion and decay processes. These processes determine the magnon lifetime, which can be used to estimate thermal conductivity in a single-mode approximation. However, by solving the full Boltzmann equation numerically, we find a much higher thermal conductivity. This signifies that heat is carried not by individual magnons but by their linear combinations -- relaxons. The thermal conductivity is found to increase with the diminishing spiral pitch, consistent with recent experiments. The results provide the blueprint for calculating magnetic thermal transport in non-collinear magnets."

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a machine learning-based framework for asset selection and portfolio construction, termed the Best-Path Algorithm Sparse Graphical Model (BPASGM). The method extends the Best-Path Algorithm (BPA) by mapping linear and non-linear dependencies among a large set of financial assets into a sparse graphical model satisfying a structural Markov property. Based on this representation, BPASGM performs a dependence-driven screening that removes positively or redundantly connected assets, isolating subsets that are conditionally independent or negatively correlated. This step is designed to enhance diversification and reduce estimation error in high-dimensional portfolio settings. Portfolio optimization is then conducted on the selected subset using standard mean-variance techniques. BPASGM does not aim to improve the theoretical mean-variance optimum under known population parameters, but rather to enhance realized performance in finite samples, where sample-based Markowitz portfolios are highly sensitive to estimation error. Monte Carlo simulations show that BPASGM-based portfolios achieve more stable risk-return profiles, lower realized volatility, and superior risk-adjusted performance compared to standard mean-variance portfolios. Empirical results for U.S. equities, global stock indices, and foreign exchange rates over 1990-2025 confirm these findings and demonstrate a substantial reduction in portfolio cardinality. Overall, BPASGM offers a statistically grounded and computationally efficient framework that integrates sparse graphical modeling with portfolio theory for dependence-aware asset selection."

In this regime of a small scaling parameter $\\varepsilon$, the solution exhibits rapid oscillations in both time and space, posing challenges for numerical approximation. We propose an explicit and an implicit exponentially weighted finite difference method. While the explicit weighted leapfrog method needs to satisfy a CFL-type stability condition, the implicit weighted Crank--Nicolson method is unconditionally stable. Both methods achieve second-order accuracy with time steps and mesh sizes that are not restricted in magnitude by $\\varepsilon$. The methods are uniformly convergent in the range from arbitrarily small to moderately bounded $\\varepsilon$. Numerical experiments illustrate the theoretical results."

This letter considers a complementary class of dynamics: Mutual future avoiding random walks (MFARWs), where stochastically driven walkers are avoiding each others planned future trajectories. Such systems arise naturally in conceptual models of shared mobility. We show that periodic behavior emerges spontaneously in such MFARWs, and that periodic and unstructured behavior coexist, providing a first example of Chimera style behavior of non-oscillatory paths on networks. Further, we analytically describe and predict the onset of structure. We find that the phase transition from unstructured to periodic behavior is driven by a novel mechanism of self-amplifying coupling to the periodic components of the stochastic drivers of the system. In the context of shared mobility applications, these Chimera states imply a regime of naturally stable co-existence between flexible and line-based public transport."

While the performance of these models has greatly increased for conventional single-channel, dry audio clips, their success in real-world acoustic environments with reverberation and noise is limited. Furthermore, most audio foundation models ignore the spatial dimension of real-world acoustic environments, ruling out tasks involving sound localization. To address these limitations, we propose GRAM: a general-purpose real-world audio model that employs a multi-channel masked autoencoder to efficiently learn spatial audio representations. We evaluated GRAM and other audio foundation models in a standardized manner on high-quality simulations of naturalistic, spatial acoustic environments as well as recordings of real-world environments and release these two complementary benchmark task suites: NatHEAR and RealSELD. Our results demonstrate that GRAM outperforms all state-of-the-art self-supervised audio foundation models on NatHEAR and the clean, single-channel version HEAR, while using only a fraction of the training data. GRAM also shows state-of-the-art localization performance in simulated environments and generalizes efficiently to real-world recordings in RealSELD. Taken together, GRAM presents a significant advance toward robust spatial audio foundation models for real-world environments."

To address this, we propose an automated pipeline leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for offline reward design and verification. We formulate the reward function using potential functions consisted of three core components: survival, confidence, and competence. We further introduce quantitative metrics to rigorously evaluate and select the optimal reward structure prior to deployment. By integrating LLM-driven domain knowledge, our framework automates the design of reward functions for specific diseases while significantly enhancing the performance of the resulting policies."

    "abstract": "Unsupervised anomaly detection stands as an important problem in machine learning, with applications in financial fraud prevention, network security and medical diagnostics. Existing unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms rarely perform well across different anomaly types, often excelling only under specific structural assumptions. This lack of robustness also becomes particularly evident under noisy settings. We propose Mean Shift Density Enhancement (MSDE), a fully unsupervised framework that detects anomalies through their geometric response to density-driven manifold evolution. MSDE is based on the principle that normal samples, being well supported by local density, remain stable under iterative density enhancement, whereas anomalous samples undergo large cumulative displacements as they are attracted toward nearby density modes. To operationalize this idea, MSDE employs a weighted mean-shift procedure with adaptive, sample-specific density weights derived from a UMAP-based fuzzy neighborhood graph. Anomaly scores are defined by the total displacement accumulated across a small number of mean-shift iterations. We evaluate MSDE on the ADBench benchmark, comprising forty six real-world tabular datasets, four realistic anomaly generation mechanisms, and six noise levels. Compared to 13 established unsupervised baselines, MSDE achieves consistently strong, balanced and robust performance for AUC-ROC, AUC-PR, and Precision@n, at several noise levels and on average over several types of anomalies. These results demonstrate that displacement-based scoring provides a robust alternative to the existing state-of-the-art for unsupervised anomaly detection."

Among existing TTA strategies, pseudo-label-based methods have shown promising performance. However, they often rely on perturbation-ensemble heuristics (e.g., dropout sampling, test-time augmentation, Gaussian noise), which lack distributional grounding and yield unstable training signals. This can trigger error accumulation and catastrophic forgetting during adaptation. To address this, we propose \\textbf{A3-TTA}, a TTA framework that constructs reliable pseudo-labels through anchor-guided supervision. Specifically, we identify well-predicted target domain images using a class compact density metric, under the assumption that confident predictions imply distributional proximity to the source domain. These anchors serve as stable references to guide pseudo-label generation, which is further regularized via semantic consistency and boundary-aware entropy minimization. Additionally, we introduce a self-adaptive exponential moving average strategy to mitigate label noise and stabilize model update during adaptation. Evaluated on both multi-domain medical images (heart structure and prostate segmentation) and natural images, A3-TTA significantly improves average Dice scores by 10.40 to 17.68 percentage points compared to the source model, outperforming several state-of-the-art TTA methods under different segmentation model architectures. A3-TTA also excels in continual TTA, maintaining high performance across sequential target domains with strong anti-forgetting ability.

Since its second wave, ADNI has increasingly collected resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI), a valuable resource for discovering brain connectivity changes predictive of cognitive decline and AD. A major barrier to its use is the considerable variability in acquisition protocols and data quality, compounded by missing imaging sessions and inconsistencies in how functional scans temporally align with clinical assessments. As a result, many studies only utilize a small subset of the total rs-fMRI data, limiting statistical power, reproducibility, and the ability to study longitudinal functional brain changes at scale. Here, we describe a pipeline for ADNI rs-fMRI data that encompasses the download of necessary imaging and clinical data, temporally aligning the clinical and imaging data, preprocessing, and quality control. We integrate data curation and preprocessing across all ADNI sites and scanner types using a combination of open-source software (Clinica, fMRIPrep, and MRIQC) and bespoke tools. Quality metrics and reports are generated for each subject and session to facilitate rigorous data screening. All scripts and configuration files are available to enable reproducibility. The pipeline, which currently supports ADNI-GO, ADNI-2, and ADNI-3 data releases, outputs high-quality rs-fMRI time series data adhering to the BIDS-derivatives specification.

We also design a partition method for BlockRR based on a weight matrix derived from label prior information; the parallel composition principle ensures that the composition of two such mechanisms remains $ε$-label DP. Empirically, we evaluate BlockRR on two variants of CIFAR-10 with varying degrees of class imbalance. Results show that in the high-privacy and moderate-privacy regimes ($ε\\leq 3.0$), our propsed method gets a better balance between test accuaracy and the average of per-class accuracy.

We prove that for Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), the mutual-visibility number $μ(D)$ is always 1, and for directed cycles of length $n \\geq 3$, it is strictly 2. In contrast, we demonstrate that tournaments can support arbitrarily large mutual-visibility sets; specifically, using properties of Paley tournaments, we show that $μ(T)$ grows linearly with the size of the tournament. On the algorithmic side, we show that while verifying a candidate set is polynomial-time solvable ($O(|S|(|V|+|A|))$), the problem of determining $μ(D)$ is NP-hard for general digraphs. We also analyze the impact of strong bridges and strongly connected components on the upper bounds of $μ(D)$."

However, when applied to aggregated or coarse-grained social networks, disjoint community partitions cannot capture the diverse composition of community memberships within aggregated nodes. While existing mixed membership methods alleviate this issue, they may detected communities that are highly sensitive to the aggregation resolution, not reliably reflecting the underlying community structure of the underlying individual-level network. This paper presents the Link Fraction Mixed Membership (LFMM) method, which computes the mixed memberships of nodes in aggregated networks. Unlike existing mixed membership methods, LFMM is consistent under aggregation. Specifically, we show that it conserves community membership sums at different scales. The method is utilized to study a population-scale social network of the Netherlands, aggregated at different resolutions. Experiments reveal variation in community membership across different geographical regions and evolution over the last decade. In particular, we show how our method identifies large urban hubs that act as the melting pots of diverse, spatially remote communities."

Using GCG as a case study, we show that both optimizing attacks to generate prefixes instead of suffixes and varying adversarial token position during evaluation substantially influence attack success rates. Our findings highlight a critical blind spot in current safety evaluations and underline the need to account for the position of adversarial tokens in the adversarial robustness evaluation of LLMs."

We address this inherent limitation by selectively regularizing such geometries into strictly convex implicit representations, restoring uniqueness and smoothness of the contact map. Leveraging this geometric regularization, we develop iDCOL, an implicit differentiable collision detection and contact kinematics framework. iDCOL represents colliding bodies using strictly convex implicit surfaces and computes collision detection and contact kinematics by solving a fixed-size nonlinear system derived from a geometric scaling-based convex optimization formulation. By applying the Implicit Function Theorem to the resulting system residual, we derive analytical derivatives of the contact kinematic quantities. We develop a fast Newton-based solver for iDCOL and provide an open-source C++ implementation of the framework. The robustness of the approach is evaluated through extensive collision simulations and benchmarking, and applicability is demonstrated in gradient-based kinematic path planning and differentiable contact physics, including multi-body rigid collisions and a soft-robot interaction example."

Current approaches, whether using manually designed circuit templates, fixed heuristics, or automated rules, face limitations in scalability, flexibility, and adaptability, often producing circuits that are poorly matched to the specific problem or quantum hardware. In this work, we propose the Evolutionary eXploration of Augmenting Quantum Circuits (EXAQC), an evolutionary approach to the automated design and training of parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) which leverages and extends on strategies from neuroevolution and genetic programming. The proposed method jointly searches over gate types, qubit connectivity, parameterization, and circuit depth while respecting hardware and noise constraints. The method supports both Qiskit and Pennylane libraries, allowing the user to configure every aspect. This work highlights evolutionary search as a critical tool for advancing quantum machine learning and variational quantum algorithms, providing a principled pathway toward scalable, problem-aware, and hardware-efficient quantum circuit design. Preliminary results demonstrate that circuits evolved on classification tasks are able to achieve over 90% accuracy on most of the benchmark datasets with a limited computational budget, and are able to emulate target circuit quantum states with high fidelity scores."

Inspired by sand-grain roughness experiments performed by Hollis (2017), we perform the first direct numerical simulation (DNS) of a blunt cylinder in Mach 6 cross-flow with roughness elements distributed along the entire surface. Such simulations aimed to uncover the precise means by which laminar-turbulent transition occurs given the limited measurements attainable from experiments and non-existent high-fidelity simulations. Element heights were held fixed at approximately 35% boundary layer thickness, while the relative phasing between streamwise rows was varied. All configurations exhibited convective instabilities driving the transition process, with the mode type being set by the roughness configuration. A fundamental sinuous streak mode dominated the aligned roughness element case, whereas both the staggered and randomly phased cases saw 2D T-S waves dominating. These instability waves, when grown to sufficient amplitude, triggered the steady streaks seeded by the underlying roughness pattern to begin forming hairpin vortices and breakdown occurred soon thereafter. The roughness arrangement was found to dramatically influence the degree to which the waves were destabilised, as well as the strength of the underlying steady streaks, thereby combining to dictate the position along the surface where LTT occurred. Finally, exogeneous forcing was not required for the T-S dominated cases as the acoustics generated by the turbulence in the subsonic flow excited T-S waves on the other side - a feedback mechanism hitherto unknown."

Second, redundancy offers a natural bias for \\emph{where} to place plasticity: by restricting updates to a subset of redundant neurons and constraining the remaining degrees of freedom, we obtain update families with reduced functional drift on the old-data distribution and improved worst-case retention guarantees.

    "abstract": "Recent theoretical work has revealed that basic observables of quantum field theory in de Sitter space, known as in-in or cosmological correlators, exhibit surprisingly simple mathematical structure reminiscent of scattering amplitudes in flat space. For many theories, this simplicity can be made manifest using a set of ``cosmological dressing rules'' which uplift flat-space Feynman diagrams to in-in correlators in de Sitter space by attaching auxiliary propagators to the interaction vertices. In this paper, we show that discontinuities of cosmological correlators with respect to internal energy variables can be obtained by applying auxiliary propagators to unitarity cuts of flat space Feynman diagrams. Moreover, discontinuities with respect to external energy variables can be obtained by cutting auxiliary propagators attached to Feynman diagrams. This observation in turn implies highly non-trivial constraints on cosmological correlators in the form of simple sum rules. We illustrate these ideas in a number of examples at tree-level and 1-loop for conformally coupled scalar theories, although they hold more generally. Finally, we show how to reconstruct cosmological correlators from their discontinuities using dispersion relations, providing a powerful new approach to computing cosmological observables by systematically reconstructing them from data uplifted from flat space."

However, in bandwidth-constrained distributed RL, scalability is often bottlenecked by the synchronization of policy weights from trainers to inference workers, particularly over commodity networks or in decentralized settings. While recent studies suggest that RL updates modify only a small fraction of model parameters, these observations are typically based on coarse checkpoint differences. We present a systematic empirical study of weight-update sparsity at both step-level and multi-step granularities, examining its evolution across training dynamics, off-policy delay, and model scale. We find that update sparsity is consistently high, frequently exceeding 99% across practically relevant settings. Leveraging this structure, we propose PULSE (Patch Updates via Lossless Sparse Encoding), a simple yet highly efficient lossless weight synchronization method that transmits only the indices and values of modified parameters. PULSE is robust to transmission errors and avoids floating-point drift inherent in additive delta schemes. In bandwidth-constrained decentralized environments, our approach achieves over 100x (14 GB to ~108 MB) communication reduction while maintaining bit-identical training dynamics and performance compared to full weight synchronization. By exploiting this structure, PULSE enables decentralized RL training to approach centralized throughput, reducing the bandwidth required for weight synchronization from 20 Gbit/s to 0.2 Gbit/s to maintain high GPU utilization."

The rerouting decisions at any node $v$ must rely solely on local information available at $v$: the link from which a packet arrived at $v$, the target of the packet, and the incident link failures at $v$. Ideally, such rerouting mechanisms provide perfect resilience: any packet is routed from its source to its target as long as the two are connected in the underlying graph after the link failures. Already in their seminal paper at ACM PODC '12, Feigenbaum, Godfrey, Panda, Schapira, Shenker, and Singla showed that perfect resilience cannot always be achieved. While the design of local rerouting algorithms has received much attention since then, we still lack a detailed understanding of when perfect resilience is achievable. This paper closes this gap and presents a complete characterization of when perfect resilience can be achieved. This characterization also allows us to design an $O(n)$-time algorithm to decide whether a given instance is perfectly resilient and an $O(nm)$-time algorithm to compute perfectly resilient rerouting rules whenever it is. Our algorithm is also attractive for the simple structure of the rerouting rules it uses, known as skipping in the literature: alternative links are chosen according to an ordered priority list (per in-port), where failed links are simply skipped. Intriguingly, our result also implies that in the context of perfect resilience, skipping rerouting rules are as powerful as more general rerouting rules. This partially answers a long-standing open question by Chiesa, Nikolaevskiy, Mitrovic, Gurtov, Madry, Schapira, and Shenker [IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking, 2017] in the affirmative."

    "abstract": "Diffusion-based editing models have emerged as a powerful tool for semantic image and video manipulation. However, existing models lack a mechanism for smoothly controlling the intensity of text-guided edits. In standard text-conditioned generation, Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) impacts prompt adherence, suggesting it as a potential control for edit intensity in editing models. However, we show that scaling CFG in these models does not produce a smooth transition between the input and the edited result. We attribute this behavior to the unconditional prediction, which serves as the guidance origin and dominates the generation at low guidance scales, while representing an arbitrary manipulation of the input content. To enable continuous control, we introduce Adaptive-Origin Guidance (AdaOr), a method that adjusts this standard guidance origin with an identity-conditioned adaptive origin, using an identity instruction corresponding to the identity manipulation. By interpolating this identity prediction with the standard unconditional prediction according to the edit strength, we ensure a continuous transition from the input to the edited result. We evaluate our method on image and video editing tasks, demonstrating that it provides smoother and more consistent control compared to current slider-based editing approaches. Our method incorporates an identity instruction into the standard training framework, enabling fine-grained control at inference time without per-edit procedure or reliance on specialized datasets."

This unifies applications such as conditional probability of necessity and sufficiency, conditional Win Ratio, and Generalized Pairwise Comparisons. Despite the intrinsic non-identifiability of comparison-based estimands, CPTE provides interpretable targets and delivers new identifiability conditions for previous unidentifiable estimands. We present estimation strategies via matching, quantile, and distributional regression, and further design efficient influence-function estimators to correct plug-in bias and maximize policy value. Synthetic and semi-synthetic experiments demonstrate clear performance gains and practical impact."

While online RL tends to perform better than offline RL, its higher training cost and instability hinders wide adoption. In this paper, we build on the observation that multi-turn code generation can be formulated as a one-step recoverable Markov decision process and propose contextual bandit learning with offline trajectories (Cobalt), a new method that combines the benefits of online and offline RL. Cobalt first collects code generation trajectories using a reference LLM and divides them into partial trajectories as contextual prompts. Then, during online bandit learning, the LLM is trained to complete each partial trajectory prompt through single-step code generation. Cobalt outperforms two multi-turn online RL baselines based on GRPO and VeRPO, and substantially improves R1-Distill 8B and Qwen3 8B by up to 9.0 and 6.2 absolute Pass@1 scores on LiveCodeBench. Also, we analyze LLMs' in-context reward hacking behaviors and augment Cobalt training with perturbed trajectories to mitigate this issue. Overall, our results demonstrate Cobalt as a promising solution for iterative decision-making tasks like multi-turn code generation.

    "abstract": "The prediction of critical heat flux (CHF) using machine learning (ML) approaches has become a highly active research activity in recent years, the goal of which is to build models more accurate than current conventional approaches such as empirical correlations or lookup tables (LUTs). Previous work developed and deployed tube-based pure and hybrid ML models in the CTF subchannel code, however, full-scale reactor core simulations require the use of rod bundle geometries. Unlike isolated subchannels, rod bundles experience complex thermal hydraulic phenomena such as channel crossflow, spacer grid losses, and effects from unheated conductors. This study investigates the generalization of ML-based CHF prediction models in rod bundles after being trained on tube-based CHF data. A purely data-driven DNN and two hybrid bias-correction models were implemented in the CTF subchannel code and used to predict CHF location and magnitude in the Combustion Engineering 5-by-5 bundle CHF test series. The W-3 correlation, Bowring correlation, and Groeneveld LUT were used as baseline comparators. On average, all three ML-based approaches produced magnitude and location predictions more accurate than the baseline models, with the hybrid LUT model exhibiting the most favorable performance metrics."

It controls various phenomena, such as magnetization reversal, domain formation, domain-wall motion, spin-wave generation, and spin-wave propagation etc. We investigate the mixed anisotropies in face-centred-cubic Permalloy (fcc-Py) and amorphous Cobalt (a-Co) thin films deposited via rf magnetron sputtering on Si (100) substrate with thicknesses, d = 5-125 nm and t = 5-150 nm, respectively. X-ray diffraction technique, atomic force microscopy, and vibrating sample magnetometry are employed to study the structural, morphological, and magnetic properties. We adopt a qualitative approach to understand the nature of different anisotropies present in both materials. Mixed anisotropies evolve with film thicknesses for both fcc-Py and a-Co films. The role of growth conditions in the emergence of specific anisotropies is discussed in detail. An alteration of the magnetization easy axis from the conventional in-plane orientation is evidenced due to the collective influence of these mixed anisotropies. Based on the dominance of anisotropy components, their origin, and the direction of magnetization tilt, we categorize our samples as belonging to specific regimes. Introduction of magnetization tilt has been proven to be an extremely innovative way to improve the performance of spintronic devices so far. The one-to-one comparison between a sputter-deposited crystalline and an amorphous magnetic material could be beneficial for building a stronger foundation for that."

    "abstract": "Joint base station (BS) association and beam selection in multi-UAV aerial corridors constitutes a challenging radio resource management (RRM) problem. It is driven by high-dimensional action spaces, need for substantial overhead to acquire global channel state information (CSI), rapidly varying propagation channels, and stringent latency requirements. Conventional combinatorial optimization methods, while near-optimal, are computationally prohibitive for real-time operation in such dynamic environments. While learning-based approaches can mitigate computational complexity and CSI overhead, the need for extensive site-specific (SS) datasets for model training remains a key challenge. To address these challenges, we develop a Digital Twin (DT)-enabled two-stage optimization framework that couples physics-based beam gain modeling with DRL for scalable online decision-making. In the first stage, a channel twin (CT) is constructed using a high-fidelity ray-tracing solver with geo-spatial contexts, and network information to capture SS propagation characteristics, and dual annealing algorithm is employed to precompute optimal transmission beam directions. In the second stage, a Multi-Head Proximal Policy Optimization (MH-PPO) agent, equipped with a scalable multi-head actor-critic architecture, is trained on the DT-generated channel dataset to directly map complex channel and beam states to jointly execute UAV-BS-beam association decisions. The proposed PPO agent achieves a 44%-121% improvement over DQN and 249%-807% gain over traditional heuristic based optimization schemes in a dense UAV scenario, while reducing inference latency by several orders of magnitude. These results demonstrate that DT-driven training pipelines can deliver high-performance, low-latency RRM policies tailored to SS deployments suitable for real-time resource management in next-generation aerial corridor networks."

However, most prior work in this regard assumes either that the system dynamics are known or deterministic, or that the state and action space are finite, significantly limiting application scope. We address this limitation by developing a probabilistic verification framework for unknown dynamical systems which combines conformal prediction with reachability analysis. In particular, we use conformal prediction to obtain valid uncertainty intervals for the unknown dynamics at each time step, with reachability then verifying whether safety is maintained within the conformal uncertainty bounds. Next, we develop an algorithmic approach for training control policies that optimize nominal reward while also maximizing the planning horizon with sound probabilistic safety guarantees. We evaluate the proposed approach in seven safe control settings spanning four domains -- cartpole, lane following, drone control, and safe navigation -- for both affine and nonlinear safety specifications. Our experiments show that the policies we learn achieve the strongest provable safety guarantees while still maintaining high average reward."

Notably, constructing production-level full-stack web applications is far more challenging than only generating frontend web pages, demanding careful control of data flow, comprehensive understanding of constantly updating packages and dependencies, and accurate localization of obscure bugs in the codebase. To address these difficulties, we introduce FullStack-Agent, a unified agent system for full-stack agentic coding that consists of three parts: (1) FullStack-Dev, a multi-agent framework with strong planning, code editing, codebase navigation, and bug localization abilities. (2) FullStack-Learn, an innovative data-scaling and self-improving method that back-translates crawled and synthesized website repositories to improve the backbone LLM of FullStack-Dev.

Our FullStack-Dev outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method by 8.7%, 38.2%, and 15.9% on the frontend, backend, and database test cases respectively. Additionally, FullStack-Learn raises the performance of a 30B model by 9.7%, 9.5%, and 2.8% on the three sets of test cases through self-improvement, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.

MRFs provide positive and bounded features, a key property for accurate, low-variance approximation. We show deep asymptotic connection between GRFs, defined on discrete graph objects, and continuous random features used for regular kernels. As a by-product of our method, we re-discover recently introduced mechanism of Gaussian kernel approximation applied in particular to improve linear-attention Transformers, considering simple random walks on graphs and by-passing original complex mathematical computations.

However, standard reinforcement learning (RL) operates over fixed problem distributions and training budgets, which limits extrapolation amidst distribution shift at test time. To address this, we introduce RC, an iterative decoding algorithm that replaces standard autoregressive decoding during both training and inference. RC exploits an asymmetry between the response generation and summarization capabilities of LLMs to construct reasoning chains that consistently improve across iterations. Models trained to use RC can extrapolate and continually improve over reasoning horizons more than an order of magnitude longer than those seen during training. Empirically, training a 4B model with RC using a 16k-token training budget improves performance on HMMT 2025 from 40% to nearly 70% with 0.5m tokens at test time, outperforming both comparably sized models and many larger reasoning LLMs. Finally, we also show that models trained with RC can more effectively leverage existing scaffolds to further scale test-time performance, due to the improved summary-conditioned generation abilities learned through training."

We propose two new estimators: the Sum of Conditional Outcome Probability Estimator (SCOPE) and Risk Estimation from Anticipated Conditional Hazards (REACH), that leverage next-token probability distributions discarded by standard Monte Carlo. We prove both estimators are unbiased and that REACH guarantees variance reduction over Monte Carlo sampling for any model and outcome. Empirically, on hospital mortality prediction in MIMIC-IV using the ETHOS-ARES framework, SCOPE and REACH match 100-sample Monte Carlo performance using only 10-11 samples (95% CI: [9,11]), representing a ~10x reduction in inference cost without degrading calibration. For ICU admission prediction, efficiency gains are more modest (~1.2x), which we attribute to the outcome's lower \"spontaneity,\" a property we characterize theoretically and empirically.

However, existing refactoring benchmarks commonly suffer from three shortcomings: limited coverage of refactoring scenarios, the inclusion of instances that mix refactoring with unrelated changes, and insufficient repository-level context for realistic assessment. To mitigate these issues, we introduce SWE-Refactor, a new benchmark for LLM-based code refactoring. SWE-Refactor comprises 1,099 developer-written, behavior-preserving refactorings mined from 18 Java projects, including 922 atomic and 177 compound instances. Each instance is validated via compilation, test execution, and automated refactoring detection tools to ensure correctness. We evaluate nine widely used LLMs on SWE-Refactor, covering models such as GPT-4o-mini, DeepSeek-V3, and CodeLLaMa, to provide representative reference results. Our results show that complex and compound refactorings remain the primary source of failures; notably, an OpenAI Codex agent achieves only 39.4% success on compound instances.

Many existing methods oversimplify these realities, often assuming fixed communication rounds or ideal channel conditions, which limits their effectiveness in real-world scenarios. To address this, we propose variable rate vehicular federated learning (VR-VFL), a novel federated learning method designed specifically for vehicular networks under imperfect channel state information. VR-VFL combines dynamic client selection with adaptive transmission rate selection, while also allowing round times to flex in response to changing wireless conditions. At its core, VR-VFL is built on a bi-objective optimization framework that strikes a balance between improving learning convergence and minimizing the time required to complete each round. By accounting for both the challenges of mobility and realistic wireless constraints, VR-VFL offers a more practical and efficient approach to federated learning in vehicular edge networks. Simulation results show that the proposed VR-VFL scheme achieves convergence approximately 40% faster than other methods in the literature."

In this work, we introduce ID-MoCQA, the first large-scale multi-hop QA dataset for assessing the cultural understanding of large language models (LLMs), grounded in Indonesian traditions and available in both English and Indonesian. We present a new framework that systematically transforms single-hop cultural questions into multi-hop reasoning chains spanning six clue types (e.g., commonsense, temporal, geographical). Our multi-stage validation pipeline, combining expert review and LLM-as-a-judge filtering, ensures high-quality question-answer pairs. Our evaluation across state-of-the-art models reveals substantial gaps in cultural reasoning, particularly in tasks requiring nuanced inference. ID-MoCQA provides a challenging and essential benchmark for advancing the cultural competency of LLMs."

    "abstract": "Quantum measurements can inject energy into quantum systems, enabling engines whose operation is powered entirely by measurements. We develop a general theory of quantum vacuum measurement engines by introducing the quantum vacuum bending function (QVBF), a quantity that characterizes the lowering of the ground-state energy due to interactions. We show that all thermodynamic observables, including work and efficiency, are governed solely by the shape of the ground-state energy landscape encoded in the QVBF, regardless of microscopic details. We further demonstrate that work fluctuations are defined by the curvature of QVBF modulated by a model-dependent quantity, and are constrained by a generalized quantum fluctuation relation that involves the interplay between quantum Fisher information and the ground-state energy landscape. Exactly solvable models and numerical simulations of single and many-body systems confirm the theory and illustrate how the QVBF alone determines the performance of quantum vacuum measurement engines."

We also include a formalisation of the worst-case running time argument for Orlin's algorithm. Our verified implementation of this algorithm, which is derived by the technique of stepwise refinement, is fully executable and was integrated into a reusable formal library on graph algorithms. Because the problems for which Orlin's algorithm works are restricted, we also verified an executable reduction from the general minimum-cost flow problem. We believe we are the first to formally consider the problem of minimum-cost flows and, more generally, any scaling algorithms.

Yet, they fail to spatially reproduce the Universe we observe, limiting comparison between observations and simulations to a statistical level. This is highly problematic for rare, faint or well studied nearby objects that are observed in a single environment. The computational cost of recovering this environment in random simulations is prohibitive. We present Hamlet-PM, a method that enables the constraining of initial conditions for cosmological simulations so as to produce evolved numerical universes that can be directly compared to observations of the Local Universe: constrained simulations. Our method implements the field-level forward modeling of the early-time density field from sparse and noisy measurements of late-time peculiar velocities. The dynamics are integrated with a particle-mesh gravity solver, thus probing the mildly non-linear regime. The code is applied to the Cosmicflows-4 compilation of peculiar velocities up to z < 0.05 (160 Mpc/h). The constrained ICs a re-simulated with a high precision N-body code. A series of one hundred dark-matter only cosmological constrained simulations with a resolution of 512^3 particles in a 500^3 [Mpc/h]3 box is presented. Special attention is given to twelve prominent nearby galaxy clusters, whose simulated counterparts are matched on criteria of mass and separation. We provide a mass estimate constrained by the dynamical environment for each cluster. Field-level forward modeling of the initial conditions produces highly constrained cosmological simulations. Currently, this method already overtakes in quality the pipeline in use in the peculiar-velocity community, although systematic biases still need to be addressed. Furthermore, improving the model is easy thanks to the inherent flexibility of the Bayesian approach."

The resulting multi-peak, multi-scale responses allocate energy to heterogeneous regions of the Laplacian spectrum while remaining interpretable via explicit centers and bandwidths. To scale, we implement filters with Chebyshev polynomial expansions, avoiding eigendecompositions. We further propose Transferable Adaptive Spectral Shaping (TASS): the baseline kernel is learned on source graphs and, on a target graph, kept fixed while only the shaping parameters are adapted, enabling few-shot transfer under matched compute. Across controlled synthetic benchmarks spanning graph families and signal regimes, Adaptive Spectral Shaping reduces reconstruction error relative to fixed-prototype wavelets and learned linear banks, and TASS yields consistent positive transfer. The framework provides compact spectral modules that plug into graph signal processing pipelines and graph neural networks, combining scalability, interpretability, and cross-graph generalization."

From there, we outline a procedure for constructing ISSf-CBFs for two relevant classes of systems with unmatched uncertainties: i) strict-feedback systems; ii) dual-relative-degree systems, which are similar to differentially flat systems. Our theoretical results are illustrated via numerical simulations of an inverted pendulum and planar quadrotor."

When learning peaked probability distributions, e.g., next-token distributions, these components yield power-law vanishing losses and gradients, creating a fundamental optimization bottleneck. This ultimately leads to power-law time scaling of the loss with a universal exponent of $1/3$.

We propose ContraLog, a parser-free and self-supervised method that reframes log anomaly detection as predicting continuous message embeddings rather than discrete template IDs. ContraLog combines a message encoder that produces rich embeddings for individual log messages with a sequence encoder to model temporal dependencies within sequences. The model is trained with a combination of masked language modeling and contrastive learning to predict masked message embeddings based on the surrounding context. Experiments on the HDFS, BGL, and Thunderbird benchmark datasets empirically demonstrate effectiveness on complex datasets with diverse log messages. Additionally, we find that message embeddings generated by ContraLog carry meaningful information and are predictive of anomalies even without sequence context. These results highlight embedding-level prediction as an approach for log anomaly detection, with potential applicability to other event sequences."

It is fundamental to ensuring safety and reliability in real-world deployments. However, the underlying mechanisms governing this decision-making process remain poorly understood. In this paper, we investigate its working mechanism through an information flow lens. Our findings reveal that instruction tokens function as structural anchors for modality arbitration: Shallow attention layers perform non-selective information transfer, routing multimodal cues to these anchors as a latent buffer; Modality competition is resolved within deep attention layers guided by the instruction intent, while MLP layers exhibit semantic inertia, acting as an adversarial force. Furthermore, we identify a sparse set of specialized attention heads that drive this arbitration. Causal interventions demonstrate that manipulating a mere $5\\%$ of these critical heads can decrease the modality-following ratio by $60\\%$ through blocking, or increase it by $60\\%$ through targeted amplification of failed samples. Our work provides a substantial step toward model transparency and offers a principled framework for the orchestration of multimodal information in MLLMs."

Through attention analysis, we identify conversational inertia, a phenomenon where models exhibit strong diagonal attention to previous responses, which is associated with imitation bias that constrains exploration. This reveals a tension when transforming few-shot LLMs into agents: longer context enriches environmental feedback for exploitation, yet also amplifies conversational inertia that undermines exploration. Our key insight is that for identical states, actions generated with longer contexts exhibit stronger inertia than those with shorter contexts, enabling construction of preference pairs without environment rewards. Based on this, we propose Context Preference Learning to calibrate model preferences to favor low-inertia responses over highinertia ones. We further provide context management strategies at inference time to balance exploration and exploitation. Experimental results across eight agentic environments and one deep research scenario validate that our framework reduces conversational inertia and achieves performance improvements."

Here we construct an infinite set of Dirac observables for Gowdy cosmologies, valid off-shell, strongly, and without gauge fixing. These observables stay regular at the Big Bang and can be matched to much simpler Dirac observables of the Carroll-type gravity theory. Conversely, in an adapted foliation there is a systematic anti-Newtonian expansion (in inverse powers of the reduced Newton constant) of the full Dirac observables whose leading terms are the Carroll ones. In particular, this provides an off-shell generalization of the Asymptotic Velocity Domination property."

Our analysis indicates that the branching fractions for $Λ_b^0 \\to P_c^+ π^-$ lie around the $10^{-6}$ level, with the corresponding direct CP asymmetries approaching approximately $1\\%$. In contrast, the direct CP violation for the decay $Λ_b^0 \\to P_c^+ K^-$ is found to be very small, while its branching ratios show a strong dependence on the spin assignments of the $P_c$ states. These predictions may provide useful guidance for more precise CP measurements and amplitude analyses in the $P_c$ region in future experiments."

Despite its importance, consensus on the precise critical exponents remains elusive due to severe finite-size effects in numerical simulations and the lack of conformal bootstrap benchmarks. Here we try to resolve this long-standing controversy by performing projector determinant quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations on lattices of unprecedented size, reaching 10,368 sites. By developing a novel projected submatrix update algorithm, we achieve a significant algorithmic speedup that enables us to access the thermodynamic limit with high precision. We observe that the fermion anomalous dimension and the correlation length exponent converge rapidly, while the boson anomalous dimension exhibits a systematic size dependence that we resolve via linear extrapolation. To validate our analysis, we perform parallel large-scale simulations of the spinless $t$-$V$ model on the honeycomb lattice, which belongs to the Gross-Neveu-Ising class. Our results for the $t$-$V$ model, including the first QMC determination of the fermion anomalous dimension, show agreement with conformal bootstrap predictions, thereby corroborating the robustness of our methodology. Our work provides state-of-the-art critical exponents for the honeycomb Hubbard model and establishes a systematic finite-size scaling workflow applicable to a broad class of strongly correlated quantum systems, paving the way for resolving other challenging fermionic quantum critical phenomena."

    "abstract": "Deuterium fractionation is highly efficient during the early stages of star formation, particularly in starless and prestellar cores where temperatures are low (<10 K) and molecular freeze-out onto dust grains is significant. Methanol forms early in these environments following CO freeze-out via successive hydrogenation reactions on grain surfaces, while the production of deuterated methanol requires elevated gas-phase D/H ratios generated through dissociative recombination of deuterated H3+. Consequently, large abundances of deuterated methanol are observed toward young stellar objects where prestellar ices have recently sublimated. Here, we present laboratory infrared spectra of methanol and its deuterated isotopologues in astrophysical ice analogues, complemented by anharmonic vibrational calculations used to guide band assignments. Experiments were performed at the CASICE laboratory using a Bruker Vertex 70v spectrometer coupled to a closed-cycle helium cryostat, with isotopologue ices deposited at 10 K under high-vacuum conditions. Infrared transmission spectra were recorded over 6000-30 cm-1 (1.67-333 um) and compared with spectra of pure isotopologue ices. Distinctive mid-infrared band patterns are identified for each deuterated species. In particular, CH2DOH exhibits a characteristic doublet at 1293 and 1326 cm-1 (7.73 and 7.54 um), while CHD2OH shows a similar doublet at 1301 and 1329 cm-1 (7.69 and 7.52 um), both remaining largely invariant across all studied ice mixtures. These robust spectral signatures provide reliable tracers for identifying deuterated methanol in JWST observations and for constraining astrochemical gas-grain models of deuterium enrichment prior to star and planet formation."

However, training these agents via reinforcement learning is hindered by the multi-scale credit assignment problem: existing methods typically rely on sparse, trajectory-level rewards that fail to distinguish between high-quality reasoning and fortuitous guesses, leading to redundant or misleading search behaviors. To address this, we propose Search-R2, a novel Actor-Refiner collaboration framework that enhances reasoning through targeted intervention, with both components jointly optimized during training. Our approach decomposes the generation process into an Actor, which produces initial reasoning trajectories, and a Meta-Refiner, which selectively diagnoses and repairs flawed steps via a 'cut-and-regenerate' mechanism. To provide fine-grained supervision, we introduce a hybrid reward design that couples outcome correctness with a dense process reward quantifying the information density of retrieved evidence. Theoretically, we formalize the Actor-Refiner interaction as a smoothed mixture policy, proving that selective correction yields strict performance gains over strong baselines. Extensive experiments across various general and multi-hop QA datasets demonstrate that Search-R2 consistently outperforms strong RAG and RL-based baselines across model scales, achieving superior reasoning accuracy with minimal overhead."

With SNe now being detected within days after explosion, there is growing evidence that the majority of Type II SNe show signs of interaction with a confined, dense cirumstellar material (CSM) in the first few days post explosion. In this work we aim to bridge the gap between single SN studies showing early-time interaction in their spectra, and the statistical studies of early-time SN light curves, which imply the existence of CSM. We present a sample of 68 Type II SNe with both early photometric data, obtained with the ATLAS survey, and spectroscopic data, obtained with the ePESSTO+ collaboration. A subset of the sample is classified based on the presence or absence of narrow spectral features with electron-scattered broadened wings in the early spectra, indicative of interaction with CSM. We characterise the photometric and spectroscopic properties of the sample by measuring rise times to maximum light, peak magnitudes, decline rates and line velocities. Additionally, we measure the ratio of absorption to emission (a/e) of the H alpha P-Cygni profile. Our analysis reveals that SNe II showing early spectroscopic signs of interaction with CSM decline faster and are brighter than those without. However no difference is found in rise times between the two groups. A clear separation is observed in the a/e ratio: SNe with signs of interaction exhibit lower a/e ratios at all epochs compared to those without. Our results highlight that understanding SN II ejecta-CSM interaction requires large, uniform samples of photometric and spectroscopic data, such as the one presented in this work."

    "abstract": "A consistent trend throughout the research of oriented object detection has been the pursuit of maintaining comparable performance with fewer and weaker annotations. This is particularly crucial in the remote sensing domain, where the dense object distribution and a wide variety of categories contribute to prohibitively high costs. Based on the supervision level, existing oriented object detection algorithms can be broadly grouped into fully supervised, semi-supervised, and weakly supervised methods. Within the scope of this work, we further categorize them to include sparsely supervised and partially weakly-supervised methods. To address the challenges of large-scale labeling, we introduce the first Sparse Partial Weakly-Supervised Oriented Object Detection framework, designed to efficiently leverage only a few sparse weakly-labeled data and plenty of unlabeled data. Our framework incorporates three key innovations: (1) We design a Sparse-annotation-Orientation-and-Scale-aware Student (SOS-Student) model to separate unlabeled objects from the background in a sparsely-labeled setting, and learn orientation and scale information from orientation-agnostic or scale-agnostic weak annotations.

    "abstract": "AI-enabled systems are subjected to various types of runtime uncertainties, ranging from dynamic workloads, resource requirements, model drift, etc. These uncertainties have a big impact on the overall Quality of Service (QoS). This is particularly true in the case of Language Model (LM) enabled systems where the autoregressive nature of token generation introduces variability in latency, energy usage and response quality. These systems, powered by LLMs, are either resource-intensive (if run on-prem) or raise privacy/cost concerns (if leveraged using APIs). While deploying a Small Language Model (SLM) can be resource-efficient, it often falls short in addressing the diversity and scale of real-world requirements. To this, we argue that, rather than relying on any one SLM, leveraging a coordinated fleet of SLMs, each with specialized strengths can enable systems to dynamically adapt to shifting contexts and workload patterns. However, realizing the full potential of such an approach demands intelligent orchestration and continuous adaptation. To this end, we introduce CALM , a self-adaptive orchestration mechanism based on MAPE-K. Our approach continuously monitors user queries, analyzes the QoS metrics of the SLMs, identifies the optimal SLM to be used, routes the query to the identified SLM and further to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency, leverages caching and scheduling to decide the SLMs to be kept in memory. Our evaluation shows that CALM reduces latency by approximately 40% and energy consumption by 50%, while preserving domain-specific task performance when compared to single-LLM baselines."

    "abstract": "In isolated binary evolution, binary black hole (BBH) mergers are generally formed through stable mass transfer (SMT) or common envelope evolution. In recent years, the SMT channel has received significant attention due to detailed binary models showing increased mass transfer stability compared to previous studies. In this work, we perform a full zero-age-main-sequence to compact object merger analysis using detailed binary models at eight metallicities between $10^{-4}Z_\\odot$ and $2Z_\\odot$ to self-consistently model the population properties of BBH mergers in the SMT channel, determined their progenitor initial conditional, and investigate the binary physics governing their formation and metallicity dependence. We use the population synthesis code POSYDON to determine the population of BBH mergers from SMT. Using its extended grids of MESA binary models, we determine the essential physics in the formation of BBH mergers. SMT produces BBH mergers predominantly from systems with $P_{ZAMS}\\leq10$ days. In these systems, both the initial mass transfer between two stars and the subsequent interaction between the remaining star and the first-born BH take place while the respective donor star is on the main-sequence (Case A). We find a limited contribution from wider Case B/C systems. Without a natal kick, the SMT channel does not produce BBH mergers above $Z>0.2Z_\\odot$ due to orbital widening from stellar wind mass loss. The primary BH mass distribution shows a strong dependence on metallicity, while the mass ratio prefers unity independent of metallicity due to mass ratio reversal. Additionally, the $χ_{eff}$ distributions contain peaks at $χ_{eff}=0$ and ~0.15 of which the former disappears at high metallicities. A mass-scaled natal kick leave this sub-population unchanged but introduce a low-mass, unequal mass ratio sub-population that merges due to their high eccentricity."

    "abstract": "Semantic segmentation networks require large amounts of pixel-level annotated data, which are costly to obtain for real-world images. Computer graphics engines can generate synthetic images alongside their ground-truth annotations. However, models trained on such images can perform poorly on real images due to the domain gap between real and synthetic images. Style transfer methods can reduce this difference by applying a realistic style to synthetic images. Choosing effective data transformations and their sequence is difficult due to the large combinatorial search space of style transfer operators. Using multi-objective genetic algorithms, we optimize pipelines to balance structural coherence and style similarity to target domains. We study the use of paired-image metrics on individual image samples during evolution to enable rapid pipeline evaluation, as opposed to standard distributional metrics that require the generation of many images. After optimization, we evaluate the resulting Pareto front using distributional metrics and segmentation performance. We apply this approach to standard datasets in synthetic-to-real domain adaptation: from the video game GTA5 to real image datasets Cityscapes and ACDC, focusing on adverse conditions. Results demonstrate that evolutionary algorithms can propose diverse augmentation pipelines adapted to different objectives. The contribution of this work is the formulation of style transfer as a sequencing problem suitable for evolutionary optimization and the study of efficient metrics that enable feasible search in this space.

    "abstract": "Retinal diseases spanning a broad spectrum can be effectively identified and diagnosed using complementary signals from multimodal data. However, multimodal diagnosis in ophthalmic practice is typically challenged in terms of data heterogeneity, potential invasiveness, registration complexity, and so on. As such, a unified framework that integrates multimodal data synthesis and fusion is proposed for retinal disease classification and grading. Specifically, the synthesized multimodal data incorporates fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA), multispectral imaging (MSI), and saliency maps that emphasize latent lesions as well as optic disc/cup regions. Parallel models are independently trained to learn modality-specific representations that capture cross-pathophysiological signatures. These features are then adaptively calibrated within and across modalities to perform information pruning and flexible integration according to downstream tasks. The proposed learning system is thoroughly interpreted through visualizations in both image and feature spaces. Extensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrated the superiority of our approach over state-of-the-art ones in the tasks of multi-label classification (F1-score: 0.683, AUC: 0.953) and diabetic retinopathy grading (Accuracy:0.842, Kappa: 0.861). This work not only enhances the accuracy and efficiency of retinal disease screening but also offers a scalable framework for data augmentation across various medical imaging modalities."

    "abstract": "Nowadays, training and evaluating DeepResearch-generated reports remain challenging due to the lack of verifiable reward signals. Accordingly, rubric-based evaluation has become a common practice. However, existing approaches either rely on coarse, pre-defined rubrics that lack sufficient granularity, or depend on manually constructed query-specific rubrics that are costly and difficult to scale. In this paper, we propose a pipeline to train human-preference-aligned query-specific rubric generators tailored for DeepResearch report generation. We first construct a dataset of DeepResearch-style queries annotated with human preferences over paired reports, and train rubric generators via reinforcement learning with a hybrid reward combining human preference supervision and LLM-based rubric evaluation. To better handle long-horizon reasoning, we further introduce a Multi-agent Markov-state (MaMs) workflow for report generation. We empirically show that our proposed rubric generators deliver more discriminative and better human-aligned supervision than existing rubric design strategies. Moreover, when integrated into the MaMs training framework, DeepResearch systems equipped with our rubric generators consistently outperform all open-source baselines on the DeepResearch Bench and achieve performance comparable to that of leading closed-source models."

    "abstract": "The effective Hamiltonian serves as the conceptual pivot of quantum engineering, transforming physical complexity into programmable logic; yet, its construction remains compromised by the mathematical non-uniqueness of block diagonalization, which introduces an intrinsic \"gauge freedom\" that standard methods fail to resolve. We address this by establishing the Least Action Unitary Transformation (LAUT) as the fundamental principle for effective models. By minimizing geometric action, LAUT guarantees dynamical fidelity and inherently enforces the preservation of symmetries--properties frequently violated by conventional Schrieffer-Wolff and Givens rotation techniques. We identify the Bloch-Brandow formalism as the natural perturbative counterpart to this principle, yielding analytic expansions that preserve symmetries to high order. We validate this framework against experimental data from superconducting quantum processors, demonstrating that LAUT quantitatively reproduces interaction rates in driven entangling gates where standard approximations diverge. Furthermore, in tunable coupler architectures, we demonstrate that the LAUT approach captures essential non-rotating-wave contributions that standard models neglect; this inclusion is critical for quantitatively reproducing interaction rates and revealing physical multi-body interactions such as $XZX+YZY$, which are verified to be physical rather than gauge artifacts. By reconciling variational optimality with analytical tractability, this work provides a systematic, experimentally validated route for high-precision system learning and Hamiltonian engineering."

    "abstract": "Context: The role of Pluto contributing to the long-term evolution of the trans-Neptunian region has been considered significant only over its neighboring Plutinos. However, it has recently been found that the long-term stability of the Twotino population is strongly affected when including Pluto as a massive object in simulations, while Eris, with a similar mass, has a negligible effect. Aims: We hypothesize that the effect of Pluto on Twotinos results from the latter being trapped in a 4:3 mean motion resonance (MMR) with Pluto. In this work, we aim to demonstrate the resonant behavior of Twotinos within Pluto's 4:3 MMR and the significance of this resonance for the long-term evolution of the population. Methods: We run high-resolution, 10 Myr REBOUND simulations of the observed Twotino population in the Kuiper belt, under the perturbations of the Sun, the four giant planets, and Pluto, as massive objects. Results: We find that all objects trapped in the 2:1 MMR with Neptune are locked in a weak 4:3 MMR with Pluto. The 4:3 resonant angles of most objects trapped in the leading and trailing islands of the 2:1 MMR, librate with amplitudes lower than $360^\\circ$. Objects in the symmetric islands of the 2:1 MMR librate in the 4:3 MMR with amplitudes greater than $360^\\circ$, but, contrary to circulating objects, will oscillate by up to $840^\\circ$ visiting preferred angles on Pluto's co-rotating frame, indicating a diluted resonant effect that may also perturb their orbits on secular timescales. Conclusions: The importance of Pluto in shaping the structure of the trans-Neptunian region should be reconsidered, especially for resonant populations. Moreover, with current computational power, its exclusion from simulations can not be justified."

After fitting a surrogate linear regression once, the procedure simulates small batches at the proposed parameter values and assigns kernel weights based on the resulting batch-residual discrepancy, producing a self-normalized pseudo-posterior that is simple, parallelizable, and requires access only to the fitted regression coefficients rather than raw observations. We formalize the construction as an importance-sampling approximation to a population target that averages over simulator randomness, prove consistency as the number of parameter draws grows, and establish stability in estimating the surrogate regression from finite samples. We then characterize the asymptotic concentration as the batch size increases and the bandwidth shrinks, showing that the pseudo-posterior concentrates on an identified set determined by the chosen projection, thereby clarifying when the method yields point versus set identification. Experiments on a tractable nonlinear model and on a cosmological calibration task using the DREAMS simulation suite illustrate the computational advantages of regression-based projections and the identifiability limitations arising from low-information summaries."

In this work, we focus on the problem of how CFs expand the attack surface of MLaaS by strengthening membership inference attacks (MIAs), and on the need to design defense mechanisms that mitigate this emerging risk without undermining utility and explainability. First, we systematically analyze how exposing CFs through query-based APIs enables more effective shadow-based MIAs. Second, we propose a defense framework that integrates Differential Privacy (DP) with Active Learning (AL) to jointly reduce memorization and limit effective training data exposure. Finally, we conduct an extensive empirical evaluation to characterize the three-way trade-off between privacy leakage, predictive performance, and explanation quality. Our findings highlight the need to carefully balance transparency, utility, and privacy in the responsible deployment of explainable MLaaS systems."

Building on three approximation families - inducing-point methods (FITC), Vecchia approximations, and a hybrid Vecchia-inducing-point full-scale approach (VIF) - we introduce three extensions that address key bottlenecks in large space-time settings: (i) a scalable correlation-based neighbor selection strategy for Vecchia approximations with point-referenced data, enabling accurate conditioning under complex dependence structures, (ii) a space-time kMeans++ inducing-point selection algorithm, and (iii) GPU-accelerated implementations of computationally expensive operations, including matrix operations and neighbor searches. Using both synthetic experiments and a large NOAA station dataset containing approximately 1.7 million space-time observations, we analyze the models with respect to predictive performance, parameter estimation, and computational efficiency. Our results demonstrate that scalable Gaussian process models can yield accurate continental-scale forecasts while remaining computationally feasible, offering practical tools for weather applications."

In a bistatic network where multiple backscatter nodes (BNs) harvest RF energy and alternate between sleep and active modes, we formulate a fractional program with coupled time, power, and reflection variables and develop a Dinkelbach-based alternating optimization (AO) algorithm with closed-form updates. Analysis reveals two operating modes depending on power availability, circuit demands and propagation conditions. Simulations show the proposed design adapts the time allocation, achieving up to 8% higher EE than fixed-power and 68% than no-sleep baselines, and delivering up to 127% EE gains over orthogonal multiple access (OMA).

Signatures of strong correlations- such as the onset of atomic or atomic-ligand multiplets and spin-orbit-entangled exciton have been observed in this material by various two-particle spectroscopies, but not previously in photoemission. Our measurements reveal a weakly dispersive feature at the valence-band edge that is absent in DFT+$U$ calculations and remains unchanged across the Néel transition. After critically examining and ruling out alternative interpretations, we show that an exact diagonalization of a NiS$_6$ cluster yields low-energy final-state configurations of mixed multiplet $d^7$ and $d^8\\underline{L}$ character, whose energy differences are consistent with the observed additional feature. This implies that ARPES directly accesses local Ni-S multiplet physics in NiPS$_3$, revealing a many-body structure beyond mean-field theory.

In this third paper in a series, we investigate how the strength of narrow interstellar absorption lines in low-resolution spectra varies with SN type and host galaxy properties, both on local and global scales. Using a dataset of over 10000 spectra from $\\sim1800$ low-redshift SNe, we find that Type Ia SNe (SNe Ia) in passive galaxies exhibit significantly weaker narrow absorption features compared to CC-SNe and SNe Ia in star-forming hosts (SNe Ia-SF), suggesting lower interstellar gas content in quiescent environments. Within the star-forming hosts, the Na I D equivalent-width distribution of SNe II is much lower than that of both SNe Ia-SF and stripped-envelope SNe (SE-SNe). This result is somewhat unexpected, since CC-SNe are generally associated with star-forming regions and occur deeper within galactic disks, where stronger line-of-sight extinction would be anticipated. This suggests that the observed behaviour cannot be explained solely by absorption from the integrated interstellar medium (ISM) along the line of sight. Instead, if part of the absorption arises from material near the explosion, the similarity between the Na I D EW distributions of SNe Ia-SF and SE-SNe implies that comparable absorption signatures can emerge from distinct progenitor pathways. Possible explanations include (a) circumstellar material (CSM) expelled by the progenitor system before explosion, or (b) interaction of SN radiation with nearby patchy ISM clouds. Our results highlight the diagnostic power of interstellar absorption features in revealing the diverse environments and progenitor pathways of SNe."

We introduce a modification to the MWEM framework that improves the per-iteration runtime dependency to $Θ(\\sqrt{m})$ in expectation. This is done via a lazy sampling approach to the Report-Noisy-Max mechanism, which we implement efficiently using Gumbel noise and a $k$-Nearest Neighbor data structure. This allows for the rapid selection of the approximate score in the exponential mechanism without an exhaustive linear scan. We apply our accelerated framework to the problems of private linear query release and solving Linear Programs (LPs) under neighboring constraint conditions and low-sensitivity assumptions.

    "abstract": "Critical quantum metrology exploits the dramatic growth of the quantum Fisher information near quantum phase transitions to enhance the precision of parameter estimation. Traditionally, this enhancement is associated with a closing energy gap, which causes the characteristic timescales for adiabatic preparation or relaxation to diverge with increasing system size. Consequently, the apparent growth of the quantum Fisher information largely reflects the increasing evolution time induced by critical slowing down, rather than a genuine gain in metrological performance, thereby severely limiting the practical usefulness of such protocols. Here we show that the relationship between energy-gap variations, quantum Fisher information, and achievable precision is far more subtle in interacting quantum systems: enhanced sensitivity does not require a vanishing gap, and, perhaps more surprisingly, a decreasing quantum Fisher information does not necessarily imply reduced precision once the time is properly taken into account. Building on this insight, we introduce an anti-critical metrology scheme that achieves enhanced precision while the energy gap increases. We illustrate this mechanism using the quantum Rabi model, thereby identifying a route to metrological advantage that avoids the critical slowing down associated with conventional criticality."

We also investigate the role of Skip Connections in preserving semantic information during the reverse diffusion process. Experimental results on the full MNIST dataset (digits 0-9) demonstrate that the proposed architecture is capable of generating structurally coherent and recognizable images for all digit classes.

In a second analysis, we manipulate input traits to maximize Neuroticism and Psychoticism scores. Notably, when Psychoticism is maximized, several models produce an overrepresentation of non-binary and LGBTQ+ identities, raising concerns about stereotyping and the potential pathologization of marginalized groups.

We propose the WST-X series, a novel family of feature extractors that combines the best of both worlds via the wavelet scattering transform (WST), integrating wavelets with nonlinearities analogous to deep convolutional networks. We investigate 1D and 2D WSTs to extract acoustic details and higher-order structural anomalies, respectively. Experimental results on the recent and challenging Deepfake-Eval-2024 dataset indicate that WST-X outperforms existing front-ends by a wide margin.

    "abstract": "Event cameras offer a considerable alternative to RGB cameras in many scenarios. While there are recent works on event-based novel-view synthesis, dense 3D mesh reconstruction remains scarcely explored and existing event-based techniques are severely limited in their 3D reconstruction accuracy. To address this limitation, we present EventNeuS, a self-supervised neural model for learning 3D representations from monocular colour event streams. Our approach, for the first time, combines 3D signed distance function and density field learning with event-based supervision. Furthermore, we introduce spherical harmonics encodings into our model for enhanced handling of view-dependent effects. EventNeuS outperforms existing approaches by a significant margin, achieving 34% lower Chamfer distance and 31% lower mean absolute error on average compared to the best previous method."

    "abstract": "Parallel thinking has emerged as a promising paradigm for reasoning, yet it imposes significant computational burdens. Existing efficiency methods primarily rely on local, per-trajectory signals and lack principled mechanisms to exploit global dynamics across parallel branches. We introduce 2D probing, an interface that exposes the width-depth dynamics of parallel thinking by periodically eliciting intermediate answers from all branches. Our analysis reveals three key insights: non-monotonic scaling across width-depth allocations, heterogeneous reasoning branch lengths, and early stabilization of global consensus. Guided by these insights, we introduce $\\textbf{Parallel-Probe}$, a training-free controller designed to optimize online parallel thinking. Parallel-Probe employs consensus-based early stopping to regulate reasoning depth and deviation-based branch pruning to dynamically adjust width. Extensive experiments across three benchmarks and multiple models demonstrate that Parallel-Probe establishes a superior Pareto frontier for test-time scaling. Compared to standard majority voting, it reduces sequential tokens by up to $\\textbf{35.8}$% and total token cost by over $\\textbf{25.8}$% while maintaining competitive accuracy."

    "abstract": "The spanwise organization of the flow over a thick airfoil is investigated using surface pressure measurements for a range of angles of attack around maximum lift and high Reynolds numbers (1 Million). Locally strong pressure fluctuations, which are not detected in the global lift coefficient, are shown to be associated with the presence of a stall cell. The stall cell width is of the order of the chord length and increases linearly with the angle of attack, with a weak dependence on the Reynolds number. Its dynamics at Reynolds numbers larger than 1 Million is dominated by a coherent motion in the spanwise direction with a characteristic velocity of order tenth of the freestream velocity. The motion can be decomposed into a large-scale, low-frequency sweep with a Strouhal number equal to 0.001 combined with faster, smaller-scale oscillations. The coherence of the stall cell makes it possible to track global dynamics from local measurements."

In this work, we present a detailed study of this process within the framework of Higgs Effective Field Theory (HEFT) at the High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC). A comparative analysis is performed using a traditional cut-based approach in the single-lepton channel and a multivariate parametric boosted decision tree method in both single-lepton and dilepton final states. We derive one- and two-parameter limits at 95\\% confidence level on the HEFT couplings $δκ_λ$, $c_2$, $c_{2g}$, and $c_{tg}$. The projected bound on $δκ_λ$ is weaker than current experimental constraints from dedicated Higgs-pair measurement; however, this coupling plays a critical role in shaping the multidimensional allowed parameter space. For the remaining HEFT couplings, where no direct experimental limits currently exist, our results provide the first sensitivity projections in the $t\\bar{t}hh$ channel. Overall, this study demonstrates the strong potential of the $t\\bar{t}hh$ production process to probe extended Higgs and top-quark interactions beyond the Standard Model through the exploitation of the $t\\bar{t}hh$ data at the HL-LHC."

To address this gap, we present PrevizWhiz, a system that leverages rough 3D scenes in combination with generative image and video models to create stylized video previews. The workflow integrates frame-level image restyling with adjustable resemblance, time-based editing through motion paths or external video inputs, and refinement into high-fidelity video clips.

However, data on lunar soil properties remain fragmented across decades of mission reports, often in formats that are difficult to access or interpret. We present a newly compiled database of lunar regolith physical and geotechnical properties, including data collected by direct in-situ measurements from crewed missions, estimates inferred from surface interactions on the Moon and using remote sensing, as well as laboratory analyses of samples returned to Earth. The data collected include, among others, the angle of internal friction and cohesion (both Mohr-Coulomb model parameters), bulk density, and static bearing capacity, extracted from Luna and Apollo-era historical mission documentation all the way to contemporary Lunar programs. The dataset specifies the type and location of the tests from which each value was obtained. Our database also includes parameters for lunar regolith simulants, providing a direct link between mission data and laboratory studies. In addition to centralizing this information, we developed a user interface that facilitates data retrieval, filtering, and visualization. This interface enables users to generate customized plots for comparative analysis. Developed in an open-science perspective, it is designed to evolve in response to the community's needs. The database and its associated tools significantly enhance the accessibility and usability of lunar regolith and simulants data for scientific and engineering research."

    "abstract": "Human interventions are a common source of data in autonomous systems during testing. These interventions provide an important signal about where the current policy needs improvement, but are often noisy and incomplete. We define Robust Intervention Learning (RIL) as the problem of learning from intervention data while remaining robust to the quality and informativeness of the intervention signal. In the best case, interventions are precise and avoiding them is sufficient to solve the task, but in many realistic settings avoiding interventions is necessary but not sufficient for achieving good performance. We study robust intervention learning in the context of emergency stop interventions and propose Residual Intervention Fine-Tuning (RIFT), a residual fine-tuning algorithm that treats intervention feedback as an incomplete learning signal and explicitly combines it with a prior policy. By framing intervention learning as a fine-tuning problem, our approach leverages structure encoded in the prior policy to resolve ambiguity when intervention signals under-specify the task. We provide theoretical analysis characterizing conditions under which this formulation yields principled policy improvement, and identify regimes where intervention learning is expected to fail. Our experiments reveal that residual fine-tuning enables robust and consistent policy improvement across a range of intervention strategies and prior policy qualities, and highlight robust intervention learning as a promising direction for future work."

The technique has been tested on a supersonic argon jet excited by electrons at a distance of 30 millimetres from the nozzle outlet, where the clustering process is practically complete, and the influence of secondary processes on the intensity of the observed emissions is significantly suppressed. It is proposed to use the continuum emitted by neutral excited clusters with a wavelength of 127 nm as an indicator of cluster formation in a supersonic argon jet under various flow conditions. Analysis of the temperature dependence of the intensity of this continuum recorded at multiple argon pressures at the nozzle inlet allowed us to establish that the parameters of supersonic jet flow corresponding to the onset of crystallisation are related by the empirical expression. The calculated value of the constant for argon in the studied range of pressures and temperatures was 0.011."

At its core is SymFormer, a structure-aware Transformer that models hierarchical symbolic dependencies via tree-relative self-attention and enforces syntactic validity through grammar-constrained autoregressive decoding, overcoming the limited expressivity of sequence-based generators. Unlike numerical and neural approaches that approximate solutions in discretized or implicit function spaces, SymPlex operates directly in symbolic expression space, enabling interpretable and human-readable solutions that naturally represent non-smooth behavior and explicit parametric dependence. Empirical results demonstrate exact recovery of non-smooth and parametric PDE solutions using deep learning-based symbolic methods."

    "abstract": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) suffer from severe training inefficiency issue, which is associated with their massive model sizes and visual token numbers. Existing efforts in efficient training focus on reducing model sizes or trainable parameters. Inspired by the success of Visual Token Pruning (VTP) in improving inference efficiency, we are exploring another substantial research direction for efficient training by reducing visual tokens. However, applying VTP at the training stage results in a training-inference mismatch: pruning-trained models perform poorly when inferring on non-pruned full visual token sequences. To close this gap, we propose DualSpeed, a fast-slow framework for efficient training of MLLMs. The fast-mode is the primary mode, which incorporates existing VTP methods as plugins to reduce visual tokens, along with a mode isolator to isolate the model's behaviors. The slow-mode is the auxiliary mode, where the model is trained on full visual sequences to retain training-inference consistency. To boost its training, it further leverages self-distillation to learn from the sufficiently trained fast-mode. Together, DualSpeed can achieve both training efficiency and non-degraded performance. Experiments show DualSpeed accelerates the training of LLaVA-1.5 by 2.1$\\times$ and LLaVA-NeXT by 4.0$\\times$, retaining over 99% performance. Code: https://github.com/dingkun-zhang/DualSpeed"

    "abstract": "Imbalanced node classification in graph neural networks (GNNs) happens when some labels are much more common than others, which causes the model to learn unfairly and perform badly on the less common classes. To solve this problem, we propose a Curriculum-Guided Feature Learning and Three-Stage Attention Network (CL3AN-GNN), a learning network that uses a three-step attention system (Engage, Enact, Embed) similar to how humans learn. The model begins by engaging with structurally simpler features, defined as (1) local neighbourhood patterns (1-hop), (2) low-degree node attributes, and (3) class-separable node pairs identified via initial graph convolutional networks and graph attention networks (GCN and GAT) embeddings. This foundation enables stable early learning despite label skew. The Enact stage then addresses complicated aspects: (1) connections that require multiple steps, (2) edges that connect different types of nodes, and (3) nodes at the edges of minority classes by using adjustable attention weights. Finally, Embed consolidates these features via iterative message passing and curriculum-aligned loss weighting. We evaluate CL3AN-GNN on eight Open Graph Benchmark datasets spanning social, biological, and citation networks. Experiments show consistent improvements across all datasets in accuracy, F1-score, and AUC over recent state-of-the-art methods. The model's step-by-step method works well with different types of graph datasets, showing quicker results than training everything at once, better performance on new, imbalanced graphs, and clear explanations of each step using gradient stability and attention correlation learning curves. This work provides both a theoretically grounded framework for curriculum learning in GNNs and practical evidence of its effectiveness against imbalances, validated through metrics, convergence speeds, and generalisation tests."

However, they still face key challenges: a misalignment between coordinate-space actions and pixel-space videos, sensitivity to camera viewpoint, and non-unified architectures across embodiments. To this end, we present BridgeV2W, which converts coordinate-space actions into pixel-aligned embodiment masks rendered from the URDF and camera parameters. These masks are then injected into a pretrained video generation model via a ControlNet-style pathway, which aligns the action control signals with predicted videos, adds view-specific conditioning to accommodate camera viewpoints, and yields a unified world model architecture across embodiments. To mitigate overfitting to static backgrounds, BridgeV2W further introduces a flow-based motion loss that focuses on learning dynamic and task-relevant regions. Experiments on single-arm (DROID) and dual-arm (AgiBot-G1) datasets, covering diverse and challenging conditions with unseen viewpoints and scenes, show that BridgeV2W improves video generation quality compared to prior state-of-the-art methods. We further demonstrate the potential of BridgeV2W on downstream real-world tasks, including policy evaluation and goal-conditioned planning.

    "abstract": "The advent of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models represents a significant leap for embodied intelligence, yet their immense computational demands critically hinder deployment on resource-constrained robotic platforms. Intuitively, low-bit quantization is a prevalent and preferred technique for large-scale model compression. However, we find that a systematic analysis of VLA model's quantization is fundamentally lacking. We argue that naively applying uniform-bit quantization from Large Language Models (LLMs) to robotics is flawed, as these methods prioritize passive data fidelity while ignoring how minor action deviations compound into catastrophic task failures. To bridge this gap, we introduce QVLA, the first action-centric quantization framework specifically designed for embodied control. In a sharp departure from the rigid, uniform-bit quantization of LLM-based methods, QVLA introduces a highly granular, channel-wise bit allocation strategy. Its core mechanism is to directly measure the final action-space sensitivity when quantizing each individual channel to various bit-widths. This process yields a precise, per-channel importance metric that guides a global optimization, which elegantly unifies quantization and pruning (0-bit) into a single, cohesive framework. Extensive evaluations on different baselines demonstrate the superiority of our approach. In the LIBERO, the quantization version of OpenVLA-OFT with our method requires only 29.2% of the original model's VRAM while maintaining 98.9% of its original performance and achieving a 1.49x speedup. This translates to a 22.6% performance improvement over the LLM-derived method SmoothQuant. Our work establishes a new, principled foundation for compressing VLA models in robotics, paving the way for deploying powerful, large-scale models on real-world hardware. Code will be released."

Building on the resonant exciton-exciton annihilation (EEA) mechanism in 2H-phase TMDs, we report the first observation of upconversion photoluminescence (UPL) in rhombohedral MoS2 and demonstrate that this many-body process is strongly polytype-dependent. Using low-temperature spectroscopy, we observe anti-Stokes emission with superlinear power dependence. Beyond serving as a layer-number sensor, UPL provides a sensitive probe of stacking order. Trilayer ABA and BAB polytypes, indistinguishable by surface potential measurements and second harmonic generation, exhibit markedly different UPL intensities, and this persists in thicker samples. First-principles calculations attribute this polytype dependence to modulation of the Gamma-point conduction manifold, which controls energy-matching conditions for the annihilation process. Power-dependent spectroscopy further disentangles two distinct annihilation channels originating from different dark exciton valleys, identified through their contrasting intensity scaling and opposite density-induced energy shifts. Crucially, the annihilation process doubles the energy separation of nearly degenerate dark excitons while converting their weak emission into bright signal, providing experimental access to valley-specific responses that are obscured in direct dark-exciton spectroscopy. Our findings demonstrate that ferroelectric configurations provide a new degree of freedom for controlling nonlinear optical processes, with implications for all-optical ferroelectric readout and electrically switchable wavelength conversion in two-dimensional materials."

In this paper, we establish global-in-time existence for general initial data with critical mass, without imposing any symmetry or moment assumptions.

In contrast, most computer vision systems encode the visual world at a uniform resolution, raising challenges for processing full-field high-resolution images efficiently. We propose a foveated vision interface (FOVI) based on the human retina and primary visual cortex, that reformats a variable-resolution retina-like sensor array into a uniformly dense, V1-like sensor manifold. Receptive fields are defined as k-nearest-neighborhoods (kNNs) on the sensor manifold, enabling kNN-convolution via a novel kernel mapping technique. We demonstrate two use cases: (1) an end-to-end kNN-convolutional architecture, and (2) a foveated adaptation of the foundational DINOv3 ViT model, leveraging low-rank adaptation (LoRA). These models provide competitive performance at a fraction of the computational cost of non-foveated baselines, opening pathways for efficient and scalable active sensing for high-resolution egocentric vision.

We explore using ML classifiers to determine input validity. We hypothesize that tensor shapes are a precise abstraction to encode concrete inputs and capture relationships of the data. Shape abstraction severely reduces problem dimensionality, which is important to facilitate ML training. Labeled data are obtained by observing runtime outcomes on a sample of inputs and classifiers are trained on sets of labeled inputs to capture API constraints. Our evaluation, conducted over 183 APIs from TensorFlow and Pytorch, shows that the classifiers generalize well on unseen data with over 91% accuracy. Integrating these classifiers into the pipeline of ACETest, a SoTA bug-finding technique, improves its pass rate from ~29% to ~61%. Our findings suggest that ML-enhanced input classification is an important aid to scale DL library testing."

Our method provides versatile control at multiple scales, ranging from fine-grained texture matching via single patches to broad semantic guidance using global image feature tokens. We further extend this to multi-concept composition, allowing for the faithful combination of distinct concepts. REPA-G operates entirely at inference time, offering a flexible and precise alternative to often ambiguous text prompts or coarse class labels. We theoretically justify how this guidance enables sampling from the potential-induced tilted distribution.

    "abstract": "In the three-flavor neutrino oscillation framework, we investigate the transition probabilities of an initial muon neutrino flavor state in the presence of non-standard interactions (NSIs) characterized by complex off-diagonal ($|ε_{αβ}|e^{iφ_{αβ}}$) and diagonal parameters ($|ε_{αα}-ε_{ββ}|$), including a CP-violating phase and a constant matter potential, under both normal (NO) and inverted mass ordering (IO) scenarios. Within these scenarios and through the lens of mode entanglement, bipartite entanglement measures such as entanglement entropy and capacity of entanglement are quantified in terms of the transition probabilities, which can be measured in neutrino oscillation experiments. Using these two bipartite entanglement measures, we further explore the quantum speed limit (QSL) time, which describes how rapidly bipartite entanglement evolves during neutrino oscillations. We illustrate our results using the baseline lengths and energies corresponding to ongoing long-baseline accelerator neutrino experiments, such as T2K, NO$ν$A, and the upcoming DUNE experiment. In the presence of a CP-violating phase and a constant matter potential, both with and without NSI effects, we compare the QSL time behavior for bipartite entanglement in neutrino oscillations for NO and IO. The most pronounced discrepancies in the QSL time for bipartite entanglement arise from the off-diagonal NSI parameter $ε_{μτ}$ across both the NO and IO scenarios. We emphasize that among all the experiments considered, NO$ν$A and DUNE exhibit a rapid suppression of bipartite entanglement in neutrino oscillations in the standard oscillation scenario with NO at the end of their baseline lengths for the corresponding best-fit value of CP-violating phase. Our results hint at a possible imprint of new physics in neutrino oscillations."

    "abstract": "Autoregressive video world models predict future visual observations conditioned on actions. While effective over short horizons, these models often struggle with long-horizon generation, as small prediction errors accumulate over time. Prior methods alleviate this by introducing pre-trained teacher models and sequence-level distribution matching, which incur additional computational cost and fail to prevent error propagation beyond the training horizon. In this work, we propose LIVE, a Long-horizon Interactive Video world modEl that enforces bounded error accumulation via a novel cycle-consistency objective, thereby eliminating the need for teacher-based distillation. Specifically, LIVE first performs a forward rollout from ground-truth frames and then applies a reverse generation process to reconstruct the initial state. The diffusion loss is subsequently computed on the reconstructed terminal state, providing an explicit constraint on long-horizon error propagation. Moreover, we provide an unified view that encompasses different approaches and introduce progressive training curriculum to stabilize training. Experiments demonstrate that LIVE achieves state-of-the-art performance on long-horizon benchmarks, generating stable, high-quality videos far beyond training rollout lengths."

    "abstract": "The visualization of temporal data on urban buildings, such as shadows, noise, and solar potential, plays a critical role in the analysis of dynamic urban phenomena. However, in dense and geographically constrained 3D urban environments, visual representations of time-varying building data often suffer from occlusion and visual clutter. To address these two challenges, we introduce an immersive lens visualization that integrates a view-dependent cutaway de-occlusion technique and a temporal display derived from a conformal mapping algorithm. The mapping process first partitions irregular building footprints into smaller, sufficiently regular subregions that serve as structural primitives. These subregions are then seamlessly recombined to form a conformal, layered layout for our temporal lens visualization. The view-responsive cutaway is inspired by traditional architectural illustrations, preserving the overall layout of the building and its surroundings to maintain users' sense of spatial orientation. This lens design enables the occlusion-free embedding of shape-adaptive temporal displays across building facades on demand, supporting rapid time-space association for the discovery, access and interpretation of spatiotemporal urban patterns. Guided by domain and design goals, we outline the rationale behind the lens visual and interaction design choices, such as the encoding of time progression and temporal values in the conforming lens image. A user study compares our approach against conventional juxtaposition and x-ray spatiotemporal designs. Results validate the usage and utility of our lens, showing that it improves task accuracy and completion time, reduces navigation effort, and increases user confidence. From these findings, we distill design recommendations and promising directions for future research on spatially-embedded lenses in 3D visualization and urban analytics."

Although robotic platforms equipped with visual sensors can efficiently detect structural deficiencies, the automated generation of human-readable summaries from these detections remains a significant challenge, especially on resource-constrained edge devices. This paper presents a novel two-stage pipeline for end-to-end summarization of underground deficiencies, combining our lightweight RAPID-SCAN segmentation model with a fine-tuned Vision-Language Model (VLM) deployed on an edge computing platform. The first stage employs RAPID-SCAN (Resource-Aware Pipeline Inspection and Defect Segmentation using Compact Adaptive Network), achieving 0.834 F1-score with only 0.64M parameters for efficient defect segmentation. The second stage utilizes a fine-tuned Phi-3.5 VLM that generates concise, domain-specific summaries in natural language from the segmentation outputs. We introduce a curated dataset of inspection images with manually verified descriptions for VLM fine-tuning and evaluation. To enable real-time performance, we employ post-training quantization with hardware-specific optimization, achieving significant reductions in model size and inference latency without compromising summarization quality. We deploy and evaluate our complete pipeline on a mobile robotic platform, demonstrating its effectiveness in real-world inspection scenarios. Our results show the potential of edge-deployable integrated AI systems to bridge the gap between automated defect detection and actionable insights for infrastructure maintenance, paving the way for more scalable and autonomous inspection solutions."

Such conditions are presented in the general case when ${\\cE}$ is a closed subset of the real line, then examined for some specific cases.

Despite their importance, the supply of detector-grade HPGe remains limited because achieving high yield in Czochralski growth (CZ) depends on tightly coupled, nonlinear processes, impurity incorporation, thermal gradients, and dynamic control settings that are largely mastered by only a handful of companies with decades of experience. Here we present a data-driven prediction framework based on a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) neural network with multi-head attention, trained on time-resolved growth parameters (e.g., heater power, pull rate, and impurity indicators) from 48 independent crystal runs. The model predicts the final detector-grade fraction for each growth and, using SHAP feature-importance analysis, identifies impurity concentration and growth rate as the dominant factors governing yield, consistent with empirical understanding. By providing a quantitative, interpretable link between in-process signals and post-growth detector quality, this framework offers a practical path toward improving yield, reducing dependence on trial-and-error tuning, and scaling HPGe production for next-generation rare-event detectors."

However, learning in long-horizon settings remains challenging due to sparse, trajectory-level outcome rewards. While prior tree-based methods attempt to mitigate this issue, they often suffer from high variance and computational inefficiency. Through empirical analysis of search agents, We identify a common pattern: performance diverges mainly due to decisions near the tail. Motivated by this observation, we propose Branching Relative Policy Optimization (BranPO), a value-free method that provides step-level contrastive supervision without dense rewards. BranPO truncates trajectories near the tail and resamples alternative continuations to construct contrastive suffixes over shared prefixes, reducing credit ambiguity in long-horizon rollouts. To further boost efficiency and stabilize training, we introduce difficulty-aware branch sampling to adapt branching frequency across tasks, and redundant step masking to suppress uninformative actions. Extensive experiments on various question answering benchmarks demonstrate that BranPO consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving significant accuracy gains on long-horizon tasks without increasing the overall training budget.

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a narrowband fully-analog $N$-antenna transmitter that emulates the functionality of a narrowband fully-digital $N$-antenna transmitter. Specifically, in symbol interval $m$, the proposed fully-analog transmitter synthesizes an arbitrary complex excitation vector $\\bm x[m]\\in\\mathbb{C}^N$ with prescribed total power $\\|\\bm x[m]\\|_2^2=P$ from a single coherent RF tone, using only tunable phase-control elements embedded in a passive interferometric programmable network. The programmable network is excited through one input port while the remaining $N - 1$ input ports are impedance matched. In the ideal lossless case, the network transfer is unitary and therefore redistributes RF power among antenna ports without dissipative amplitude control. The synthesis task is posed as a unitary state-preparation problem: program a unitary family so that $\\bm V(\\bm\\varphi)\\bm e_1=\\bm c$, where $\\bm c=\\bm x/\\sqrt{P}$ and $\\|\\bm c\\|_2=1$. We provide a constructive realization and a closed-form programming rule: a binary magnitude-splitting tree allocates the desired per-antenna magnitudes $|c_n|$ using $N -1$ tunable split ratios, and a per-antenna output phase bank assigns the target phases using $N$ tunable phase shifts. The resulting architecture uses $2N-1$ real tunable degrees of freedom and admits a deterministic $O(N)$ programming procedure with no iterative optimization, enabling symbol-by-symbol updates when the chosen phase-control technology supports the required tuning speed. Using representative COTS components, we model the RF-front-end DC power of the proposed fully-analog transmitter and compare it against an equivalent COTS fully-digital array. For $N\\le 16$, the comparison indicates significant RF-front-end power savings for the fully-analog architecture. The results in this paper are intended as a proof-of-concept for a narrowband fully-analog transmitter."

The model is equivalent to the quantum lattice nonlinear Schrödinger (NLS) model and appears as an effective theory in deep inelastic scattering in high-energy quantum chromodynamics. Owing to its integrability, it admits a consistent Bethe Ansatz description and a well-defined thermodynamic limit. Using the thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz, we analyze the ground state, elementary excitations, and finite-temperature properties. In contrast to the conventional positive spin XXX chain, the negative spin model exhibits a distinct vacuum structure and excitation spectrum, leading to modified TBA equations and unconventional low-temperature behavior. Although the integral equations resemble those of the Lieb-Liniger Bose gas, the thermodynamics and scaling properties are qualitatively different and cannot be continuously connected. We derive the free energy, entropy, and specific heat, and identify a quantum phase transition separating different thermodynamic regimes. At zero temperature, the excitation spectrum becomes linear in the continuum limit and can be described by a conformal field theory. The low-temperature regime realizes a Luttinger-liquid like phase with features unique to the negative spin XXX chain."

Despite this, most existing pretraining recipes are not anytime: they rely on horizon-dependent learning rate schedules and extensive tuning under a fixed compute budget. In this work, we provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating the existence of anytime learning schedules for overparameterized linear regression, and we highlight the central role of weight averaging - also known as model merging - in achieving the minimax convergence rates of stochastic gradient descent. We show that these anytime schedules polynomially decay with time, with the decay rate determined by the source and capacity conditions of the problem. Empirically, we evaluate 150M and 300M parameter language models trained at 1-32x Chinchilla scale, comparing constant learning rates with weight averaging and $1/\\sqrt{t}$ schedules with weight averaging against a well-tuned cosine schedule. Across the full training range, the anytime schedules achieve comparable final loss to cosine decay. Taken together, our results suggest that weight averaging combined with simple, horizon-free step sizes offers a practical and effective anytime alternative to cosine learning rate schedules for large language model pretraining."

Inspired by the success of large language models (LLMs), we propose a pretrain-then-finetune approach built on a designed Transformer model to address this challenge. The model is first pretrained on large-scale, domain-informed synthetic data that encode managerial knowledge and structural features of the decision environment, and is then fine-tuned on real observations. This new pipeline offers two complementary advantages: pretraining injects domain knowledge into the learning process and enables the training of high-capacity models using abundant synthetic data, while finetuning adapts the pretrained model to the operational environment and improves alignment with the true data-generating regime. While we have leveraged the Transformer's state-of-the-art representational capacity, particularly its attention mechanism, to efficiently extract cross-task structure, our approach is not an off-the-shelf application. Instead, it relies on problem-specific architectural design and a tailored training procedure to match the decision setting. Theoretically, we develop the first comprehensive error analysis regarding Transformer learning in relevant contexts, establishing nonasymptotic guarantees that validate the method's effectiveness. Critically, our analysis reveals how pretraining and fine-tuning jointly determine performance, with the dominant contribution governed by whichever is more favorable. In particular, finetuning exhibits an economies-of-scale effect, whereby transfer learning becomes increasingly effective as the number of instances grows."

We propose BAR-RAG, which reframes the reranker as a boundary-aware evidence selector that targets the generator's Goldilocks Zone -- evidence that is neither trivially easy nor fundamentally unanswerable for the generator, but is challenging yet sufficient for inference and thus provides the strongest learning signal. BAR-RAG trains the selector with reinforcement learning using generator feedback, and adopts a two-stage pipeline that fine-tunes the generator under the induced evidence distribution to mitigate the distribution mismatch between training and inference. Experiments on knowledge-intensive question answering benchmarks show that BAR-RAG consistently improves end-to-end performance under noisy retrieval, achieving an average gain of 10.3 percent over strong RAG and reranking baselines while substantially improving robustness.

This is surprising as we operate on the simple topology of a line graph. In the second model, agents navigate a more complex network modeled by a weighted graph where edge weights represent distances. We face the decision of improving travel time along a fixed number of edges. We provide a polynomial-time algorithm that combines Dijkstra's algorithm with a dynamical program to find the optimal decision for one or two agents. By contrast, if the number of agents is variable, we find \\np-completeness and inapproximability results for utilitarian and egalitarian welfare.

Important non-logarithmically enhanced contributions must also be calculated. We discuss dimensional regularization in the Breitenlohner-Maison-'t Hooft-Veltman scheme. The goal here consists of determining in this scheme quantum effects in chiral theories at one loop. Namely, the determination of finite counterterms at one loop that reestablish the Slavnov-Taylor identities, which follow from gauge symmetries. These counterterms are necessary due to the presence of evanescent symmetry-breaking terms in the classical Lagrangian needed to regularize fermion propagators. We consider a technique that allows an easier calculation of such finite effects, relying on the identification of $(D-4)/(D-4)$ terms of one-loop amplitudes with an external ghost leg. We focus on dimension-6 four-fermion operators, identifying all finite counterterms in the Breitenlohner-Maison-'t Hooft-Veltman scheme at one loop, and as expected find no obstructions to the Slavnov-Taylor identities that cannot be cured by finite counterterms.

    "abstract": "The quadratic computational complexity of softmax transformers has become a bottleneck in long-context scenarios. In contrast, linear attention model families provide a promising direction towards a more efficient sequential model. These linear attention models compress past KV values into a single hidden state, thereby efficiently reducing complexity during both training and inference. However, their expressivity remains limited by the size of their hidden state. Previous work proposed interleaving softmax and linear attention layers to reduce computational complexity while preserving expressivity. Nevertheless, the efficiency of these models remains bottlenecked by their softmax attention layers. In this paper, we propose Neural Attention Search Linear (NAtS-L), a framework that applies both linear attention and softmax attention operations within the same layer on different tokens. NAtS-L automatically determines whether a token can be handled by a linear attention model, i.e., tokens that have only short-term impact and can be encoded into fixed-size hidden states, or require softmax attention, i.e., tokens that contain information related to long-term retrieval and need to be preserved for future queries. By searching for optimal Gated DeltaNet and softmax attention combinations across tokens, we show that NAtS-L provides a strong yet efficient token-level hybrid architecture."

    "abstract": "The current census of planetary systems displays a wide range of architectures. Extending earlier work, this paper investigates the correlation between our classification framework for these architectures and host stellar properties. Specifically, we explore how planetary system properties depend on stellar mass and stellar metallicity. This work confirms previously detected trends that jovian planets are less prevalent for low-mass and low-metallicity stars. We also find new, but expected trends such as that the total mass in planets increases with stellar mass, and that observed planetary system masses show an upper limit that is roughly consistent with expectations from the stability of circumstellar disks. We tentatively identify potential unique trends in the host stars of super-puffs and hot jupiters and a possible subdivision of the class of hot jupiter systems. In general, we find that system architectures are not overly dependent on host star properties."

They also offer cognitive training benefits. According to the DSM-5 classification, cognitive disorders are categorized as Mild Neurocognitive Disorders (mild NCDs) and Major Neurocognitive Disorders (Major NCDs). In this study, we focus on three patient groups: healthy, mild NCD, and Major NCD. We employ Discrete Time Markov Chains to model the behavior exhibited by each group while interacting with serious games. By applying model-checking techniques, we can identify discrepancies between expected and actual gameplay behavior. The primary contribution of this work is a novel theoretical framework designed to assess how a practitioner's confidence level in diagnosing a patient's Alzheimer's stage evolves with each game session (diagnosis support). Additionally, we propose an experimental protocol where the difficulty of subsequent game sessions is dynamically adjusted based on the patient's observed behavior in previous sessions (training support)."

    "abstract": "Generating synthetic tabular data under severe class imbalance is essential for domains where rare but high-impact events drive decision-making. However, most generative models either overlook minority groups or fail to produce samples that are useful for downstream learning. We introduce CTTVAE, a Conditional Transformer-based Tabular Variational Autoencoder equipped with two complementary mechanisms: (i) a class-aware triplet margin loss that restructures the latent space for sharper intra-class compactness and inter-class separation, and (ii) a training-by-sampling strategy that adaptively increases exposure to underrepresented groups. Together, these components form CTTVAE+TBS, a framework that consistently yields more representative and utility-aligned samples without destabilizing training. Across six real-world benchmarks, CTTVAE+TBS achieves the strongest downstream utility on minority classes, often surpassing models trained on the original imbalanced data while maintaining competitive fidelity and bridging the gap for privacy for interpolation-based sampling methods and deep generative methods. Ablation studies further confirm that both latent structuring and targeted sampling contribute to these gains. By explicitly prioritizing downstream performance in rare categories, CTTVAE+TBS provides a robust and interpretable solution for conditional tabular data generation, with direct applicability to industries such as healthcare, fraud detection, and predictive maintenance where even small gains in minority cases can be critical."

    "abstract": "Sampling-based controllers, such as Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) methods, offer substantial flexibility but often suffer from high variance and low sample efficiency. To address these challenges, we introduce a hybrid variance-reduced MPPI framework that integrates a prior model into the sampling process. Our key insight is to decompose the objective function into a known approximate model and a residual term. Since the residual captures only the discrepancy between the model and the objective, it typically exhibits a smaller magnitude and lower variance than the original objective. Although this principle applies to general modeling choices, we demonstrate that adopting a quadratic approximation enables the derivation of a closed-form, model-guided prior that effectively concentrates samples in informative regions. Crucially, the framework is agnostic to the source of geometric information, allowing the quadratic model to be constructed from exact derivatives, structural approximations (e.g., Gauss- or Quasi-Newton), or gradient-free randomized smoothing. We validate the approach on standard optimization benchmarks, a nonlinear, underactuated cart-pole control task, and a contact-rich manipulation problem with non-smooth dynamics. Across these domains, we achieve faster convergence and superior performance in low-sample regimes compared to standard MPPI. These results suggest that the method can make sample-based control strategies more practical in scenarios where obtaining samples is expensive or limited."

However, they still face significant limitations, such as high sampling costs and insufficient physical consistency, stemming from their many-step iterative sampling mechanism and lack of explicit physics constraints. To address these issues, we propose Phys-Instruct, a novel physics-guided distillation framework which not only (1) compresses a pre-trained diffusion PDE solver into a few-step generator via matching generator and prior diffusion distributions to enable rapid sampling, but also (2) enhances the physics consistency by explicitly injecting PDE knowledge through a PDE distillation guidance. Physic-Instruct is built upon a solid theoretical foundation, leading to a practical physics-constrained training objective that admits tractable gradients. Across five PDE benchmarks, Phys-Instruct achieves orders-of-magnitude faster inference while reducing PDE error by more than 8 times compared to state-of-the-art diffusion baselines. Moreover, the resulting unconditional student model functions as a compact prior, enabling efficient and physically consistent inference for various downstream conditional tasks. Our results indicate that Phys-Instruct is a novel, effective, and efficient framework for ultra-fast PDE solving powered by deep generative models."

    "abstract": "Training-free video understanding leverages the strong image comprehension capabilities of pre-trained vision language models (VLMs) by treating a video as a sequence of static frames, thus obviating the need for costly video-specific training. However, this paradigm often suffers from severe visual redundancy and high computational overhead, especially when processing long videos. Crucially, existing keyframe selection strategies, especially those based on CLIP similarity, are prone to biases and may inadvertently overlook critical frames, resulting in suboptimal video comprehension. To address these significant challenges, we propose \\textbf{KTV}, a novel two-stage framework for efficient and effective training-free video understanding. In the first stage, KTV performs question-agnostic keyframe selection by clustering frame-level visual features, yielding a compact, diverse, and representative subset of frames that mitigates temporal redundancy. In the second stage, KTV applies key visual token selection, pruning redundant or less informative tokens from each selected keyframe based on token importance and redundancy, which significantly reduces the number of tokens fed into the LLM. Extensive experiments on the Multiple-Choice VideoQA task demonstrate that KTV outperforms state-of-the-art training-free baselines while using significantly fewer visual tokens, \\emph{e.g.}, only 504 visual tokens for a 60-min video with 10800 frames, achieving $44.8\\%$ accuracy on the MLVU-Test benchmark. In particular, KTV also exceeds several training-based approaches on certain benchmarks."

In this work, we propose a novel framework for generating graphs by adapting the Generator Matching (arXiv:2410.20587) paradigm to graph-structured data. We leverage the graph Laplacian and its associated heat kernel to define a continous-time diffusion on each graph. The Laplacian serves as the infinitesimal generator of this diffusion, and its heat kernel provides a family of conditional perturbations of the initial graph. A neural network is trained to match this generator by minimising a Bregman divergence between the true generator and a learnable surrogate. Once trained, the surrogate generator is used to simulate a time-reversed diffusion process to sample new graph structures. Our framework unifies and generalises existing diffusion-based graph generative models, injecting domain-specific inductive bias via the Laplacian, while retaining the flexibility of neural approximators. Experimental studies demonstrate that our approach captures structural properties of real and synthetic graphs effectively."

To bridge this gap, we introduce path log-likelihood (Path LL), a trajectory-conditioned objective that strongly correlates with downstream accuracy and enables principled selection of unmasking paths. To optimize Path LL at inference time, we propose POKE, an efficient value estimator that predicts the expected future Path LL of a partial decoding trajectory. We then integrate this lookahead signal into POKE-SMC, a Sequential Monte Carlo-based search framework for dynamically identifying optimal unmasking paths. Extensive experiments across 6 reasoning tasks show that POKE-SMC consistently improves accuracy, achieving 2%--3% average gains over strong decoding-time scaling baselines at comparable inference overhead on LLaDA models and advancing the accuracy--compute Pareto frontier."

Using first-principles calculations and atomistic spin simulations, we demonstrate that a noncollinear ground state can be stabilized in Rh/Co and Pd/Co atomic bilayers on the Re(0001) surface by four spin exchange interactions, although Co -- a material often used in applications -- is a prototypical ferromagnet with strong pairwise exchange interaction. We further show that unconventional skyrmion lattices and isolated skyrmions can emerge on this noncollinear magnetic background. Transition-state theory calculations reveal that these metastable skyrmions are protected by large energy barriers, suggesting that they could be observed in experiments. These unconventional types of skyrmions in noncollinear magnets might open new possibilities for topological spin transport or magnet-superconductor hybrid systems."

To do so, we train models on Swedish from scratch and by fine-tuning English-pretrained models, probing their preferences at various checkpoints using minimal pairs that differ in linguistic acceptability or idiomaticity. For linguistic acceptability, we adapt existing benchmarks into a minimal-pair format. To assess idiomaticity, we introduce two novel datasets: one contrasting conventionalized idioms with plausible variants, and another contrasting idiomatic Swedish with Translationese. Our findings suggest that idiomatic competence emerges more slowly than other linguistic abilities, including grammatical and lexical correctness. While longer training yields diminishing returns for most tasks, idiom-related performance continues to improve, particularly in the largest model tested (8B). However, instruction tuning on data machine-translated from English -- the common approach for languages with little or no native instruction data -- causes models to rapidly lose their preference for idiomatic language."

While local kriging using $K$-nearest neighbors addresses this issue, the selection of $K$ typically relies on ad-hoc criteria that fail to account for spatial correlation structure. We propose a penalized kriging framework that incorporates LASSO-type penalties directly into the kriging equations to achieve automatic, data-driven neighbor selection. We further extend this to adaptive LASSO, using data-driven penalty weights that account for the spatial correlation structure. Our method determines which observations contribute non-zero weights through $\\ell_1$ regularization, with the penalty parameter selected via a novel criterion based on effective sample size that balances prediction accuracy against information redundancy. Numerical experiments demonstrate that penalized kriging automatically adapts neighborhood structure to the underlying spatial correlation, selecting fewer neighbors for smoother processes and more for highly variable fields, while maintaining prediction accuracy comparable to global kriging at substantially reduced computational cost."

We propose CaRE, a scalable {C}ontinual Le{a}rner with efficient Bi-Level {R}outing Mixture-of-{E}xperts (BR-MoE). The core idea of BR-MoE is a bi-level routing mechanism: a router selection stage that dynamically activates relevant task-specific routers, followed by an expert routing phase that dynamically activates and aggregates experts, aiming to inject discriminative and comprehensive representations into every intermediate network layer. On the other hand, we introduce a challenging evaluation protocol for comprehensively assessing CIL methods across very long task sequences spanning hundreds of tasks. Extensive experiments show that CaRE demonstrates leading performance across a variety of datasets and task settings, including commonly used CIL datasets with classical CIL settings (e.g., 5-20 tasks). To the best of our knowledge, CaRE is the first continual learner that scales to very long task sequences (ranging from 100 to over 300 non-overlapping tasks), while outperforming all baselines by a large margin on such task sequences.

These anomalies expand activation ranges and skew activation distributions toward task-irrelevant responses, complicating bit allocation and weakening the preservation of informative features. Without a clear criterion to distinguish anomalies, suppressing them can inadvertently discard useful information. To address this, we present InlierQ, an inlier-centric post-training quantization approach that separates anomalies from informative inliers. InlierQ computes gradient-aware volume saliency scores, classifies each volume as an inlier or anomaly, and fits a posterior distribution over these scores using the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. This design suppresses anomalies while preserving informative features. InlierQ is label-free, drop-in, and requires only 64 calibration samples. Experiments on the COCO and nuScenes benchmarks show consistent reductions in quantization error for camera-based (2D and 3D) and LiDAR-based (3D) object detection."

Prior work shows RLVR works with few prompts, but prompt selection is often based only on training-accuracy variance, leading to unstable optimization directions and weaker transfer. We revisit prompt selection from a mechanism-level view and argue that an effective minibatch should provide both (i) a reliable positive anchor and (ii) explicit negative learning signals from rare failures. Based on this principle, we propose \\emph{positive--negative pairing}: at each update, we sample a hard-but-solvable $q^{+}$ and an easy-but-brittle prompt $q^{-}$(high success rate but not perfect), characterized by low and high empirical success rates under multiple rollouts. We further introduce Weighted GRPO, which reweights binary outcomes at the pair level and uses group-normalized advantages to amplify rare successes on $q^{+}$ into sharp positive guidance while turning rare failures on $q^{-}$ into strong negative penalties. This bidirectional signal provides informative learning feedback for both successes and failures, improving sample efficiency without suppressing exploration. On Qwen2.5-Math-7B, a single paired minibatch per update consistently outperforms a GRPO baseline that selects two prompts via commonly used variance-based selection heuristics: AIME~2025 Pass@8 improves from 16.8 to 22.2, and AMC23 Pass@64 from 94.0 to 97.0, while remaining competitive with large-scale RLVR trained from a pool of 1209 training prompts.

Despite generating significant interest especially in the machine-learning community, a thorough study of realistic inverse problems in the presence of modelling error and utilization of physical measurement data is still outstanding. In this work, the framework of unconditional representation for the conditional score function (UCoS) is evaluated for linearized difference imaging in diffuse optical tomography (DOT). DOT uses boundary measurements of near-infrared light to estimate the spatial distribution of absorption and scattering parameters in biological tissues. The problem is highly ill-posed and thus sensitive to noise and modelling errors. We introduce a novel regularization approach that prevents overfitting of the score function by constructing a mixed score composed of a learned and a model-based component. Validation of this approach is done using both simulated and experimental measurement data. The experiments demonstrate that a data-driven prior distribution results in posterior samples with low variance, compared to classical model-based estimation, and centred around the ground truth, even in the context of a highly ill-posed problem and in the presence of modelling errors."

These mixed agent types exhibit complex behaviors such as hook turns, lane splitting, and informal right-of-way negotiation. Such behaviors pose significant challenges for autonomous vehicles but remain underrepresented in existing datasets focused on structured, lane-disciplined traffic. To bridge the gap, we collect a large- scale drone-based dataset to provide a holistic observation of traffic scenes with centimeter-accurate annotations, HD maps, and traffic signal states. We further develop a modular toolkit for extracting per-agent scenarios to support downstream task development. In total, the dataset comprises over 65.4k high- fidelity agent trajectories, 70% of which are from VRUs. HetroD supports modeling of VRU behaviors in dense, het- erogeneous traffic and provides standardized benchmarks for forecasting, planning, and simulation tasks. Evaluation results reveal that state-of-the-art prediction and planning models struggle with the challenges presented by our dataset: they fail to predict lateral VRU movements, cannot handle unstructured maneuvers, and exhibit limited performance in dense and multi-agent scenarios, highlighting the need for more robust approaches to heterogeneous traffic.

Thus, Continual Reinforcement Learning (CRL) is a promising pathway for deploying VLA models in lifelong robotic scenarios, yet balancing stability (retaining old skills) and plasticity (learning new ones) remains a formidable challenge for existing methods. We introduce CRL-VLA, a framework for continual post-training of VLA models with rigorous theoretical bounds. We derive a unified performance bound linking the stability-plasticity trade-off to goal-conditioned advantage magnitude, scaled by policy divergence. CRL-VLA resolves this dilemma via asymmetric regulation: constraining advantage magnitudes on prior tasks while enabling controlled growth on new tasks. This is realized through a simple but effective dual-critic architecture with novel Goal-Conditioned Value Formulation (GCVF), where a frozen critic anchors semantic consistency and a trainable estimator drives adaptation. Experiments on the LIBERO benchmark demonstrate that CRL-VLA effectively harmonizes these conflicting objectives, outperforming baselines in both anti-forgetting and forward adaptation."

Within The World Avatar (TWA), ontological specifications are compiled into executable tool interfaces that LLM-based agents must use to create and modify knowledge graph instances, enforcing semantic constraints during generation rather than through post-hoc validation. Extending TWA's semantic agent composition framework, the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and associated agents are integral components of the knowledge graph ecosystem, enabling structured interaction between generative models, symbolic constraints, and external resources. An agent-based workflow translates ontologies into ontology-aware tools and iteratively applies them to extract, validate, and repair structured knowledge from unstructured scientific text. Using metal-organic polyhedra synthesis literature as an illustrative case, we show how executable ontological semantics can guide LLM behaviour and reduce manual schema and prompt engineering, establishing a general paradigm for embedding formal knowledge into generative systems."

This duality highlights a reciprocal connection in which prompts support control system design while control theory helps shape prompts to achieve specific goals efficiently. In this study, we frame this emerging interconnection of LLM and control as a bidirectional continuum, from prompt design to system dynamics. First, we investigate how LLMs can advance the field of control in two distinct capacities: directly, by assisting in the design and synthesis of controllers, and indirectly, by augmenting research workflows. Second, we examine how control concepts help LLMs steer their trajectories away from undesired meanings, improving reachability and alignment via input optimization, parameter editing, and activation-level interventions. Third, we look into deeper integrations by treating LLMs as dynamic systems within a state-space framework, where their internal representations are closely linked to external control loops. Finally, we identify key challenges and outline future research directions to understand LLM behavior and develop interpretable and controllable LLMs that are as trustworthy and robust as their electromechanical counterparts, thereby ensuring they continue to support and safeguard society."

Most existing approaches rely on execution feedback from containerized environments, which require dependency-complete setup and physical execution of programs and tests. While effective, this paradigm is resource-intensive and difficult to maintain, substantially complicating agent training and limiting scalability. We propose SWE-World, a Docker-free framework that replaces physical execution environments with a learned surrogate for training and evaluating software engineering agents. SWE-World leverages LLM-based models trained on real agent-environment interaction data to predict intermediate execution outcomes and final test feedback, enabling agents to learn without interacting with physical containerized environments. This design preserves the standard agent-environment interaction loop while eliminating the need for costly environment construction and maintenance during agent optimization and evaluation. Furthermore, because SWE-World can simulate the final evaluation outcomes of candidate trajectories without real submission, it enables selecting the best solution among multiple test-time attempts, thereby facilitating effective test-time scaling (TTS) in software engineering tasks. Experiments on SWE-bench Verified demonstrate that SWE-World raises Qwen2.5-Coder-32B from 6.2\\% to 52.0\\% via Docker-free SFT, 55.0\\% with Docker-free RL, and 68.2\\% with further TTS.

Human annotation is prohibitively expensive, while automated methods fail to ensure fidelity and training effectiveness. Existing approaches either passively adapt to available images or employ inefficient random exploration with filtering, decoupling generation from learning needs. We propose Socratic-Geo, a fully autonomous framework that dynamically couples data synthesis with model learning through multi-agent interaction. The Teacher agent generates parameterized Python scripts with reflective feedback (Reflect for solvability, RePI for visual validity), ensuring image-text pair purity. The Solver agent optimizes reasoning through preference learning, with failure paths guiding Teacher's targeted augmentation. Independently, the Generator learns image generation capabilities on accumulated \"image-code-instruction\" triplets, distilling programmatic drawing intelligence into visual generation. Starting from only 108 seed problems, Socratic-Solver achieves 49.11 on six benchmarks using one-quarter of baseline data, surpassing strong baselines by 2.43 points. Socratic-Generator achieves 42.4% on GenExam, establishing new state-of-the-art for open-source models, surpassing Seedream-4.0 (39.8%) and approaching Gemini-2.5-Flash-Image (43.1%)."

However, existing preference-based conflict models rely exclusively on three qualitative relations, namely, preference, converse, and indifference, to describe agents' attitudes towards issue pairs, which significantly limits their capacity in capturing the essence of conflict. To overcome this limitation, we introduce the concept of an intuitionistic fuzzy preference-based conflict situation that captures agents' attitudes towards issue pairs with finer granularity than that afforded by classical preference-based models. Afterwards, we develop intuitionistic fuzzy preference-based conflict measures within this framework, and construct three-way conflict analysis models for trisecting the set of agent pairs, the agent set, and the issue set. Additionally, relative loss functions built on the proposed conflict functions are employed to calculate thresholds for three-way conflict analysis. Finally, we present adjustment mechanism-based feasible strategies that simultaneously account for both adjustment magnitudes and conflict degrees, together with an algorithm for constructing such feasible strategies, and provide an illustrative example to demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of the proposed model."

We propose Tiled Prompts, a unified framework for image and video super-resolution that generates a tile-specific prompt for each latent tile and performs super-resolution under locally text-conditioned posteriors, providing high-information guidance that resolves prompt underspecification with minimal overhead. Experiments on high resolution real-world images and videos show consistent gains in perceptual quality and text alignment, while reducing hallucinations and tile-level artifacts relative to global-prompt baselines."

    "abstract": "Recent progress in adversarial attacks on 3D point clouds, particularly in achieving spatial imperceptibility and high attack performance, presents significant challenges for defenders. Current defensive approaches remain cumbersome, often requiring invasive model modifications, expensive training procedures or auxiliary data access. To address these threats, in this paper, we propose a plug-and-play and non-invasive defense mechanism in the spectral domain, grounded in a theoretical and empirical analysis of the relationship between imperceptible perturbations and high-frequency spectral components. Building upon these insights, we introduce a novel purification framework, termed PWAVEP, which begins by computing a spectral graph wavelet domain saliency score and local sparsity score for each point. Guided by these values, PWAVEP adopts a hierarchical strategy, it eliminates the most salient points, which are identified as hardly recoverable adversarial outliers. Simultaneously, it applies a spectral filtering process to a broader set of moderately salient points. This process leverages a graph wavelet transform to attenuate high-frequency coefficients associated with the targeted points, thereby effectively suppressing adversarial noise. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that the proposed PWAVEP achieves superior accuracy and robustness compared to existing approaches, advancing the state-of-the-art in 3D point cloud purification.

Stability is defined through domination of second--order structure, leading to a covariance envelope of admissible sources ordered by the Löwner relation. Our main result establishes an envelope extremal principle: the maximal value of the quadratic functional over the entire envelope coincides with that of a single extremal configuration, which may lie only in the closure of the admissible class. This identification is obtained without convexity, compactness, or any global Hilbert space structure governing all components of the system, and relies instead on an operator--theoretic approximation scheme. As a consequence, minimax optimization over stability sets reduces to an ordinary quadratic minimization problem with well--posed existence and uniqueness properties for the associated minimizing operators. Structural properties of covariance envelopes are also derived, including density, closure, and spectral characterizations in stationary settings."

In this work, we systematically investigate $ΔR_{\\mathrm{np}}$ in the transuranium berkelium (Bk) isotopic chain using the deformed relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov theory in continuum (DRHBc). Our results reveal a general increase of $ΔR_{\\mathrm{np}}$ with neutron number $N$, which exhibits anti-kinks at the shell closures $N = 184, 258$ due to the shell effects. By decomposing $ΔR_{\\mathrm{np}}$ into volume and surface contributions through two-parameter Fermi (2pF) fits to angle-averaged DRHBc densities, we find that the volume term accounts for as much as $68\\%$ in most nuclei, whereas the surface term dominates only near the proton drip line for $N < 142$. Nuclear deformation is shown to slightly reduce the central radius $R_c$ while significantly enhancing the surface diffuseness $a$, resulting in a notable increase in $ΔR_{\\mathrm{np}}$ that is largely driven by the surface term. Moreover, by extracting 2pF parameters along the symmetry axis ($θ= 0^\\circ$) and perpendicular to it ($θ= 90^\\circ$), we examine the anisotropy of $ΔR_{\\mathrm{np}}$. In prolate deformed nuclei, a pronounced directional dependence emerges: although the nucleus elongates along the symmetry axis, $ΔR_{\\mathrm{np}}$ is substantially larger in the perpendicular direction. This anisotropy is weak for oblate nuclei near shell closures. The anisotropy of $ΔR_{\\rm np}$ is attributed mainly to the volume term, which remains the dominant contribution in most nuclei regardless of direction.

We then establish new, explicit lower bounds for the Hardy term in fractional Hardy--Sobolev--Maz'ya inequalities involving both \\(\\mathcal{P}_s\\) and \\(\\widetilde{\\mathcal{P}}_s\\). By applying the concentration--compactness principle together with a detailed analysis of the strict-gap regions for the Poincaré--Sobolev levels, we prove the existence of solutions to the Brezis--Nirenberg problem on \\(\\mathbb H^n\\) for both operators. Finally, combining the Hardy lower bounds with criteria for attainability, we obtain a complete characterization of the Poincaré--Sobolev levels \\(H_{n,s}\\) and \\(\\widetilde H_{n,s}\\)."

Our structural analysis of the samples confirms the ThCr$_2$Si$_2$-type structure as well as an increase of the room temperature $a$ and $c$ lattice parameters with increasing $x$. Chemical analysis reveals that, depending on the Au concentration, only about 25-35\\% of the amount of Au available in the initial melt is incorporated into the crystal structure, resulting in a decreasing substitution level for increasing $x$. Through Au substitution, chemical pressure is applied and large changes in valence crossover temperatures are already observed for low substitution levels $x$. In contrast to previous studies, we do not find any signs of a first-order transition in samples with $x_{\\rm nom}=0.1$ or AFM order for higher $x$. Furthermore, we observe the formation of quarternary side phases for a higher amount of Au in the melt. In addition, cubic-mm-sized single crystals of EuPd$_2$(Si$_{1-x}$Ge$_x$)$_2$ with $x_{\\rm nom}=0.2$ were grown. The analysis of the X-ray fluorescence revealed that the crystals exhibit a slight variation in the Ge content. Such tiny compositional changes can cause changes in the sample properties concerning variations of the crossover temperature or changes of the type of the transition from crossover to magnetic order. Furthermore, we report on a new orthorhombic phase EuPd$_{1.42}$Si$_{1.27}$Ge$_{0.31}$ that orders antiferromagnetically below $17\\,\\rm K$."

    "abstract": "Business logic vulnerabilities have become one of the most damaging yet least understood classes of smart contract vulnerabilities. Unlike traditional bugs such as reentrancy or arithmetic errors, these vulnerabilities arise from missing or incorrectly enforced business invariants and are tightly coupled with protocol semantics. Existing static analysis techniques struggle to capture such high-level logic, while recent large language model based approaches often suffer from unstable outputs and low accuracy due to hallucination and limited verification. In this paper, we propose LogicScan, an automated contrastive auditing framework for detecting business logic vulnerabilities in smart contracts. The key insight behind LogicScan is that mature, widely deployed on-chain protocols implicitly encode well-tested and consensus-driven business invariants. LogicScan systematically mines these invariants from large-scale on-chain contracts and reuses them as reference constraints to audit target contracts. To achieve this, LogicScan introduces a Business Specification Language (BSL) to normalize diverse implementation patterns into structured, verifiable logic representations. It further combines noise-aware logic aggregation with contrastive auditing to identify missing or weakly enforced invariants while mitigating LLM-induced false positives. We evaluate LogicScan on three real-world datasets, including DeFiHacks, Web3Bugs, and a set of top-200 audited contracts. The results show that LogicScan achieves an F1 score of 85.2%, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art tools while maintaining a low false-positive rate on production-grade contracts. Additional experiments demonstrate that LogicScan maintains consistent performance across different LLMs and is cost-effective, and that its false-positive suppression mechanisms substantially improve robustness."

    "abstract": "Infrared small targets are typically tiny and locally salient, which belong to high-frequency components (HFCs) in images. Single-frame infrared small target (SIRST) detection is challenging, since there are many HFCs along with targets, such as bright corners, broken clouds, and other clutters. Current learning-based methods rely on the powerful capabilities of deep networks, but neglect explicit modeling and discriminative representation learning of various HFCs, which is important to distinguish targets from other HFCs. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose a dynamic high-frequency convolution (DHiF) to translate the discriminative modeling process into the generation of a dynamic local filter bank. Especially, DHiF is sensitive to HFCs, owing to the dynamic parameters of its generated filters being symmetrically adjusted within a zero-centered range according to Fourier transformation properties. Combining with standard convolution operations, DHiF can adaptively and dynamically process different HFC regions and capture their distinctive grayscale variation characteristics for discriminative representation learning. DHiF functions as a drop-in replacement for standard convolution and can be used in arbitrary SIRST detection networks without significant decrease in computational efficiency. To validate the effectiveness of our DHiF, we conducted extensive experiments across different SIRST detection networks on real-scene datasets. Compared to other state-of-the-art convolution operations, DHiF exhibits superior detection performance with promising improvement. Codes are available at https://github.com/TinaLRJ/DHiF."

Unlike traditional search engines that match keywords to documents, these systems infer user intent, synthesize multimodal evidence, and generate contextual answers directly on the search page, introducing a paradigm shift from Search Engine Optimization (SEO) to Generative Engine Optimization (GEO). For visual content platforms hosting billions of assets, this poses an acute challenge: individual images lack the semantic depth and authority signals that generative search prioritizes, risking disintermediation as user needs are satisfied in-place without site visits. We present Pinterest GEO, a production-scale framework that pioneers reverse search design: rather than generating generic image captions describing what content is, we fine-tune Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to predict what users would actually search for, augmented this with AI agents that mine real-time internet trends to capture emerging search demand. These VLM-generated queries then drive construction of semantically coherent Collection Pages via multimodal embeddings, creating indexable aggregations optimized for generative retrieval. Finally, we employ hybrid VLM and two-tower ANN architectures to build authority-aware interlinking structures that propagate signals across billions of visual assets. Deployed at scale across billions of images and tens of millions of collections, GEO delivers 20\\% organic traffic growth contributing to multi-million monthly active user (MAU) growth, demonstrating a principled pathway for visual platforms to thrive in the generative search era."

    "abstract": "Coordinating traffic signals along multimodal corridors is challenging because many multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approaches remain vehicle-centric and struggle with high-dimensional discrete action spaces. We propose MA2B-DDQN, a human-centric multi-agent action-branching double Deep Q-Network (DQN) framework that explicitly optimizes traveler-level equity. Our key contribution is an action-branching discrete control formulation that decomposes corridor control into (i) local, per-intersection actions that allocate green time between the next two phases and (ii) a single global action that selects the total duration of those phases. This decomposition enables scalable coordination under discrete control while reducing the effective complexity of joint decision-making. We also design a human-centric reward that penalizes the number of delayed individuals in the corridor, accounting for pedestrians, vehicle occupants, and transit passengers. Extensive evaluations across seven realistic traffic scenarios in Melbourne, Australia, demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces the number of impacted travelers, outperforming existing DRL and baseline methods. Experiments confirm the robustness of our model, showing minimal variance across diverse settings. This framework not only advocates for a fairer traffic signal system but also provides a scalable solution adaptable to varied urban traffic conditions."

This paper proves that these frameworks are structurally compatible for intensional semantics. We establish that Kripke-style intensional models embed injectively into vector spaces, with semantic functions lifting to (multi)linear maps that preserve composition. The construction accommodates multiple index sorts (worlds, times, locations) via a compound index space, representing intensions as linear operators. Modal operators are derived algebraically: accessibility relations become linear operators, and modal conditions reduce to threshold checks on accumulated values. For uncountable index domains, we develop a measure-theoretic generalization in which necessity becomes truth almost everywhere and possibility becomes truth on a set of positive measure, a non-classical logic natural for continuous parameters."

In particular, this is true for convex Euclidean tables. We also describe a more general class of tables to which this result applies and present explicit non-Euclidean examples."

We show that the resulting flow-weighted end-to-end delay minimization is a convex program, yielding a global system-optimal solution characterized by KKT conditions that equalize total marginal costs (a path marginal access term plus a node congestion price) across all utilized routes. This condition admits a Wardrop-type interpretation: for each source, all utilized options equalize total marginal cost, while any option with strictly larger total marginal cost receives no flow. Building on this structure, we develop a lightweight distributed pricing-based algorithm in which each service node locally computes and broadcasts a scalar congestion price from its observed aggregate load, while each source updates its traffic split by solving a small separable convex allocation problem under the advertised prices. Numerical illustrations demonstrate convergence of the distributed iteration to the centralized optimum and highlight the trade-offs induced by jointly modeling access and service congestion."

    "abstract": "Multi-state structured population models, including integral projection models (IPMs) and age-structured McKendrick equations, link individual life histories to population growth and composition, yet the demographic meaning of their dominant eigenstructure can be difficult to interpret. A main goal of this paper is to derive interpretable demographic indicators for multi-state heterogeneity -- in particular expected generation numbers, which act as an effective genealogical memory length (in generations) of the ancestry-weighted contributions driving growth -- together with type reproduction numbers and generation intervals, directly from life-history transition kernels. To this end we develop a determinant-free genealogical framework based on a reference-point operator, a rank-one construction at the kernel level that singles out a biologically chosen reference state and organizes lineages by their contributions relative to that state. This yields stable distributions and reproductive values as convergent series of iterated kernels, and leads to an Euler--Lotka-like characteristic equation expressed by reference-point moments. The resulting expansion admits a closed combinatorial form via ordinary partial Bell polynomials, providing a direct bridge from transition kernels to genealogical quantities. We extend the approach to multi-state McKendrick equations and show how these indicators quantify how population scale and composition are determined by ancestry-weighted initial-state information. The framework avoids restrictive Hilbert--Schmidt assumptions and clarifies how temporal memory and multi-type heterogeneity emerge from cross-generational accumulation, yielding a unified and interpretable route from transition kernels to multi-state demographic indicators."

ATACompressor employs a selective encoder that compresses only the task-relevant portions of long contexts, ensuring that essential information is preserved while reducing unnecessary content. Its adaptive allocation controller perceives the length of relevant content and adjusts the compression rate accordingly, optimizing resource utilization. We evaluate ATACompressor on three QA datasets: HotpotQA, MSMARCO, and SQUAD-showing that it outperforms existing methods in terms of both compression efficiency and task performance.

This paper studies a test-time scaling method that enables sampling from regions with higher human-aligned reward values. Existing gradient guidance methods approximate the expected future reward (EFR) at an intermediate particle $\\mathbf{x}_t$ using a Taylor approximation, but this approximation at each time step incurs high computational cost due to sequential neural backpropagation. We show that the EFR at any $\\mathbf{x}_t$ can be computed using only marginal samples from a pre-trained diffusion model. The proposed EFR formulation detaches the neural dependency between $\\mathbf{x}_t$ and the EFR, enabling closed-form guidance computation without neural backpropagation. To further improve efficiency, we introduce lookahead sampling to collect marginal samples. For final sample generation, we use an accurate solver that guides particles toward high-reward lookahead samples. We refer to this sampling scheme as LiDAR sampling. LiDAR achieves substantial performance improvements using only three samples with a 3-step lookahead solver, exhibiting steep performance gains as lookahead accuracy and sample count increase; notably, it reaches the same GenEval performance as the latest gradient guidance method for SDXL with a 9.5x speedup."

However, as the sequence length grows, the key-value (KV) cache expands linearly, incurring significant memory and computation costs. Existing KV cache eviction methods mitigate this issue by discarding less important KV pairs, but often fail to capture complex KV dependencies, resulting in performance degradation. To better balance efficiency and performance, we introduce ForesightKV, a training-based KV cache eviction framework that learns to predict which KV pairs to evict during long-text generations. We first design the Golden Eviction algorithm, which identifies the optimal eviction KV pairs at each step using future attention scores. These traces and the scores at each step are then distilled via supervised training with a Pairwise Ranking Loss. Furthermore, we formulate cache eviction as a Markov Decision Process and apply the GRPO algorithm to mitigate the significant language modeling loss increase on low-entropy tokens.

    "abstract": "Imitation learning (IL) enables robots to acquire human-like motion skills from demonstrations, but it still requires extensive high-quality data and retraining to handle complex or long-horizon tasks. To improve data efficiency and adaptability, this study proposes a hierarchical IL framework that integrates motion primitives with proportion-based motion synthesis. The proposed method employs a two-layer architecture, where the upper layer performs long-term planning, while a set of lower-layer models learn individual motion primitives, which are combined according to specific proportions. Three model variants are introduced to explore different trade-offs between learning flexibility, computational cost, and adaptability: a learning-based proportion model, a sampling-based proportion model, and a playback-based proportion model, which differ in how the proportions are determined and whether the upper layer is trainable. Through real-robot pick-and-place experiments, the proposed models successfully generated complex motions not included in the primitive set. The sampling-based and playback-based proportion models achieved more stable and adaptable motion generation than the standard hierarchical model, demonstrating the effectiveness of proportion-based motion integration for practical robot learning."

    "abstract": "We present an adaptive Chebyshev-based Boundary Integral Equation (CBIE) solver for electromagnetic scattering from smooth perfect electric conductor (PEC) objects. The proposed approach eliminates manual parameter tuning by introducing (i) a unified adaptive quadrature strategy for automatic selection of the near-singular interaction distance and (ii) an adaptive computation of all self- and near-singular precomputation integrals to a prescribed accuracy using Gauss-Kronrod (h-adaptive) or Clenshaw-Curtis (p-adaptive) rules and singularity-resolving changes of variables. Both h-adaptive and p-adaptive schemes are explored within this framework, ensuring high-order accuracy and robustness across a broad range of geometries without loss of efficiency. Numerical results for canonical and complex CAD geometries demonstrate that the adaptive solver achieves accuracy and convergence rates comparable to optimally tuned fixed-grid CBIE implementations, while offering automation and scalability to electrically large, geometrically complex problems."

    "abstract": "Extreme rainfall over the Indian monsoon region poses severe societal and infrastructural risks but remains difficult to predict at daily time scales due to stochastic convective triggering and multiscale atmospheric interactions. While large-scale atmospheric fields provide important environmental context, their ability to localize extreme rainfall events is fundamentally limited. In this study, we examine how large-scale atmospheric information from ERA5 reanalysis can be leveraged for event-level probabilistic prediction of daily rainfall extremes over India. We compare an adaptive ConvLSTM baseline with a proposed Physics-Gated Latent Ordinary Differential Equation (PG-LODE) framework, which models atmospheric evolution as a continuous-time latent process whose dynamics are explicitly modulated by a physics-based gating mechanism under convectively unstable conditions. Extreme events are defined using the local 95th percentile of the India Meteorological Department gridded rainfall dataset during the June to September monsoon season. Pixel-wise evaluation shows limited skill for both models due to spatial displacement errors, whereas event-level tile-based verification reveals a clear performance contrast. The ConvLSTM remains highly conservative, detecting only 27 percent of extreme events, while PG-LODE achieves near-complete detection with a substantially higher critical success index and a moderate false alarm rate. These results demonstrate that physics-gated continuous-time latent dynamics offer a robust pathway for translating large-scale atmospheric predictability into reliable assessments of extreme rainfall risk."

We identified a periodicity of 309 days based on a nearly complete light curve, with 833 epochs every few days. A strong correlation is found between the maser and the mid-infrared fluxes at 3.4 and 4.6 $μ$m observed by NEOWISE during these periods, suggesting that the maser emission responds to variations in the protostellar luminosity. The average profile of the maser light curve is asymmetric and shows a steep drop in intensity just before the brightening, resembling that of some pulsating variable stars. Assuming a protostellar pulsation as the origin of maser periodicity, the observed period implies a cool and highly bloated, red supergiant-like structure. Such a bloated structure is consistent with a theoretical model of protostellar evolution under high accretion rates. The inferred protostellar parameters are broadly consistent with the theoretical model of pulsational instability during the early phase of high-mass star formation. However, a periodic accretion scenario caused by an unresolved compact protobinary cannot be completely ruled out. Several irregular peaks that deviate from the periodicity may result from episodic accretion phenomena or jet-launching events independent of the protostellar pulsation. Extremely high-resolution imaging with next-generation interferometers such as the ngVLA will provide a conclusive test for both the protostellar pulsation and the binary accretion scenarios."

During the surgery, a surgeon holds tweezers and a dissector to delicately strip the blockage, but available tools for this surgery are rigid and straight, lacking distal dexterity to access into thin branches of PA. Therefore, this work presents a novel robotized dissector based on concentric push/pull robot (CPPR) structure, enabling entering deep thin branch of tortuous PA. Compared with conventional rigid dissectors, our design characterizes slenderness and dual-segment-bending dexterity. Owing to the hollow and thin-walled structure of the CPPR-based dissector as it has a slender body of 3.5mm in diameter, the central lumen accommodates two channels for irrigation and tip tool, and space for endoscopic camera's signal wire. To provide accurate surgical manipulation, optimization-based kinematics model was established, realizing a 2mm accuracy in positioning the tip tool (60mm length) under open-loop control strategy. As such, with the endoscopic camera, traditional PTE is possible to be upgraded as endoscopic PTE. Basic physic performance of the robotized dissector including stiffness, motion accuracy and maneuverability was evaluated through experiments. Surgery simulation on ex vivo porcine lung also demonstrates its dexterity and notable advantages in PTE."

    "abstract": "Inverse design has enabled the systematic design of ultra-compact and high-performance nanophotonic components. Yet enforcing foundry design rules during inverse design remains a major challenge, as optimized devices frequently violate constraints on minimum feature size and spacing. Existing fabrication-constrained approaches typically rely on penalty terms, projection filters, or heuristic binarization schedules, which restrict the accessible design space, require extensive hyperparameter tuning, and often fail to guarantee compliance throughout the optimization trajectory. Here, we introduce a framework for nanophotonic inverse design with intrinsic enforcement of design rules through a generative reparameterization of the design space, restricting optimization to a learned manifold of DRC-compliant geometries. We validate this paradigm by designing representative silicon photonic components including broadband power splitters, spectral duplexers, and mode converters operating across the 1,500-1,600 nm band for both electron-beam lithography and photolithography platforms. Across all devices, the manifold-based formulation reaches state-of-the-art performance metrics with over a 5-fold reduction in computational cost compared to pixel-based representations, while ensuring fabrication-compatible geometries throughout the entire design process. By treating fabrication constraints as a fundamental property of the design representation rather than an external penalty, this work establishes a direct pathway toward broadly applicable, platform-agnostic, and intrinsically DRC-compliant nanophotonics."

While effective on coarse-grained reasoning tasks, they suffer from significant performance degradation on tasks requiring fine-grained visual details. Through layer-wise analysis, we reveal substantial discrepancies in visual token importance across layers, showing that tokens deemed unimportant at shallow layers can later become highly relevant for text-conditioned reasoning. To avoid irreversible critical information loss caused by premature pruning, we introduce a new pruning paradigm, termed bypass, which preserves unselected visual tokens and forwards them to subsequent pruning stages for re-evaluation. Building on this paradigm, we propose SwiftVLM, a simple and training-free method that performs pruning at model-specific layers with strong visual token selection capability, while enabling independent pruning decisions across layers. Experiments across multiple VLMs and benchmarks demonstrate that SwiftVLM consistently outperforms existing pruning strategies, achieving superior accuracy-efficiency trade-offs and more faithful visual token selection behavior."

This comprehensive review delineates the historical and theoretical evolution of the mathematical frameworks developed to analyze, predict, and manage these systems. We trace the intellectual trajectory from the early, deterministic bioeconomic models of the mid-20th century, which established the fundamental tension between individual profit maximization and collective efficiency, to the contemporary era of complex coupled human-environment system models. Our analysis systematically dissects the formalization of the \"Tragedy of the Commons\" through the lens of classical cooperative and non-cooperative game theory, examining how the N-person Prisoner's Dilemma and Nash Equilibrium concepts provided the initial, albeit pessimistic, predictive baseline. We subsequently explore the \"Ostrom Turn,\" which necessitated the integration of institutional realism-specifically monitoring, graduated sanctions, and communication-into formal game-theoretic structures. The review further investigates the relaxation of rationality assumptions via evolutionary game theory and behavioral economics, highlighting the destabilizing roles of prospect theory and hyperbolic discounting. Finally, we synthesize recent advances in stochastic differential equations and agent-based computational economics, which capture the critical roles of spatial heterogeneity, noise-induced regime shifts, and early warning signals of collapse. By unifying these diverse mathematical threads, this review elucidates the shifting paradigm from static optimization to dynamic resilience in the management of the commons."

    "abstract": "3D human pose estimation from 2D images is a challenging problem due to depth ambiguity and occlusion. Because of these challenges the task is underdetermined, where there exists multiple -- possibly infinite -- poses that are plausible given the image. Despite this, many prior works assume the existence of a deterministic mapping and estimate a single pose given an image. Furthermore, methods based on machine learning require a large amount of paired 2D-3D data to train and suffer from generalization issues to unseen scenarios. To address both of these issues, we propose a framework for pose estimation using diffusion models, which enables sampling from a probability distribution over plausible poses which are consistent with a 2D image. Our approach falls under the guidance framework for conditional generation, and guides samples from an unconditional diffusion model, trained only on 3D data, using the gradients of the heatmaps from a 2D keypoint detector. We evaluate our method on the Human 3.6M dataset under best-of-$m$ multiple hypothesis evaluation, showing state-of-the-art performance among methods which do not require paired 2D-3D data for training. We additionally evaluate the generalization ability using the MPI-INF-3DHP and 3DPW datasets and demonstrate competitive performance. Finally, we demonstrate the flexibility of our framework by using it for novel tasks including pose generation and pose completion, without the need to train bespoke conditional models.

The molecular abundances relative to CH$_3$OH are similar to those of another outer Galactic hot core, demonstrating that chemically rich hot cores exist in different regions of the outer Galaxy. We also compared molecular abundances among hot cores in the inner Galaxy, outer Galaxy, and Magellanic Clouds. This comparison revealed that the metallicity-corrected $N$(SO$_2$)/$N$(H$_2$) ratios of outer Galactic hot cores are significantly lower than those of the inner Galactic ones, while their $N$(CH$_3$OH)/$N$(H$_2$) ratios are similar. The Magellanic hot cores show different trends despite having metallicities similar to those of the outer Galaxy, indicating that the chemical complexity of hot cores is governed by environmental conditions (e.g., cosmic ray intensity and dust temperature) rather than simple metallicity scaling. These environmental differences would also affect the production efficiency of COMs derived from CH$_3$OH, as the $N$(CH$_3$OCH$_3$)/$N$(CH$_3$OH) and $N$(C$_2$H$_5$OH)/$N$(CH$_3$OH) ratios in the outer Galactic sources are moderately lower than those of inner Galactic sources. The $N$(CH$_2$DOH)/$N$(CH$_3$OH) ratio of Sh 2-283-1a SMM1 is 1.5$^{+3.9}_{-1.2}$$\\%$, comparable to that of inner Galactic high-mass sources."

    "abstract": "Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) is essential for deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) on memory-constrained devices, yet it renders models static and difficult to fine-tune. Standard fine-tuning paradigms, including Reinforcement Learning (RL), fundamentally rely on backpropagation and high-precision weights to compute gradients. Thus they cannot be used on quantized models, where the parameter space is discrete and non-differentiable. While Evolution Strategies (ES) offer a backpropagation-free alternative, optimization of the quantized parameters can still fail due to vanishing or inaccurate gradient. This paper introduces Quantized Evolution Strategies (QES), an optimization paradigm that performs full-parameter fine-tuning directly in the quantized space. QES is based on two innovations: (1) it integrates accumulated error feedback to preserve high-precision gradient signals, and (2) it utilizes a stateless seed replay to reduce memory usage to low-precision inference levels. QES significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art zeroth-order fine-tuning method on arithmetic reasoning tasks, making direct fine-tuning for quantized models possible. It therefore opens up the possibility for scaling up LLMs entirely in the quantized space. The source code is available at https://github.com/dibbla/Quantized-Evolution-Strategies ."

In this work, we propose VLM-FS-EB, a novel function-space empirical Bayes regularisation framework, leveraging large vision-language models (VLMs) to generates semantically meaningful context points. These synthetic samples are then used VLMs for embeddings to construct expressive functional priors. Furthermore, the proposed method is evaluated against various baselines, and experimental results demonstrate that our method consistently improves predictive performance and yields more reliable uncertainty estimates, particularly in out-of-distribution (OOD) detection tasks and data-scarce regimes."

A specialized paradigm of analogue quantum computing, quantum annealing (QA), has been proposed to solve these problems by encoding optimization problems into physical energy landscapes and solving them by quantum tunnelling systematically through exploration of solution space. This is a critical review that summarizes the current applications of quantum annealing to combinatorial optimization and includes a theoretical background, hardware designs, algorithm implementation strategies, encoding and embedding schemes, protocols to benchmark quantum annealing, areas of implementation, and links with the quantum algorithms implementation with gate-based hardware and classical solvers. We develop a unified framework, relating adiabatic quantum dynamics, Ising and QUBO models, stoquastic and non-stoquastic Hamiltonians, and diabatic transitions to modern flux-qubit annealers (Chimera, Pegasus, Zephyr topologies), and emergent architectures (Lechner-Hauke-Zoller systems, Rydberg atom platforms), and hybrids of quantum and classical computation. Through our analysis, we find that overhead in embedding and encoding is the largest determinant of the scalability and performance (this is not just the number of qubits). Minor embeddings also usually have a physical qubit count per logical variable of between 5 and 12 qubits, which limits effective problem capacity by 80-92% and, due to chain-breaking errors, compromises the quality of solutions."

    "abstract": "Detecting whether a model has been poisoned is a longstanding problem in AI security. In this work, we present a practical scanner for identifying sleeper agent-style backdoors in causal language models. Our approach relies on two key findings: first, sleeper agents tend to memorize poisoning data, making it possible to leak backdoor examples using memory extraction techniques. Second, poisoned LLMs exhibit distinctive patterns in their output distributions and attention heads when backdoor triggers are present in the input. Guided by these observations, we develop a scalable backdoor scanning methodology that assumes no prior knowledge of the trigger or target behavior and requires only inference operations. Our scanner integrates naturally into broader defensive strategies and does not alter model performance. We show that our method recovers working triggers across multiple backdoor scenarios and a broad range of models and fine-tuning methods."

To address these challenges, we propose \\underline{A}utonomous \\underline{E}volutionary \\underline{R}easoning \\underline{O}ptimization (AERO), an unsupervised framework that achieves autonomous reasoning evolution by internalizing self-questioning, answering, and criticism within a synergistic dual-loop system.

Furthermore, we introduce a Staggered Training Strategy to synchronize capability growth across functional roles and prevent curriculum collapse. Extensive evaluations across nine benchmarks spanning three domains demonstrate that AERO achieves average performance improvements of 4.57\\% on Qwen3-4B-Base and 5.10\\% on Qwen3-8B-Base, outperforming competitive baselines.

    "abstract": "We introduce functional adaptive shrinkage (FASH), an empirical Bayes method for joint analysis of observation units in which each unit estimates an effect function at several values of a continuous condition variable. The ideas in this paper are motivated by dynamic expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) studies, which aim to characterize how genetic effects on gene expression vary with time or another continuous condition. FASH integrates a broad family of Gaussian processes defined through linear differential operators into an empirical Bayes shrinkage framework, enabling adaptive smoothing and borrowing of information across units. This provides improved estimation of effect functions and principled hypothesis testing, allowing straightforward computation of significance measures such as local false discovery and false sign rates. To encourage conservative inferences, we propose a simple prior- adjustment method that has theoretical guarantees and can be more broadly used with other empirical Bayes methods. We illustrate the benefits of FASH by reanalyzing dynamic eQTL data on cardiomyocyte differentiation from induced pluripotent stem cells. FASH identified novel dynamic eQTLs, revealed diverse temporal effect patterns, and provided improved power compared with the original analysis. More broadly, FASH offers a flexible statistical framework for joint analysis of functional data, with applications extending beyond genomics. To facilitate use of FASH in dynamic eQTL studies and other settings, we provide an accompanying R package at https: //github.com/stephenslab/fashr."

Manual curation of this knowledge is prohibitively labor-intensive and prone to human error. To address this challenge, we introduce an autonomous, agent-based framework powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) designed to excavate high-fidelity datasets from scientific PDFs without human intervention. By deploying a modular \"skill-based\" architecture, the agent orchestrates complex cognitive tasks - including semantic filtering, multi-modal information extraction, and physics-informed validation. We demonstrate the efficacy of this framework by constructing a physically self-consistent database for material creep mechanics, a domain characterized by complex graphical trajectories and heterogeneous constitutive models. Applying the pipeline to 243 publications, the agent achieved a verified extraction success rate exceeding 90% for graphical data digitization. Crucially, we introduce a cross-modal verification protocol, demonstrating that the agent can autonomously align visually extracted data points with textually extracted constitutive parameters ($R^2 > 0.99$), ensuring the physical self-consistency of the database. This work not only provides a critical resource for investigating time-dependent deformation across diverse material systems but also establishes a scalable paradigm for autonomous knowledge acquisition, paving the way for the next generation of self-driving laboratories."

A significant challenge, however, is their prohibitive inference cost when processing high-resolution visual inputs. While visual token pruning has emerged as a promising solution, existing methods that primarily focus on semantic relevance often discard tokens that are crucial for spatial reasoning. We address this gap through a novel insight into \\emph{how LVLMs process spatial reasoning}. Specifically, we reveal that LVLMs implicitly establish visual coordinate systems through Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE), where specific token positions serve as \\textbf{implicit visual coordinates} (IVC tokens) that are essential for spatial reasoning. Based on this insight, we propose \\textbf{IVC-Prune}, a training-free, prompt-aware pruning strategy that retains both IVC tokens and semantically relevant foreground tokens. IVC tokens are identified by theoretically analyzing the mathematical properties of RoPE, targeting positions at which its rotation matrices approximate identity matrix or the $90^\\circ$ rotation matrix. Foreground tokens are identified through a robust two-stage process: semantic seed discovery followed by contextual refinement via value-vector similarity. Extensive evaluations across four representative LVLMs and twenty diverse benchmarks show that IVC-Prune reduces visual tokens by approximately 50\\% while maintaining $\\geq$ 99\\% of the original performance and even achieving improvements on several benchmarks.

    "abstract": "Multi-turn tool calling is challenging for Large Language Models (LLMs) because rewards are sparse and exploration is expensive. A common recipe, SFT followed by GRPO, can stall when within-group reward variation is low (e.g., more rollouts in a group receive the all 0 or all 1 reward), making the group-normalized advantage uninformative and yielding vanishing updates. To address this problem, we propose RC-GRPO (Reward-Conditioned Group Relative Policy Optimization), which treats exploration as a controllable steering problem via discrete reward tokens. We first fine-tune a Reward-Conditioned Trajectory Policy (RCTP) on mixed-quality trajectories with reward goal special tokens (e.g., <|high_reward|>, <|low_reward|>) injected into the prompts, enabling the model to learn how to generate distinct quality trajectories on demand. Then during RL, we sample diverse reward tokens within each GRPO group and condition rollouts on the sampled token to improve within-group diversity, improving advantage gains. On the Berkeley Function Calling Leaderboard v4 (BFCLv4) multi-turn benchmark, our method yields consistently improved performance than baselines, and the performance on Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct even surpasses all closed-source API models."

Training captioning models, however, typically requires high-quality music caption data which is scarce compared to metadata (e.g., genre, mood, etc.). As a result, it is common to use large language models (LLMs) to synthesize captions from metadata to generate training data for captioning models, though this process imposes a fixed stylization and entangles factual information with natural language style. As a more direct approach, we propose metadata-based captioning. We train a metadata prediction model to infer detailed music metadata from audio and then convert it into expressive captions via pre-trained LLMs at inference time. Compared to a strong end-to-end baseline trained on LLM-generated captions derived from metadata, our method: (1) achieves comparable performance in less training time over end-to-end captioners, (2) offers flexibility to easily change stylization post-training, enabling output captions to be tailored to specific stylistic and quality requirements, and (3) can be prompted with audio and partial metadata to enable powerful metadata imputation or in-filling--a common task for organizing music data."

However, existing paradigms are often plagued by overfitting, training instability, ineffective binary rewards for multi-solution tasks, and the difficulty of synergizing techniques. We introduce STAR: Similarity-guided Teacher-Assisted Refinement, a novel holistic framework that effectively transfers LLMs' capabilities to super-tiny models. STAR consists of two core technical innovations: (1) Constrained Knowledge Distillation (CKD), a training objective that augments top-k forward KL divergence to suppress confidently incorrect predictions, ensuring training stability while preserving exploration capacity for downstream RL. STAR holistically synergizes these strategies within a cohesive training curriculum, enabling super-tiny models to achieve exceptional performance on complex function calling tasks; (2) Similarity-guided RL (Sim-RL), a RL mechanism that introduces a fine-grained, similarity-based reward. This provides a robust, continuous, and rich signal for better policy optimization by evaluating the similarity between generated outputs and the ground truth. Extensive experiments on challenging and renowned benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Our STAR models establish SOTA in their size classes, significantly outperforming baselines. Remarkably, our 0.6B STAR model achieves the best performance among all open models under 1B, surpassing even several well-known open models at a larger scale. STAR demonstrates a training framework that distills capabilities of LLMs into super-tiny models, paving the way for powerful, accessible, and efficient AI agents."

The central challenge lies in balancing solution accuracy with computational efficiency. Recent diffusion-based generative models produce high-quality samples; however, their slow sampling procedures limit practical scalability. In this work, we argue that exact physical feasibility is ultimately enforced by power flow solvers or projection steps, and therefore the generative model only needs to produce good initializations rather than perfectly feasible solutions. Based on this insight, we propose a fast diffusion framework using Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) combined with physics-guided corrections during sampling. The proposed method replaces slow stochastic refinement with a small number of deterministic steps and explicit constraint guidance. Experiments on IEEE 6-, 24-, and 118-bus systems show that our approach achieves up to 20 times faster sampling than standard diffusion models while maintaining comparable statistical accuracy and physical consistency. This makes the method well suited for scalable OPF dataset generation and practical power system learning tasks. We release the implementation code at https://github.com/PSquare-Lab/DDIM_OPF."

    "abstract": "Fine-tuning is essential to adapt general-purpose large language models (LLMs) to domain-specific tasks. As a privacy-preserving framework to leverage decentralized data for collaborative model training, Federated Learning (FL) is gaining popularity in LLM fine-tuning, but remains challenging due to the high cost of transmitting full model parameters and computing full gradients on resource-constrained clients. While Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods are widely used in FL to reduce communication and memory costs, they often sacrifice model performance compared to FFT. This paper proposes FedKRSO (Federated $K$-Seed Random Subspace Optimization), a novel method that enables communication and memory efficient FFT of LLMs in federated settings. In FedKRSO, clients update the model within a shared set of random low-dimension subspaces generated by the server to save memory usage. Furthermore, instead of transmitting full model parameters in each FL round, clients send only the model update accumulators along the subspaces to the server, enabling efficient global model aggregation and dissemination. By using these strategies, FedKRSO can substantially reduce communication and memory overhead while overcoming the performance limitations of PEFT, closely approximating the performance of federated FFT. The convergence properties of FedKRSO are analyzed rigorously under general FL settings. Extensive experiments on the GLUE benchmark across diverse FL scenarios demonstrate that FedKRSO achieves both superior performance and low communication and memory overhead, paving the way towards on federated LLM fine-tuning at the resource-constrained edge."

OUTFORMER is pretrained solely on synthetic labeled datasets and infers test labels of a new task by using its training data as in-context input. Inference is fast and zero-shot, requiring merely forward pass and no labeled outliers. Thanks to in-context learning, it requires zero additional work-no OD model training or bespoke model selection-enabling truly plug-and-play deployment.

In this work, we derive gradient noise scales for signSGD and specSGD that naturally emerge from the geometry of their respective dual norms. To practically estimate these non-Euclidean metrics, we propose an efficient variance estimation procedure that leverages the local mini-batch gradients on different ranks in distributed data-parallel systems. Our experiments demonstrate that adaptive batch size strategies using non-Euclidean GNS enable us to match the validation loss of constant-batch baselines while reducing training steps by up to 66% for Signum and Muon on a 160 million parameter Llama model."

Existing tools fail to capture fine-grained perfor- mance patterns or generate runnable workloads that reproduce these public traces with both high fidelity and efficiency. To bridge this gap, we propose ResQ, a fine-grained workload synthesis sys- tem designed to generate executable SQL workloads that faithfully match the per-query execution targets and operator distributions of production traces. ResQ constructs execution-aware query graphs, instantiates them into SQL via Bayesian Optimization-driven pred- icate search, and explicitly models workload repetition through reuse at both exact-query and parameterized-template levels. To ensure practical scalability, ResQ combines search-space bounding with lightweight local cost models to accelerate optimization. Ex- periments on public cloud traces (Snowset, Redset) and a newly released industrial trace (Bendset) demonstrate that ResQ signif- icantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving 96.71% token savings and a 86.97% reduction in runtime, while lowering maximum Q-error by 14.8x on CPU time and 997.7x on scanned bytes, and closely matching operator composition."

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in text understanding, which has paved the way for their expansion into video LLMs (Vid-LLMs) to analyze video data. However, current Vid-LLMs struggle to simultaneously retain high-quality frame-level semantic information (i.e., a sufficient number of tokens per frame) and comprehensive video-level temporal information (i.e., an adequate number of sampled frames per video). This limitation hinders the advancement of Vid-LLMs towards fine-grained video understanding. To address this issue, we introduce the SlowFocus mechanism, which significantly enhances the equivalent sampling frequency without compromising the quality of frame-level visual tokens. SlowFocus begins by identifying the query-related temporal segment based on the posed question, then performs dense sampling on this segment to extract local high-frequency features. A multi-frequency mixing attention module is further leveraged to aggregate these local high-frequency details with global low-frequency contexts for enhanced temporal comprehension. Additionally, to tailor Vid-LLMs to this innovative mechanism, we introduce a set of training strategies aimed at bolstering both temporal grounding and detailed temporal reasoning capabilities. Furthermore, we establish FineAction-CGR, a benchmark specifically devised to assess the ability of Vid-LLMs to process fine-grained temporal understanding tasks. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our mechanism across both existing public video understanding benchmarks and our proposed FineAction-CGR."

    "abstract": "Current language models (LMs) excel at reasoning over prompts using pre-trained knowledge. However, real-world tasks are far more complex and context-dependent: models must learn from task-specific context and leverage new knowledge beyond what is learned during pre-training to reason and resolve tasks. We term this capability context learning, a crucial ability that humans naturally possess but has been largely overlooked. To this end, we introduce CL-bench, a real-world benchmark consisting of 500 complex contexts, 1,899 tasks, and 31,607 verification rubrics, all crafted by experienced domain experts. Each task is designed such that the new content required to resolve it is contained within the corresponding context. Resolving tasks in CL-bench requires models to learn from the context, ranging from new domain-specific knowledge, rule systems, and complex procedures to laws derived from empirical data, all of which are absent from pre-training. This goes far beyond long-context tasks that primarily test retrieval or reading comprehension, and in-context learning tasks, where models learn simple task patterns via instructions and demonstrations. Our evaluations of ten frontier LMs find that models solve only 17.2% of tasks on average. Even the best-performing model, GPT-5.1, solves only 23.7%, revealing that LMs have yet to achieve effective context learning, which poses a critical bottleneck for tackling real-world, complex context-dependent tasks. CL-bench represents a step towards building LMs with this fundamental capability, making them more intelligent and advancing their deployment in real-world scenarios."

To tackle this, in this paper, we introduce a novel symbolic method for encoding Petri net markings. It is based on the use of generalised intervals on vectors, as opposed to existing methods based on vectors of intervals such as Interval Decision Diagrams. We develop a formalisation of these intervals, show that they possess homomorphic operations for model checking CTL on Petri nets, and define a canonical form that provides good performance characteristics. Our structure facilitates the symbolic evaluation of CTL formulas in the realm of global model checking, which aims to identify every state that satisfies a formula. Tests on examples of the model checking contest (MCC 2022) show that our approach yields promising results. To achieve this, we implement efficient computations based on saturation and clustering principles derived from other symbolic model checking techniques."

In this work, we first use a set of pilot experiments to show that in the supervised setting, the cross-entropy loss objective (CE) and the contrastive learning objective often conflict with each other, thus hindering the applications of CL in supervised settings. To resolve this problem, we introduce a novel \\underline{A}ligned \\underline{C}ontrastive \\underline{L}earning (ACL) framework. First, ACL-Embed regards label embeddings as extra augmented samples with different labels and employs contrastive learning to align the label embeddings with its samples' representations. Second, to facilitate the optimization of ACL-Embed objective combined with the CE loss, we propose ACL-Grad, which will discard the ACL-Embed term if the two objectives are in conflict. To further enhance the performances of intermediate exits of multi-exit BERT, we further propose cross-layer ACL (ACL-CL), which is to ask the teacher exit to guide the optimization of student shallow exits. Extensive experiments on the GLUE benchmark results in the following takeaways: (a) ACL-BRT outperforms or performs comparably with CE and CE+SCL on the GLUE tasks; (b) ACL, especially CL-ACL, significantly surpasses the baseline methods on the fine-tuning of multi-exit BERT, thus providing better quality-speed tradeoffs for low-latency applications."

Building on these pairs, ELIQ adapts a pre-trained multimodal model into a quality-aware critic via instruction tuning and predicts two-dimensional quality using lightweight gated fusion and a Quality Query Transformer. Experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that ELIQ consistently outperforms existing label-free methods, generalizes from AI-generated content (AIGC) to user-generated content (UGC) scenarios without modification, and paves the way for scalable and label-free quality assessment under continuously evolving generative models.

However, existing TDD-style code generation studies are largely limited to function-level tasks, leaving class-level synthesis where multiple methods interact through shared state and call dependencies underexplored. In this paper, we scale test-driven code generation from functions to classes via an iterative TDD framework. Our approach first analyzes intra-class method dependencies to derive a feasible generation schedule, and then incrementally implements each method under method-level public tests with reflection-style execution feedback and bounded repair iterations. To support test-driven generation and rigorous class-level evaluation, we construct ClassEval-TDD, a cleaned and standardized variant of ClassEval with consistent specifications, deterministic test environments, and complete method-level public tests. We conduct an empirical study across eight LLMs and compare against the strongest direct-generation baseline (the best of holistic, incremental, and compositional strategies). Our class-level TDD framework consistently improves class-level correctness by 12 to 26 absolute points and achieves up to 71% fully correct classes, while requiring only a small number of repairs on average. These results demonstrate that test-driven generation can effectively scale beyond isolated functions and substantially improve class-level code generation reliability.

Recent work in Generative Agent-Based Modeling has shown that large language models can simulate human-like synthetic personas with high fidelity, accurately reproducing the beliefs and behaviors of specific individuals. However, most approaches require detailed data about target populations and often prioritize density matching (replicating what is most probable) rather than support coverage (spanning what is possible), leaving long-tail behaviors underexplored. We introduce Persona Generators, functions that can produce diverse synthetic populations tailored to arbitrary contexts. We apply an iterative improvement loop based on AlphaEvolve, using large language models as mutation operators to refine our Persona Generator code over hundreds of iterations. The optimization process produces lightweight Persona Generators that can automatically expand small descriptions into populations of diverse synthetic personas that maximize coverage of opinions and preferences along relevant diversity axes. We demonstrate that evolved generators substantially outperform existing baselines across six diversity metrics on held-out contexts, producing populations that span rare trait combinations difficult to achieve in standard LLM outputs."

The construction clarifies the algebraic structure and solvability of a family of two parameters odd order polynomials, classically and through operator methods familiar in QIT, including Fourier transforms and spectral calculus on operator algebras.

We show that WARP yields the most parameter-efficient representation for exactly learning Boolean functions and that several prior approaches arise as restricted special cases. Training is improved by introducing learnable thresholding and residual initialization, while we bridge the gap between relaxed training and discrete logic inference through stochastic smoothing. Experiments demonstrate faster convergence than state-of-the-art baselines, while scaling effectively to deeper architectures and logic functions with higher input arity."

To better match the dynamic process of DiT generation and thereby enhance the diffusion model's generative capability, we introduce a unified normalized convex fusion framework equipped with lightweight gates to systematically organize multi-layer LLM hidden states via time-wise, depth-wise, and joint fusion. Experiments establish Depth-wise Semantic Routing as the superior conditioning strategy, consistently improving text-image alignment and compositional generation (e.g., +9.97 on the GenAI-Bench Counting task). Conversely, we find that purely time-wise fusion can paradoxically degrade visual generation fidelity. We attribute this to a train-inference trajectory mismatch: under classifier-free guidance, nominal timesteps fail to track the effective SNR, causing semantically mistimed feature injection during inference. Overall, our results position depth-wise routing as a strong and effective baseline and highlight the critical need for trajectory-aware signals to enable robust time-dependent conditioning."

In this article, we introduce PATCHES, an evolutionary circuit discovery algorithm that identifies compact and correct circuits for SR. Using PATCHES, we isolate 28 circuits, providing the first circuit-level characterisation of an SR transformer. We validate these findings through a robust causal evaluation framework based on key notions such as faithfulness, completeness, and minimality. Our analysis shows that mean patching with performance-based evaluation most reliably isolates functionally correct circuits. In contrast, we demonstrate that direct logit attribution and probing classifiers primarily capture correlational features rather than causal ones, limiting their utility for circuit discovery. Overall, these results establish SR as a high-potential application domain for mechanistic interpretability and propose a principled methodology for circuit discovery."

Since full retraining is expensive, prior work has explored efficient alternatives such as model editing and parameter-efficient fine-tuning.

To address these limitations, we propose the CoRSA (Conflict-Resolving and Sharpness-Aware Minimization) training framework, a parameter-efficient, holistic approach for knowledge editing with multiple updates. CoRSA tackles multiple challenges simultaneously: it improves generalization to different input forms and enhances stability across multiple updates by minimizing loss curvature, and resolves conflicts by maximizing the margin between new and prior knowledge. Across three widely used fact editing benchmarks, CoRSA achieves significant gains in generalization, outperforming baselines with average absolute improvements of 12.42% over LoRA and 10% over model editing methods. With multiple updates, it maintains high update efficacy while reducing catastrophic forgetting by 27.82% compared to LoRA. CoRSA also generalizes to the code domain, outperforming the strongest baseline by 5.48% Pass@5 in update efficacy."

However, existing fingerprinting techniques that could be used to detect such distillation rely on heuristic perturbations that impose a steep trade-off between generation quality and fingerprinting strength, often requiring significant degradation of utility to ensure the fingerprint is effectively internalized by the student. We introduce antidistillation fingerprinting (ADFP), a principled approach that aligns the fingerprinting objective with the student's learning dynamics. Building upon the gradient-based framework of antidistillation sampling, ADFP utilizes a proxy model to identify and sample tokens that directly maximize the expected detectability of the fingerprint in the student after fine-tuning, rather than relying on the incidental absorption of the un-targeted biases of a more naive watermark. Experiments on GSM8K and OASST1 benchmarks demonstrate that ADFP achieves a significant Pareto improvement over state-of-the-art baselines, yielding stronger detection confidence with minimal impact on utility, even when the student model's architecture is unknown."

This work presents a detailed investigation of the effects of static magnetic islands on ITG instability, relevant to the ADITYA-U tokamak, using the Global Gyrokinetic Code in Cylindrical Coordinates (G2C3), a particle-in-cell (PIC) framework that employs a neural-network-assisted projection scheme. A two-phase simulation strategy is adopted. In the first phase, static magnetic islands with mode numbers (m, n) = (2, 1) and (3, 1) are introduced by perturbing the equilibrium magnetic flux functions. Particle dynamics within these modified topologies result in the flattening of plasma density profiles in the island regions, confirming island formation and its impact on the equilibrium profiles. In the second phase, the flattened profiles serve as new equilibria for linear electrostatic gyrokinetic simulations with adiabatic electrons, enabling the study of the modified ITG behavior. Magnetic islands significantly restructure the ITG mode, producing a spatial redistribution of potential fluctuations within and around the island region. Moreover, as the island width increases, the growth rates of different toroidal ITG modes converge, suggesting a universal stabilization trend. A comparison between the (2,1) and (3,1) islands indicates that higher-q islands lead to a more spatially extended ITG mode structure, reflecting the longer magnetic connection lengths and weaker curvature drive at outer flux surfaces. These results demonstrate the pivotal role of island-induced equilibrium modifications in determining ITG stability and mode structure in tokamak plasmas."

The interaction potential of microwave-shielded molecules can be tuned by using microwaves of two different polarisations, while for static-field-shielded molecules the tunability of interactions is more limited and depends on the particular species. In this work, we propose a general method to tune the interactions between static-field-shielded molecules by applying a microwave field. We carry out coupled-channel scattering calculations in a field-dressed basis set to determine loss rate coefficients and scattering lengths. We find that both the s-wave scattering length and the dipole length can be widely tuned by changing the parameters of the microwave field, while maintaining strong suppression of lossy collisions."

The model was evaluated on 12 downstream diagnostic tasks and generally outperformed baselines in fracture detection, osteoarthritis grading, and bone tumor classification. Furthermore, SKELEX demonstrated zero-shot abnormality localization, producing error maps that identified pathologic regions without task-specific training. Building on this capability, we developed an interpretable, region-guided model for predicting bone tumors, which maintained robust performance on independent external datasets and was deployed as a publicly accessible web application.

When tested on the QM9 dataset, comprising small organic molecules, the proposed model demonstrated superior accuracy compared to both the original EGNN models and the baseline models without PFP-derived descriptors for 11 out of the 12 molecular properties. Furthermore, when evaluated on the tmQM dataset, which encompasses transition metal complexes, notable enhancements in performance were observed across all five target properties, indicating the significance of the local atomic environment surrounding transition metals. In essence, the proposed methodology is adaptable to any 3D GNN architecture, and further enhancements in prediction accuracy are anticipated when integrated with continually evolving GNN architectures."

    "abstract": "Computational optimal transport (OT) offers a principled framework for generative modeling. Neural OT methods, which use neural networks to learn an OT map (or potential) from data in an amortized way, can be evaluated out of sample after training, but existing approaches are tailored to Euclidean geometry. Extending neural OT to high-dimensional Riemannian manifolds remains an open challenge. In this paper, we prove that any method for OT on manifolds that produces discrete approximations of transport maps necessarily suffers from the curse of dimensionality: achieving a fixed accuracy requires a number of parameters that grows exponentially with the manifold dimension. Motivated by this limitation, we introduce Riemannian Neural OT (RNOT) maps, which are continuous neural-network parameterizations of OT maps on manifolds that avoid discretization and incorporate geometric structure by construction. Under mild regularity assumptions, we prove that RNOT maps approximate Riemannian OT maps with sub-exponential complexity in the dimension. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate improved scalability and competitive performance relative to discretization-based baselines."

We propose Video-OPD, an efficient post-training framework for TVG inspired by recent advances in on-policy distillation. Video-OPD optimizes trajectories sampled directly from the current policy, thereby preserving alignment between training and inference distributions, while a frontier teacher supplies dense, token-level supervision via a reverse KL divergence objective. This formulation preserves the on-policy property critical for mitigating distributional shift, while converting sparse, episode-level feedback into fine-grained, step-wise learning signals. Building on Video-OPD, we introduce Teacher-Validated Disagreement Focusing (TVDF), a lightweight training curriculum that iteratively prioritizes trajectories that are both teacher-reliable and maximally informative for the student, thereby improving training efficiency. Empirical results demonstrate that Video-OPD consistently outperforms GRPO while achieving substantially faster convergence and lower computational cost, establishing on-policy distillation as an effective alternative to conventional reinforcement learning for TVG."

Estimating subsurface reservoir properties given remotely sensed or borehole-based observations typically involves finding the solution to a challenging inverse problem. We compare Monte Carlo random sampling to variational inference methods which use optimisation to constrain parametrised uncertainties in nonlinear Bayesian inversions. We use them to estimate the posterior probability distribution of reservoir permeability given fluid pressure and seismic measurements. The methods include automatic differentiation variational inference (ADVI), Stein variational gradient descent (SVGD), and a Monte Carlo method called stochastic SVGD (sSVGD), all of which we benchmark against results from Metropolis-Hastings McMC. We also test an ADVI variant called physically structured variational inference (PSVI): in our implementation this method estimates only spatially-local correlations between model parameters based on the intuition that such correlations are strong in remote sensing problems in which data only inform about spatial-averages of local dynamics. We apply the methods to two- and three-dimensional inverse problems of carbon dioxide storage, inspired by the Endurance field, located in the UK North Sea. Results show that PSVI achieves a good balance between mean-field ADVI and full-rank ADVI in terms of accuracy of the posterior approximation and computational efficiency. SVGD and sSVGD offer more accurate approximations of the target posterior distribution, but at far higher computational cost. Between them, sSVGD outperforms SVGD, exhibiting better computational efficiency and mitigating the problems of mode collapse and spurious correlations."

We further validate the proposed model through two controlled experiments: a random-generation task demonstrating constrained planning under human prompts and increasing planning strength as self-generated context accumulates, and a Gaussian-sampling task showing reduced initial bias when conditioning on self-generated sequences. These findings provide a theoretical explanation along with empirical evidence for characterizing how LLMs plan ahead during inference."

We propose Co2PO, a novel MARL communication-augmented framework that enables coordination-driven safety through selective, risk-aware communication. Co2PO introduces a shared blackboard architecture for broadcasting positional intent and yield signals, governed by a learned hazard predictor that proactively forecasts potential violations over an extended temporal horizon. By integrating these forecasts into a constrained optimization objective, Co2PO allows agents to anticipate and navigate collective hazards without the performance trade-offs inherent in traditional reactive constraints. We evaluate Co2PO across a suite of complex multi-agent safety benchmarks, where it achieves higher returns compared to leading constrained baselines while converging to cost-compliant policies at deployment. Ablation studies further validate the necessity of risk-triggered communication, adaptive gating, and shared memory components."

Through an online survey of 453 Wuliangye consumers from Sichuan, an analysis was conducted using structural equation modeling rooted in the ETPB and SOR theory. This analysis revealed the favorable impact of environmental stimuli and consumer ethnocentrism on purchasing behavior. This influence was found to be partially mediated through perceived value, attitudes, and purchase intention, forming a chain-mediated effect. Notably, purchase intention doesn't always translate to actual buying behavior, with environmental stimuli, consumer ethnocentrism, perceived behavioral control and purchase intention all being robust predictors of purchase behavior. Finally, several management strategies were proposed, aimed at bolstering Wuliangye sales, with a focus on platform development, mid-to-low range product creation, and appealing to Generation Z consumers."

In this short paper, we provide an initial empirical study to understand bug-reproducing tests better. We analyze 642 bug-reproducing tests of 15 real-world Python systems. Overall, we find that bug-reproducing tests are not (statistically significantly) different from other tests regarding LOC, number of assertions, and complexity. However, bug-reproducing tests contain slightly more try/except blocks and ``weak assertions'' (e.g.,~\\texttt{assertNotEqual}).

Automating this migration could substantially reduce effort and accelerate test modernization. In this paper, we investigate the capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate test framework migrations from \\texttt{unittest} to \\texttt{Pytest}. We evaluate GPT 4o and Claude Sonnet 4 under three prompting strategies (Zero-shot, One-shot, and Chain-of-Thought) and two temperature settings (0.0 and 1.0). To support this analysis, we first introduce a curated dataset of real-world migrations extracted from the top 100 Python open-source projects. Next, we actually execute the LLM-generated test migrations in their respective test suites. Overall, we find that 51.5% of the LLM-generated test migrations failed, while 48.5% passed. The results suggest that LLMs can accelerate test migration, but there are often caveats. For example, Claude Sonnet 4 exhibited more conservative migrations (e.g., preserving class-based tests and legacy \\texttt{unittest} references), while GPT-4o favored more transformations (e.g., to function-based tests).

In autoregressive video generation models, the KV cache grows with generation history and quickly dominates GPU memory, often exceeding 30 GB, preventing deployment on widely available hardware. More critically, constrained KV cache budgets restrict the effective working memory, directly degrading long horizon consistency in identity, layout, and motion. To address this challenge, we present Quant VideoGen (QVG), a training free KV cache quantization framework for autoregressive video diffusion models. QVG leverages video spatiotemporal redundancy through Semantic Aware Smoothing, producing low magnitude, quantization friendly residuals. It further introduces Progressive Residual Quantization, a coarse to fine multi stage scheme that reduces quantization error while enabling a smooth quality memory trade off. Across LongCat Video, HY WorldPlay, and Self Forcing benchmarks, QVG establishes a new Pareto frontier between quality and memory efficiency, reducing KV cache memory by up to 7.0 times with less than 4% end to end latency overhead while consistently outperforming existing baselines in generation quality."

Thus, the prevailing interpretation of ferroelectric switching dynamics fails under real operating conditions. Here we introduce a compact dynamic-field-driven nucleation and growth (DFNG) model that enables quantitative fits to switching transients across multiple ferroelectric materials to extract time-varying domain wall velocity and growth dimensionality, even under arbitrary voltage waveform. This capability then motivates its use in device modeling under complex signals spanning disparate time and frequency scales. Coupling the compact model to application-related waveforms facilitates a predictive materials-circuit co-design framework by linking nucleation and growth parameters to memory window, disturb error, speed, and energy dissipation for next-generation ferroelectric technologies."

    "abstract": "Reliable nebular emission line diagnostics are essential for accurately inferring the physical properties (e.g. electron temperature, density, pressure, and metallicity) of H II regions from spectra. When interpreting spectra, it is typical to adopt a single zone model, e.g. at fixed density, pressure, or temperature, to infer H II region properties. However, such an assumption may not fully capture the complexities of a turbulent interstellar medium. To understand how a complex density field driven by supersonic turbulence impacts nebular emission lines, we simulate 3D H II regions surrounding a single O star, both with and without supersonic turbulence. We find that turbulence directly impacts the values of common strong line ratios. For example turbulent H II regions exhibit systematically higher [N II]/H$α$, lower [O III]/H$β$, and lower O32, compared to homogeneous H II regions with the same mean density and ionizing source. These biases can impact inferences of metallicity, ionization parameter, excitation, and ionization source. For our choice of turbulence, direct $T_e$ method metallicity inferences are biased low, by up to 0.1 dex, which is important for metallicity studies, but not enough to explain the abundance discrepancy problem. Finally, we show that large differences between measured electron densities emerge between infrared, optical, and UV density indicators. Our results motivate the need for large grids of turbulent H II regions models that span the range of conditions seen at both high and low redshift to better interpret observed spectra."

Traditionally, a linear mixed model, which includes random effects to account for within-group correlation, would be used to model the observed data and make new predictions on unseen data. Some work has been done to extend the mixed model approach beyond linear regression into more complex and non-parametric models, such as decision trees and random forests. However, existing methods are limited to using the global fixed effects for prediction on data from out-of-sample groups, effectively assuming that all clusters share a common outcome model. We propose a lightweight sum-of-trees model in which we learn a decision tree for each sample group. We combine the predictions from these trees using weights so that out-of-sample group predictions are more closely aligned with the most similar groups in the training data. This strategy also allows for inference on the similarity across groups in the outcome prediction model, as the unique tree structures and variable importances for each group can be directly compared. We show our model outperforms traditional decision trees and random forests in a variety of simulation settings. Finally, we showcase our method on real-world data from the sarcoma cohort of The Cancer Genome Atlas, where patient samples are grouped by sarcoma subtype."

However, existing public datasets consider ICU patients (Intensive Care Unit) as a uniform group and neglect the potential challenges presented by critically ill trauma patients in whom injury-related inflammation and organ dysfunction can overlap with the clinical features of sepsis. We propose that a targeted identification of post-traumatic sepsis is necessary in order to develop methods for early detection. Therefore, we introduce a publicly available standardized post-trauma sepsis onset dataset extracted, relabeled using standardized post-trauma clinical facts, and validated from MIMIC-III. Furthermore, we frame early detection of post-trauma sepsis onset according to clinical workflow in ICUs in a daily basis resulting in a new rare event detection problem.

This paper presents a neuro-symbolic anomaly detection framework that combines a Graph Autoencoder (GAE) with rare pattern mining to identify APT-like activities in system-level provenance data. Our approach first constructs a process behavioral graph using k-Nearest Neighbors based on feature similarity, then learns normal relational structure using a Graph Autoencoder. Anomaly candidates are identified through deviations between observed and reconstructed graph structure. To further improve detection, we integrate an rare pattern mining module that discovers infrequent behavioral co-occurrences and uses them to boost anomaly scores for processes exhibiting rare signatures. We evaluate the proposed method on the DARPA Transparent Computing datasets and show that rare-pattern boosting yields substantial gains in anomaly ranking quality over the baseline GAE. Compared with existing unsupervised approaches on the same benchmark, our single unified model consistently outperforms individual context-based detectors and achieves performance competitive with ensemble aggregation methods that require multiple separate detectors. These results highlight the value of coupling graph-based representation learning with classical pattern mining to improve both effectiveness and interpretability in provenance-based security anomaly detection."

    "abstract": "Deep Research (DR) agents extend Large Language Models (LLMs) beyond parametric knowledge by autonomously retrieving and synthesizing evidence from large web corpora into long-form reports, enabling a long-horizon agentic paradigm. However, unlike real-time conversational assistants, DR is computationally expensive and time-consuming, creating an autonomy-interaction dilemma: high autonomy on ambiguous user queries often leads to prolonged execution with unsatisfactory outcomes. To address this, we propose IntentRL, a framework that trains proactive agents to clarify latent user intents before starting long-horizon research. To overcome the scarcity of open-ended research data, we introduce a scalable pipeline that expands a few seed samples into high-quality dialogue turns via a shallow-to-deep intent refinement graph. We further adopt a two-stage reinforcement learning (RL) strategy: Stage I applies RL on offline dialogues to efficiently learn general user-interaction behavior, while Stage II uses the trained agent and a user simulator for online rollouts to strengthen adaptation to diverse user feedback. Extensive experiments show that IntentRL significantly improves both intent hit rate and downstream task performance, outperforming the built-in clarify modules of closed-source DR agents and proactive LLM baselines."

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) can generate structured artifacts, but using them as dependable optimizers for scientific design requires a mechanism for iterative improvement under black-box evaluation. Here, we cast quantum circuit synthesis as a closed-loop, test-time optimization problem: an LLM proposes edits to a fixed-length gate list, and an external simulator evaluates the resulting state with the Meyer-Wallach (MW) global entanglement measure. We introduce a lightweight test-time learning recipe that can reuse prior high-performing candidates as an explicit memory trace, augments prompts with a score-difference feedback, and applies restart-from-the-best sampling to escape potential plateaus. Across fixed 20-qubit settings, the loop without feedback and restart-from-the-best improves random initial circuits over a range of gate budgets. To lift up this performance and success rate, we use the full learning strategy. For 25-qubit, it mitigates a pronounced performance plateau when naive querying is used. Beyond raw scores, we analyze the structure of synthesized states and find that high MW solutions can correspond to stabilizer or graph-state-like constructions, but full connectivity is not guaranteed due to the metric property and prompt design. These results illustrate both the promise and the pitfalls of memory evaluator-guided LLM optimization for circuit synthesis, highlighting the critical role of prior human-made theoretical theorem to optimally design a custom tool in support of research."

    "abstract": "Estimating treatment effects in networks is challenging, as each potential outcome depends on the treatments of all other nodes in the network. To overcome this difficulty, existing methods typically impose an exposure mapping that compresses the treatment assignments in the network into a low-dimensional summary. However, if this mapping is misspecified, standard estimators for direct and spillover effects can be severely biased. We propose a novel partial identification framework for causal inference on networks to assess the robustness of treatment effects under misspecifications of the exposure mapping. Specifically, we derive sharp upper and lower bounds on direct and spillover effects under such misspecifications. As such, our framework presents a novel application of causal sensitivity analysis to exposure mappings. We instantiate our framework for three canonical exposure settings widely used in practice: (i) weighted means of the neighborhood treatments, (ii) threshold-based exposure mappings, and (iii) truncated neighborhood interference in the presence of higher-order spillovers. Furthermore, we develop orthogonal estimators for these bounds and prove that the resulting bound estimates are valid, sharp, and efficient. Our experiments show the bounds remain informative and provide reliable conclusions under misspecification of exposure mappings."

Thus, we demonstrate the ability to distribute nonclassical correlations beyond the interaction region.

    "abstract": "Coordinating the movement of multiple autonomous agents over a shared network is a fundamental challenge in algorithmic robotics, intelligent transportation, and distributed systems. The dominant approach, Multi-Agent Path Finding, relies on centralized control and synchronous collision avoidance, which often requires strict synchronization and guarantees of globally conflict-free execution. This paper introduces the Multi-Agent Routing under Crossing Cost model on mixed graphs, a novel framework tailored to asynchronous settings. In our model, instead of treating conflicts as hard constraints, each agent is assigned a path, and the system is evaluated through a cost function that measures potential head-on encounters. This ``crossing cost'', which is defined as the product of the numbers of agents traversing an edge in opposite directions, quantifies the risk of congestion and delay in decentralized execution. Our contributions are both game-theoretic and algorithmic. We model the setting as a congestion game with a non-standard cost function, prove the existence of pure Nash equilibria, and analyze the dynamics leading to them. Equilibria can be found in polynomial time under mild conditions, while the general case is PLS-complete. From an optimization perspective, minimizing the total crossing cost is NP-hard, as the problem generalizes Steiner Orientation. To address this hardness barrier, we design a suite of parameterized algorithms for minimizing crossing cost, with parameters including the number of arcs, edges, agents, and structural graph measures. These yield XP or FPT results depending on the parameter, offering algorithmic strategies for structurally restricted instances. Our framework provides a new theoretical foundation for decentralized multi-agent routing, bridging equilibrium analysis and parameterized complexity to support scalable and risk-aware coordination."

Existing graph-based retrieval approaches typically rely on a uniform similarity metric that overlooks hop-specific semantics, and their rigid pre-defined plans hinder dynamic error correction. These limitations suggest that a retriever should adapt its reasoning to the evolving context and recover intelligently from dead ends. To address these needs, we propose Failure is Feedback (FiF), which casts subgraph retrieval as a sequential decision process and introduces two key innovations. (i) We introduce a history-aware backtracking mechanism; unlike standard backtracking that simply reverts the state, our approach piggybacks on the context of failed traversals, leveraging insights from previous failures. (ii) We implement an economically-rational agentic workflow. Unlike conventional agents with static strategies, our orchestrator employs a cost-aware traversal method to dynamically manage the trade-off between retrieval accuracy and inference costs, escalating to intensive LLM-based reasoning only when the prior failure justifies the additional computational investment. Extensive experiments show that FiF achieves state-of-the-art retrieval on the benchmarks of MultimodalQA, MMCoQA and WebQA."

SN 2024igg shows many characteristics in common with other 03fg-like objects, such as high ultraviolet flux, slowly declining light curves ($Δm_{15}(B)=0.90\\pm0.08$ mag), low expansion velocities, along with strong and persistent C II absorption. Meanwhile, this SN exhibits some remarkable properties within this subgroup, including a moderately low optical luminosity ($M_{\\rm max}(B)=-18.99\\pm0.15$ mag), a short rise time less than 18.5 days, and strong C II $\\lambda6580$. The bolometric analysis yields a $^{56}$Ni mass of $M_{\\rm Ni}=0.547\\pm0.082$ $M_{\\rm \\odot}$ and an ejecta mass of $1.54^{+0.22}_{-0.19}$ $M_{\\rm \\odot}$, marginally exceeding the Chandrasekhar mass. Our TARDIS result indicates that most of the features in the earliest spectrum could be attributed to C II, which is consistent with a model where a supernova explodes within a carbon-rich circumstellar medium (CSM). The CSM interaction would produce a density peak in the ejecta, offering a natural explanation for the slowly evolving line velocities near $-$8000 km s$^{-1}$. The CSM may stem from the debris of a secondary white dwarf in a white-dwarf merger or the envelope of an asymptotic giant branch star. Combined with the unshifted forbidden lines in the spectrum taken at $t\\approx\\ +$135 days, we suggest that SN 2024igg comes from a symmetric explosion on a secular timescale after the merger."

    "abstract": "Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) on flow-based models is crucial for preference alignment. However, they often introduce visual hallucinations like over-optimized details and semantic misalignment. This work preliminarily explores why visual hallucinations arise and how to reduce them. We first investigate RFT methods from a unified perspective, and reveal the core problems stemming from two aspects, exploration and exploitation: (1) limited exploration during stochastic differential equation (SDE) rollouts, leading to an over-emphasis on local details at the expense of global semantics, and (2) trajectory imitation process inherent in policy gradient methods, distorting the model's foundational vector field and its cross-step consistency. Building on this, we propose ConsistentRFT, a general framework to mitigate these hallucinations. Specifically, we design a Dynamic Granularity Rollout (DGR) mechanism to balance exploration between global semantics and local details by dynamically scheduling different noise sources. We then introduce a Consistent Policy Gradient Optimization (CPGO) that preserves the model's consistency by aligning the current policy with a more stable prior. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ConsistentRFT significantly mitigates visual hallucinations, achieving average reductions of 49\\% for low-level and 38\\% for high-level perceptual hallucinations. Furthermore, ConsistentRFT outperforms other RFT methods on out-of-domain metrics, showing an improvement of 5.1\\% (v.s. the baseline's decrease of -0.4\\%) over FLUX1.dev.

Elements from the first three rows of the periodic table, together with selected transition and coinage metals, were examined on the pristine surface and at boron- and nitrogen-vacancy sites. On pristine h-BN, adsorption is generally weak and dominated by dispersion forces, with measurable chemisorption limited to highly electronegative atoms such as C, O, and F. The introduction of vacancies transforms h-BN into a chemically active material, increasing adsorption energies by one to two orders of magnitude. The boron vacancy strongly stabilizes metallic and electropositive species through coordination to undercoordinated nitrogen atoms, whereas the nitrogen vacancy selectively binds electronegative and covalent adsorbates. Scaling of adsorption energies with elemental cohesive energies distinguishes regimes of physisorption, chemisorption, and substitutional stabilization. These insights provide a unified description of adsorption trends across the periodic table and establish defect engineering as an effective strategy for tailoring the catalytic, sensing, and electronic properties of h-BN."

Our main result demonstrates that perfect oblivious transfer is impossible. In the asymptotic regime, we further show that even negligible leakage cannot be achieved, as repeated use of the resource amplifies the receiver(s)'s ability to distinguish messages that were not intended for him/them. In contrast, the receiver(s)'s own privacy is not subject to a universal impossibility limitation."

To alleviate the issue, we present a learning-based initial trajectory generation method that generates high-quality initial trajectories in a short time budget by adopting example-guided reinforcement learning. In addition, we suggest a null-space projected imitation reward to consider null-space constraints by efficiently learning kinematically feasible motion captured in expert demonstrations. Our statistical evaluation in simulation shows the improved optimality, efficiency, and applicability of TO when we plug in our method's output, compared with three other baselines.

This challenge has spurred growing interest in effective machine unlearning, the process of selectively removing specific knowledge or concepts from a model without compromising its overall generative capabilities. Among various approaches, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as an effective and efficient method for fine-tuning models toward targeted unlearning. However, LoRA-based methods often exhibit limited adaptability to concept semantics and struggle to balance removing closely related concepts with maintaining generalization across broader meanings. Moreover, these methods face scalability challenges when multiple concepts must be erased simultaneously. To address these limitations, we introduce UnHype, a framework that incorporates hypernetworks into single- and multi-concept LoRA training. The proposed architecture can be directly plugged into Stable Diffusion as well as modern flow-based text-to-image models, where it demonstrates stable training behavior and effective concept control. During inference, the hypernetwork dynamically generates adaptive LoRA weights based on the CLIP embedding, enabling more context-aware, scalable unlearning. We evaluate UnHype across several challenging tasks, including object erasure, celebrity erasure, and explicit content removal, demonstrating its effectiveness and versatility.

The method combines classical Jacobi-Richardson iterations with data-driven corrections to refine numerical solutions while preserving the underlying topological and metric structure. NHCS employs a two-phase training strategy. In the first phase, DEC operators are learned through relative residual minimization from data. In the second phase, these operators are integrated into the iterative solver, and training targets the improvement of convergence through learned corrective updates that remain effective even for inaccurate intermediate solutions. This staggered training enables stable, progressive refinement while maintaining the structure-preserving properties of DEC discretizations. To improve multiscale adaptivity, NHCS introduces a convolutional neural network-based correction term capable of capturing fine-scale solution features via localized updates informed by global context, improving scalability over mesh component-wise neural approaches. Moreover, the proposed framework substantially reduces computational cost by avoiding Newton-Raphson-based training and the associated Jacobian evaluations of parameterized operators.

Recent research shows that LLMs inherently recognize unsafe content in text, and the incorporation of visual inputs in VLMs frequently dilutes risk-related signals. Motivated by this, we propose Risk Awareness Injection (RAI), a lightweight and training-free framework for safety calibration that restores LLM-like risk recognition by amplifying unsafe signals in VLMs. Specifically, RAI constructs an Unsafe Prototype Subspace from language embeddings and performs targeted modulation on selected high-risk visual tokens, explicitly activating safety-critical signals within the cross-modal feature space. This modulation restores the model's LLM-like ability to detect unsafe content from visual inputs, while preserving the semantic integrity of original tokens for cross-modal reasoning. Extensive experiments across multiple jailbreak and utility benchmarks demonstrate that RAI substantially reduces attack success rate without compromising task performance."

Such a world's first time-domain interferometric observatory would enable qualitatively new science: directly linking optical and infrared variability to spatially resolved changes in magnetospheric accretion, inner-disk geometry, and dust and gas dynamics in the innermost astronomical unit. Crucially, connecting these processes to outer-scale unresolved information from JWST, ALMA, and the ELT would yield a complete tomography of the planet-forming region."

    "abstract": "While deep learning has revolutionized financial forecasting through sophisticated architectures, the design of the supervision signal itself is rarely scrutinized. We challenge the canonical assumption that training labels must strictly mirror inference targets, uncovering the Label Horizon Paradox: the optimal supervision signal often deviates from the prediction goal, shifting across intermediate horizons governed by market dynamics. We theoretically ground this phenomenon in a dynamic signal-noise trade-off, demonstrating that generalization hinges on the competition between marginal signal realization and noise accumulation. To operationalize this insight, we propose a bi-level optimization framework that autonomously identifies the optimal proxy label within a single training run. Extensive experiments on large-scale financial datasets demonstrate consistent improvements over conventional baselines, thereby opening new avenues for label-centric research in financial forecasting."

    "abstract": "Entropy serves as a critical metric for measuring the diversity of outputs generated by large language models (LLMs), providing valuable insights into their exploration capabilities. While recent studies increasingly focus on monitoring and adjusting entropy to better balance exploration and exploitation in reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), a principled understanding of entropy dynamics during this process is yet to be thoroughly investigated. In this paper, we establish a theoretical framework for analyzing the entropy dynamics during the RFT process, which begins with a discriminant expression that quantifies entropy change under a single logit update. This foundation enables the derivation of a first-order expression for entropy change, which can be further extended to the update formula of Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). The corollaries and insights drawn from the theoretical analysis inspire the design of entropy control methods, and also offer a unified lens for interpreting various entropy-based methods in existing studies. We provide empirical evidence to support the main conclusions of our analysis and demonstrate the effectiveness of the derived entropy-discriminator clipping methods. This study yields novel insights into RFT training dynamics, providing theoretical support and practical strategies for optimizing the exploration-exploitation balance during LLM fine-tuning."

However, the sustainability of such collaborative environments hinges on a fair and stable payoff allocation mechanism. Focusing on coalition stability, this paper introduces a payoff allocation framework based on the least core (LC) concept. Unlike traditional methods, the LC prioritizes the cohesion of the federation by minimizing the maximum dissatisfaction among all potential subgroups, ensuring that no participant has an incentive to break away. To adapt this game-theoretic concept to practical, large-scale networks, we propose a streamlined implementation with a stack-based pruning algorithm, effectively balancing computational efficiency with allocation precision. Case studies in federated intrusion detection demonstrate that our mechanism correctly identifies pivotal contributors and strategic alliances. The results confirm that the practical LC framework promotes stable collaboration and fosters a sustainable FL ecosystem."

    "abstract": "We present a unified framework for neutrino masses, baryogenesis, and dark matter based on a modular $S_4$ symmetry combined with a type-III seesaw mechanism. All Yukawa couplings, CP phases, and flavor textures originate from a single complex modulus $τ$, whose vacuum expectation value controls both visible and dark sector dynamics. The same modular parameter fixes the neutrino mass matrix, determines the CP asymmetries driving resonant leptogenesis, and correlates the resulting baryon and dark matter abundances. A detailed numerical analysis shows that the model reproduces all neutrino oscillation data within the $3σ$ NuFIT~5.2 (2024) ranges for normal ordering, predicting $δ_{\\rm CP} \\simeq \\pm (150^\\circ-180^\\circ)$, $\\sum m_ν\\simeq(0.06-0.08)~\\mathrm{eV}$, and an effective Majorana mass $m_{ββ} \\simeq (8 - 18)\\times 10^{-3}~\\mathrm{eV}$, testable in next-generation neutrinoless double-beta decay experiments. The same modular Yukawas yield resonantly enhanced CP asymmetries $|ε_{L,χ}| \\sim 10^{-9}-10^{-6}$ at $M_Σ\\sim 10^{7}~\\mathrm{GeV}$, successfully generating the observed baryon asymmetry $η_B\\simeq6\\times10^{-10}$ and dark relic density $Ω_χh^2\\simeq0.12$ without additional free parameters. The predicted correlation $Ω_χ/Ω_B\\simeq5.4$ fixes the dark matter mass to $m_χ\\simeq0.1-2~\\mathrm{GeV}$, consistent with all current constraints. This framework therefore realizes a fully predictive baryon$-$dark matter co-genesis, where the geometry of the modular symmetry links the origin of flavor, CP violation, and the cosmic matter asymmetry."

Here, we collect and analyze the eye movements from 40 participants during video understanding and AI detection tasks involving a mix of real-world and AI-generated videos. We find that given the high realism of AI-generated videos, gaze behavior is driven less by the video's actual authenticity and more by the viewer's perception of its authenticity.

However, their effectiveness in identifying new, complex materials remains uncertain. Here, we systematically assess the capability of a uMLIP (i.e.,M3GNet) to accelerate CSP in quaternary oxides. Through extensive exploration of the Sr-Li-Al-O and Ba-Y-Al-O systems, we show that uMLIP can rediscover experimentally known materials absent from its training set and identify seven new thermodynamically and dynamically stable compounds. These include a new polymorph of Sr2LiAlO4 (P3221) and a new disordered phase, Sr2Li4Al2O7 (P1_bar). Furthermore, our results show stability predictions based on the semilocal PBE functional require cross-validation with higher-level methods, such as SCAN and RPA, to ensure reliability. While uMLIPs substantially reduce the computational cost of CSP, the primary bottleneck has shifted to the efficiency of search algorithms in navigating complex structural spaces. This work highlights both the promise and current limitations of uMLIP-driven CSP in the discovery of new materials."

However, these strategies are impractical for edge device deployment due to limited RAM and NPU resources. Despite hardware constraints, deploying performant LLM on edge devices such as smartphone remains crucial for user experience. To address this, we propose MeKi (Memory-based Expert Knowledge Injection), a novel system that scales LLM capacity via storage space rather than FLOPs. MeKi equips each Transformer layer with token-level memory experts that injects pre-stored semantic knowledge into the generation process. To bridge the gap between training capacity and inference efficiency, we employ a re-parameterization strategy to fold parameter matrices used during training into a compact static lookup table. By offloading the knowledge to ROM, MeKi decouples model capacity from computational cost, introducing zero inference latency overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MeKi significantly outperforms dense LLM baselines with identical inference speed, validating the effectiveness of memory-based scaling paradigm for on-device LLMs. Project homepage is at https://github.com/ningding-o/MeKi."

    "abstract": "Audio is a fundamental modality for analyzing speech, music, and environmental sounds. Although pretrained audio models have significantly advanced audio understanding, they remain fragile in real-world settings where data distributions shift over time. In this work, we present the first systematic benchmark for audio continual learning (CL) with pretrained models (PTMs), together with a comprehensive analysis of its unique challenges. Unlike in vision, where parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has proven effective for CL, directly transferring such strategies to audio leads to poor performance. This stems from a fundamental property of audio backbones: they focus on low-level spectral details rather than structured semantics, causing severe upstream-downstream misalignment. Through extensive empirical study, we identify analytic classifiers with first-session adaptation (FSA) as a promising direction, but also reveal two major limitations: representation saturation in coarse-grained scenarios and representation drift in fine-grained scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose PACE, a novel method that enhances FSA via a regularized analytic classifier and enables multi-session adaptation through adaptive subspace-orthogonal PEFT for improved semantic alignment. In addition, we introduce spectrogram-based boundary-aware perturbations to mitigate representation overlap and improve stability. Experiments on six diverse audio CL benchmarks demonstrate that PACE substantially outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, marking an important step toward robust and scalable audio continual learning with PTMs."

We introduce \\textbf{PEGRL}, a \\textit{two-stage} RL framework that uses post-editing as an auxiliary task to stabilize training and guide overall optimization. At each iteration, translation outputs are sampled to construct post-editing inputs, allowing return estimation in the post-editing stage to benefit from conditioning on the current translation behavior, while jointly supporting both global exploration and fine-grained local optimization. A task-specific weighting scheme further balances the contributions of translation and post-editing objectives, yielding a biased yet more sample-efficient estimator.

The schemes under consideration include the classical Harten-Lax-van Leer-Contact (HLLC), the recently proposed TV flux splitting, the low-dissipation Central-Upwind (LDCU), and the local characteristic decomposition-based Central-Upwind (LCDCU) schemes. These methods are extended to higher orders of accuracy, up to the fifth order, within both finite-volume and finite-difference frameworks. A series of numerical experiments for the one- and two-dimensional Euler equations of gas dynamics are performed to evaluate the accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency of the studied schemes. The comparison highlights the trade-offs between resolution of contact and shear waves, robustness in the presence of shocks, and computational cost. The investigated low-dissipation schemes show comparable levels of numerical dissipation, with only subtle differences appearing in selected benchmark problems. The results provide practical guidance for selecting efficient low-dissipation solvers for the simulation of complex compressible flows."

    "abstract": "Robustness is often regarded as a critical future challenge for real-world applications, where stability is essential. However, as models often learn tasks in a similar order, we hypothesize that easier tasks will be easier regardless of how they are presented to the model. Indeed, in this paper, we show that as models approach high performance on a task, robustness is effectively achieved. Through an empirical analysis of multiple models across diverse datasets and configurations (e.g., paraphrases, different temperatures), we find a strong positive correlation. Moreover, we find that robustness is primarily driven by task-specific competence rather than inherent model-level properties, challenging current approaches that treat robustness as an independent capability. Thus, from a high-level perspective, we may expect that as new tasks saturate, model robustness on these tasks will emerge accordingly. For researchers, this implies that explicit efforts to measure and improve robustness may warrant reduced emphasis, as such robustness is likely to develop alongside performance gains. For practitioners, it acts as a sign that indeed the tasks that the literature deals with are unreliable, but on easier past tasks, the models are reliable and ready for real-world deployment."

By employing an InfoGAN-style objective, where we train a recognition model to predict the tokens used to condition the diffusion decoder using the decoded images, we enforce the decoder to not ignore any of the tokens. To promote compositional control, besides the original images, CompTok also trains on tokens formed by swapping token subsets between images, enabling more compositional control of the token over the decoder. As the swapped tokens between images do not have ground truth image targets, we apply a manifold constraint via an adversarial flow regularizer to keep unpaired swap generations on the natural-image distribution. The resulting tokenizer not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on image class-conditioned generation, but also demonstrates properties such as swapping tokens between images to achieve high level semantic editing of an image. Additionally, we propose two metrics that measures the landscape of the token space that can be useful to describe not only the compositionality of the tokens, but also how easy to learn the landscape is for a generator to be trained on this space. We show in experiments that CompTok can improve on both of the metrics as well as supporting state-of-the-art generators for class conditioned generation."

We show that a binary LLM critic with strong offline accuracy (AUROC 0.94) can nevertheless cause severe performance degradation, inducing a 26 percentage point (pp) collapse on one model while affecting another by near zero pp. This variability demonstrates that LLM critic accuracy alone is insufficient to determine whether intervention is safe. We identify a disruption-recovery tradeoff: interventions may recover failing trajectories but also disrupt trajectories that would have succeeded. Based on this insight, we propose a pre-deployment test that uses a small pilot of 50 tasks to estimate whether intervention is likely to help or harm, without requiring full deployment. Across benchmarks, the test correctly anticipates outcomes: intervention degrades performance on high-success tasks (0 to -26 pp), while yielding a modest improvement on the high-failure ALFWorld benchmark (+2.8 pp, p=0.014). The primary value of our framework is therefore identifying when not to intervene, preventing severe regressions before deployment."

    "abstract": "In fault-tolerant quantum computing, soft outputs from real-time decoders play a crucial role in improving decoding accuracy, post-selecting magic states, and accelerating lattice surgery. A recent paper by Meister et al. [arXiv:2405.07433 (2024)] proposed an efficient method to evaluate soft outputs for cluster-based decoders, including the Union-Find (UF) decoder. However, in parallel computing environments, its computational complexity is comparable to or even surpasses that of the UF decoder itself, resulting in a substantial overhead. Furthermore, this method requires global information about the decoding graph, making it poorly suited for existing hardware implementations of the UF decoder on Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). In this paper, to alleviate these issues, we develop more efficient methods for evaluating high-quality soft outputs in cluster-based decoders by introducing several early-stopping techniques. Our central idea is that the precise value of a large soft output is often unnecessary in practice. Based on this insight, we introduce two types of novel soft-outputs: the bounded cluster gap and the extra-cluster gap. The former reduces the computational complexity of Meister's method by terminating the calculation at an early stage. Our numerical simulations show that this method achieves improved scaling with code distance $d$ compared to the original proposal. The latter, the extra-cluster gap, quantifies decoder reliability by performing a small, additional growth of the clusters obtained by the decoder. This approach offers the significant advantage of enabling soft-output computation without modifying the existing architecture of FPGA-implemented UF decoders. These techniques offer lower computational complexity and higher hardware compatibility, laying a crucial foundation for future real-time decoders with soft outputs."

    "abstract": "Advancing complex reasoning in large language models relies on high-quality, verifiable datasets, yet human annotation remains cost-prohibitive and difficult to scale. Current synthesis paradigms often face a recurring trade-off: maintaining structural validity typically restricts problem complexity, while relaxing constraints to increase difficulty frequently leads to inconsistent or unsolvable instances. To address this, we propose Agentic Proposing, a framework that models problem synthesis as a goal-driven sequential decision process where a specialized agent dynamically selects and composes modular reasoning skills. Through an iterative workflow of internal reflection and tool-use, we develop the Agentic-Proposer-4B using Multi-Granularity Policy Optimization (MGPO) to generate high-precision, verifiable training trajectories across mathematics, coding, and science. Empirical results demonstrate that downstream solvers trained on agent-synthesized data significantly outperform leading baselines and exhibit robust cross-domain generalization. Notably, a 30B solver trained on only 11,000 synthesized trajectories achieves a state-of-the-art 91.6% accuracy on AIME25, rivaling frontier-scale proprietary models such as GPT-5 and proving that a small volume of high-quality synthetic signals can effectively substitute for massive human-curated datasets."

We report the newest developments on the production of such structures using laser-based techniques, namely the manufacture of a first batch of the so-called FAT-GEMs. This process allows low-cost and reproducible manufacturing of a high volume of such structures. In addition to the detailed description of the production, we present a performance assessment in pure argon, at a gas density close to the one expected in LAr conditions. An energy resolution of 23.5$\\pm$1~\\% (FWHM) at 5.9~keV was obtained, indicating a consistent improvement over previous batch. The optical treatment of the electrode surfaces has been greatly simplified and modestly improved, while charging-up effects arising from the use of laminates eliminated."

The introduction of transformer architectures and self-supervised pretraining (SSL) has led to the development of EEG foundation models. These models are pretrained on large amounts of unlabeled data and can be adapted to a range of downstream tasks. This systematic review summarizes recent SSL-trained EEG foundation models that learn whole-brain representations from multichannel EEG rather than representations derived from a single channel. We searched PubMed, IEEE Xplore, Scopus, and arXiv through July 21, 2025. Nineteen preprints and peer-reviewed articles met inclusion criteria. We extracted information regarding pretraining datasets, model architectures, pretraining SSL objectives, and downstream task applications. While pretraining data heavily relied on the Temple University EEG corpus, there was significant heterogeneity in model architecture and training objectives across studies. Transformer architectures were identified as the predominant pretraining architecture with state-space models such as MAMBA and S4 as emerging alternatives. Concerning SSL objectives, masked auto-encoding was most common, and other studies incorporate contrastive learning. Downstream tasks varied widely and implemented diverse fine-tuning strategies, which made direct comparison challenging. Furthermore, most studies used single-task fine-tuning, and a generalizable EEG foundation model remains lacking. In conclusion, the field is advancing rapidly but still limited by limited dataset diversity and the absence of standardized benchmarks. Progress will likely depend on larger and more diverse pretraining datasets, standardized evaluation protocols, and multi-task validation. The development will advance EEG foundation models towards robust and general-purpose relevant to both basic and clinical applications."

Delivering such latency-sensitive experiences involves considerable challenges in orchestrating network, computing, and service resources, where existing limitations highlight the need for a structured approach to analyse and optimise these complex systems. This challenge is amplified by the need for high-performance, low-latency connectivity, where 5G and 6G networks provide essential infrastructure to meet the requirements of XR services at scale. This article addresses these challenges by developing a model that parametrises multi-user XR services across four critical layers of the standard virtualisation architecture. We formalise this model mathematically, proposing a context-aware framework that defines key parameters at each level and integrates them into a comprehensive Edge-Cloud Continuum orchestration strategy. Our contributions include a detailed analysis of the current limitations and needs in existing Edge-Cloud Continuum orchestration approaches, the formulation of a layered mathematical model, and a validation framework that demonstrates the utility and feasibility of the proposed solution."

Finally, we set the ground for the finer question of transfer of NIP formulas of valued fields with bounded quantifier rank. Namely, we prove that for any henselian equicharacteristic valued field, any formula of quantifier rank at most $n\\geq 1$ is NIP if and only if the same is true for the residue field and the value group, provided that the valued field is separably defectless Kaplansky and conditional on a multi-variable generalization of a well known statement about indiscernible sequences of singletons in ac-valued fields."

This paper investigates the impact of integrating physics-based information into data-driven surrogate models. Specifically, we evaluate whether physics-informed features allow for the simplification of neural network architectures without compromising accuracy. Using the open-source electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) battery dataset, we compare pure data-driven models against physics-informed data models. Results demonstrate that physics-informed models achieve comparable accuracy to complex pure data-driven models while using up to 75% fewer trainable parameters, significantly reducing computational overhead for potential on-board deployment."

To fill this gap, we present LPS-Bench, a benchmark that evaluates the planning-time safety awareness of MCP-based CUAs under long-horizon tasks, covering both benign and adversarial interactions across 65 scenarios of 7 task domains and 9 risk types. We introduce a multi-agent automated pipeline for scalable data generation and adopt an LLM-as-a-judge evaluation protocol to assess safety awareness through the planning trajectory.

This pretraining strategy yields nearly orthogonal feature bases. We provide both theoretical and empirical evidence that physics-informed pretraining improves the approximation capability of the learned feature space. When employed to solve Helmholtz, Poisson, wave, and Navier-Stokes equations, the proposed method achieves residual errors 2-3 orders of magnitude lower than those of comparable methods. Furthermore, the orthogonality regularization improves transferability, enabling pretrained features to generalize effectively across different source terms and domain geometries for the same PDE."

BayeSQP employs second-order Gaussian process surrogates for both the objective and constraints to jointly model the function values, gradients, and Hessian from only zero-order information. At each iteration, a local subproblem is constructed using the GP posterior estimates and solved to obtain a search direction. Crucially, the formulation of the subproblem explicitly incorporates uncertainty in both the function and derivative estimates, resulting in a tractable second-order cone program for high probability improvements under model uncertainty. A subsequent one-dimensional line search via constrained Thompson sampling selects the next evaluation point. Empirical results show thatBayeSQP outperforms state-of-the-art methods in specific high-dimensional settings. Our algorithm offers a principled and flexible framework that bridges classical optimization techniques with modern approaches to black-box optimization."

In this paper, we propose EventFlash, a novel and efficient MLLM to explore spatiotemporal token sparsification for reducing data redundancy and accelerating inference. Technically, we build EventMind, a large-scale and scene-diverse dataset with over 500k instruction sets, providing both short and long event stream sequences to support our curriculum training strategy. We then present an adaptive temporal window aggregation module for efficient temporal sampling, which adaptively compresses temporal tokens while retaining key temporal cues. Finally, a sparse density-guided attention module is designed to improve spatial token efficiency by selecting informative regions and suppressing empty or sparse areas. Experimental results show that EventFlash achieves a $12.4\\times$ throughput improvement over the baseline (EventFlash-Zero) while maintaining comparable performance. It supports long-range event stream processing with up to 1,000 bins, significantly outperforming the 5-bin limit of EventGPT.

We introduce ConsisDrive, an identity-preserving driving world model designed to enforce temporal consistency at the instance level. Our framework incorporates two key components: (1) Instance-Masked Attention, which applies instance identity masks and trajectory masks within attention blocks to ensure that visual tokens interact only with their corresponding instance features across spatial and temporal dimensions, thereby preserving object identity consistency; and (2) Instance-Masked Loss, which adaptively emphasizes foreground regions with probabilistic instance masking, reducing background noise while maintaining overall scene fidelity.

We also construct two sequences of mixing distributions that demonstrate the sharpness of this bound. Taken together, our results resolve an open problem raised in Jia et al.

    "abstract": "AI-powered planning tools show promise in supporting programming learners by enabling early, formative feedback on their thinking processes prior to coding. To date, however, most AI-supported planning tools rely on students' natural-language explanations, using LLMs to interpret learners' descriptions of their algorithmic intent. Prior to the emergence of LLM-based systems, CS education research extensively studied trace-based planning in pen-and-paper settings, demonstrating that reasoning through stepwise execution with explicit state transitions helps learners build and refine mental models of program behavior. Despite its potential, little is known about how tracing interacts with AI-mediated feedback and whether integrating tracing into AI-supported planning tools leads to different learning processes or interaction dynamics compared to natural-language-based planning alone. We study how requiring learners to produce explicit execution traces with an AI-supported planning tool affects their algorithmic reasoning. In a between-subjects study with 20 students, tracing shifted learners away from code-like, line-by-line descriptions toward more goal-driven reasoning about program behavior. Moreover, it led to more consistent partially correct solutions, although final coding performance remained comparable across conditions. Notably, tracing did not significantly affect the quality or reliability of LLM-generated feedback. These findings reveal tradeoffs in combining tracing with AI-supported planning and inform design guidelines for integrating natural language, tracing, and coding to support iterative reasoning throughout the programming process."

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a key paradigm for aligning and optimizing large language models (LLMs). Standard approaches treat the LLM as the policy and apply RL directly over the full vocabulary space. However, this formulation includes the massive tail of contextually irrelevant tokens in the action space, which could distract the policy from focusing on decision-making among the truly reasonable tokens. In this work, we verify that valid reasoning paths could inherently concentrate within a low-rank subspace. Based on this insight, we introduce Reinforcement Learning with Promising Tokens (RLPT), a framework that mitigates the action space issue by decoupling strategic decision-making from token generation. Specifically, RLPT leverages the semantic priors of the base model to identify a dynamic set of \\emph{promising tokens} and constrains policy optimization exclusively to this refined subset via masking. Theoretical analysis and empirical results demonstrate that RLPT effectively reduces gradient variance, stabilizes the training process, and improves sample efficiency. Experiment results on math, coding, and telecom reasoning show that RLPT outperforms standard RL baselines and integrates effectively across various model sizes (4B and 8B) and RL algorithms (GRPO and DAPO)."

    "abstract": "Superconducting quantum circuits typically use capacitive charge-based linear coupling schemes to control interactions between elements such as qubits. While simple and effective, this coupling scheme makes it difficult to satisfy competing circuit design requirements such as maintaining large qubit anharmonicity and coherence along with a high degree of qubit connectivity and packing density. Moreover, tunable interactions using linear coupling elements produce dynamical variations in mode hybridization, which can induce non-adiabatic transitions, resulting in leakage errors and limiting gate speeds. In this work we attempt to address these challenges by proposing a junction-based coupling architecture based on SQUID (superconducting quantum interference device) couplers with relatively small Josephson energies. SQUID couplers provide intrinsic cross-Kerr interactions that can be controlled by external fluxes and that do not rely on mode hybridization. The small Josephson energies of the coupler maintain the interaction at a perturbative scale, which limits undesired higher-order mixing between coupled elements while achieving a sufficiently strong cross-Kerr interaction originating from diagonal coupling elements. Based on these properties, we show that a SQUID coupler can be used to implement a fast, adiabatic, and high-fidelity controlled-Z gate without introducing extra modes, and the operation is robust against junction asymmetry for high-frequency qubits. Although unconventional crosstalk may arise due to junction asymmetries and parasitic hybridization with spectator qubits, we show that these effects are sufficiently small for realistic circuit parameters. As an example of the utility of such junction-based coupling schemes, we present a scalable tiling strategy for a miniaturized superconducting quantum processor based on merged-element transmon qubits."

While it has been well established that bubble geometry strongly influences the ejection speeds of liquid jets, mathematical studies of liquid jets with arbitrary bubble shapes remain limited. In this work, we derive a pressure impulse in the small-cavity limit as a tractable integral of classical Legendre functions. It is shown that the jet speed can be divided into two components: (i) the velocity induced by the hydrostatic pressure impulse distribution created by the curvature of the bubble, and (ii) the velocity induced by the distribution of the submersion of the tube in a container. This decomposition reveals that an optimal bubble curvature emerges only when the tube is submerged: the optimality is absent for non-submerged configurations, where the jet speed increases monotonically with bubble depth. Experiments confirm this non-monotonicity and quantitatively support the predicted shift of the optimal geometry with submersion depth."

Compared to existing datasets, Privasis, comprising 1.4 million records, offers orders-of-magnitude larger scale with quality, and far greater diversity across various document types, including medical history, legal documents, financial records, calendars, and text messages with a total of 55.1 million annotated attributes such as ethnicity, date of birth, workplace, etc. We leverage Privasis to construct a parallel corpus for text sanitization with our pipeline that decomposes texts and applies targeted sanitization. Our compact sanitization models (<=4B) trained on this dataset outperform state-of-the-art large language models, such as GPT-5 and Qwen-3 235B. We plan to release data, models, and code to accelerate future research on privacy-sensitive domains and agents."

We identify a gap in UT training data: repository-mined tests lack developer CoTs, while LLM-distilled CoTs are often incorrect or incomplete. To address this issue, we propose a novel data-distillation approach that uses self-debugging to produce high-quality UT training examples paired with faithful CoTs. Our approach combines (1) guided test repair, a heuristic loop (error-, failure-, and coverage-focused steps) that asks the used model to diagnose and iteratively fix generated tests, and (2) CoT compression, which compacts original and debugging CoTs into concise explanations that directly justify correct tests. We apply this pipeline to a large corpus of open-source projects to construct a dataset of 74,518 high-quality <focal method, test, CoT> examples, and then use it for supervised fine-tuning of a base model. An empirical evaluation shows that the fine-tuned model achieves high UT generation effectiveness: it attains a pass rate of 36.17% on test assertions, a branch coverage of 43.90%, and a mutation score of 88.66%, substantially higher than state-of-the-art commercial models like o4-mini."

    "abstract": "We present a jet-free approach for measuring energy-energy correlators (EEC) in proton-proton (pp) collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), employing an event-topology method that does not rely on explicit jet reconstruction. Using the leading charged hadron as a reference axis, the azimuthal plane is divided into Toward and Transverse regions, enabling a robust background subtraction and extending EEC measurements into the low $p_T$ regime where conventional jet-based approaches become unreliable. The method is validated through comparisons with conventional jet reconstruction results. We systematically explore the dependence of the EEC on the leading-particle transverse momentum and parton flavor. The observed scaling between the EEC peak position and the hard scale suggests that this topology-based EEC captures effectively the transition between perturbative and non-perturbative QCD regimes. Distinct differences are found between quark- and gluon-initiated events, reflecting their different color charges and radiation patterns. Extending the analysis to heavy flavor, EECs triggered by leading charm mesons exhibit a suppressed magnitude and a peak shifted toward larger angular separations relative to inclusive charged-particle triggers, providing a direct manifestation of the dead-cone effect. This jet-free EEC framework offers a simple and experimentally robust tool for studying the scale and flavor dependence of the QCD dynamics, with promising applications to proton-nucleus and heavy-ion collisions at the LHC."

In this work, we present a force-plate-free approach for estimating GRFs using only marker-based motion capture data. This kinematics only method to estimate and decompose GRF makes it well suited for widespread clinical depolyment. By using kinematics from sixteen body segments, we estimate the centre of mass (CoM) and compute GRFs, which are subsequently decomposed into individual components through a minimization-based approach. Through this framework, we can identify gait stance phases and provide access to clinically meaningful kinetic measures without a dedicated force plate system. Experimental results demonstrate the viability of CoM and GRF estimation based solely on kinematic data, supporting force-plate-free gait analysis."

In this work, we study the precession of the spherical orbit in the Kerr-Bertotti-Robinson geometry describing a rotating black hole immersed in a uniform electromagnetic field. Although the timelike geodesics is non-separable, we develop a Hamiltonian approach to investigate the spherical orbits. For sufficiently strong magnetic fields, the study shows that the spherical orbits can only exist within a finite radial range for given orbital inclination. Requiring the existence of the spherical orbits, we obtain an upper bound of the magnetic field, i.e., $B<0.33 M^{-1}$ for prograde and $B<0.0165 M^{-1}$ for retrograde motion. Furthermore, imposing the observed jet precession period, we obtain a significantly tighter constraint, $B\\lesssim 0.0145 M^{-1}$, providing a new constrain on the magnetic field of M87* independent of the shadow. Our results provide unified constraints on the parameters of the KBR black hole and demonstrate that the jet precession offers a robust and complementary probe of magnetized black holes in the strong gravity regime."

Attackers can pretrain VLAs on poisoned data to implant backdoors that remain stealthy but can trigger harmful behavior during inference. However, existing defenses either lack mechanistic insight into multimodal backdoors or impose prohibitive computational costs via full-model retraining. To this end, we uncover a deep-layer attention grabbing mechanism: backdoors redirect late-stage attention and form compact embedding clusters near the clean manifold. Leveraging this insight, we introduce Bera, a test-time backdoor erasure framework that detects tokens with anomalous attention via latent-space localization, masks suspicious regions using deep-layer cues, and reconstructs a trigger-free image to break the trigger-unsafe-action mapping while restoring correct behavior. Unlike prior defenses, Bera requires neither retraining of VLAs nor any changes to the training pipeline. Extensive experiments across multiple embodied platforms and tasks show that Bera effectively maintains nominal performance, significantly reduces attack success rates, and consistently restores benign behavior from backdoored outputs, thereby offering a robust and practical defense mechanism for securing robotic systems."

    "abstract": "Vision Language Models (VLMs) typically assume complete modality input during inference. However, their effectiveness drops sharply when certain modalities are unavailable or incomplete. Current research primarily faces two dilemmas: Prompt-based methods struggle to restore missing yet indispensable features and impair generalization of VLMs. Imputation-based approaches, lacking effective guidance, are prone to generating semantically irrelevant noise. Restoring precise semantics while sustaining VLM generalization remains challenging. Therefore, we propose a general missing modality restoration strategy in this paper. We introduce an enhanced diffusion model as a pluggable mid-stage training module to effectively restore missing features. Our strategy introduces two key innovations: (I) Dynamic Modality Gating, which adaptively leverages conditional features to steer the generation of semantically consistent features; (II) Cross-Modal Mutual Learning mechanism, which bridges the semantic spaces of dual encoders to achieve bidirectional alignment. Zero-shot evaluations across benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing baseline methods. Extensive experiments and ablation studies confirm our model as a robust and scalable extension for VLMs in missing modality scenarios, ensuring reliability across diverse missing rates and environments. Our code and models will be publicly available."

    "abstract": "Multi-agent LLM frameworks are widely used to accelerate the development of agent systems powered by large language models (LLMs). These frameworks impose distinct architectural structures that govern how agents interact, store information, and coordinate tasks. However, their impact on system performance remains poorly understood. This gap is critical, as architectural choices alone can induce order-of-magnitude differences in latency and throughput, as well as substantial variation in accuracy and scalability. Addressing this challenge requires (i) jointly evaluating multiple capabilities, such as orchestration overhead, memory behavior, planning, specialization, and coordination, and (ii) conducting these evaluations under controlled, framework-level conditions to isolate architectural effects. Existing benchmarks focus on individual capabilities and lack standardized framework-level evaluation. We address these limitations by (i) introducing an architectural taxonomy for systematically comparing multi-agent LLM frameworks along fundamental dimensions, and (ii) developing MAFBench, a unified evaluation suite that integrates existing benchmarks under a standardized execution pipeline. Using MAFBench, we conduct a controlled empirical study across several widely used frameworks. Our results show that framework-level design choices alone can increase latency by over 100x, reduce planning accuracy by up to 30%, and lower coordination success from above 90% to below 30%. Finally, we translate our findings into concrete architectural design principles and framework selection guidance, and outline promising future research directions."

Learners receive mixtures of labeled and unlabeled exemplars while we vary supervision (1/3/6 labels), target feature (size, shape, pattern), and perceptual alignment (high/low). We find that children generalize rapidly from minimal labels but show strong feature-specific biases and sensitivity to alignment. CNNs show a different interaction profile: added supervision improves performance, but both alignment and feature structure moderate the impact additional supervision has on learning. These results show that human-model comparisons must be drawn under the right conditions, emphasizing interactions among supervision, feature structure, and alignment rather than overall accuracy."

Therefore, it is hard for someone to compare different social media platforms or determine whether transparency leads to greater accountability or only leads to increased understanding. A new classification system has been developed to help provide a standard way of categorizing the way, that an algorithm is presented through UI elements and whether the company has provided any type of explanation as to why they are featured. This new classification system includes the following three areas of development: design form, information content, and user agency. This new classification system can be applied to the six social media platforms currently available and serves as a reference database for identifying common archetypes of features in the each social media platform's UI. The new classification system will assist in determining whether or not the transparency of an algorithm functions the way that it was intended when it was developed and provide future design ideas that can help improve the inspectibility, actionability, and contestability of algorithms."

Our approach exploits the geometric structure of pretrained contrastive encoders to enable zero-shot cross-modal transfer using only text descriptions, without paired supervision. We empirically validate that such consistent modality gaps exist across image, video, audio, 3D, X-ray, and molecular domains, demonstrating that text-only training can preserve substantial performance of pretrained encoders. We further show that our framework enables emergent cross-modal retrieval between modality pairs not explicitly aligned during training (e.g., audio-to-image, 3D-to-image). These results establish text-only training as a practical alternative to paired supervision for modality expansion."

In this study, using spatially resolved spectroscopic data from the SAMI Galaxy Survey, we identify galaxies undergoing or recently affected by RPS in eight nearby clusters ($0.029 < z < 0.058$), through a visual classification scheme based on the ionised gas ($\\rm Hα+ [NII]λ6584$) morphologies, split into unperturbed, asymmetric, and truncated. The projected phase-space analysis shows that asymmetric galaxies are found in a narrow region in cluster-centric distance ($\\rm 0.1 < R/R_{200} < 0.6$) and have a larger dispersion in line-of-sight velocity ($σ(|v_{pec}|)_\\mathrm{Asym} = 0.71^{+0.09}_{-0.07}\\ σ_{200}$) compared to the truncated and unperturbed samples. In terms of star formation activity, RPS candidates yield a much steeper resolved star-forming main sequence (rSFMS; $Σ_\\mathrm{SFR} - Σ_\\ast$) relation compared to the unperturbed counterparts, primarily emerging from having lower $Σ_\\mathrm{SFR}$ values for the low mass density regime, with the steepest gradient deriving from the truncated sample. Moreover, radial star formation profiles reveal that star formation in RPS candidates is suppressed in the outskirts relative to unperturbed galaxies and is more prominent for the truncated sample. In contrast, central ($\\rm r/r_{eff}<0.5$) star formation activity in RPS candidates is comparable with that in their unperturbed and field counterparts, suggesting no elevated activity. Taken together, this suggests an evolutionary trend linked to the RPS stage, where unperturbed galaxies likely represent recently accreted systems (pre-RPS), while asymmetric and truncated galaxies may correspond to populations undergoing RPS and post-RPS phases, respectively, favouring outside-in quenching."

Practical solvers for these problems typically follow a predictor-corrector (PC) structure, but rely on hand-crafted heuristics for step sizes and iteration termination, which are often suboptimal and task-specific. To address this, we unify these problems under a single framework, which enables the design of a general neural solver. Building on this unified view, we propose Neural Predictor-Corrector (NPC), which replaces hand-crafted heuristics with automatically learned policies. NPC formulates policy selection as a sequential decision-making problem and leverages reinforcement learning to automatically discover efficient strategies. To further enhance generalization, we introduce an amortized training mechanism, enabling one-time offline training for a class of problems and efficient online inference on new instances. Experiments on four representative homotopy problems demonstrate that our method generalizes effectively to unseen instances. It consistently outperforms classical and specialized baselines in efficiency while demonstrating superior stability across tasks, highlighting the value of unifying homotopy methods into a single neural framework."

The proposed framework is notably more powerful than classical theory -- it not only provides systematic guidance for choosing the optimal scaling factor, but also predicts root-exponential and other intricate convergence behaviors that classical approaches fail to capture. Leveraging this framework, we conducted a detailed comparative study of Hermite and Laguerre approximations. We find that functions with similar decay and oscillation characteristics may nonetheless display markedly different convergence rates. Furthermore, approximations based on two concatenated sets of Laguerre functions may offer significant advantages over those using a single set of Hermite functions."

In this work, we report the long-term timing evolution of four AXPs: 1E 2259+586, 4U 0142+61, 1RXS J170849.0-400910 and 1E 1841-045, which were regularly monitored with NICER from 2017 to 2024. Over this period, we identify a total of 10 timing events. In addition to one glitch and one anti-glitch in 1E 2259+586 reported in literature, we detect another 8 new timing events: 5 glitches, 2 anti-glitches, and 1 unusual state transition event. Notably, both anti-glitches were observed in 4U 0142+61, making it the most frequent source of such events, and there is a hint of regular evolution in its pulse profile. In the case of 1RXS J170849.0-400910, it continues to exhibit pronounced high-frequency timing anomalies and undergoes a state transition event. Finally, we study the evolution of the pulse profiles and find that the profiles of 1E 2259+586 and 4U 0142+61 both evolve.

However, the potential for a bidirectional process--where insights from post-training retroactively improve the pre-trained foundation--remains unexplored. We aim to establish a self-reinforcing flywheel: a cycle in which reinforcement learning (RL)-tuned model strengthens the base model, which in turn enhances subsequent post-training performance, requiring no specially trained teacher or reference model. To realize this, we analyze training dynamics and identify the mid-training (annealing) phase as a critical turning point for model capabilities. This phase typically occurs at the end of pre-training, utilizing high-quality corpora under a rapidly decaying learning rate. Building upon this insight, we introduce ReMiT (Reinforcement Learning-Guided Mid-Training). Specifically, ReMiT leverages the reasoning priors of RL-tuned models to dynamically reweight tokens during the mid-training phase, prioritizing those pivotal for reasoning. Empirically, ReMiT achieves an average improvement of 3\\% on 10 pre-training benchmarks, spanning math, code, and general reasoning, and sustains these gains by over 2\\% throughout the post-training pipeline.

    "abstract": "It is increasingly common for data to possess intricate structure, necessitating new models and analytical tools. Graphs, a prominent type of structure, can encode the relationships between any two entities (nodes). However, graphs neither allow connections that are not dyadic nor permit relationships between sets of nodes. We thus turn to simplicial complexes for connecting more than two nodes as well as modeling relationships between simplices, such as edges and triangles. Our data then consist of signals lying on topological spaces, represented by simplicial complexes. Much recent work explores these topological signals, albeit primarily through deterministic formulations. We propose a probabilistic framework for random signals defined on simplicial complexes. Specifically, we generalize the classical notion of stationarity. By spectral dualities of Hodge and Dirac theory, we define stationary topological signals as the outputs of topological filters given white noise. This definition naturally extends desirable properties of stationarity that hold for both time-series and graph signals. Crucially, we properly define topological power spectral density (PSD) through a clear spectral characterization. We then discuss the advantages of topological stationarity due to spectral properties via the PSD. In addition, we empirically demonstrate the practicality of these benefits through multiple synthetic and real-world simulations."

    "abstract": "Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) built on Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit high variance in their reasoning trajectories. Process verification, which evaluates intermediate steps in trajectories, has shown promise in general reasoning settings, and has been suggested as a potential tool for guiding coordination of MAS; however, its actual effectiveness in MAS remains unclear. To fill this gap, we present MAS-ProVe, a systematic empirical study of process verification for multi-agent systems (MAS). Our study spans three verification paradigms (LLM-as-a-Judge, reward models, and process reward models), evaluated across two levels of verification granularity (agent-level and iteration-level). We further examine five representative verifiers and four context management strategies, and conduct experiments over six diverse MAS frameworks on multiple reasoning benchmarks. We find that process-level verification does not consistently improve performance and frequently exhibits high variance, highlighting the difficulty of reliably evaluating partial multi-agent trajectories. Among the methods studied, LLM-as-a-Judge generally outperforms reward-based approaches, with trained judges surpassing general-purpose LLMs. We further observe a small performance gap between LLMs acting as judges and as single agents, and identify a context-length-performance trade-off in verification. Overall, our results suggest that effective and robust process verification for MAS remains an open challenge, requiring further advances beyond current paradigms.

FEDCOMPASS employs spectral clustering to group clients by class distribution similarity and performs cluster-wise aggregation for classical feature extractors. For quantum parameters, it uses circular mean aggregation combined with adaptive optimization to ensure stable global updates.

    "abstract": "Regular black holes are often used to address singularities, but they typically involve a potentially unstable de Sitter core and an internal horizon that breaks predictability. Integrable singularities (IS) have recently gained attention because they avoid both issues and exhibit finite tidal forces, allowing nondestructive radial infall. First, we present a new BH solution sourced by a string fluid (FS) that exhibits an IS. Motivated by the divergence of the conserved energy in the cloud of strings (CS) model, we introduce an energy density profile based on the screening of the CS energy density within an FS framework, yielding a finite conserved energy. On the other hand, it has been proposed \\cite{Ovalle:2024wtv} that an interior region, rather than a pointlike mass, can generate a Schwarzschild BH exterior region. Secondly, motivated by the variety of BH solutions with singularities in the literature, we establish the conditions that an interior region with an IS must satisfy to represent a generic exterior BH solution, with Schwarzschild being only a particular case of the latter. We derive the junction conditions (JC) between the interior and exterior regions, showing that they lead to temperature continuity at the interface, while discontinuities in tangential pressure lead to phase transitions. We propose that the nature of the interior region is described by CS and FS, while the exterior corresponds to Reissner Nordström."

Moreover, existing adaptive methods often rely on instance-level metrics, such as task pass rates, failing to capture the model's dynamic learning state. To address these limitations, we propose CoBA-RL, a reinforcement learning algorithm designed to adaptively allocate rollout budgets based on the model's evolving capability. Specifically, CoBA-RL utilizes a Capability-Oriented Value function to map tasks to their potential training gains and employs a heap-based greedy strategy to efficiently self-calibrate the distribution of computational resources to samples with high training value. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach effectively orchestrates the trade-off between exploration and exploitation, delivering consistent generalization improvements across multiple challenging benchmarks. These findings underscore that quantifying sample training value and optimizing budget allocation are pivotal for advancing LLM post-training efficiency."

We herein propose the Kolmogorov-Arnold Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (KANFIS), a compact neuro-symbolic architecture that unifies fuzzy reasoning with additive function decomposition. KANFIS employs an additive aggregation mechanism, under which both model parameters and rule complexity scale linearly with input dimensionality rather than exponentially. Furthermore, KANFIS is compatible with both Type-1 (T1) and Interval Type-2 (IT2) fuzzy logic systems, enabling explicit modeling of uncertainty and ambiguity in fuzzy representations. By using sparse masking mechanisms, KANFIS generates compact and structured rule sets, resulting in an intrinsically interpretable model with clear rule semantics and transparent inference processes. Empirical results demonstrate that KANFIS achieves competitive performance against representative neural and neuro-fuzzy baselines."

    "abstract": "We investigated how Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) prompt emission measurements are affected by increasing distance to the source. We selected a sample of 26 bright GRBs with measured redshifts $z<1$ observed by the Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) on board the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory (Swift) and simulated what BAT would have observed if the GRBs were at larger redshifts. We measured the durations of the simulated gamma-ray signals using a Bayesian block approach and calculated the enclosed fluences and peak fluxes. As expected, we found that almost all durations (fluences) measured for simulated high-$z$ GRBs were shorter (less) than their true durations (energies) due to low signal-to-noise ratio emission becoming completely dominated by background, i.e., the ``tip-of-the-iceberg'' effect. This effect strongly depends on the profile and intensity of the source light curve. Due to the uniqueness of GRB light curves, there is no common behavior in the evolution of measured durations with redshift. We compared our synthetic high-$z$ (i.e., $z>3$) GRBs to a sample of 72 observed high-$z$ bursts and found that the two samples were not inconsistent with being drawn from the same underlying population. We conclude that: (i) prompt emission durations (fluences) of high-$z$ GRBs observed by Swift/BAT are most likely underestimations, sometimes by factors of $\\sim$several tens ($\\sim2$), and (ii) changes in the average GRB prompt emission duration and fluence with increasing redshift are consistent with the tip-of-the-iceberg effect."

    "abstract": "Neural quantum states (NQS) are powerful ansätze in the variational Monte Carlo framework, yet their architectures are often treated as black boxes. We propose a physically transparent framework in which NQS are treated as neural approximations to latent imaginary-time evolution. This viewpoint suggests that standard Transformer-based NQS (TQS) architectures correspond to physically unmotivated effective Hamiltonians dependent on imaginary time in a latent space. Building on this interpretation, we introduce physics-inspired transformer quantum states (PITQS), which enforce a static effective Hamiltonian by sharing weights across layers and improve propagation accuracy via Trotter-Suzuki decompositions without increasing the number of variational parameters. For the frustrated $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg model, our ansätze achieve accuracies comparable to or exceeding state-of-the-art TQS while using substantially fewer variational parameters. This study demonstrates that reinterpreting the deep network structure as a latent cooling process enables a more physically grounded, systematic, and compact design, thereby bridging the gap between black-box expressivity and physically transparent construction."

Distinct from canonical GCFs derived from classical hypergeometric series, the identity at hand features a complex polynomial architecture characterized by quartic partial numerators. Our approach utilizes an algebraic decomposition of the second-order shift operator $\\mathcal{L} = \\mathcal{T}^2 - b_n \\mathcal{T} - a_n$ into a coupled first-order system. This decomposition enables an exact mapping of the higher-order recurrence to a cascaded system, from which the continued fraction is identified as the reciprocal of an Apéry-like summation involving central binomial coefficients. The convergence is established through Pincherle's Theorem, confirming that the numerator sequence constitutes the minimal solution to the associated difference equation. This work provides a systematic operator-theoretic methodology for verifying automated conjectures of transcendental constants with high-degree polynomial coefficients."

We propose Graph of Concept Predictors (GCP), a reasoning-aware active distillation framework that externalizes the teacher's decision process as a directed acyclic graph and mirrors it with modular concept predictors in the student. GCP enhances sample efficiency through a graph-aware acquisition strategy that targets uncertainty and disagreement at critical reasoning nodes. Additionally, it improves training stability and efficiency by performing targeted sub-module retraining, which attributes downstream loss to specific concept predictors and updates only the most influential modules. Experiments on eight NLP classification benchmarks demonstrate that GCP enhances performance under limited annotation budgets while yielding more interpretable and controllable training dynamics.

Recognizing that the minimal two-site approximation often fails to resolve essential spectral features, we investigate the efficacy of VQE for larger bath discretizations while adhering to near-term hardware constraints. We employ a symmetry-adapted ansatz enforcing conservation of particle number $(N)$, spin projection $(S_z=0)$, and total spin $(S^2=0)$ symmetry, benchmarking the performance against exact diagonalization across different interaction strengths using bath parameters extracted from the DMFT self-consistency loop. For a four-site model, the relative error in the ground state energy remains well below $0.01%$ with a compact parameter set $(N_p \\le 30)$. Crucially, we demonstrate that the single-particle Green's function-the central quantity for DMFT-can be accurately extracted from VQE-prepared ground states via real-time evolution in the intermediate to strong interaction regimes. However, in the weak interaction regime, the Green's function exhibits noticeable deviations from the exact benchmark, particularly in resolving low-energy spectral features, despite the ground state energy showing excellent agreement. These findings demonstrate that VQE combined with real-time evolution can effectively extend quantum-classical hybrid DMFT beyond the two-site approximation, particularly for describing insulating phases. While this approach offers a viable pathway for simulating strongly correlated materials on near-term devices, the observation that accurate ground state energy does not guarantee accurate dynamical properties highlights a key challenge for applying such approaches to correlated metals."

This introduces a phenomenon that was not considered in these earlier discussions: the dominant transition from one cosmological state to another can go through a fluctuation that annihilates the universe and creates a new one. We nonetheless argue that the observer decoherence rule allows for the third-quantized description of such a theory to emerge from a factorizing holographic theory with a one-dimensional Hilbert space, without any need for $α$-parameters. We also point out a close analogy between the observer rule in this context and the coarse-graining of the spectral form factor at late times for AdS black holes. Along the way we clarify several aspects of the relationship between holography, the gravitational path integral, and $α$-parameters. We also explain why string theory scattering amplitudes do not lead to a one-dimensional Hilbert space on the worldsheet, despite being computed by a gravitational path integral with a sum over topology. Finally we point out that using the path integral to compute integrated local operators conditioned on an observer in the context of a theory with a landscape can lead to rather surprising conclusions. For example we argue that in a landscape with one AdS minimum and one dS minimum, both of which can support observers, an observer almost surely finds themself in dS and not AdS even if the boundary conditions are dual to a state with an observer in AdS."

However, their development and adoption are hindered by the complexity of low-level RAN control and monitoring message models exposed over the O-RAN E2 interface, limited interoperability across heterogeneous RAN software stacks, and the lack of developer-friendly frameworks. In this paper, we introduce xDevSM, a framework that significantly lowers the barrier to xApp development by unifying observability and control in O-RAN deployment.

In this work we examine a flexible, fixed ordering based on progressive checkerboards for multiscale autoregressive image generation. Our ordering draws samples in parallel from evenly spaced regions at each scale, maintaining full balance in all levels of a quadtree subdivision at each step. This enables effective conditioning both between and within scales. Intriguingly, we find evidence that in our balanced setting, a wide range of scale-up factors lead to similar results, so long as the total number of serial steps is constant.

    "abstract": "In the context of first-passage percolation (FPP), we investigate the statistical properties of the selected link-times (SLTs) -the random link times comprising the optimal paths (or geodesics) connecting two given points. We focus on weakly disordered square lattices, whose geodesics are known to fall under the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class. Our analysis reveals universal power-law decays with the end-to-end distance for both the average and standard deviation of the SLTs, along with an intricate pattern of long-range correlations, whose scaling exponents are directly linked to KPZ universality. Crucially, the SLT distributions for diagonal and axial paths exhibit significant differences, which we trace back to the distinct directed and undirected nature, respectively, of the underlying geodesics. Moreover, we demonstrate that the SLT distribution violates the conditions of the central limit theorem. Instead, SLT sums follow the Tracy-Widom distribution characteristic of the KPZ class, which we associate with evidence for the emergence of high-order long-range correlations in the ensemble."

The ATLAS Monitored Drift Tube (MDT) chambers are the main component of the precision tracking system in the ATLAS muon spectrometer. It is important to understand any potential issues with the MDT Front-End (FE) readout electronics for an expected level-1 (L1) trigger rate of 100 kHz and a complex deadtime of over 5% for Run 3 operations. We use raw data collected in 2022 to emulate the expected hit rates in MDT chambers and perform a realistic simulation on the ATLAS Muon TDC (Time-to-Digital Converter) (AMT) chip with the current configuration. We study the AMT chip performances by analyzing the trigger/L1/readout buffer occupancies and hit loss fractions under different luminosities with L1 rate of 100 kHz by using the Modelsim software. The hit loss fraction of the hottest MDT chamber (BIL3C05) is lower than 5% due to FE readout, even at a luminosity of 5.01 x 10^34 cm-2s-1 with a deadtime of 5% and a L1 rate of 100 kHz, indicating that AMT can operate under Run 3 conditions without problems. The MDT trigger and readout electronics will be replaced for triggerless readout during High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) runs. We also simulate the AMT behavior in the triggerless mode up to 7.44 x 10^34 cm-2s-1 and propose possible AMT configurations in case some FE electronics could not be replaced during the long shutdown 3 (LS3)."

    "abstract": "Dynamical properties are notoriously difficult to compute in numerical treatments of the Fermi-Hubbard model, especially in two spatial dimensions. However, they are essential in providing us with insight into some of the most important and less well-understood phases of the model, such as the pseudogap and strange metal phases at relatively high temperatures, or unconventional superconductivity at lower temperatures, away from the commensurate filling. Here, we use the numerical linked-cluster expansions to compute spin and charge optical conductivities of the model at different temperatures and strong interaction strengths via the exact real-time-dependent correlation functions of the current operators. We mitigate systematic errors associated with having a limited access to the long-time behavior of the correlators by introducing fits and allowing for non-zero Drude weights when appropriate. We compare our results to available data from optical lattice experiments and find that the Drude contributions can account for the theory-experiment gap in the DC spin conductivity of the model at half filling in the strong-coupling region. Our method helps paint a more complete picture of the conductivity in the two-dimensional Hubbard model and opens the door to studying dynamical properties of quantum lattice models in the thermodynamic limit."

Lett. 136, 058201 (2026)], we demonstrate that ideal ultrastable glasses in the athermal limit (or ultrastable ideal 2D disk packings) possess a remarkably high degree of local centrosymmetry. In particular, we find that the inversion-symmetry order parameter for local force transmission introduced in Milkus and Zaccone, [Phys. Rev. 93, 094204 (2016)], is as high as $F_{IS}= 0.93546$, to be compared with $F_{IS}=1$ for perfect centrosymmetric crystals free of defects, and with $F_{IS} \\sim 0.3-0.5$ for standard random packings. This observation provides a clear, natural explanation for the ultra-high shear modulus of ideal packings and ideal glasses, because the high centrosymmetry prevents non-affine relaxations which decrease the shear modulus. The same mechanism explains the absence of boson peak-like soft vibrational modes. These results also confirm what was found previous work, i.e. that the bond-orientational order parameter is a very poor correlator for the vibrational and mechanical"

Open-access AIWP models thus hold promise as transformational tools for helping low- and middle-income populations make decisions in the face of high-impact weather shocks. Yet, current approaches to evaluating AIWP models focus mainly on aggregated meteorological metrics without considering local stakeholders' needs in decision-oriented, operational frameworks. Here, we introduce such a framework that connects meteorology, AI, and social sciences. As an example, we apply it to the 150-year-old problem of Indian monsoon forecasting, focusing on benefits to rain-fed agriculture, which is highly susceptible to climate change. AIWP models skillfully predict an agriculturally relevant onset index at regional scales weeks in advance when evaluated out-of-sample using deterministic and probabilistic metrics. This framework informed a government-led effort in 2025 to send 38 million Indian farmers AI-based monsoon onset forecasts, which captured an unusual weeks-long pause in monsoon progression. This decision-oriented benchmarking framework provides a key component of a blueprint for harnessing the power of AIWP models to help large vulnerable populations adapt to weather shocks in the face of climate variability and change."

    "abstract": "Passive qubit reset is a key primitive for quantum information processing, whereby qubits are initialized by allowing them to relax to their ground state through natural dissipation, without the need for active control or feedback. However, passive reset occurs on timescales that are much longer than those of gate operations and measurements, making it a significant bottleneck for algorithmic execution. Here, we show that this limitation can be overcome by exploiting the Mpemba effect, originally indicating the faster cooling of hot systems compared to cooler ones. Focusing on the regime where coherence times exceed energy relaxation times ($T_2 > T_1$), we propose a simple protocol based on a single entangling two-qubit gate that converts local single-qubit coherences into fast-decaying global two-qubit coherences. This removes their overlap with the slowest decaying Liouvillian mode and enables a substantially faster relaxation to the ground state. For realistic parameters, we find that our protocol can reduce reset times by up to $50\\%$ compared to standard passive reset. We analyze the robustness of the protocol under non-Markovian noise, imperfect coherent control and finite temperature, finding that the accelerated reset persists across a broad range of realistic error sources. Finally, we present an experimental implementation of our protocol on an IQM superconducting quantum processor. Our results demonstrate how Mpemba-like accelerated relaxation can be harnessed as a practical tool for fast and accurate qubit initialization."

    "abstract": "Visually-guided acoustic highlighting seeks to rebalance audio in alignment with the accompanying video, creating a coherent audio-visual experience. While visual saliency and enhancement have been widely studied, acoustic highlighting remains underexplored, often leading to misalignment between visual and auditory focus. Existing approaches use discriminative models, which struggle with the inherent ambiguity in audio remixing, where no natural one-to-one mapping exists between poorly-balanced and well-balanced audio mixes. To address this limitation, we reframe this task as a generative problem and introduce a Conditional Flow Matching (CFM) framework. A key challenge in iterative flow-based generation is that early prediction errors -- in selecting the correct source to enhance -- compound over steps and push trajectories off-manifold. To address this, we introduce a rollout loss that penalizes drift at the final step, encouraging self-correcting trajectories and stabilizing long-range flow integration. We further propose a conditioning module that fuses audio and visual cues before vector field regression, enabling explicit cross-modal source selection. Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations show that our method consistently surpasses the previous state-of-the-art discriminative approach, establishing that visually-guided audio remixing is best addressed through generative modeling."

Accurately describing this process requires fully nonadiabatic electron-lattice dynamics, which is computationally demanding due to the need to resolve fast electronic motion over long time scales. By analyzing the structure of the lattice force during nonequilibrium evolution, we show that the force naturally separates into a smooth quasi-adiabatic component and a residual bath-like contribution associated with fast electronic fluctuations. The quasi-adiabatic component depends only on the instantaneous local lattice configuration and can be efficiently learned using machine-learning techniques, while a minimal Langevin description of the bath term captures the essential features of the recovery dynamics. Combining these elements enables efficient and scalable simulations of long-time nonequilibrium dynamics on large lattices, providing a practical route to access driven correlated systems beyond the reach of direct nonadiabatic approaches."

Among available resins, the newly developed IPX Clear is particularly well suited for visible applications, offering high transmission across the visible-near-IR, low surface roughness, and excellent shape fidelity. However, Fresnel reflections at the air-polymer interface introduce significant optical losses, which are detrimental in low-signal astronomy. Previous studies show grass-like alumina coatings on glass and fused silica can raise average transmission from 91.9% to approximately 99% over 400-900 nm. Here we explore the feasibility of Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) to apply such coatings to IPX-Clear micro-optics over 400-1700 nm. Grass-like alumina anti-reflective (AR) coatings can approximate the ideal index condition by creating a gradual refractive-index transition from air to bulk IPX Clear, suppressing surface reflections. While grass-like coatings are established on bulk optics and conformal ALD films have been applied to 2PP micro-optics, we demonstrate - for the first time - alumina grass on 2PP microlenses made with the new IPX-Clear resin. We discuss key challenges and process steps, and observe that alumina-grass-coated microlenses lose only approximately 0.3% of photons to reflection in the 400-850 nm range. Future work will test performance across the full 400-1700 nm band and explore improved environmental resilience, e.g., a SiO2 overcoat. Combined with the high optical transparency of IPX Clear, these coatings enable custom-designed, highly efficient microlenses for astronomical applications."

However, the technique is often limited by factors such as long acquisition times and radiation damage. We present two measurement strategies that allow for significantly shorter experiment times and total doses applied. The strategies are based on taking only a small subset of all the measurements (e.g. sparse acquisition or subsampling), and then computationally reconstructing all unobserved measurements using mathematical techniques. The methods are data-driven, using spectral and spatial importance subsampling distributions to identify important measurements. As a result, taking as little as 4-6\\% of the measurements is sufficient to capture the same information as in a conventional scan."

A key driver of the system's behaviour is the form of the interaction function, which determines the strength of interactions based on the distance between individuals' opinions and appears in both opinion and network dynamics. Two cases are examined: in the first the interaction function is always positive and in the second case the interaction function is of bounded-confidence type. In both cases there is positive feedback between opinion clustering and the emergence of community structure in the social network. This is confirmed through analytical results on long-term behaviour, extending existing results for a fixed network, as well as through numerical simulations. Transient network dynamics are also examined through a short-time approximation that captures the `typical' early network dynamics. Each approach improves some aspect of our understanding of the interplay between opinion and network evolution."

Indirect microwave resonator-mediated measurements provide an attractive alternative, though a full analysis of relevant sources of measurement noise is lacking. In this work we study dispersive readout of an inhomogeneously broadened spin ensemble via coupling to a driven resonator measured via homodyne detection. We derive generic analytic conditions for when the homodyne measurement can be limited by the fundamental spin-projection noise, as opposed to microwave-drive shot noise or resonator phase noise. By studying fluctuations of the measurement record in detail, we also propose an experimental protocol for directly detecting spin squeezing, i.e. a reduction of the spin ensemble's intrinsic projection noise from entanglement. Our protocol provides a method for benchmarking entangled states for quantum-enhanced metrology."

For such cases, the classical Monte Carlo integration procedure provides the state-of-the-art provable, asymptotic performance: polynomial in problem dimension and quadratic in inverse-precision. While quantum algorithms are known to offer quadratic speedups over classical Monte Carlo methods, end-to-end speedups have been proven only in the simplified setting over the Black-Scholes geometric Brownian motion (GBM) model. This paper extends existing frameworks to demonstrate novel quadratic speedups for more practical models, such as the Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR) model and a variant of Heston's stochastic volatility model, utilizing a characteristic of the underlying SDEs which we term fast-forwardability. Additionally, for general models that do not possess the fast-forwardable property, we introduce a quantum Milstein sampler, based on a novel quantum algorithm for sampling Lévy areas, which enables quantum multi-level Monte Carlo to achieve quadratic speedups for multi-dimensional stochastic processes exhibiting certain correlation types. We also present an improved analysis of numerical integration for derivative pricing, leading to substantial reductions in the resource requirements for pricing GBM and CIR models. Furthermore, we investigate the potential for additional reductions using arithmetic-free quantum procedures. Finally, we critique quantum partial differential equation (PDE) solvers as a method for derivative pricing based on amplitude estimation, identifying theoretical barriers that obstruct achieving a quantum speedup through this approach. Our findings significantly advance the understanding of quantum algorithms in derivative pricing, addressing key challenges and open questions in the field."

To address this gap, we introduce ReQUESTA, a hybrid, multi-agent framework for generating cognitively diverse MCQs that systematically target text-based, inferential, and main idea comprehension. ReQUESTA decomposes MCQ authoring into specialized subtasks and coordinates LLM-powered agents with rule-based components to support planning, controlled generation, iterative evaluation, and post-processing. We evaluated the framework in a large-scale reading comprehension study using academic expository texts, comparing ReQUESTA-generated MCQs with those produced by a single-pass GPT-5 zero-shot baseline. Psychometric analyses of learner responses assessed item difficulty and discrimination, while expert raters evaluated question quality across multiple dimensions, including topic relevance and distractor quality. Results showed that ReQUESTA-generated items were consistently more challenging, more discriminative, and more strongly aligned with overall reading comprehension performance. Expert evaluations further indicated stronger alignment with central concepts and superior distractor linguistic consistency and semantic plausibility, particularly for inferential questions. These findings demonstrate that hybrid, agentic orchestration can systematically improve the reliability and controllability of LLM-based generation, highlighting workflow design as a key lever for structured artifact generation beyond single-pass prompting."

    "abstract": "Tabular machine learning systems are frequently trained on data affected by non-uniform corruption, including noisy measurements, missing entries, and feature-specific biases. In practice, these defects are often documented only through column-level reliability indicators rather than instance-wise quality annotations, limiting the applicability of many robustness and cleaning techniques. We present QuAIL, a quality-informed training mechanism that incorporates feature reliability priors directly into the learning process. QuAIL augments existing models with a learnable feature-modulation layer whose updates are selectively constrained by a quality-dependent proximal regularizer, thereby inducing controlled adaptation across features of varying trustworthiness. This stabilizes optimization under structured corruption without explicit data repair or sample-level reweighting. Empirical evaluation across 50 classification and regression datasets demonstrates that QuAIL consistently improves average performance over neural baselines under both random and value-dependent corruption, with especially robust behavior in low-data and systematically biased settings. These results suggest that incorporating feature reliability information directly into optimization dynamics is a practical and effective approach for resilient tabular learning."

    "abstract": "The study of decimal numbers in secondary education is often approached from algorithmic perspectives, which limits students' understanding of their structure. This paper presents the task Footprints of the Walking of Numbers, a dynamic visualization proposal aimed at supporting the understanding of decimal numbers through the exploration of their infinite decimal expansions. The task is based on assigning vectors to the decimal digits from 0 to 9, so that the sequence of digits of a number generates a dynamic geometric path in the plane. Through the use of GeoGebra as a visualization environment, students can observe, compare, and interpret traces associated with different types of numbers, such as terminating decimals, repeating decimals, and irrational numbers, identifying visual regularities linked to their decimal behavior. The analysis is developed from a theoretical-didactical perspective, using the Mathematical Working Space as an interpretative lens to characterize the potential of the task design. In addition, the paper discusses the punctual use of generative AI tools exclusively as instrumental support for computation, without shifting the focus away from mathematical reasoning."

    "abstract": "Lane detection is a crucial perception task for all levels of automated vehicles (AVs) and Advanced Driver Assistance Systems, particularly in mixed-traffic environments where AVs must interact with human-driven vehicles (HDVs) and challenging traffic scenarios. Current methods lack versatility in delivering accurate, robust, and real-time compatible lane detection, especially vision-based methods often neglect critical regions of the image and their spatial-temporal (ST) salience, leading to poor performance in difficult circumstances such as serious occlusion and dazzle lighting. This study introduces a novel sequential neural network model with a spatial-temporal attention mechanism to focus on key features of lane lines and exploit salient ST correlations among continuous image frames. The proposed model, built on a standard encoder-decoder structure and common neural network backbones, is trained and evaluated on three large-scale open-source datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate the strength and robustness of the proposed model, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in various testing scenarios. Furthermore, with the ST attention mechanism, the developed sequential neural network models exhibit fewer parameters and reduced Multiply-Accumulate Operations (MACs) compared to baseline sequential models, highlighting their computational efficiency.

On Bridge V2, MVP-LAM produces more action-centric latent actions, achieving higher mutual information with ground-truth actions and improved action prediction, including under out-of-distribution evaluation. Finally, pretraining VLAs with MVP-LAM latent actions improves downstream manipulation performance on the SIMPLER and LIBERO-Long benchmarks."

Atmospheric escape of a close-in planet's atmosphere plays a role in its evolutionary pathway, but to which extent remains unknown. It could explain demographic features like the radius valley and Neptunian desert. We will describe the development of instrumental, reduction, and modelling techniques to study exoplanetary atmospheric escape, focusing on the helium triplet. One such development is the NIGHT spectrograph, intended to provide the first survey of escaping atmospheres. NIGHT spectra will be processed with ANTARESS, a state-of-the-art workflow for reducing high-resolution spectral time-series of exoplanet transits and computing transmission spectra in a robust and reproducible way. Transmission spectra contain the potential signature of the planetary atmosphere as well as distortions induced by the occultation of local regions of the stellar surface along the transit chord. Transmission spectra cannot be corrected for those stellar distortions without biasing the planetary signal. They must instead be directly interpreted using a numerical model like the EvE code, which generates realistic stellar spectra that account for the system's 3D architecture, the planet's atmospheric structure, and its local occultation of the stellar disc. This global approach, from the measurement and computation of transmission spectra to their interpretation, will be a legacy of the NCCR PlanetS, becoming the standard procedure to study high-resolution spectroscopy of planetary transits."

    "abstract": "Hardware Trojans (HTs) threaten the trust and reliability of integrated circuits (ICs), particularly when triggered HTs remain dormant during standard testing and activate only under rare conditions. Existing electromagnetic (EM) side-channel-based detection techniques often rely on golden references or labeled data, which are infeasible in modern distributed manufacturing. This paper introduces a reference-free, design-agnostic framework for detecting triggered HTs directly from post-silicon EM emissions. The proposed flow converts each EM trace into a time-frequency scalogram using Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT), extracts discriminative features through a convolutional neural network (CNN), reduces dimensionality with principal component analysis (PCA), and applies Bayesian Gaussian Mixture Modeling (BGMM) for unsupervised probabilistic clustering. The framework quantifies detection confidence using posterior-based metrics (alpha_{post}, beta_{post}), Bayesian information criterion (Delta BIC), and Mahalanobis cluster separation (D), enabling interpretable anomaly decisions without golden data. Experimental validation on AES-128 designs embedded with four different HTs demonstrates high separability between HT-free and HT-activated conditions and robustness to PCA variance thresholds. The results highlight the method's scalability, statistical interpretability, and potential for extension to runtime and in-field HT monitoring in trusted microelectronics."

In this paper we explore a higher-dimensional analogue of this theory, formulated with respect to the higher Auslander-Reiten translation $τ_d$. In particular, we associate to any functorially finite $d$-torsion class a maximal $τ_d$-rigid pair and a $(d+1)$-term silting complex. In the case $d=1$, the notions of maximal $τ_d$-rigid and support $τ$-tilting pairs coincide, and our theory recovers the classical bijections. However, the proof strategies for $d>1$ differ significantly. As an intermediate step, we prove that a $d$-cluster tilting subcategory of a module category induces a $d$-cluster tilting subcategory of the category of $(d+1)$-term complexes, producing novel examples of $d$-exact categories. We introduce the notion of a $d$-torsion class in the exact setup, and use this to obtain the aforementioned $(d+1)$-term silting complex. We moreover apply our theory to study $d$-APR tilting modules and slices. To illustrate our results, we provide explicit combinatorial descriptions of maximal $τ_d$-rigid pairs and $(d+1)$-term silting complexes for higher Auslander and higher Nakayama algebras."

The population of such binaries remains elusive, with $\\lesssim5$ candidate or confirmed systems. The Tarantula nebula harbors thousands of massive stars, 2-3 % of which are expected to have BH companions. It is therefore an ideal place to hunt for such systems. Here we analyse 30 epochs of VLT/FLAMES IFU high-resolution observations of the H$δ$ region, as well as archival FLAMES spectroscopy, of VFTS 812, a 17-day single-lined spectroscopic binary with an O4V primary and a minimum secondary mass of $5.1\\,M_\\odot$. Following careful removal of the nebular contamination, spectral disentangling on the new data did not reveal any signature of the hidden companion.

Using injection tests of various luminous artificial companions in our data, we exhaustively rule out the presence of any luminous signature from a main sequence star more massive than $6\\,M_\\odot$. We discuss the possible nature of the companion, suggesting that the rejuvenated O star + BH companion is the most suitable scenario to consistently explain the location, (rejuvenated) young age, eccentricity and lack of companion signature. While this establishes VFTS 812 as a strong candidate O+BH system, follow-up observations are deemed necessary for robust confirmation and to search for accretion signatures on the O4V star."

    "abstract": "Information retrieval has long focused on ranking documents by semantic relatedness. Yet many real-world information needs demand more: enforcement of logical constraints, multi-step inference, and synthesis of multiple pieces of evidence. Addressing these requirements is, at its core, a problem of reasoning. Across AI communities, researchers are developing diverse solutions for the problem of reasoning, from inference-time strategies and post-training of LLMs, to neuro-symbolic systems, Bayesian and probabilistic frameworks, geometric representations, and energy-based models. These efforts target the same problem: to move beyond pattern-matching systems toward structured, verifiable inference. However, they remain scattered across disciplines, making it difficult for IR researchers to identify the most relevant ideas and opportunities. To help navigate the fragmented landscape of research in reasoning, this tutorial first articulates a working definition of reasoning within the context of information retrieval and derives from it a unified analytical framework. The framework maps existing approaches along axes that reflect the core components of the definition. By providing a comprehensive overview of recent approaches and mapping current methods onto the defined axes, we expose their trade-offs and complementarities, highlight where IR can benefit from cross-disciplinary advances, and illustrate how retrieval process itself can play a central role in broader reasoning systems. The tutorial will equip participants with both a conceptual framework and practical guidance for enhancing reasoning-capable IR systems, while situating IR as a domain that both benefits and contributes to the broader development of reasoning methodologies."

The balance function is a differential observable of opposite-charge correlations, which is calculated in the jet frame for inclusive charged hadrons and the identified $π$, $K$, and $p$. The results show a clear narrowing of the balancing width with increasing jet charged multiplicity, indicating that particle production becomes more localized in momentum space in high-multiplicity jets.This trend resembles features attributed to collective expansion in heavy-ion collisions. The species dependence highlights sensitivity to the redistribution of strangeness and baryon number during string fragmentation and color reconnection. The new CR tune yields a little broader proton balance-function width in $Δφ^{*}$ than CP5, hinting at enhanced baryon-production dynamics, whereas meson widths differ only mildly. These comparisons suggest that multiparton interactions and color reconnection contribute to the observed trends, potentially generating collective like features inside jets, especially in high multiplicity jets, via nontrivial color dynamics alongside standard fragmentation. Taken together, the results establish identified hadron balance functions in high multiplicity jets as a sensitive probe of hadronization and provide new constraints for models of small system collectivity."

Translation quality is validated on a sample size determined by the Central Limit Theorem to ensure 95% confidence, achieving 98.15% accuracy on human-evaluated samples. Using BIRDTurk, we evaluate inference-based prompting, agentic multi-stage reasoning, and supervised fine-tuning. Our results reveal that Turkish introduces consistent performance degradation, driven by both structural linguistic divergence and underrepresentation in LLM pretraining, while agentic reasoning demonstrates stronger cross-lingual robustness. Supervised fine-tuning remains challenging for standard multilingual baselines but scales effectively with modern instruction-tuned models. BIRDTurk provides a controlled testbed for cross-lingual Text-to-SQL evaluation under realistic database conditions. We release the training and development splits to support future research."

With the aid of matrix inversion derivations, we can construct the conventional MMSE combining from the perspective of each AP, where global instantaneous information is involved. Then, for an arbitrary AP, we apply the statistics approximation methodology to approximate instantaneous terms related to other APs by channel statistics to construct the distributed combining scheme at each AP with local instantaneous information and global statistics. With the aid of uplink-downlink duality, we derive the respective GSLI-MMSE precoding schemes.

Thomson scattering measurements reveal electron temperatures and densities that decay with distance from the target.

Correlating the results of these laser diagnostics with spatially resolved EUV spectroscopy suggests that the bulk of useful EUV emission originates within 150 $μ$m of the target and is generated under suboptimal plasma conditions.

We study how mismatches between externally presented tool descriptions and underlying implementations systematically shape the mental models and decision-making behavior of intelligent agents. Specifically, we present the first large-scale study of description-code inconsistency in the MCP ecosystem. We design an automated static analysis framework and apply it to 10,240 real-world MCP Servers across 36 categories. Our results show that while most servers are highly consistent, approximately 13% exhibit substantial mismatches that can enable undocumented privileged operations, hidden state mutations, or unauthorized financial actions. We further observe systematic differences across application categories, popularity levels, and MCP marketplaces. Our findings demonstrate that description-code inconsistency is a concrete and prevalent attack surface in MCP-based AI agents, and motivate the need for systematic auditing and stronger transparency guarantees in future agent ecosystems."

    "abstract": "Magnons are the low-energy excitations of magnetically ordered materials. While the magnetic moment of a ferromagnet aligns with an applied magnetic field, it has been experimentally shown that the magnetic order can be inverted by injecting spin current into the magnet. This results in an energetically unstable but dynamically stabilized state where the magnetic moment aligns antiparallel to an applied magnetic field, called the inverted magnetic state. The excitations on top of such a state have negative energy and are called antimagnons. The inverted state is subject to fluctuations, in particular, as shot noise in the spin current, which are different from fluctuations in equilibrium, especially at low temperatures. Here, we theoretically study the fluctuations of the inverted magnetic state and their signatures in experimental setups. We find that the fluctuations from the injection of spin current play a large role. In the quantum regime, the inverted magnetic state exhibits larger fluctuations compared to the equilibrium position, which can be probed using a qubit. Our results advance the understanding of the fundamental properties of antimagnons and their experimental controllability, and they pave the way for applications in spintronics and magnonics, such as spin wave amplification and entanglement."

    "abstract": "Although significant progress has been made in decision-making for automated driving, challenges remain for deployment in the real world. One challenge lies in addressing interaction-awareness. Most existing approaches oversimplify interactions between the ego vehicle and surrounding agents, and often neglect interactions among the agents themselves. A common solution is to model these interactions using classical game theory. However, its formulation assumes rational players, whereas human behavior is frequently uncertain or irrational. To address these challenges, we propose the Quantum Game Decision-Making (QGDM) model, a novel framework that combines classical game theory with quantum mechanics principles (such as superposition, entanglement, and interference) to tackle multi-player, multi-strategy decision-making problems. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first studies to apply quantum game theory to decision-making for automated driving. QGDM runs in real time on a standard computer, without requiring quantum hardware. We evaluate QGDM in simulation across various scenarios, including roundabouts, merging, and highways, and compare its performance with multiple baseline methods. Results show that QGDM significantly improves success rates and reduces collision rates compared to classical approaches, particularly in scenarios with high interaction."

    "abstract": "Audio-visual joint representation learning under Cross-Modal Generalization (CMG) aims to transfer knowledge from a labeled source modality to an unlabeled target modality through a unified discrete representation space. Existing symmetric frameworks often suffer from information allocation ambiguity, where the absence of structural inductive bias leads to semantic-specific leakage across modalities. We propose Asymmetric Hierarchical Anchoring (AHA), which enforces directional information allocation by designating a structured semantic anchor within a shared hierarchy. In our instantiation, we exploit the hierarchical discrete representations induced by audio Residual Vector Quantization (RVQ) to guide video feature distillation into a shared semantic space. To ensure representational purity, we replace fragile mutual information estimators with a GRL-based adversarial decoupler that explicitly suppresses semantic leakage in modality-specific branches, and introduce Local Sliding Alignment (LSA) to encourage fine-grained temporal alignment across modalities. Extensive experiments on AVE and AVVP benchmarks demonstrate that AHA consistently outperforms symmetric baselines in cross-modal transfer. Additional analyses on talking-face disentanglement experiment further validate that the learned representations exhibit improved semantic consistency and disentanglement, indicating the broader applicability of the proposed framework."

    "abstract": "World models offer a principled framework for simulating future states under interventions, but realizing such models in complex, high-stakes domains like medicine remains challenging. Recent large language models (LLMs) have achieved strong performance on static medical reasoning tasks, raising the question of whether they can function as dynamic medical world models capable of simulating disease progression and treatment outcomes over time. In this work, we show that LLMs only incorporating medical knowledge struggle to maintain consistent patient states under sequential interventions, leading to error accumulation in long-horizon clinical simulation. To address this limitation, we introduce EHRWorld, a patient-centric medical world model trained under a causal sequential paradigm, together with EHRWorld-110K, a large-scale longitudinal clinical dataset derived from real-world electronic health records. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that EHRWorld significantly outperforms naive LLM-based baselines, achieving more stable long-horizon simulation, improved modeling of clinically sensitive events, and favorable reasoning efficiency, highlighting the necessity of training on causally grounded, temporally evolving clinical data for reliable and robust medical world modeling."

    "abstract": "Time series forecasting can be viewed as a generative problem that requires both semantic understanding over contextual conditions and stochastic modeling of continuous temporal dynamics. Existing approaches typically rely on either autoregressive large language models (LLMs) for semantic context modeling or diffusion-like models for continuous probabilistic generation. However, neither method alone can adequately model both aspects simultaneously. In this work, we propose CoGenCast, a hybrid generative framework that couples pre-trained LLMs with flow-matching mechanism for effective time series forecasting. Specifically, we reconfigure pre-trained decoder-only LLMs into a native forecasting encoder-decoder backbone by modifying only the attention topology, enabling bidirectional context encoding and causal representation generation. Building on this, a flow-matching mechanism is further integrated to model temporal evolution, capturing continuous stochastic dynamics conditioned on the autoregressively generated representation. Notably, CoGenCast naturally supports multimodal forecasting and cross-domain unified training. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show that CoGenCast consistently outperforms previous compared baselines. Code is available at https://github.com/liuyaguo/_CoGenCast."

    "abstract": "Despite major advances in multilingual modeling, large quality disparities persist across languages. Besides the obvious impact of uneven training resources, typological properties have also been proposed to determine the intrinsic difficulty of modeling a language. The existing evidence, however, is mostly based on small monolingual language models or bilingual translation models trained from scratch. We expand on this line of work by analyzing two large pre-trained multilingual translation models, NLLB-200 and Tower+, which are state-of-the-art representatives of encoder-decoder and decoder-only machine translation, respectively. Based on a broad set of languages, we find that target language typology drives translation quality of both models, even after controlling for more trivial factors, such as data resourcedness and writing script. Additionally, languages with certain typological properties benefit more from a wider search of the output space, suggesting that such languages could profit from alternative decoding strategies beyond the standard left-to-right beam search. To facilitate further research in this area, we release a set of fine-grained typological properties for 212 languages of the FLORES+ MT evaluation benchmark."

In contrast to the new SFS model, where the expansion is decelerating before reaching the pressure singularity, the FTPR scenario is preceded by a super-accelerated phantom phase. Our claim is based on the thorough study of the energy conditions showing the violations of all of them for a FTPR, and only the dominant energy one for an SFS. Application of the so-called Raychaudhuri averaging shows that, alike within the requirement of geodesic completeness, these singularities are weak in the sense of this definition. We study the properties of the models including the behaviour of the cosmological horizons presented in the appropriate Penrose diagrams."

A key technical ingredient is a new memorization result for deep ReLU networks that enables efficient point fitting with dense architectures. We further introduce a class of compositional models in which each component function is smooth and acts on a domain of low intrinsic dimension. This framework unifies two common assumptions in the statistical learning literature, structural constraints on the target function and low dimensionality of the covariates, within a single model. We show that deep networks can approximate such functions at rates determined by the most difficult function in the composition. As an application, we derive improved convergence rates for empirical risk minimization in nonparametric regression that adapt to smoothness, compositional structure, and intrinsic dimensionality."

    "abstract": "The rapid progress of large multimodal models has inspired efforts toward unified frameworks that couple understanding and generation. While such paradigms have shown remarkable success in 2D, extending them to 3D remains largely underexplored. Existing attempts to unify 3D tasks under a single autoregressive (AR) paradigm lead to significant performance degradation due to forced signal quantization and prohibitive training cost. Our key insight is that the essential challenge lies not in enforcing a unified autoregressive paradigm, but in enabling effective information interaction between generation and understanding while minimally compromising their inherent capabilities and leveraging pretrained models to reduce training cost. Guided by this perspective, we present the first unified framework for 3D understanding and generation that combines autoregression with diffusion. Specifically, we adopt an autoregressive next-token prediction paradigm for 3D understanding, and a continuous diffusion paradigm for 3D generation. A lightweight transformer bridges the feature space of large language models and the conditional space of 3D diffusion models, enabling effective cross-modal information exchange while preserving the priors learned by standalone models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse 3D understanding and generation benchmarks, while also excelling in 3D editing tasks. These results highlight the potential of unified AR+diffusion models as a promising direction for building more general-purpose 3D intelligence."

Existing works mainly work towards two directions: traditional pixel-codec streaming nearly approaches its limit and is hard to step further in compression; the emerging neural-enhanced or generative streaming usually fall short in latency and visual fidelity, hindering their practical deployment. Inspired by the recent success of vision foundation model (VFM), we strive to harness the powerful video understanding and processing capacities of VFM to achieve generalization, high fidelity and loss resilience for real-time video streaming with even higher compression rate. We present the first revolutionized paradigm that enables VFM-based end-to-end generative video streaming towards this goal. Specifically, Morphe employs joint training of visual tokenizers and variable-resolution spatiotemporal optimization under simulated network constraints. Additionally, a robust streaming system is constructed that leverages intelligent packet dropping to resist real-world network perturbations. Extensive evaluation demonstrates that Morphe achieves comparable visual quality while saving 62.5\\% bandwidth compared to H.265, and accomplishes real-time, loss-resilient video delivery in challenging network environments, representing a milestone in VFM-enabled multimedia streaming solutions."

By continuously interacting with the environment, the RL agent autonomously learns a near-optimal mapping between receiver height and beam divergence, thereby eliminating the need for analytical modeling or computationally intensive exhaustive search. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves up to 92% coverage at low receiver heights and maintains robust performance under challenging conditions, enabling scalable, real-time, and energy-efficient beam control for dense VCSEL array deployments in next-generation OWC systems."

    "abstract": "Live streaming has become a cornerstone of today's internet, enabling massive real-time social interactions. However, it faces severe risks arising from sparse, coordinated malicious behaviors among multiple participants, which are often concealed within normal activities and challenging to detect timely and accurately. In this work, we provide a pioneering study on risk assessment in live streaming rooms, characterized by weak supervision where only room-level labels are available. We formulate the task as a Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) problem, treating each room as a bag and defining structured user-timeslot capsules as instances. These capsules represent subsequences of user actions within specific time windows, encapsulating localized behavioral patterns. Based on this formulation, we propose AC-MIL, an Action-aware Capsule MIL framework that models both individual behaviors and group-level coordination patterns. AC-MIL captures multi-granular semantics and behavioral cues through a serial and parallel architecture that jointly encodes temporal dynamics and cross-user dependencies. These signals are integrated for robust room-level risk prediction, while also offering interpretable evidence at the behavior segment level. Extensive experiments on large-scale industrial datasets from Douyin demonstrate that AC-MIL significantly outperforms MIL and sequential baselines, establishing new state-of-the-art performance in room-level risk assessment for live streaming. Moreover, AC-MIL provides capsule-level interpretability, enabling identification of risky behavior segments as actionable evidence for intervention.

Here, we compute ab initio Gibbs free energies for liquid and superionic hcp and bcc Fe-H phases and construct the superionic-liquid phase diagram over pressure-temperature conditions relevant to the Earth's inner core. We find that phase diagrams at different inner-core pressures collapse when temperatures are scaled by the melting temperature of pure iron, indicating that solid-liquid partitioning is controlled primarily by a reduced temperature relative to iron melting and is weakly sensitive to pressure. This scaling relation further reconciles previously reported discrepancies in partition coefficients among theoretical studies and yields good agreement with available experimental data at low pressures. By applying thermochemical constraints, our free-energy results reveal a radial hydrogen gradient within the inner core. These results demonstrate that compositional gradients of superionic hydrogen in the inner core emerge naturally from equilibrium thermodynamics and suggest a general mechanism governing the depth-dependent distribution of light elements within Earth's inner core."

    "abstract": "Large vision-language models such as CLIP struggle with long captions because they align images and texts as undifferentiated wholes. Fine-grained vision-language understanding requires hierarchical semantics capturing both global context and localized details across visual and textual domains. Yet linguistic hierarchies from syntax or semantics rarely match visual organization, and purely visual hierarchies tend to fragment scenes into appearance-driven parts without semantic focus. We propose CAFT (Cross-domain Alignment of Forests and Trees), a hierarchical image-text representation learning framework that aligns global and local semantics across images and long captions without pixel-level supervision. Coupling a fine-to-coarse visual encoder with a hierarchical text transformer, it uses a hierarchical alignment loss that matches whole images with whole captions while biasing region-sentence correspondences, so that coarse semantics are built from fine-grained evidence rather than from aggregation untethered to part-level grounding. Trained on 30M image-text pairs, CAFT achieves state-of-the-art performance on six long-text retrieval benchmarks and exhibits strong scaling behavior. Experiments show that hierarchical cross-domain alignment enables fine-grained, visually grounded image-text representations to emerge without explicit region-level supervision."

The formulation is compatible with both $δf$ and full-$f$ models and employs mixed-variable representations, along with a generalized pullback scheme, to control numerical cancellation in electromagnetic simulations. The method is implemented in the TRIMEG-C1 code and demonstrated using linear and nonlinear electromagnetic simulations of the TCV-X21 configuration.

    "abstract": "Route recommendation systems commonly adopt a multi-stage pipeline involving fine-ranking and re-ranking to produce high-quality ordered recommendations. However, this paradigm faces three critical limitations. First, there is a misalignment between offline training objectives and online metrics. Offline gains do not necessarily translate to online improvements. Actual performance must be validated through A/B testing, which may potentially compromise the user experience. Second, redundancy elimination relies on rigid, handcrafted rules that lack adaptability to the high variance in user intent and the unstructured complexity of real-world scenarios. Third, the strict separation between fine-ranking and re-ranking stages leads to sub-optimal performance. Since each module is optimized in isolation, the fine-ranking stage remains oblivious to the list-level objectives (e.g., diversity) targeted by the re-ranker, thereby preventing the system from achieving a jointly optimized global optimum. To overcome these intertwined challenges, we propose \\textbf{SCASRec} (\\textbf{S}elf-\\textbf{C}orrecting and \\textbf{A}uto-\\textbf{S}topping \\textbf{Rec}ommendation), a unified generative framework that integrates ranking and redundancy elimination into a single end-to-end process. SCASRec introduces a stepwise corrective reward (SCR) to guide list-wise refinement by focusing on hard samples, and employs a learnable End-of-Recommendation (EOR) token to terminate generation adaptively when no further improvement is expected. Experiments on two large-scale, open-sourced route recommendation datasets demonstrate that SCASRec establishes an SOTA in offline and online settings. SCASRec has been fully deployed in a real-world navigation app, demonstrating its effectiveness."

This limit defines a new class of quantum Brownian motion, which incorporates both the external and internal degrees of freedom of the Brownian particle. We consider a weakly driven Brownian particle confined in a harmonic potential and dissipatively coupled to a thermal bath. Applying the rotating wave approximation (RWA) to the system-bath interaction Hamiltonian, we derive a completely positive Born-Markov master equation for the reduced dynamics. We express the resulting master equation in the coordinate representation and, utilizing the adiabatic elimination of fast variables, derive a completely positive hybrid quantum-classical master equation that defines OQBM. We illustrate the resulting dynamics using examples of initial Gaussian and non-Gaussian distributions of the OQBM walker. Both examples reveal the emergence of Gaussian distributions in the limiting behavior of the OQBM dynamics, which closely matches that of the standard OQBM. With the help of the obtained OQBM master equation, we derive the equations for the $n$-th moments and the cumulants of the position distribution of the open Brownian walker. We subsequently solve these equations numerically for Gaussian initial distributions across various parameter regimes. Notably, we find that the third-order cumulant is nonzero, indicating that the dynamics' intrinsic generator is non-Gaussian."

These subsets are selected to reflect different prior cause distributions, while preserving the effect-cause conditional relationships. Using this invariance test and exploiting an (empirical) sparsity of most causal graphs, we develop an algorithm that efficiently uncovers causal relationships with quadratic complexity in the number of observational variables, reducing the processing time by up to 25x compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Prior acceleration methods either sparsify the attention map with structured patterns or permanently evict tokens at specific layers, which can retain irrelevant tokens or rely on irreversible early decisions despite the layer-/head-wise dynamics of token importance. In this paper, we propose Token Sparse Attention, a lightweight and dynamic token-level sparsification mechanism that compresses per-head $Q$, $K$, $V$ to a reduced token set during attention and then decompresses the output back to the original sequence, enabling token information to be reconsidered in subsequent layers. Furthermore, Token Sparse Attention exposes a new design point at the intersection of token selection and sparse attention. Our approach is fully compatible with dense attention implementations, including Flash Attention, and can be seamlessly composed with existing sparse attention kernels. Experimental results show that Token Sparse Attention consistently improves accuracy-latency trade-off, achieving up to $\\times$3.23 attention speedup at 128K context with less than 1% accuracy degradation. These results demonstrate that dynamic and interleaved token-level sparsification is a complementary and effective strategy for scalable long-context inference."

Thus, they provide an ambiguous signal about the quality of the code and interfere with the automated assessment of code changes. While a variety of factors can cause test flakiness, approaches to fix flaky tests are typically tailored to address specific causes. However, the prevalent root causes of flaky tests can vary depending on the programming language, application domain, or size of the software project. Since manually labeling flaky tests is time-consuming and tedious, this work proposes an LLMs-as-annotators approach that leverages intra- and inter-model consistency to label issue reports related to fixed flakiness issues with the relevant root cause category. This allows us to gain an overview of prevalent flakiness categories in the issue reports. We evaluated our labeling approach in the context of SAP HANA, a large industrial database management system. Our results suggest that SAP HANA's tests most commonly suffer from issues related to concurrency (23%, 130 of 559 analyzed issue reports).

    "abstract": "Light-matter interaction plays a crucial role in modifying the properties of quantum materials. In this work, we investigate the effect of cavity induced photon fields on a topological superconductor hosting Majorana bound states (MBS). We model the system using a Peierls substitution of the photonic operator in the kinetic and spin-orbit terms, and utilize an exact diagonalization of Hamiltonian for a finite number of photons to investigate the coupled system. We find that the MBS persist even in the presence of a cavity field and notably appear at finite and tunable energy, in contrast to a usual 1D topological superconductor. The MBS energy is shifted by two processes: the cavity photon energy adds a constant energy shift, while the light-matter interaction induces additional parameter dependencies, such that the MBS experience a pseudo-dispersion as a function of both light-matter interaction and magnetic field. Additionally, we find that the MBS energy oscillations are suppressed with increasing light-matter interaction and that disorder stability is not impacted by the light-matter interaction. Combined, these offer additional tunability and stability of the MBS. As a second result, we establish a modified spectral localizer formalism as an essential tool for topological characterization of quantum matter in a cavity. The spectral localizer allows characterization at arbitrary energies, which is needed for probing different photon sectors. However, hybridization between different photon sectors in the low-frequency regime limits a straightforward application of a standard spectral localizer. We fully resolve this issue by judiciously applying an energy shift to the spectral localizer. Our work thus introduces a new avenue for controlling MBS via light-matter coupling and provides a framework for exploring cavity-modified topologies."

    "abstract": "Augmented Reality (AR) offers promising opportunities to enhance learning, but its mechanisms and effects are not yet fully understood. As learning becomes increasingly personalized, considering individual learner characteristics becomes more important. This study investigates the moderating effect of spatial ability on learning experience with AR in the context of robot programming. A between-subjects experiment ($N=71$) compared conventional robot programming to an AR-assisted approach using a head-mounted display. Participants' spatial ability was assessed using the Mental Rotation Test. The learning experience was measured through the System Usability Scale (SUS) and cognitive load. The results indicate that AR support does not significantly improve the learning experience compared to the conventional approach. However, AR appears to have a compensatory effect on the influence of spatial ability. In the control group, spatial ability was significantly positively associated with SUS scores and negatively associated with extraneous cognitive load, indicating that higher spatial ability predicts a better learning experience. In the AR condition, these relationships were not observable, suggesting that AR mitigated the disadvantage typically experienced by learners with lower spatial abilities. These findings suggest that AR can serve a compensatory function by reducing the influence of learner characteristics. Future research should further explore this compensatory role of AR to guide the design of personalized learning environments that address diverse learner needs and reduce barriers for learners with varying cognitive profiles."

We provide convergence guaranties by embedding our method in a multilevel optimization framework. Furthermore, we empirically show that our algorithm can produce highly sparse and accurate models on standard benchmarks. We also show that the theoretical number of FLOPs compared to SGD training can be reduced from 38% for standard Bregman iterations to 6% for our method while maintaining test accuracy."

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) often produce overconfident out-of-distribution predictions, motivating Bayesian uncertainty quantification. The Linearized Laplace Approximation (LLA) achieves this by linearizing the DNN and applying Laplace inference to the resulting model. Importantly, the linear model is also used for prediction. We argue this linearization in the posterior may degrade fidelity to the true Laplace approximation. To alleviate this problem, without increasing significantly the computational cost, we propose the Quadratic Laplace Approximation (QLA). QLA approximates each second order factor in the approximate Laplace log-posterior using a rank-one factor obtained via efficient power iterations. QLA is expected to yield a posterior precision closer to that of the full Laplace without forming the full Hessian, which is typically intractable. For prediction, QLA also uses the linearized model. Empirically, QLA yields modest yet consistent uncertainty estimation improvements over LLA on five regression datasets."

This is especially pronounced in medical image analysis, where data is often scarce and covariate shifts arise from different hardware devices, imaging protocols, and heterogeneous patient populations. These factors collectively hinder reliable performance and slow down clinical adoption. Despite recent progress, existing learning paradigms primarily rely on the Euclidean manifold, whose flat geometry fails to capture the complex, hierarchical structures present in clinical data. In this work, we exploit the advantages of hyperbolic manifolds to model complex data characteristics. We present the first comprehensive validation of hyperbolic representation learning for medical image analysis and demonstrate statistically significant gains across eleven in-distribution datasets and three ViT models. We further propose an unsupervised, domain-invariant hyperbolic cross-branch consistency constraint. Extensive experiments confirm that our proposed method promotes domain-invariant features and outperforms state-of-the-art Euclidean methods by an average of $+2.1\\%$ AUC on three domain generalization benchmarks: Fitzpatrick17k, Camelyon17-WILDS, and a cross-dataset setup for retinal imaging. These datasets span different imaging modalities, data sizes, and label granularities, confirming generalization capabilities across substantially different conditions.

This theoretical advance provides a rigorous foundation for robust pricing and hedging of complex, path-dependent financial derivatives. To support our analysis, we present numerical experiments that demonstrate the practical solvability of large-scale discrete MOT problems using the state-of-the-art primal-dual linear programming (PDLP) algorithm. In particular, we solve multi-dimensional (or vectorial) MOT instances arising from the robust pricing of worst-of autocallable options, confirming the accuracy and feasibility of our theoretical results.

    "abstract": "Machine unlearning, the ability to erase the effect of specific training samples without retraining from scratch, is critical for privacy, regulation, and efficiency. However, most progress in unlearning has been empirical, with little theoretical understanding of when and why unlearning works. We tackle this gap by framing unlearning through the lens of asymptotic linear stability to capture the interaction between optimization dynamics and data geometry. The key quantity in our analysis is data coherence which is the cross sample alignment of loss surface directions near the optimum. We decompose coherence along three axes: within the retain set, within the forget set, and between them, and prove tight stability thresholds that separate convergence from divergence. To further link data properties to forgettability, we study a two layer ReLU CNN under a signal plus noise model and show that stronger memorization makes forgetting easier: when the signal to noise ratio (SNR) is lower, cross sample alignment is weaker, reducing coherence and making unlearning easier; conversely, high SNR, highly aligned models resist unlearning. For empirical verification, we show that Hessian tests and CNN heatmaps align closely with the predicted boundary, mapping the stability frontier of gradient based unlearning as a function of batching, mixing, and data/model alignment. Our analysis is grounded in random matrix theory tools and provides the first principled account of the trade offs between memorization, coherence, and unlearning."

Tesseract is a novel Most-Likely-Error (MLE) decoder for QEC that employs the A* search algorithm to explore an exponentially large graph of error hypotheses, achieving high decoding speed and accuracy. This paper presents a systematic approach to optimizing the Tesseract decoder through low-level performance enhancements. Based on extensive profiling, we implemented four targeted optimization strategies, including the replacement of inefficient data structures, reorganization of memory layouts to improve cache hit rates, and the use of hardware-accelerated bit-wise operations. We achieved significant decoding speedups across a wide range of code families and configurations, including Color Codes, Bivariate-Bicycle Codes, Surface Codes, and Transversal CNOT Protocols. Our results demonstrate consistent speedups of approximately 2x for most code families, often exceeding 2.5x. Notably, we achieved a peak performance gain of over 5x for the most computationally demanding configurations of Bivariate-Bicycle Codes. These improvements make the Tesseract decoder more efficient and scalable, serving as a practical case study that highlights the importance of high-performance software engineering in QEC and providing a strong foundation for future research."

We benchmark 20+ LLMs against a matched human baseline on 11 causal judgment tasks formalized by a collider structure ($C_1 \\!\\rightarrow\\! E\\! \\leftarrow \\!C_2$). We find that a small interpretable model compresses LLMs' causal judgments well and that most LLMs exhibit more rule-like reasoning strategies than humans who seem to account for unmentioned latent factors in their probability judgments. Furthermore, most LLMs do not mirror the characteristic human collider biases of weak explaining away and Markov violations. We probe LLMs' causal judgment robustness under (i) semantic abstraction and (ii) prompt overloading (injecting irrelevant text), and find that chain-of-thought (CoT) increases robustness for many LLMs. Together, this divergence suggests LLMs can complement humans when known biases are undesirable, but their rule-like reasoning may break down when uncertainty is intrinsic -- highlighting the need to characterize LLM reasoning strategies for safe, effective deployment."

This dependence renders supervision-heavy training paradigms increasingly unsustainable, with signs of diminishing scalability already evident in practice. To overcome this limitation, we introduce CPMöbius (CPMobius), a collaborative Coach-Player paradigm for data-free reinforcement learning of reasoning models. Unlike traditional adversarial self-play, CPMöbius, inspired by real world human sports collaboration and multi-agent collaboration, treats the Coach and Player as independent but cooperative roles. The Coach proposes instructions targeted at the Player's capability and receives rewards based on changes in the Player's performance, while the Player is rewarded for solving the increasingly instructive tasks generated by the Coach. This cooperative optimization loop is designed to directly enhance the Player's mathematical reasoning ability. Remarkably, CPMöbius achieves substantial improvement without relying on any external training data, outperforming existing unsupervised approaches. For example, on Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct, our method improves accuracy by an overall average of +4.9 and an out-of-distribution average of +5.4, exceeding RENT by +1.5 on overall accuracy and R-zero by +4.2 on OOD accuracy."

Variations in dynamics, degrees of freedom (DoFs), and kinematic topology still hinder a single policy from commanding diverse humanoids. Moreover, obtaining a generalist policy that not only transfers across embodiments but also supports richer behaviors-beyond simple walking to squatting, leaning-remains especially challenging. In this work, we tackle these obstacles by introducing EAGLE, an iterative generalist-specialist distillation framework that produces a single unified policy that controls multiple heterogeneous humanoids without per-robot reward tuning. During each cycle, embodiment-specific specialists are forked from the current generalist, refined on their respective robots, and new skills are distilled back into the generalist by training on the pooled embodiment set. Repeating this loop until performance convergence produces a robust Whole-Body Controller validated on robots such as Unitree H1, G1, and Fourier N1. We conducted experiments on five different robots in simulation and four in real-world settings. Through quantitative evaluations, EAGLE achieves high tracking accuracy and robustness compared to other methods, marking a step toward scalable, fleet-level humanoid control.

We find the star grows to $\\sim 27$ M$_{\\odot}$ over $31,000$ years, with its final mass regulated by accretion and protostellar jets. Protostellar jets form because the magnetic mass-to-flux ratio lies within the regime that allows jet launching, and they are further enabled by a rotating circumstellar disk with sufficient gas-magnetic-field coupling, both present in this simulation. These jets regulate accretion onto the (proto)star and drive outflows that collide with infalling gas, slowing inflow at large radii due to the substantial momentum they carry. A circumstellar disk forms, extending out to $\\sim 0.01$ pc, which remains gravitationally stable (Q $\\gg 1$). The stability of the disk is maintained through both thermal support and turbulence. In this paper we focus on how jets play a critical role not only in shaping the final masses of Pop. III stars but also in directly influencing their surroundings by regulating accretion. These results will provide important insights into the initial mass function and feedback processes in the earliest star-forming regions of the Universe."

Many applications demand not just point estimates but interpretable uncertainty. Providing fast inference alongside uncertainty estimates remains challenging yet desirable in numerous applications. We propose the Variational Sparse Paired Autoencoder (vsPAIR) to address this challenge. The architecture pairs a standard VAE encoding observations with a sparse VAE encoding quantities of interest, connected through a learned latent mapping. The variational structure enables uncertainty estimation, the paired architecture encourages interpretability by anchoring QoI representations to clean data, and sparse encodings provide structure by concentrating information into identifiable factors rather than diffusing across all dimensions. We also propose modifications to existing sparse VAE methods: a hard-concrete spike-and-slab relaxation for differentiable training and a beta hyperprior for adaptive sparsity levels. To validate the effectiveness of our proposed architecture, we conduct experiments on blind inpainting and computed tomography, demonstrating that vsPAIR is a capable inverse problem solver that can provide interpretable and structured uncertainty estimates."

We employ soft edge blending to create smooth anatomical transitions and continuous labels, eliminating the hard boundaries from traditional copy-paste augmentation. The framework generates pseudo-labels for synthetic images via an EMA teacher model and applies soft-segmentation losses that respect uncertainty in mixed regions. Our experiments demonstrate strong results: using only 10% labeled real data and 90% synthetic unlabeled data, SRA-Seg achieves 89.34% Dice on ACDC and 84.42% on FIVES, significantly outperforming existing semi-supervised methods and matching the performance of methods using real unlabeled data."

This work considers the problem of HF channel estimation (CE) and introduces a unified model that superimposes FF and NF contributions according to the Rayleigh distance boundary. By exploiting the inherent sparsity of the channel in the angular and polar domains, we formulate the estimation task as a sparse recovery problem. Unlike conventional approaches that require prior knowledge of the channel sparsity level, the proposed method operates without requiring knowledge of the sparsity level L and the NF/FF ratio γ, which are used only for synthetic channel generation in simulations. The channel estimator determines the number of paths adaptively through a residual-based stopping rule. A combined FF/NF dictionary is employed to initialize the support, and each selected atom undergoes continuous parameter refinement to mitigate grid mismatch. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed estimator achieves accurate HF channel reconstruction under both line-of-sight (LoS) and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) conditions, offering a practical and computationally efficient solution for XL-MIMO systems.

Yet existing SZZ-based approaches are limited by their reliance on git blame, which restricts the search space to commits that directly modified the fixed lines. Our preliminary study on 2,102 validated bug-fixing commits reveals that this limitation is significant: over 40% of cases cannot be solved by blame alone, as 28% of BICs require traversing commit history beyond blame results and 14% are blameless. We present AgenticSZZ, the first approach to apply Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs) to software evolution analysis. AgenticSZZ reframes BIC identification from a ranking problem over blame commits into a graph search problem, where temporal ordering is fundamental to causal reasoning about bug introduction. The approach operates in two phases: (1) constructing a TKG that encodes commits with temporal and structural relationships, expanding the search space by traversing file history backward from two reference points (blame commits and the BFC); and (2) leveraging an LLM agent to navigate the graph using specialized tools for candidate exploration and causal analysis. Evaluation on three datasets shows that AgenticSZZ achieves F1-scores of 0.48 to 0.74, with statistically significant improvements over state-of-the-art by up to 27%. Our ablation study confirms that both components are essential, reflecting a classic exploration-exploitation trade-off: the TKG expands the search space while the agent provides intelligent selection. By transforming BIC identification into a graph search problem, we open a new research direction for temporal and causal reasoning in software evolution analysis."

This yields denoising directions better directed toward the data manifold. Across architectures, Distance Marching consistently improves FID by 13.5% on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet over recent time-unconditional baselines. For class-conditional ImageNet generation, despite removing time input, Distance Marching surpasses flow matching using our losses and inference methods. It achieves lower FID than flow matching's final performance using 60% of the sampling steps and 13.6% lower FID on average across backbone sizes. Moreover, our distance prediction is also helpful for early stopping during sampling and for OOD detection. We hope distance field modeling can serve as a principled lens for generative modeling."

Offloading MoE expert parameters to host memory and leveraging both CPU and GPU computation has recently emerged as a promising direction to support such models on resourceconstrained local PC platforms. While promising, we notice that existing approaches mismatch the dynamic nature of expert workloads, which leads to three fundamental inefficiencies: (1) Static expert assignment causes severe CPUGPU load imbalance, underutilizing CPU and GPU resources; (2) Existing prefetching techniques fail to accurately predict high-workload experts, leading to costly inaccurate prefetches; (3) GPU cache policies neglect workload dynamics, resulting in poor hit rates and limited effectiveness. To address these challenges, we propose DALI, a workloaDAware offLoadIng framework for efficient MoE inference on local PCs. To fully utilize hardware resources, DALI first dynamically assigns experts to CPU or GPU by modeling assignment as a 0-1 integer optimization problem and solving it efficiently using a Greedy Assignment strategy at runtime. To improve prefetching accuracy, we develop a Residual-Based Prefetching method leveraging inter-layer residual information to accurately predict high-workload experts. Additionally, we introduce a Workload-Aware Cache Replacement policy that exploits temporal correlation in expert activations to improve GPU cache efficiency. By evaluating across various MoE models and settings, DALI achieves significant speedups in the both prefill and decoding phases over the state-of-the-art offloading frameworks."

In this paper, we report on the laboratory experimental study of Larmor coupling leading to the formation of a plasma blob associated with a laser-driven, super-Alfvénic plasma flow on the Large Plasma Device at the University of California, Los Angeles. The high-repetition rate enables systematic spatial and temporal scans of the plasma evolution using Doppler spectroscopy, as well as measurements of the magnetic field, electrostatic field, and self-emission of both debris and ambient ions using filtered imaging. We observe the self-focusing of the laser-produced plasma and the formation of a secondary diamagnetic cavity associated with a blob composed of background ions. Doppler spectroscopy reveals the transverse velocity distribution of the background ions, providing direct evidence of ion energization via Larmor coupling. The systematic spatial and temporal scans enabled by the high-repetition rate experiment allow for a detailed characterization of the ion dynamics. These experimental observations are supported by numerical simulations that provide more insight into the kinetic-scale physics associated with blob formation as well as the role of the ambient plasma density."

However, when the macroscopic limit is considered, that is when the number of particles tends to infinity, the conditions are satisfied, thus providing the conceptual possibility of obtaining the Navier-Stokes equations from the principle of least action."

In the present work, we obtain results that complement his work in several directions. In particular, we obtain restricted weak-type endpoint bound on the maximal function and $L^p$--$L^q$ bounds on its local variant. We also investigate how Frostman's growth condition on the measure influences those maximal bounds. While a key feature of Rubio de Francia's result is that $L^p$ boundedness is determined solely by the decay order of $\\widehatμ$, we show that the Frostman condition plays a significant role when the growth order exceeds $d-1$ or when $L^p$--$L^q$ estimates are considered."

    "abstract": "Despite recent progress in vision-language models (VLMs), existing approaches often fail to generate personalized responses based on the user's specific experiences, as they lack the ability to associate visual inputs with a user's accumulated visual-textual context. We newly formalize this challenge as contextualized visual personalization, which requires the visual recognition and textual retrieval of personalized visual experiences by VLMs when interpreting new images. To address this issue, we propose CoViP, a unified framework that treats personalized image captioning as a core task for contextualized visual personalization and improves this capability through reinforcement-learning-based post-training and caption-augmented generation. We further introduce diagnostic evaluations that explicitly rule out textual shortcut solutions and verify whether VLMs truly leverage visual context. Extensive experiments demonstrate that existing open-source and proprietary VLMs exhibit substantial limitations, while CoViP not only improves personalized image captioning but also yields holistic gains across downstream personalization tasks. These results highlight CoViP as a crucial stage for enabling robust and generalizable contextualized visual personalization."

The main theorem asserts that asymptotically flat manifolds with nonnegative distributional scalar curvature have nonnegative ADM mass. The proof uses smooth approximations of the metric together with a Sobolev version of Friedrichs' Lemma, which yields improved convergence for commutators between differentiation and convolution operators. Rigidity is obtained for $C^0 \\cap W_{\\mathrm{loc}}^{1,p}$ metrics with $p>n$ via the comparison theory of $\\sf{RCD}$-spaces and a rigidity theorem for compact manifolds with metrics of nonnegative distributional curvature by Jiang-Sheng-Zhang.

They still rely on two paradigms: (1) designing an algorithm that retrieves passages in a single shot and concatenates them into the model's input, or (2) predefining a workflow and prompting the model to execute it step-by-step. Neither paradigm allows the model to participate in retrieval decisions, preventing efficient scaling with model improvements. In this paper, we introduce A-RAG, an Agentic RAG framework that exposes hierarchical retrieval interfaces directly to the model. A-RAG provides three retrieval tools: keyword search, semantic search, and chunk read, enabling the agent to adaptively search and retrieve information across multiple granularities. Experiments on multiple open-domain QA benchmarks show that A-RAG consistently outperforms existing approaches with comparable or lower retrieved tokens, demonstrating that A-RAG effectively leverages model capabilities and dynamically adapts to different RAG tasks. We further systematically study how A-RAG scales with model size and test-time compute. We will release our code and evaluation suite to facilitate future research.

    "abstract": "Continuum soft robots are inherently underactuated and subject to intrinsic input constraints, making dynamic control particularly challenging, especially in hybrid rigid-soft robots. While most existing methods focus on quasi-static behaviors, dynamic tasks such as swing-up require accurate exploitation of continuum dynamics. This has led to studies on simple low-order template systems that often fail to capture the complexity of real continuum deformations. Model-based optimal control offers a systematic solution; however, its application to rigid-soft robots is often limited by the computational cost and inaccuracy of numerical differentiation for high-dimensional models. Building on recent advances in the Geometric Variable Strain model that enable analytical derivatives, this work investigates three optimal control strategies for underactuated soft systems-Direct Collocation, Differential Dynamic Programming, and Nonlinear Model Predictive Control-to perform dynamic swing-up tasks. To address stiff continuum dynamics and constrained actuation, implicit integration schemes and warm-start strategies are employed to improve numerical robustness and computational efficiency. The methods are evaluated in simulation on three Rigid-Soft and high-order soft benchmark systems-the Soft Cart-Pole, the Soft Pendubot, and the Soft Furuta Pendulum- highlighting their performance and computational trade-offs."

This result is in agreement with Donato et al. (2009)'s results, claiming the existence of a quasi-universal surface density in all masses in galaxies. The Milgrom paper also predicts that objects with mean inner acceleration smaller than the values discussed do %es not show the quasi-universal behavior of the surface density discussed. In the present paper, we extend the result of Milgrom's paper, based on a point mass model, considering spiral galaxies, modelled with a double exponential disk.

    "abstract": "Emotional expression in human speech is nuanced and compositional, often involving multiple, sometimes conflicting, affective cues that may diverge from linguistic content. In contrast, most expressive text-to-speech systems enforce a single utterance-level emotion, collapsing affective diversity and suppressing mixed or text-emotion-misaligned expression. While activation steering via latent direction vectors offers a promising solution, it remains unclear whether emotion representations are linearly steerable in TTS, where steering should be applied within hybrid TTS architectures, and how such complex emotion behaviors should be evaluated. This paper presents the first systematic analysis of activation steering for emotional control in hybrid TTS models, introducing a quantitative, controllable steering framework, and multi-rater evaluation protocols that enable composable mixed-emotion synthesis and reliable text-emotion mismatch synthesis. Our results demonstrate, for the first time, that emotional prosody and expressive variability are primarily synthesized by the TTS language module instead of the flow-matching module, and also provide a lightweight steering approach for generating natural, human-like emotional speech."

The policy devises adequate maneuvering strategies according to transporter-specific control dynamics, while the estimators resolve sensor ambiguities in non-inertial frames by inferring unobservable robot and transporter states. Comprehensive evaluations in simulation validate proficient command tracking abilities across various transporter-robot models and reduced energy consumption compared to legged locomotion. Moreover, we conduct ablation studies to quantify individual component contributions within the \\textit{RL-ATR}. This riding ability could broaden the locomotion modalities of quadruped robots, potentially expanding the operational range and efficiency."

We perform a comprehensive Bayesian analysis of the $ΛΛ$ and $ΛΛN$ interaction parameters within the Skyrme Hartree-Fock framework, constrained by both hypernuclei experimental data and astrophysical observations. Our results show that the parameter space of the $ΛΛ$ interaction is tightly constrained by combining nuclear and astrophysical data, while the parameters of the $ΛΛN$ three-body interaction remain sensitive to astrophysical inputs alone. Specifically, the local, momentum-independent two-body interaction parameter $λ_0$ is tightly constrained and predominantly attractive, while the momentum-dependent parameters $λ_1$ and $λ_2$ contribute repulsive effects at high densities. A key role is played by the $ΛΛ$ potential depth in pure $Λ$ matter, which effectively constrains the two-body $ΛΛ$ interaction and governs the balance between attraction at low densities and repulsion at high densities. The repulsive components of $ΛΛ$ interactions then decrease hyperon fractions and reconcile hyperon-rich equations of state with the observed $\\sim2\\,M_{\\odot}$ neutron stars, increasing the maximum mass by up to 22\\%. The inclusion of $ΛΛN$ three-body forces further stiffens the EOS, raising the maximum mass by up to $\\sim 0.1\\,M_{\\odot}$.

Firstly, we identify that introducing reasoning mechanisms exacerbates models' reliance on language priors while overlooking visual inputs, which can produce CoTs with reduced visual cues but redundant text tokens. To this end, we propose to selectively filter redundant thinking tokens for a more compact and signal-efficient CoT representation that preserves task-relevant information while suppressing noise. In addition, we observe that the quality of the reasoning trace largely determines whether hallucination emerges in subsequent responses. To leverage this insight, we introduce a reasoning-enhanced preference tuning scheme that constructs training pairs using high-quality AI feedback. We further design a multimodal hallucination-inducing mechanism that elicits models' inherent hallucination patterns via carefully crafted inducers, yielding informative negative signals for contrastive correction. We provide theoretical justification for the effectiveness and demonstrate consistent hallucination reduction across diverse MLRMs and benchmarks."

In practice, black-box watermarks manifest as specific predictive behaviors for specially crafted samples. However, due to the generalization nature of DNNs, the keys to extracting the watermark message are not unique, which would provide attackers with more opportunities. Advanced attack techniques can reverse-engineer approximate replacements for the original watermark keys, enabling subsequent watermark removal. In this paper, we explore black-box DNN watermarking specificity, which refers to the accuracy of a watermark's response to a key. Using this concept, we introduce Specificity-Enhanced Watermarking (SEW), a new method that improves specificity by reducing the association between the watermark and approximate keys. Through extensive evaluation using three popular watermarking benchmarks, we validate that enhancing specificity significantly contributes to strengthening robustness against removal attacks. SEW effectively defends against six state-of-the-art removal attacks, while maintaining model usability and watermark verification performance."

Under DiM, watermark information is modeled as payloads of different dimensionalities, including one-dimensional binary messages, two-dimensional spatial masks, and three-dimensional spatiotemporal structures. We find that the dimensional configuration of embedding and extraction largely determines the resulting watermarking behavior. Same-dimensional mappings preserve payload structure and support fine-grained control, while cross-dimensional mappings enable spatial or spatiotemporal localization. We instantiate DiM in the video domain, where spatiotemporal representations enable a broader set of dimension mappings. Experiments demonstrate that varying only the embedding and extraction dimensions, without architectural changes, leads to different watermarking capabilities, including spatiotemporal tamper localization, local embedding control, and recovery of temporal order under frame disruptions."

Two distinct models, the Tsallis-Pareto type function (model) and the combined BGBW model and Tsallis-Pareto type model have been employed to fit the pT distributions via the minimum chi-square method. The combined Hydro+Tsallis model is more reliably describing the pT spectra than the Tsallis-Pareto model. The Tsallis temperature (T), non-extensivity parameter (q), normalization constant (N0), Kinetic freeze-out temperature (T0), transverse flow velocity (betaT), and (mean pT) have been extracted through the fitting procedure via the employed models. The Tsallis-Pareto model gives T, q, N0 and mean pT while Hydro+Tsallis model gives T0, betaT, T, q, N0 and mean pT. Incorporating the values of the extracted T and q the thermodynamic quantities and response functions, including energy density (epsilon), particle density (n), entropy density (s), pressure (P), specific heat at constant volume (CV), squared speed of sound (cs2), mean free path (lambda), Knudsen number (Kn), isothermal compressibility (kappaT), and expansion coefficient (alpha) have been calculated at the freeze-out stage. It has been observed that T, betaT, mean pT, N0, epsilon, n, s, P, CV, cs2, and alpha increase with increasing(decreasing) the charged particles multiplicity density dNch/deta(MCs). While T0, q, lambda, Kn, and kappaT decrease with increasing(decreasing) dNch/deta(MCs).

For radial Jeffery-Hamel solutions, we obtain all the explicit local profiles in $Ω$ with arbitrary opening angles. In the non-radial case, we show that some Jeffery-Hamel solutions can be obtained via solving a Liénard equation, and we derive new explicit local profiles expressible in terms of Weierstrass elliptic functions."

    "abstract": "In bioinformatics, minimizers have become an inescapable method for handling $k$-mers (words of fixed size $k$) extracted from DNA or RNA sequencing, whether for sampling, storage, querying or partitioning. According to some fixed order on $m$-mers ($m<k$), the minimizer of a $k$-mer is defined as its smallest $m$-mer -- and acts as its fingerprint. Although minimizers are widely used for partitioning purposes, there is almost no theoretical work on the quality of the resulting partitions. For instance, it has been known for decades that the lexicographic order empirically leads to highly unbalanced partitions that are unusable in practice, but it was not until very recently that this observation was theoretically substantiated. The rejection of the lexicographic order has led the community to resort to (pseudo-)random orders using hash functions. In this work, we extend the theoretical results relating to the partitions obtained by the lexicographical order, departing from it to a (exponentially) large family of hash functions, namely where the $m$-mers are XORed against a fixed key. More precisely, provided a key $γ$ and a $m$-mer $w$, we investigate the function that counts how many $k$-mers admit $w$ as their minimizer (i.e. where $w\\oplusγ$ is minimal among all $m$-mers of said $k$-mers). This number, denoted by $π_k^γ(w)$, represents the maximum size of the bucket associated with $w$, if all possible $k$-mers were to be seen and partitioned. We adapt the (lexicographical order) method of the literature to our framework and propose combinatorial equations that allow to compute, using dynamic programming, $π_k^γ(w)$ in $O(km^2)$ time and $O(km)$ space."

However, 3DGS relies heavily on accurate camera poses and high-quality point cloud initialization, which are difficult to obtain in sparse-view scenarios. While traditional Structure from Motion (SfM) pipelines often fail in these settings, existing learning-based point estimation alternatives typically require reliable reference views and remain sensitive to pose or depth errors. In this work, we propose a robust method utilizing π^3, a reference-free point cloud estimation network. We integrate dense initialization from π^3 with a regularization scheme designed to mitigate geometric inaccuracies. Specifically, we employ uncertainty-guided depth supervision, normal consistency loss, and depth warping.

    "abstract": "Deep search agents, which autonomously iterate through multi-turn web-based reasoning, represent a promising paradigm for complex information-seeking tasks. However, current agents suffer from critical inefficiency: they conduct excessive searches as they cannot accurately judge when to stop searching and start answering. This stems from outcome-centric training that prioritize final results over the search process itself. We identify the root cause as misaligned decision boundaries, the threshold determining when accumulated information suffices to answer. This causes over-search (redundant searching despite sufficient knowledge) and under-search (premature termination yielding incorrect answers). To address these errors, we propose a comprehensive framework comprising two key components. First, we introduce causal intervention-based diagnosis that identifies boundary errors by comparing factual and counterfactual trajectories at each decision point. Second, we develop Decision Boundary Alignment for Deep Search agents (DAS), which constructs preference datasets from causal feedback and aligns policies via preference optimization. Experiments on public datasets demonstrate that decision boundary errors are pervasive across state-of-the-art agents. Our DAS method effectively calibrates these boundaries, mitigating both over-search and under-search to achieve substantial gains in accuracy and efficiency.

Specifically, we design a pulse sequence that combines dynamical decoupling with hyperfine interactions to realize decoherence-protected universal gate operations between the processor and memory qubits. Leveraging this gate, we deterministically prepare entangled states within the quantum node, achieving a fidelity of 90%, which exceeds the fault-tolerance threshold of certain quantum network architectures.

Existing structured pruning methods, while hardware-efficient, often suffer from significant accuracy degradation. In this paper, we argue that this failure stems from a stage-agnostic pruning approach that overlooks the asymmetric roles between the prefill and decode stages. By introducing a virtual gate mechanism, our importance analysis reveals that deep layers are critical for next-token prediction (decode) but largely redundant for context encoding (prefill). Leveraging this insight, we propose Prefill-Only Pruning (POP), a stage-aware inference strategy that safely omits deep layers during the computationally intensive prefill stage while retaining the full model for the sensitive decode stage. To enable the transition between stages, we introduce independent Key-Value (KV) projections to maintain cache integrity, and a boundary handling strategy to ensure the accuracy of the first generated token. Extensive experiments on Llama-3.1, Qwen3-VL, and Gemma-3 across diverse modalities demonstrate that POP achieves up to 1.37$\\times$ speedup in prefill latency with minimal performance loss, effectively overcoming the accuracy-efficiency trade-off limitations of existing structured pruning methods."

For example, VQA optimization often suffers from vanishing gradients called barren plateau (BP) and the presence of local minima in the landscape of the cost function. Numerical studies have shown that the trap in local minima is significantly reduced when the circuit is overparametrized (OP), where the number of parameters exceeds a certain threshold. Theoretical understanding of the BP and OP phenomena has advanced over the past years, however, comprehensive studies of both effects in the same setting are not fully covered in the literature. In this paper, we perform a comprehensive numerical study in VQA, quantitatively evaluating the impacts of BP and OP and their interplay on the optimization of a variational quantum circuit, using concrete implementations of one-dimensional transverse and longitudinal field quantum Ising model. The numerical results are compared with the theoretical diagnostics of BP and OP phenomena. The framework presented in this paper will provide a guiding principle for designing VQA algorithms and ansatzes with theoretical support for behaviors of parameter optimization in practical settings."

    "abstract": "This paper develops a new approach to computational argumentation that is informed by philosophical and linguistic views. Namely, it takes into account two ideas that have received little attention in the literature on computational argumentation: First, an agent may rationally reject an argument based on mere doubt, thus not all arguments they could defend must be accepted; and, second, that it is sometimes more natural to think in terms of which individual sentences or claims an agent accepts in a debate, rather than which arguments. In order to incorporate these two ideas into a computational approach, we first define the notion of structured bipolar argumentation frameworks (SBAFs), where arguments consist of sentences and we have both an attack and a support relation between them. Then, we provide semantics for SBAFs with two features: (1) Unlike with completeness-based semantics, our semantics do not force agents to accept all defended arguments. (2) In addition to argument extensions, which give acceptable sets of arguments, we also provide semantics for language extensions that specify acceptable sets of sentences. These semantics represent reasonable positions an agent might have in a debate. Our semantics lie between the admissible and complete semantics of abstract argumentation. Further, our approach can be used to provide a new perspective on existing approaches. For instance, we can specify the conditions under which an agent can ignore support between arguments (i.e. under which the use of abstract argumentation is warranted) and we show that deductive support semantics is a special case of our approach."

Existing meeting benchmarks mainly focus on simplified question answering and fail to reflect real world enterprise workflows, where queries arise organically from multi stakeholder collaboration, span long temporal contexts, and require tool augmented reasoning. We address this gap through a grounded dataset and a learned agent framework. First, we introduce MeetAll, a bilingual and multimodal corpus derived from 231 enterprise meetings totaling 140 hours. Questions are injected using an enterprise informed protocol validated by domain expert review and human discriminability studies. Unlike purely synthetic benchmarks, this protocol is grounded in four enterprise critical dimensions: cognitive load, temporal context span, domain expertise, and actionable task execution, calibrated through interviews with stakeholders across finance, healthcare, and technology sectors. Second, we propose MeetBench XL, a multi dimensional evaluation protocol aligned with human judgment that measures factual fidelity, intent alignment, response efficiency, structural clarity, and completeness. Third, we present MeetMaster XL, a learned dual policy agent that jointly optimizes query routing between fast and slow reasoning paths and tool invocation, including retrieval, cross meeting aggregation, and web search. A lightweight classifier enables accurate routing with minimal overhead, achieving a superior quality latency tradeoff over single model baselines. Experiments against commercial systems show consistent gains, supported by ablations, robustness tests, and a real world deployment case study.Resources: https://github.com/huyuelin/MeetBench."

This focus has shaped both training objectives and evaluation protocols, implicitly treating global geometry as a proxy for representational competence. While global geometry effectively encodes which elements are present, it is often insensitive to how they are composed. We investigate this limitation by testing the ability of geometric metrics to predict compositional binding across 21 vision encoders. We find that standard geometry-based statistics exhibit near-zero correlation with compositional binding. In contrast, functional sensitivity, as measured by the input-output Jacobian, reliably tracks this capability. We further provide an analytic account showing that this disparity arises from objective design, as existing losses explicitly constrain embedding geometry but leave the local input-output mapping unconstrained. These results suggest that global embedding geometry captures only a partial view of representational competence and establish functional sensitivity as a critical complementary axis for modeling composite structure."

In this paper, we show that this is not the case. We identify the precise characterizations of categorical models of effect handlers that allow us to establish soundness and completeness results with respect to a certain equational theory for effect handling constructs. Notably, this allows us to capture not only free monad models but also the CPS semantics for effect handlers as models of the calculus."

    "abstract": "Detecting toxicity in multimodal data remains a significant challenge, as harmful meanings often lurk beneath seemingly benign individual modalities: only emerging when modalities are combined and semantic associations are activated. To address this, we propose a novel detection framework based on Toxicity Association Graphs (TAGs), which systematically model semantic associations between innocuous entities and latent toxic implications. Leveraging TAGs, we introduce the first quantifiable metric for hidden toxicity, the Multimodal Toxicity Covertness (MTC), which measures the degree of concealment in toxic multimodal expressions. By integrating our detection framework with the MTC metric, our approach enables precise identification of covert toxicity while preserving full interpretability of the decision-making process, significantly enhancing transparency in multimodal toxicity detection. To validate our method, we construct the Covert Toxic Dataset, the first benchmark specifically designed to capture high-covertness toxic multimodal instances. This dataset encodes nuanced cross-modal associations and serves as a rigorous testbed for evaluating both the proposed metric and detection framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods across both low- and high-covertness toxicity regimes, while delivering clear, interpretable, and auditable detection outcomes. Together, our contributions advance the state of the art in explainable multimodal toxicity detection and lay the foundation for future context-aware and interpretable approaches.

As a result, existing federated RF implementations rely on unprincipled heuristics: for instance, aggregating decision trees trained independently on clients fails to optimize the global impurity criterion, even under simple distribution shifts. We propose FedForest, a new federated RF algorithm for horizontally partitioned data that naturally accommodates diverse forms of client data heterogeneity, from covariate shift to more complex outcome shift mechanisms. We prove that our splitting procedure, based on aggregating carefully chosen client statistics, closely approximates the split selected by a centralized algorithm. Moreover, FedForest allows splits on client indicators, enabling a non-parametric form of personalization that is absent from prior federated random forest methods. Empirically, we demonstrate that the resulting federated forests closely match centralized performance across heterogeneous benchmarks while remaining communication-efficient."

This mechanism enables a Fold inference mode, where the model periodically summarizes its thought process and discards former thoughts to reduce dependency on historical tokens. We apply reinforcement learning to incentivize this capability further, uncovering a critical insight: the accuracy gap between the highly efficient Fold mode and the exhaustive Unfold mode progressively narrows and eventually vanishes over the course of training. This phenomenon demonstrates that the model learns to encode essential reasoning information into compact summaries, achieving effective compression of the reasoning context. Our Accordion-Thinker demonstrates that with learned self-compression, LLMs can tackle complex reasoning tasks with minimal dependency token overhead without compromising solution quality, and it achieves a 3x throughput while maintaining accuracy on a 48GB GPU memory configuration, while the structured step summaries provide a human-readable account of the reasoning process."

    "abstract": "Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) is the de facto positional encoding in large language models due to its ability to encode relative positions and support length extrapolation. When adapted to vision transformers, the standard axial formulation decomposes two-dimensional spatial positions into horizontal and vertical components, implicitly restricting positional encoding to axis-aligned directions. We identify this directional constraint as a fundamental limitation of the standard axial 2D RoPE, which hinders the modeling of oblique spatial relationships that naturally exist in natural images. To overcome this limitation, we propose Spiral RoPE, a simple yet effective extension that enables multi-directional positional encoding by partitioning embedding channels into multiple groups associated with uniformly distributed directions. Each group is rotated according to the projection of the patch position onto its corresponding direction, allowing spatial relationships to be encoded beyond the horizontal and vertical axes. Across a wide range of vision tasks including classification, segmentation, and generation, Spiral RoPE consistently improves performance. Qualitative analysis of attention maps further show that Spiral RoPE exhibits more concentrated activations on semantically relevant objects and better respects local object boundaries, highlighting the importance of multi-directional positional encoding in vision transformers."

    "abstract": "As code large language models (LLMs) evolve into tool-interactive agents via the Model Context Protocol (MCP), their generalization is increasingly limited by low-quality synthetic data and the diminishing returns of quantity scaling. Moreover, quantity-centric scaling exhibits an early bottleneck that underutilizes trajectory data. We propose TDScaling, a Trajectory Diversity Scaling-based data synthesis framework for code agents that scales performance through diversity rather than raw volume. Under a fixed training budget, increasing trajectory diversity yields larger gains than adding more trajectories, improving the performance-cost trade-off for agent training. TDScaling integrates four innovations: (1) a Business Cluster mechanism that captures real-service logical dependencies; (2) a blueprint-driven multi-agent paradigm that enforces trajectory coherence; (3) an adaptive evolution mechanism that steers synthesis toward long-tail scenarios using Domain Entropy, Reasoning Mode Entropy, and Cumulative Action Complexity to prevent mode collapse; and (4) a sandboxed code tool that mitigates catastrophic forgetting of intrinsic coding capabilities. Experiments on general tool-use benchmarks (BFCL, tau^2-Bench) and code agent tasks (RebenchT, CodeCI, BIRD) demonstrate a win-win outcome: TDScaling improves both tool-use generalization and inherent coding proficiency. We plan to release the full codebase and the synthesized dataset (including 30,000+ tool clusters) upon publication."

    "abstract": "For randomized controlled trials to be conclusive, it is important to set the target sample size accurately at the design stage. Comparing two normal populations, the sample size calculation requires specification of the variance other than the treatment effect and misspecification can lead to underpowered studies. Blinded sample size re-estimation is an approach to minimize the risk of inconclusive studies. Existing methods proposed to use the total (one-sample) variance that is estimable from blinded data without knowledge of the treatment allocation. We demonstrate that, since the expectation of this estimator is greater than or equal to the true variance, the one-sample variance approach can be regarded as providing an upper bound of the variance in blind reviews. This worst-case evaluation can likely reduce a risk of underpowered studies. However, blinded reviews of small sample size may still lead to underpowered studies. We propose a refined method accounting for estimation error in blind reviews using an upper confidence limit of the variance. A similar idea had been proposed in the setting of external pilot studies. Furthermore, we developed a method to select an appropriate confidence level so that the re-estimated sample size attains the target power. Numerical studies showed that our method works well and outperforms existing methods. The proposed procedure is motivated and illustrated by recent randomized clinical trials."

Hand3R synergizes a pre-trained hand expert with a 4D scene foundation model via a scene-aware visual prompting mechanism. By injecting high-fidelity hand priors into a persistent scene memory, our approach enables simultaneous reconstruction of accurate hand meshes and dense metric-scale scene geometry in a single forward pass. Experiments demonstrate that Hand3R bypasses the reliance on offline optimization and delivers competitive performance in both local hand reconstruction and global positioning."

In this paper, we propose TempLoc, a new LiDAR relocalization framework that enhances the robustness of localization by effectively modeling sequential consistency. Specifically, a Global Coordinate Estimation module is first introduced to predict point-wise global coordinates and associated uncertainties for each LiDAR scan. A Prior Coordinate Generation module is then presented to estimate inter-frame point correspondences by the attention mechanism. Lastly, an Uncertainty-Guided Coordinate Fusion module is deployed to integrate both predictions of point correspondence in an end-to-end fashion, yielding a more temporally consistent and accurate global 6-DoF pose. Experimental results on the NCLT and Oxford Robot-Car benchmarks show that our TempLoc outperforms stateof-the-art methods by a large margin, demonstrating the effectiveness of temporal-aware correspondence modeling in LiDAR relocalization. Our code will be released soon."

Nevertheless, the substantial model size and high computational cost of Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) limit downstream applications. While low-bit quantization is a common approach for model compression, the effectiveness of quantized models is challenged by the high dynamic range of input latent and diverse layer behaviors. To deal with these challenges, we introduce LSGQuant, a layer-sensitivity guided quantizing approach for one-step diffusion-based real-world VSR. Our method incorporates a Dynamic Range Adaptive Quantizer (DRAQ) to fit video token activations. Furthermore, we estimate layer sensitivity and implement a Variance-Oriented Layer Training Strategy (VOLTS) by analyzing layer-wise statistics in calibration. We also introduce Quantization-Aware Optimization (QAO) to jointly refine the quantized branch and a retained high-precision branch. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method has nearly performance to origin model with full-precision and significantly exceeds existing quantization techniques.

In particular we consider the space of binary sequence prediction tasks where the observations are generated by the space parameterized by hidden Markov models (HMM). As the space of tasks is large, experimental exploration of the entire space is infeasible. To solve this problem we propose the adversarial construction approach, which helps identify tasks that are most likely to elicit a qualitatively novel behavior. Our results suggest that adversarial construction significantly outperforms random sampling of environments and therefore could be used as a proxy for optimal experimental design in high-dimensional task spaces."

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning algorithms often suffer from slow convergence due to sparse reward signals, particularly in complex environments where feedback is delayed or infrequent. This paper introduces the Psychological Regret Model (PRM), a novel approach that accelerates learning by incorporating regret-based feedback signals after each decision step. Rather than waiting for terminal rewards, PRM computes a regret signal based on the difference between the expected value of the optimal action and the value of the action taken in each state. This transforms sparse rewards into dense feedback signals through a step-wise scoring framework, enabling faster convergence. We demonstrate that PRM achieves stable performance approximately 36\\% faster than traditional Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) in benchmark environments such as Lunar Lander. Our results indicate that PRM is particularly effective in continuous control tasks and environments with delayed feedback, making it suitable for real-world applications such as robotics, finance, and adaptive education where rapid policy adaptation is critical. The approach formalizes human-inspired counterfactual thinking as a computable regret signal, bridging behavioral economics and reinforcement learning."

This human-in-the-loop adaptation is employed in a group-activity video retrieval framework to improve its retrieval performance. Our method initially pre-trains the GAF space based on the similarity of group activities in a self-supervised manner, unlike prior work that classifies videos into pre-defined group activity classes in a supervised learning manner. Our interactive fine-tuning process updates the GAF space to allow a user to better retrieve videos similar to query videos given by the user. In this fine-tuning, our proposed data-efficient video selection process provides several videos, which are selected from a video database, to the user in order to manually label these videos as positive or negative. These labeled videos are used to update (i.e., fine-tune) the GAF space, so that the positive and negative videos move closer to and farther away from the query videos through contrastive learning. Our comprehensive experimental results on two team sports datasets validate that our method significantly improves the retrieval performance. Ablation studies also demonstrate that several components in our human-in-the-loop adaptation contribute to the improvement of the retrieval performance.

We formalize a network-native model of agentic collaboration and introduce an incentive-compatible workflow-coalition feasibility framework that integrates capability coverage, network locality, and economic implementability. To enable scalable coordination, we formulate a minimum-effort coalition selection problem and propose a decentralized coalition formation algorithm. The proposed framework can operate as a coordination layer above the Model Context Protocol (MCP). A healthcare case study demonstrates how domain specialization, cloud-edge heterogeneity, and dynamic coalition formation enable scalable, resilient, and economically viable agentic workflows. This work lays the foundation for principled coordination and scalability in the emerging era of Internet of Agentic AI."

Although prior work shows that humans consider both representativeness and diversity when teaching, the computational principles underlying these tradeoffs remain unclear. We address this gap by modeling human exemplar selection using neural network feature representations and principled subset selection criteria. Novel visual categories were embedded along a one-dimensional morph continuum using pretrained vision models, and selection strategies varied in their emphasis on prototypicality, joint representativeness, and diversity. Adult participants selected one to three exemplars to teach a learner. Model-human comparisons revealed that strategies based on joint representativeness, or its combination with diversity, best captured human judgments, whereas purely prototypical or diversity-based strategies performed worse. Moreover, transformer-based representations consistently aligned more closely with human behavior than convolutional networks. These results highlight the potential utility of dataset distillation methods in machine learning as computational models for teaching."

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present FSOD-VFM: Few-Shot Object Detectors with Vision Foundation Models, a framework that leverages vision foundation models to tackle the challenge of few-shot object detection. FSOD-VFM integrates three key components: a universal proposal network (UPN) for category-agnostic bounding box generation, SAM2 for accurate mask extraction, and DINOv2 features for efficient adaptation to new object categories. Despite the strong generalization capabilities of foundation models, the bounding boxes generated by UPN often suffer from overfragmentation, covering only partial object regions and leading to numerous small, false-positive proposals rather than accurate, complete object detections. To address this issue, we introduce a novel graph-based confidence reweighting method. In our approach, predicted bounding boxes are modeled as nodes in a directed graph, with graph diffusion operations applied to propagate confidence scores across the network. This reweighting process refines the scores of proposals, assigning higher confidence to whole objects and lower confidence to local, fragmented parts. This strategy improves detection granularity and effectively reduces the occurrence of false-positive bounding box proposals. Through extensive experiments on Pascal-5$^i$, COCO-20$^i$, and CD-FSOD datasets, we demonstrate that our method substantially outperforms existing approaches, achieving superior performance without requiring additional training. Notably, on the challenging CD-FSOD dataset, which spans multiple datasets and domains, our FSOD-VFM achieves 31.6 AP in the 10-shot setting, substantially outperforming previous training-free methods that reach only 21.4 AP.

Despite intense recent research on the topic and promising results, how can the LLM internal representation of the space of possible programs be maximally exploited to improve performance is an open question. Here, we introduce Contrastive Concept-Tree Search (CCTS), which extracts a hierarchical concept representation from the generated programs and learns a contrastive concept model that guides parent selection. By reweighting parents using a likelihood-ratio score between high- and low-performing solutions, CCTS biases search toward useful concept combinations and away from misleading ones, providing guidance through an explicit concept hierarchy rather than the algorithm lineage constructed by the LLM. We show that CCTS improves search efficiency over fitness-based baselines and produces interpretable, task-specific concept trees across a benchmark of open Erdős-type combinatorics problems. Our analysis indicates that the gains are driven largely by learning which concepts to avoid. We further validate these findings in a controlled synthetic algorithm-discovery environment, which reproduces qualitatively the search dynamics observed with the LLMs."

Furthermore, its applicability is limited to systems with spin-orbit coupling, which motivates the need for alternative measures of chirality. In this work, we explore two complementary measures of chirality: electron chirality and hydrodynamic helicity. By analyzing a minimal atomic model under chiral crystal fields, we clarify how the interplay among crystal fields, spin-orbit coupling, and electron correlation gives rise to non-zero values of chirality measures. Although electron chirality increases with both spin-orbit coupling and chiral crystal field strength, the dependence on these two factors is highly non-trivial. Particularly, when the chiral crystal field is varied continuously and the energy levels approach quasidegenerate points, the electron chirality is insensitive to spin-orbit coupling, resulting in a remarkable enhancement of chirality. In contrast, the hydrodynamic helicity, defined as a two-body pseudoscalar quantity, remains non-zero even without spin-orbit coupling, originating from electron-electron interactions. Perturbative analysis reveals distinct symmetry selection rules governing the two quantities. Our results provide fundamental insight into the origin of chiralities in electronic systems."

For an open elliptical microcavity in the strong-interaction A.C. regime, we find a distinctive sector-resolved response: amplitude statistics tighten while phase statistics broaden maximally at the mixing point, and conditioning reveals strong amplitude-phase dependence. By introducing a coarse position label and the associated co-information, we further show that the enhancement of global amplitude-phase coupling is strongly shaped by spatial heterogeneity across the cavity."

    "abstract": "Many strong decoding methods for text generation follow a sample-and-rerank paradigm: they draw multiple candidates, score each under a utility (reward) function using consensus across samples, and return the best one. Although effective, these methods incur high computational costs during inference due to repeated sampling and scoring. Prior attempts to amortize inference-time computation typically rely on gold references, teacher labels, or curated preference data, increasing dataset construction effort and the demand for high-fidelity reward models. We propose Consensus Group Relative Policy Optimization (C-GRPO), which distills Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) decoding into training by formulating the consensus utility as a group-relative objective within GRPO. C-GRPO requires only a utility function and policy samples, without gold references or explicit preference labels. Under ideal conditions, we show that the objective function of C-GRPO is directionally aligned with the gradient of the expected-utility objective underlying MBR decoding, leading to a convergence guarantee. Experiments on machine translation (WMT 2024) and text summarization (XSum) demonstrate that C-GRPO successfully achieves performance comparable to MBR decoding without the associated inference-time overhead, while outperforming reference-free baseline methods."

In this essay, we first explain why the heterogeneity is needed in the organization of SE research, then present the current trend of SE research nowadays, as well as the consequences and potential futures. The choice is at our hands, and we urge our community to seriously consider maintaining the heterogeneity in the organization of software engineering research."

    "abstract": "Food choices shape both human and planetary health; yet, designing foods that are delicious, nutritious, and sustainable remains challenging. Here we show that generative artificial intelligence can learn the structure of the human palate directly from large-scale, human-generated recipe data to create novel foods within a structured design space. Using burgers as a model system, the generative AI rediscovers the classic Big Mac without explicit supervision and generates novel burgers optimized for deliciousness, sustainability, or nutrition. Compared to the Big Mac, its delicious burgers score the same or better in overall liking, flavor, and texture in a blinded sensory evaluation conducted in a restaurant setting with 101 participants; its mushroom burger achieves an environmental impact score more than an order of magnitude lower; and its bean burger attains nearly twice the nutritional score. Together, these results establish generative AI as a quantitative framework for learning human taste and navigating complex trade-offs in principled food design."

    "abstract": "Quadruped robots are used for primary searches during the early stages of indoor fires. A typical primary search involves quickly and thoroughly looking for victims under hazardous conditions and monitoring flammable materials. However, situational awareness in complex indoor environments and rapid stair climbing across different staircases remain the main challenges for robot-assisted primary searches. In this project, we designed a two-stage end-to-end deep reinforcement learning (RL) approach to optimize both navigation and locomotion. In the first stage, the quadrupeds, Unitree Go2, were trained to climb stairs in Isaac Lab's pyramid-stair terrain. In the second stage, the quadrupeds were trained to climb various realistic indoor staircases in the Isaac Lab engine, with the learned policy transferred from the previous stage. These indoor staircases are straight, L-shaped, and spiral, to support climbing tasks in complex environments. This project explores how to balance navigation and locomotion and how end-to-end RL methods can enable quadrupeds to adapt to different stair shapes. Our main contributions are: (1) A two-stage end-to-end RL framework that transfers stair-climbing skills from abstract pyramid terrain to realistic indoor stair topologies. (2) A centerline-based navigation formulation that enables unified learning of navigation and locomotion without hierarchical planning. (3) Demonstration of policy generalization across diverse staircases using only local height-map perception. (4) An empirical analysis of success, efficiency, and failure modes under increasing stair difficulty."

We also analyze architectures that enforce geometry only at the output, proving a separate universal approximation property that enables direct comparison to interleaved designs. When the constraint set is unknown, we learn projections via small-time heat-kernel limits, showing diffusion/flow-matching can be used as data-based projections. Experiments on dynamics over S^2 and SO(3), and diffusion on S^{d-1}-valued features demonstrate exact feasibility for analytic updates and strong performance for learned projections"

We present \\textbf{FlashSinkhorn}, an IO-aware EOT solver for squared Euclidean cost that rewrites stabilized log-domain Sinkhorn updates as row-wise LogSumExp reductions of biased dot-product scores, the same normalization as transformer attention. This enables FlashAttention-style fusion and tiling: fused Triton kernels stream tiles through on-chip SRAM and update dual potentials in a single pass, substantially reducing HBM IO per iteration while retaining linear-memory operations. We further provide streaming kernels for transport application, enabling scalable first- and second-order optimization. On A100 GPUs, FlashSinkhorn achieves up to $32\\times$ forward-pass and $161\\times$ end-to-end speedups over state-of-the-art online baselines on point-cloud OT, improves scalability on OT-based downstream tasks.

On difficult problems, an LLM may fail to produce a correct final answer, yet still provide reliable pairwise comparison signals indicating which of two candidate solutions is better. We leverage this observation to design a statistically efficient evaluation framework that combines standard labeled outcomes with pairwise comparison signals obtained by having models judge auxiliary reasoning chains. Treating these comparison signals as control variates, we develop a semiparametric estimator based on the efficient influence function (EIF) for the setting where auxiliary reasoning chains are observed. This yields a one-step estimator that achieves the semiparametric efficiency bound, guarantees strict variance reduction over naive sample averaging, and admits asymptotic normality for principled uncertainty quantification. Across simulations, our one-step estimator substantially improves ranking accuracy, with gains increasing as model output noise grows. Experiments on GPQA Diamond, AIME 2025, and GSM8K further demonstrate more precise performance estimation and more reliable model rankings, especially in small-sample regimes where conventional evaluation is pretty unstable."

While prior research treats single-agent and multi-agent performativity as distinct phenomena, this paper introduces a unified statistical inference framework that bridges these contexts, treating the former as a special case of the latter. Our contribution is two-fold. First, we put forward the Repeated Risk Minimization (RRM) procedure for estimating the performative stability, and establish a rigorous inferential theory for admitting its asymptotic normality and confirming its asymptotic efficiency. Second, for the performative optimality, we introduce a novel two-step plug-in estimator that integrates the idea of Recalibrated Prediction Powered Inference (RePPI) with Importance Sampling, and further provide formal derivations for the Central Limit Theorems of both the underlying distributional parameters and the plug-in results. The theoretical analysis demonstrates that our estimator achieves the semiparametric efficiency bound and maintains robustness under mild distributional misspecification. This work provides a principled toolkit for reliable estimation and decision-making in dynamic, performative environments."

We characterise broad classes of confining potentials for which the equilibrium measure is supported on the unit ball and admits an explicit density. Our main contribution is a converse construction: starting from a prescribed radially symmetric equilibrium density given as a power series in the squared radius, we determine the associated external potential and establish the corresponding Euler-Lagrange variational conditions. A key ingredient in the proof is an identity between two ${}_3F_2$ hypergeometric functions evaluated at unit argument, which is of independent interest. As applications, we identify the external potentials corresponding to equilibrium densities proportional to $(1-|x|^2)^α$, $α>-1$, and show that these potentials can be expressed in terms of Gauss hypergeometric functions ${}_2F_1$, reducing to polynomials for special values of $α$. We also determine the equilibrium measure associated with purely power-type external potentials, often referred to as Freud or Mittag--Leffler potentials in the context of log gases, for which the equilibrium density admits an explicit ${}_2F_1$ representation. Furthermore, we apply our framework to a Coulomb gas in dimension $d+1$ confined by a harmonic potential to the half-space. We derive a necessary condition under which the equilibrium measure is fully supported on the boundary hyperplane of dimension $d$, with the induced density corresponding to that of a Riesz gas with exponent $s=d-1$."

For this, we developed our Ocean-Heat-Content Physics and Time Macro Economic Model (OPTiMEM) to estimate future heat content (separately published). The heat conjecture assumes that weather damages curves are stochastically proportional to ocean heat increase. We model carbon combustion, validate to datasets for greenhouse gas (GHG), temperature, and ocean heat content (OHC). We show that the social cost of 4 GHGs: CO2, CH4, N2O and halogenated hydrocarbons, cannot be single values, but must be represented by a kind of economic phase space. We propose very long-term carbon bonds to implement real discounting. This obviates the Gordian knot of the descriptivist versus prescriptivist discount disagreement that is unsolvable. Implementing these bonds leads to a new monitoring metric: real-dollar spending and bond discount rates compared to SC-GHG cost with variation on the discount scale, where the discount has no relationship to the pure rate of time preference (PRTP). This heat conjecture is based on OPTiMEM. OPTiMEM initiates from a fossil fuel consumption function to produce CO2, with 18 scenarios implemented to provide the uncertainty range. We provide 1:N year loss risk models (1:10, 1:100, 1:1000) that government, engineers, and actuaries should find useful. A scenario implementing DICE family of models carbon and growth assumptions shows +18° C is breached by 2210 CE, and +110° C by 2300 CE -- both of which outcomes are obviously not compatible with the fairly rosy conclusions of DICE models. Concerns are raised about having enough low-cost fossil fuel for conversion to minimal CO$_2$ maximal energy return on energy invested (EROEI) power if nations wait too long, and low EROEI power is questioned because monetary value is dependent on energy."

Given a query, VOILA uses a two-stage pipeline: a gradient-boosted regressor estimates correctness likelihood at each fidelity from question features alone, then an isotonic calibrator refines these probabilities for reliable decision-making. The system selects the minimum-cost fidelity maximizing expected utility given predicted accuracy and retrieval costs. We evaluate VOILA across three deployment scenarios using five datasets (VQA-v2, GQA, TextVQA, LoCoMo, FloodNet) and six Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with 7B-235B parameters. VOILA consistently achieves 50-60% cost reductions while retaining 90-95% of full-resolution accuracy across diverse query types and model architectures, demonstrating that pre-retrieval fidelity selection is vital to optimize multimodal inference under resource constraints."

To tackle this challenge, we propose RPL, a two-stage training framework that enables multi-directional locomotion on challenging terrains, and remains robust with payloads. RPL first trains terrain-specific expert policies with privileged height map observations to master decoupled locomotion and manipulation skills across different terrains, and then distills them into a transformer policy that leverages multiple depth cameras to cover a wide range of views. During distillation, we introduce two techniques to robustify multi-directional locomotion, depth feature scaling based on velocity commands and random side masking, which are critical for asymmetric depth observations and unseen widths of terrains. For scalable depth distillation, we develop an efficient multi-depth system that ray-casts against both dynamic robot meshes and static terrain meshes in massively parallel environments, achieving a 5-times speedup over the depth rendering pipelines in existing simulators while modeling realistic sensor latency, noise, and dropout. Extensive real-world experiments demonstrate robust multi-directional locomotion with payloads (2kg) across challenging terrains, including 20° slopes, staircases with different step lengths (22 cm, 25 cm, 30 cm), and 25 cm by 25 cm stepping stones separated by 60 cm gaps."

We propose a set of Security-Aware Guidelines for Evaluating anomaly detectors in 5G Core Network (SAGE-5GC), driven by domain knowledge and consideration of potential adversarial threats. Using a realistic 5G Core dataset, we first train several anomaly detectors and assess their baseline performance against standard 5GC control-plane cyberattacks targeting PFCP-based network services.We then extend the evaluation to adversarial settings, where an attacker tries to manipulate the observable features of the network traffic to evade detection, under the constraint that the intended functionality of the malicious traffic is preserved. Starting from a selected set of controllable features, we analyze model sensitivity and adversarial robustness through randomized perturbations. Finally, we introduce a practical optimization strategy based on genetic algorithms that operates exclusively on attacker-controllable features and does not require prior knowledge of the underlying detection model. Our experimental results show that adversarially crafted attacks can substantially degrade detection performance, underscoring the need for robust, security-aware evaluation methodologies for anomaly detection in 5G networks deployed in the wild."

We theoretically show that activation perturbation induces a principled transition from sample-dependent to model-dependent behavior by suppressing input-specific signals and amplifying representation-level structure, and further establish that input perturbation corresponds to a constrained special case of this framework. Through representative case studies, we demonstrate the practical advantages of APEX. In the small-noise regime, APEX provides a lightweight and efficient measure of sample regularity that aligns with established metrics, while also distinguishing structured from randomly labeled models and revealing semantically coherent prediction transitions. In the large-noise regime, APEX exposes training-induced model-level biases, including a pronounced concentration of predictions on the target class in backdoored models. Overall, our results show that APEX offers an effective perspective for exploring, and understanding neural networks beyond what is accessible from input space alone."

We further unify existing training-free guided generation methods. To address their inability to approximate conditional covariance in high dimensions, we develop a time- and memory-efficient algorithm for approximate covariance estimation. Experiments on a controlled 2D study and high-fidelity 3D aerodynamic benchmarks (car and aircraft), validated by OpenFOAM simulations and miniature wind-tunnel tests with 3D-printed prototypes, demonstrate consistent gains in both optimization and guided generation.

Then, focusing on the CMMSE and LMMSE combining schemes, we propose five low-complexity distributed combining schemes based on the matrix approximation methodology or the symmetric successive over relaxation (SSOR) algorithm. More specifically, we propose two matrix approximation methodology-aided combining schemes: Global Statistics \\& Local Instantaneous information-based MMSE (GSLI-MMSE) and Statistics matrix Inversion-based LMMSE (SI-LMMSE). These two schemes are derived by approximating the global instantaneous information in the CMMSE combining and the local instantaneous information in the LMMSE combining with the global and local statistics information by asymptotic analysis and matrix expectation approximation, respectively. Moreover, by applying the low-complexity SSOR algorithm to iteratively solve the matrix inversion in the LMMSE combining, we derive three distributed SSOR-based LMMSE combining schemes, distinguished from the applied information and initial values."

While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this by integrating external corpora, its effectiveness is limited by fragmented information in unstructured domain documents. Graph-augmented RAG (GraphRAG) emerged to enhance contextual reasoning through structured knowledge graphs, yet paradoxically underperforms vanilla RAG in real-world scenarios, exhibiting significant accuracy drops and prohibitive latency despite gains on complex queries. We identify the rigid application of GraphRAG to all queries, regardless of complexity, as the root cause. To resolve this, we propose an efficient and adaptive GraphRAG framework called EA-GraphRAG that dynamically integrates RAG and GraphRAG paradigms through syntax-aware complexity analysis. Our approach introduces: (i) a syntactic feature constructor that parses each query and extracts a set of structural features; (ii) a lightweight complexity scorer that maps these features to a continuous complexity score; and (iii) a score-driven routing policy that selects dense RAG for low-score queries, invokes graph-based retrieval for high-score queries, and applies complexity-aware reciprocal rank fusion to handle borderline cases. Extensive experiments on a comprehensive benchmark, consisting of two single-hop and two multi-hop QA benchmarks, demonstrate that our EA-GraphRAG significantly improves accuracy, reduces latency, and achieves state-of-the-art performance in handling mixed scenarios involving both simple and complex queries."

    "abstract": "The Euclid spacecraft, located at the second Lagrangian point of the Sun-Earth system, hosts the Near-Infrared Spectrometer and Photometer (NISP) instrument. NISP is equipped with a mosaic of 16 HgCdTe-based detectors to acquire near-infrared photometric and spectroscopic data. To meet the spacecraft's constraints on computational resources and telemetry bandwidth, the near-infrared signal is processed onboard via a dedicated hardware-software architecture designed to fulfil the stringent Euclid's data-quality requirements. A custom application software, running on the two NISP data processing units, implements the NISP signal estimator: an ad-hoc algorithm which delivers accurate flux measurements and simultaneously estimates the quality of signal estimation through the quality factor parameter. This paper investigates the properties of the NISP signal estimator by evaluating its performance during the early flight operations of the NISP instrument. First, we revisit the assumptions on which the inference of the near-infrared signal is based and investigate the origin of the main systematics of the signal estimator through Monte Carlo simulations. Then, we test the flight performance of the NISP signal estimator. Results indicate a systematic bias lower than 0.01 e/s for 99% of the NISP pixel array, well within the noise budget of the estimated signal. We also derive an analytical expression for the variance of the NISP signal estimator, demonstrating its validity, particularly when the covariance matrix is not pre-computed. Finally, we provide a robust statistical framework to interpret the QF parameter, analyse its dependence on the signal estimator bias, and show its sensitivity to cosmic ray hits on NISP detectors. Our findings corroborate previous results on the NISP signal estimator and suggest a leading-order correction based on the agreement between flight data and simulations."

    "abstract": "Sepsis is a heterogeneous syndrome. Identifying clinically distinct phenotypes may enable more precise treatment strategies. In recent years, many researchers have applied clustering algorithms to sepsis patients. However, the clustering process rarely incorporates clinical relevance, potentially limiting to reflect clinically distinct phenotypes. We propose NPCNet, a novel deep clustering network with a target navigator that integrates temporal Electronic Health Records (EHRs) to better align sepsis phenotypes with clinical significance. We identify four sepsis phenotypes ($α$, $β$, $γ$, and $δ$) with divergence in SOFA trajectories. Notably, while $α$ and $δ$ phenotypes both show severe conditions in the early stage, NPCNet effectively differentiates patients who are likely to improve ($α$) from those at risk of deterioration ($δ$). Furthermore, through the treatment effect analysis, we discover that $α$, $β$, and $δ$ phenotypes may benefit from early vasopressor administration. The results show that NPCNet enhances precision treatment strategies by uncovering clinically distinct phenotypes."

We begin by revisiting this setting, showing that under a reasonable condition, every locally convex topological vector space $E$ that contains and is spanned by a compact convex set lying in a hyperplane not passing through the origin, is a (specific) dual Banach space equipped with the weak* topology. Second, we establish the corresponding regularity theory for convex sets in complex LCTVS's. Third, we develop a theory of regular embeddings for complex noncommutative convex sets, in the sense of Davidson and Kennedy. Finally, we use the complex theory to derive a theory of regular embeddings for real noncommutative convex sets. Interestingly, at present there appears to be no direct route to the latter."

    "abstract": "Multi-organ segmentation is a widely applied clinical routine and automated organ segmentation tools dramatically improve the pipeline of the radiologists. Recently, deep learning (DL) based segmentation models have shown the capacity to accomplish such a task. However, the training of the segmentation networks requires large amount of data with manual annotations, which is a major concern due to the data scarcity from clinic. Working with limited data is still common for researches on novel imaging modalities. To enhance the effectiveness of DL models trained with limited data, data augmentation (DA) is a crucial regularization technique. Traditional DA (TDA) strategies focus on basic intra-image operations, i.e. generating images with different orientations and intensity distributions. In contrast, the interimage and object-level DA operations are able to create new images from separate individuals. However, such DA strategies are not well explored on the task of multi-organ segmentation. In this paper, we investigated four possible inter-image DA strategies: CutMix, CarveMix, ObjectAug and AnatoMix, on two organ segmentation datasets. The result shows that CutMix, CarveMix and AnatoMix can improve the average dice score by 4.9, 2.0 and 1.9, compared with the state-of-the-art nnUNet without DA strategies. These results can be further improved by adding TDA strategies. It is revealed in our experiments that Cut-Mix is a robust but simple DA strategy to drive up the segmentation performance for multi-organ segmentation, even when CutMix produces intuitively 'wrong' images. Our implementation is publicly available for future benchmarks."

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are trained and tested extensively on symbolic representations such as code and graphs, yet real-world user tasks are often specified in natural language. To what extent can LLMs generalize across these representations? Here, we approach this question by studying isomorphic tasks involving procedures represented in code, graphs, and natural language (e.g., scheduling steps in planning). We find that training LLMs with popular post-training methods on graphs or code data alone does not reliably generalize to corresponding natural language tasks, while training solely on natural language can lead to inefficient performance gains. To address this gap, we propose a two-stage data curriculum that first trains on symbolic, then natural language data. The curriculum substantially improves model performance across model families and tasks. Remarkably, a 1.5B Qwen model trained by our method can closely match zero-shot GPT-4o in naturalistic planning. Finally, our analysis suggests that successful cross-representation generalization can be interpreted as a form of generative analogy, which our curriculum effectively encourages."

    "abstract": "Reliance on generative AI can reduce cultural variance and diversity, especially in creative work. This reduction in variance has already led to problems in model performance, including model collapse and hallucination. In this paper, we examine the long-term consequences of AI use for human cultural evolution and the conditions under which widespread AI use may lead to \"cultural collapse\", a process in which reliance on AI-generated content reduces human variation and innovation and slows cumulative cultural evolution. Using an agent-based model and evolutionary game theory, we compare two types of AI use: complement and substitute. AI-complement users seek suggestions and guidance while remaining the main producers of the final output, whereas AI-substitute users provide minimal input, and rely on AI to produce most of the output. We then study how these use strategies compete and spread under evolutionary dynamics. We find that AI-substitute users prevail under individual-level selection despite the stronger reduction in cultural variance. By contrast, AI-complement users can benefit their groups by maintaining the variance needed for exploration, and can therefore be favored under cultural group selection when group boundaries are strong. Overall, our findings shed light on the long-term, population-level effects of AI adoption and inform policy and organizational strategies to mitigate these risks."

This work started as an attempt to understand the strong downstream classification performance of MAE. In this process we discover that representations learned with the pretraining and fine-tuning, are quite robust - demonstrating a good classification performance in the presence of degradations, such as blur and occlusions. Through layer-wise analysis of token embeddings, we show that pretrained MAE progressively constructs its latent space in a class-aware manner across network depth: embeddings from different classes lie in subspaces that become increasingly separable. We further observe that MAE exhibits early and persistent global attention across encoder layers, in contrast to standard Vision Transformers (ViTs). To quantify feature robustness, we introduce two sensitivity indicators: directional alignment between clean and perturbed embeddings, and head-wise retention of active features under degradations. These studies help establish the robust classification performance of MAEs."

    "abstract": "Recent theoretical and observational analysis of the interaction between the Milky Way (MW) and LMC suggest that it has a significant dynamical impact on the MW's stellar halo. We investigate this effect using simulations from the Latte project, a simulation suite from the Feedback In Realistic Environments 2 (FIRE-2) Project. By comparing simulations with and without an LMC-analog interaction, we show that fully cosmological LMC interactions create prominent velocity asymmetry in the stellar halo of the MW, resulting from both barycentric displacement (the \"reflex motion\") and the dynamical wake of the LMC. The strength and direction of this asymmetry depend on the mass ratio at pericenter and orbit of the LMC analog. We perform a spherical-harmonic decomposition of the velocities of halo star particles to confirm that the identified signatures are LMC-induced and persist even when LMC star particles are removed. We also show that this strategy separates and individually detects the dipole (l=1) of the global reflex motion and the quadrupole (l=2) of the local wake. These asymmetries are consistent with those identified in previous work using non-cosmological simulations; the dipole is easily distinguishable from other complex halo substructure using spherical harmonics while the quadrupole is sometimes confused. These findings support the detectability of MW--LMC interaction signatures in upcoming observational surveys of the MW stellar halo."

In the static setting, state-of-the-art designs such as XOR and fuse filters achieve low overhead and very fast queries, but their peeling-based construction succeeds only with high probability, which complicates deterministic builds \\cite{graf2020xor,graf2022binary,ulrich2023taxor}. We introduce \\emph{ZOR filters}, a deterministic continuation of XOR/fuse filters that guarantees construction termination while preserving the same XOR-based query mechanism. ZOR replaces restart-on-failure with deterministic peeling that abandons a small fraction of keys, and restores false-positive-only semantics by storing the remainder in a compact auxiliary structure. In our experiments, the abandoned fraction drops below $1\\%$ for moderate arity (e.g., $N\\ge 5$), so the auxiliary handles a negligible fraction of keys. As a result, ZOR filters can achieve overhead within $1\\%$ of the information-theoretic lower bound $\\log_2(1/\\varepsilon)$ while retaining fuse-like query performance; the additional cost is concentrated on negative queries due to the auxiliary check. Our current prototype builds several-fold slower than highly optimized fuse builders because it maintains explicit incidence information during deterministic peeling; closing this optimisation gap is an engineering target."

We define an effective diameter D_eff from the Mach-1 contour of the time-averaged irrotational flow around the obstacle, which delineates the local supersonic region where quantized vortices nucleate. Using this flow-defined length scale, we construct a superfluid Reynolds number Re_s = (v0 minus vc) times D_eff divided by (hbar over m), where v0 is the flow speed, vc is the critical velocity, and m is the particle mass. We show that Re_s organizes the wake dynamics across obstacle sizes and strengths: the transition from dipole-row emission to alternating vortex cluster shedding occurs at Re_s around 2, and both the Strouhal number and the drag coefficient collapse onto universal curves when plotted as functions of Re_s. These results extend the concept of dynamic similarity in superfluid flows to penetrable obstacles and demonstrate that the dynamically relevant length scale is determined by the supersonic region rather than by the geometric obstacle size."

This problem has immediate relevance in standardized communication systems where the decoder acquires side information or priors about the true distribution that are unavailable to the fixed encoder. We formally define the mismatched quantization problem, demonstrating that the optimal reconstruction rule, termed generative decompression, aligns with classical Bayesian estimation by taking the conditional expectation under the true distribution given the quantization indices and adapting it to fixed-encoder constraints. This strategy effectively performs a generative Bayesian correction on the decoder side, strictly outperforming the conventional centroid rule. We extend this framework to transmission over noisy channels, deriving a robust soft-decoding rule that quantifies the inefficiency of standard modular source--channel separation architectures under mismatch. Furthermore, we generalize the approach to task-oriented decoding, showing that the optimal strategy shifts from conditional mean estimation to maximum a posteriori (MAP) detection. Experimental results on Gaussian sources and deep-learning-based semantic classification demonstrate that generative decompression closes a vast majority of the performance gap to the ideal joint-optimization benchmark, enabling adaptive, high-fidelity reconstruction without modifying the encoder."

The cluster is considered at the evolutionary stage dominated by Wolf-Rayet stars. This stage occurs in clusters with ages of several million years, close to the onset of supernova explosions; the well-known objects Westerlund 1 and 2 are the prototypes. The collisions of powerful winds from massive stars in the cluster core, calculated as interactions of individual outflows, are accompanied by their partial thermalization and produce a collective cluster wind. The MHD dynamics of the cluster wind bubble expansion into the interstellar medium is considered, depending on the density of the surrounding medium with a uniform magnetic field. We show that when expanding into a cold neutral medium, the cluster wind is able to reshape its surrounding environment over the Wolf-Rayet star lifetime, sweeping up more than $10^4$ $M_{\\odot}$ of gas in $\\sim 2 \\times 10^5$ yr and producing extended, thin and dense shells with an amplified magnetic field. In a cold neutral medium with a density of $\\sim 20$ cm$^{-3}$ and a magnetic field of $\\sim 3.5$ $μ$G, a thin shell forms around the cluster wind bubble, characterized by a cellular structure in its density and magnetic field distributions. The cellular magnetic field structure appears in parts of the shell expanding transversely to the orientation of the external magnetic field. Magnetic fields in the shell are amplified to strengths $\\gtrsim 50$ $μ$G. The formation of the cellular structure is associated with the development of instabilities. The expansion of the bubble into a warm neutral interstellar medium also leads to the formation of a shell with an amplified magnetic field."

This review compares the observational characteristics, detection methods, and physical interpretations of QPPs in both solar and stellar contexts. Solar flare QPPs, extensively studied in X-rays and EUV bands using instruments such as GOES, STIX, and Fermi, display typical periods of tens of seconds and show correlations with flare duration and magnetic loop length. Stellar QPPs, observed in X-rays and white light by missions such as Kepler, TESS, and XMM-Newton, exhibit much longer periods - ranging from minutes to hours - consistent with larger-scale magnetic structures in more active stars. Despite differences in scale and observing band, statistical and comparative studies reveal common scaling relations and damping behaviors, suggesting that both solar and stellar QPPs are manifestations of the same fundamental mechanisms, likely magnetohydrodynamic oscillations or oscillatory reconnection within flare loops. The comparison underscores a continuity between solar and stellar magnetic activity, linking the solar detailed physical processes to stellar-scale phenomena and providing constraints for future models and surveys."

We detect H$_2$O at 20$σ$ and CO at 5$σ$, confirming the extremely extended atmosphere of this low-mass giant. A velocity offset of $-2.9 \\pm 0.2$~km~s$^{-1}$ indicates day-to-night winds. The rotation velocity is constrained to $<1.8$~km~s$^{-1}$ at 3$σ$, consistent with tidal locking. Retrieval analysis suggests a planetary mass of 29.8 $\\pm$ 3 Earth masses and a vertically isothermal atmosphere. This mass is two times larger than the mass estimated from JWST atmospheric observations and inconsistent at 3$σ$ hence leaving a doubt on the actual planetary density of the planet. Using the mass derived derived from the CRIRES+ data, we derive a C/O ratio of $0.83 \\pm 0.09$, about 1.5 times solar, and a subsolar metallicity [C+O/H]~$= -0.8 \\pm 0.4$ which can be increased if the atmosphere is cloudy, a degeneracy our data alone cannot resolve. We report a tentative 2$σ$ detection of HDO with an extreme enrichment factor of $\\sim$1000 relative to the protosolar D/H ratio. If confirmed, this would be the first detection of deuterium in an exoplanet atmosphere and would require intense escape rate to be explained."

    "abstract": "Medical audio classification remains challenging due to low signal-to-noise ratios, subtle discriminative features, and substantial intra-class variability, often compounded by class imbalance and limited training data. Synthetic data augmentation has been proposed as a potential strategy to mitigate these constraints; however, prior studies report inconsistent methodological approaches and mixed empirical results. In this preliminary study, we explore the impact of synthetic augmentation on respiratory sound classification using a baseline deep convolutional neural network trained on a moderately imbalanced dataset (73%:27%). Three generative augmentation strategies (variational autoencoders, generative adversarial networks, and diffusion models) were assessed under controlled experimental conditions. The baseline model without augmentation achieved an F1-score of 0.645. Across individual augmentation strategies, performance gains were not observed, with several configurations demonstrating neutral or degraded classification performance. Only an ensemble of augmented models yielded a modest improvement in F1-score (0.664). These findings suggest that, for medical audio classification, synthetic augmentation may not consistently enhance performance when applied to a standard CNN classifier. Future work should focus on delineating task-specific data characteristics, model-augmentation compatibility, and evaluation frameworks necessary for synthetic augmentation to be effective in medical audio applications."

This study employs deep learning techniques, utilising a ResNet34 model capable of recognising over 10,000 bird species, to explore avian morphological evolution. We extract weights from the model's final fully connected (fc) layer and investigate the semantic alignment between the high-dimensional embedding space learned by the model and biological phenotypes. The results demonstrate that the high-dimensional embedding space encodes phenotypic convergence. Subsequently, we assess the morphological disparity among various taxa and evaluate the association between morphological disparity and species richness, demonstrating that species richness is the primary driver of morphospace expansion. Moreover, the disparity-through-time analysis reveals a visual \"early burst\" after the K-Pg extinction. While mainly aimed at evolutionary analysis, this study also provides insights into the interpretability of Deep Neural Networks. We demonstrate that hierarchical semantic structures (biological taxonomy) emerged in the high-dimensional embedding space despite being trained on flat labels. Furthermore, through adversarial examples, we provide evidence that our model in this task can overcome texture bias and learn holistic shape representations (body plans), challenging the prevailing view that CNNs rely primarily on local textures."

However, setting the token budget, as well as the threshold for adaptive reasoning, is a practical challenge that entails a fundamental risk-accuracy trade-off. We re-frame the budget setting problem as risk control, limiting the error rate while minimizing compute. Our framework introduces an upper threshold that stops reasoning when the model is confident (risking incorrect output) and a novel parametric lower threshold that preemptively stops unsolvable instances (risking premature stoppage). Given a target risk and a validation set, we use distribution-free risk control to optimally specify these stopping mechanisms. For scenarios with multiple budget controlling criteria, we incorporate an efficiency loss to select the most computationally efficient exiting mechanism. Empirical results across diverse reasoning tasks and models demonstrate the effectiveness of our risk control approach, demonstrating computational efficiency gains from the lower threshold and ensemble stopping mechanisms while adhering to the user-specified risk target."

In this work, we investigate the thermodynamic role of such defects in the widely observed 12-fold symmetric square-triangle quasicrystal. We develop a new Monte Carlo simulation to compute the configurational entropy of square-triangle tilings augmented to contain two types of irregular hexagons as defect tiles. We find that the introduction of defects leads to a notable entropy gain, with each defect contributing considerably more than a conventional vacancy in a periodic crystal. Intriguingly, the entropy gain is not simply due to individual defect types but isamplified by their combinatorial mixing. We then apply our findings to a microscopic model of core-corona particles interacting via a square-shoulder potential. By combining the configurational entropy with vibrational free-energy calculations, we predict the equilibrium defect concentration and confirm that the quasicrystalline phase contains a higher concentration of point-defects than a typical periodic crystal. These results provide a new understanding of the prominence of observed defects in soft-matter quasicrystals."

    "abstract": "Existing methods for human motion control in video generation typically rely on either 2D poses or explicit 3D parametric models (e.g., SMPL) as control signals. However, 2D poses rigidly bind motion to the driving viewpoint, precluding novel-view synthesis. Explicit 3D models, though structurally informative, suffer from inherent inaccuracies (e.g., depth ambiguity and inaccurate dynamics) which, when used as a strong constraint, override the powerful intrinsic 3D awareness of large-scale video generators. In this work, we revisit motion control from a 3D-aware perspective, advocating for an implicit, view-agnostic motion representation that naturally aligns with the generator's spatial priors rather than depending on externally reconstructed constraints. We introduce 3DiMo, which jointly trains a motion encoder with a pretrained video generator to distill driving frames into compact, view-agnostic motion tokens, injected semantically via cross-attention. To foster 3D awareness, we train with view-rich supervision (i.e., single-view, multi-view, and moving-camera videos), forcing motion consistency across diverse viewpoints. Additionally, we use auxiliary geometric supervision that leverages SMPL only for early initialization and is annealed to zero, enabling the model to transition from external 3D guidance to learning genuine 3D spatial motion understanding from the data and the generator's priors. Experiments confirm that 3DiMo faithfully reproduces driving motions with flexible, text-driven camera control, significantly surpassing existing methods in both motion fidelity and visual quality."

This raises a fundamental question: what limits scaling, and why does diversity help? We present an information-theoretic framework showing that MAS performance is bounded by the intrinsic task uncertainty, not by agent count. We derive architecture-agnostic bounds demonstrating that improvements depend on how many effective channels the system accesses. Homogeneous agents saturate early because their outputs are strongly correlated, whereas heterogeneous agents contribute complementary evidence. We further introduce $K^*$, an effective channel count that quantifies the number of effective channels without ground-truth labels. Empirically, we show that heterogeneous configurations consistently outperform homogeneous scaling: 2 diverse agents can match or exceed the performance of 16 homogeneous agents. Our results provide principled guidelines for building efficient and robust MAS through diversity-aware design.

    "abstract": "We investigate the direct and inverse Mpemba effects within the framework of the time-delayed Newton's law of cooling by introducing and analyzing the Descartes protocol, a three-reservoir thermal scheme in which each sample undergoes a single-step quench at different times. This protocol enables a transparent separation of the roles of the delay time $τ$, the waiting time $t_{\\text{w}}$, and the normalized warm temperature $ω$, thus providing a flexible setting to characterize anomalous thermal relaxation. For instantaneous quenches, exact conditions for the existence of the Mpemba effect are obtained as bounds on $ω$ for given $τ$ and $t_{\\text{w}}$. Within those bounds, the effect becomes maximal at a specific value $ω=\\widetildeω(t_{\\text{w}})$, and its magnitude is quantified by the extremal value of the temperature-difference function at this optimum. Accurate and compact approximations for both $\\widetildeω(t_{\\text{w}})$ and the maximal magnitude $\\text{Mp}(t_{\\text{w}})$ are derived, showing in particular that the absolute maximum at fixed $τ$ is reached for $t_{\\text{w}}=τ$. A comparison with a previously studied two-reservoir protocol reveals that, despite its additional control parameter, the Descartes protocol yields a smaller maximal magnitude of the effect. The analysis is extended to finite-rate quenches, where strict equality of bath conditions prevents a genuine Mpemba effect, although an approximate one survives when the bath time scale is sufficiently short. The developed framework offers a unified and analytically tractable approach that can be readily applied to other multi-step thermal protocols."

    "abstract": "Machine unlearning is the process of efficiently removing specific information from a trained machine learning model without retraining from scratch. Existing unlearning methods, which often provide provable guarantees, typically involve retraining a subset of model parameters based on a forget set. While these approaches show promise in certain scenarios, their underlying assumptions are often challenged in real-world applications -- particularly when applied to generative models. Furthermore, updating parameters using these unlearning procedures often degrades the general-purpose capabilities the model acquired during pre-training. Motivated by these shortcomings, this paper considers the paradigm of inference time unlearning -- wherein, the generative model is equipped with an (approximately correct) verifier that judges whether the model's response satisfies appropriate unlearning guarantees. This paper introduces a framework that iteratively refines the quality of the generated responses using feedback from the verifier without updating the model parameters. The proposed framework leverages conformal prediction to reduce computational overhead and provide distribution-free unlearning guarantees. This paper's approach significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, reducing unlearning error by up to 93% across challenging unlearning benchmarks."

Realizing this promise for increasingly complex, long-horizon tasks has driven the rise of a sub-agent-as-tools paradigm for multi-turn task solving.

We address this challenge with a unified, framework-agnostic agent abstraction that models any agent as a tuple Instruction, Context, Tools, Model. This tuple acts as a compositional recipe for capabilities, enabling the system to spawn specialized executors for each task on demand. Building on this abstraction, we introduce an agentic system AOrchestra, where the central orchestrator concretizes the tuple at each step: it curates task-relevant context, selects tools and models, and delegates execution via on-the-fly automatic agent creation. Such designs enable reducing human engineering efforts, and remain framework-agnostic with plug-and-play support for diverse agents as task executors. It also enables a controllable performance-cost trade-off, allowing the system to approach Pareto-efficient. Across three challenging benchmarks (GAIA, SWE-Bench, Terminal-Bench), AOrchestra achieves 16.28% relative improvement against the strongest baseline when paired with Gemini-3-Flash.

However, brain shift invalidates the preoperative MRI after dural opening. Updated intraoperative brain MRI with brain shift compensation is crucial for enhancing the precision of neuronavigation systems and ensuring the optimal outcome of surgical interventions. Methodology: We propose NeuralShift, a U-Net-based model that predicts brain shift entirely from pre-operative MRI for patients undergoing temporal lobe resection. We evaluated our results using Target Registration Errors (TREs) computed on anatomical landmarks located on the resection side and along the midline, and DICE scores comparing predicted intraoperative masks with masks derived from intraoperative MRI. Results: Our experimental results show that our model can predict the global deformation of the brain (DICE of 0.97) with accurate local displacements (achieve landmark TRE as low as 1.12 mm), compensating for large brain shifts during temporal lobe removal neurosurgery. Conclusion: Our proposed model is capable of predicting the global deformation of the brain during temporal lobe resection using only preoperative images, providing potential opportunities to the surgical team to increase safety and efficiency of neurosurgery and better outcomes to patients.

In this work, we study soft context compression, where a long context is condensed into a small set of continuous representations. Existing methods typically re-purpose the LLM itself as a trainable compressor, relying on layer-by-layer self-attention to iteratively aggregate information. We argue that this paradigm suffers from two structural limitations: (i) progressive representation overwriting across layers (ii) uncoordinated allocation of compression capacity across tokens. We propose ComprExIT (Context Compression via Explicit Information Transmission), a lightweight framework that formulates soft compression into a new paradigm: explicit information transmission over frozen LLM hidden states. This decouples compression from the model's internal self-attention dynamics. ComprExIT performs (i) depth-wise transmission to selectively transmit multi-layer information into token anchors, mitigating progressive overwriting, and (ii) width-wise transmission to aggregate anchors into a small number of slots via a globally optimized transmission plan, ensuring coordinated allocation of information. Across six question-answering benchmarks, ComprExIT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art context compression methods while introducing only ~1% additional parameters, demonstrating that explicit and coordinated information transmission enables more effective and robust long-context compression."

Most existing approaches decouple perception from representation, treating the scene graph as a derivative layer generated post hoc. This limits both consistency and scalability. In contrast, we propose a mapping architecture where the 3DSSG serves as the foundational backend, acting as the primary knowledge representation for the entire mapping process. Our approach leverages prior work on incremental scene graph prediction to infer and update the graph structure in real-time as the environment is explored. This ensures that the map remains topologically consistent and computationally efficient, even during extended operations in large-scale settings. By maintaining an explicit, spatially grounded representation that supports both flat and hierarchical topologies, we bridge the gap between sub-symbolic raw sensor data and high-level symbolic reasoning. Consequently, this provides a stable, verifiable structure that knowledge-driven frameworks, ranging from knowledge graphs and ontologies to Large Language Models (LLMs), can directly exploit, enabling agents to operate with enhanced interpretability, trustworthiness, and alignment to human concepts."

Unlike risk-neutral objectives, the static CVaR of the return depends on entire trajectories without admitting a recursive Bellman decomposition in the underlying Markov decision process. A classical resolution relies on state augmentation with a continuous variable. However, unless restricted to a specialized class of admissible value functions, this formulation induces sparse rewards and degenerate fixed points. In this work, we propose a novel formulation of the static CVaR objective based on augmentation. Our alternative approach leads to a Bellman operator with: (1) dense per-step rewards; (2) contracting properties on the full space of bounded value functions. Building on this theoretical foundation, we develop risk-averse value iteration and model-free Q-learning algorithms that rely on discretized augmented states. We further provide convergence guarantees and approximation error bounds due to discretization. Empirical results demonstrate that our algorithms successfully learn CVaR-sensitive policies and achieve effective performance-safety trade-offs."

Using a recently discovered contiguity between appearance of strictly balanced subgraphs $F$ in a random graph, and random hypergraphs where copies of $F$ are generated independently, we show that the minimum value converges to a limit, when the expected number of copies of $F$ is linear in the number of nodes $|V|$. Furthermore, using the connections with mean field spin glass models, we obtain an asymptotic expression for this limit as the normalized expected number of copies of $F$ and the size of $F$ diverge to infinity."

    "abstract": "Discrete diffusion models have recently become competitive with autoregressive models for language modeling, even outperforming them on reasoning tasks requiring planning and global coherence, but they require more computation at inference time. We trace this trade-off to a key mechanism: diffusion models are trained to jointly predict a distribution over all unknown tokens, including those that will not actually be decoded in the current step. Ablating this joint prediction yields faster inference but degrades performance, revealing that accurate prediction at the decoded position relies on joint reasoning about the distribution of undecoded tokens. We interpret these as latent tokens and introduce a method for modulating their number, demonstrating empirically that this enables a smooth tradeoff between inference speed and sample quality. Furthermore, we demonstrate that latent tokens can be introduced into autoregressive models through an auxiliary multi-token prediction objective, yielding substantial improvements on the same reasoning tasks where they have traditionally struggled. Our results suggest that latent tokens, while arising naturally in diffusion, represent a general mechanism for improving performance on tasks requiring global coherence or lookahead."

Network dynamics described by graph Laplacian flows have been widely studied in network science and control theory, and these can be generalized to simplicial complexes using Hodge Laplacians. We study weighted Hodge Laplacian flows on simplicial complexes. In particular, we develop a framework for weighted consensus dynamics based on weighted Hodge Laplacian flows and show some decomposition results for weighted Hodge Laplacians. We then show that two key spectral functions of the weighted Hodge Laplacians, the trace of the pseudoinverse and the smallest non-zero eigenvalue, are jointly convex in upper and lower simplex weights and can be formulated as semidefinite programs. Thus, globally optimal weights can be efficiently determined to optimize flows in terms of these functions. Numerical experiments demonstrate that optimal weights can substantially improve these metrics compared to uniform weights."

    "abstract": "Paleoradiology, the use of modern imaging technologies to study archaeological and anthropological remains, offers new windows on millennial scale patterns of human health. Unfortunately, the radiographs collected during field campaigns are heterogeneous: bones are disarticulated, positioning is ad hoc, and laterality markers are often absent. Additionally, factors such as age at death, age of bone, sex, and imaging equipment introduce high variability. Thus, content navigation, such as identifying a subset of images with a specific projection view, can be time consuming and difficult, making efficient triaging a bottleneck for expert analysis. We report a zero shot prompting strategy that leverages a state of the art Large Vision Language Model (LVLM) to automatically identify the main bone, projection view, and laterality in such images. Our pipeline converts raw DICOM files to bone windowed PNGs, submits them to the LVLM with a carefully engineered prompt, and receives structured JSON outputs, which are extracted and formatted onto a spreadsheet in preparation for validation. On a random sample of 100 images reviewed by an expert board certified paleoradiologist, the system achieved 92% main bone accuracy, 80% projection view accuracy, and 100% laterality accuracy, with low or medium confidence flags for ambiguous cases. These results suggest that LVLMs can substantially accelerate code word development for large paleoradiology datasets, allowing for efficient content navigation in future anthropology workflows."

In this paper, we study factor-balancedness and uniform factor-balancedness, making two main contributions. First, we establish general sufficient conditions for an infinite word to be (uniformly) factor-balanced, applicable in particular to any given linearly recurrent word. These conditions are formulated in terms of $\\mathcal{S}$-adic representations and generalize results of Adamczewski on primitive substitutive words, which show that balancedness of length-2 factors already implies uniform factor-balancedness. As an application of our criteria, we characterize the Sturmian words and ternary Arnoux--Rauzy words that are uniformly factor-balanced as precisely those with bounded weak partial quotients. Our second main contribution is a study of the relationship between factor-balancedness and factor complexity. In particular, we analyze the non-primitive substitutive case and construct an example of a factor-balanced word with exponential factor complexity, thereby making progress on a question raised in 2025 by Arnoux, Berthé, Minervino, Steiner, and Thuswaldner on the relation between balancedness and discrete spectrum."

To address this limitation, we introduce a new multi-round visual reasoning benchmark with training and test sets spanning both detection and segmentation tasks, enabling systematic evaluation under iterative reasoning scenarios. We further propose RegionReasoner, a reinforcement learning framework that enforces grounded reasoning by requiring each reasoning trace to explicitly cite the corresponding reference bounding boxes, while maintaining semantic coherence via a global-local consistency reward. This reward extracts key objects and nouns from both global scene captions and region-level captions, aligning them with the reasoning trace to ensure consistency across reasoning steps. RegionReasoner is optimized with structured rewards combining grounding fidelity and global-local semantic alignment. Experiments on detection and segmentation tasks show that RegionReasoner-7B, together with our newly introduced benchmark RegionDial-Bench, considerably improves multi-round reasoning accuracy, spatial grounding precision, and global-local consistency, establishing a strong baseline for this emerging research direction."

    "abstract": "Distributed quantum sensing leverages quantum correlations among multiple sensors to enhance the precision of parameter estimation beyond classical limits. Most existing approaches target phase estimation and rely on a shared phase reference between the signal and the probe, yet many relevant scenarios deal with regimes where such a reference is absent, making the estimation of force or field amplitudes the main task. We study this phase-insensitive regime for bosonic sensors that undergo identical displacements with common phases randomly varying between experimental runs. We derive analytical bounds on the achievable precision and show that it is determined by first-order normal correlations between modes in the probe state, constrained by their average excitations. These correlations yield a collective sensitivity enhancement over the standard quantum limit, with a gain that grows linearly in the total excitation number, revealing a distributed quantum advantage even without a global phase reference. We identify families of multimode states with definite joint parity that saturate this limit and can be probed efficiently via local parity measurements already demonstrated or emerging in several quantum platforms. We further demonstrate that experimentally relevant decoherence channels favor two distinct sensing strategies: splitting of a single-mode nonclassical state among the modes, which is robust to loss and heating, and separable probes, which are instead resilient to dephasing and phase jitter. Our results are relevant to multimode continuous platforms, including trapped-ion, solid-state mechanical, optomechanical, superconducting, and photonic systems."

The reported ``sub-Alfvénic switchback dropout'' follows from two diagnostic biases: conditioning on an instantaneous $M_a$, which is transiently elevated above unity by radial-velocity enhancements during large-amplitude Alfvénic rotations, and short-window local-mean backgrounds that partially track these rotations and suppress deflection angles. Treating $M_a$ as a bulk-stream property via rolling medians and referencing deflections to event-independent backgrounds -- a Parker-spiral direction or a sufficiently long rolling median -- recovers sub-Alfvénic switchbacks systematically. The mean deflection $\\langle θ\\rangle$ separates into two regimes with $M_a$. For $M_a \\lesssim 1$, $\\langle θ\\rangle$ rises rapidly with weak dependence on the background window, consistent with expansion-driven amplification of Alfvénic fluctuations. For $M_a \\gtrsim 1$, the evolution becomes scale dependent: large-scale $\\langle θ\\rangle$ continues to grow with $M_a$ at reduced rate, while small-scale growth saturates, consistent with turbulent decay and dissipation. Collectively, these results indicate that switchbacks need not originate only in the super-Alfvénic solar wind. Instead, they are consistent with a formation pathway in which coronal fluctuations are amplified by large-scale expansion through the sub-Alfvénic regime, with subsequent propagation into the super-Alfvénic wind where turbulent decay modifies their scale-dependent properties."

To avoid the significant memory overhead of storing large item sets, the generative recommendation paradigm instead models each item as a series of discrete semantic codes. Here, the next item is predicted by an autoregressive model that generates the code sequence corresponding to the predicted item. However, despite promising ranking capabilities on small datasets, these methods have yet to surpass traditional sequential recommenders on large item sets, limiting their adoption in the very scenarios they were designed to address. To resolve this, we propose MSCGRec, a Multimodal Semantic and Collaborative Generative Recommender. MSCGRec incorporates multiple semantic modalities and introduces a novel self-supervised quantization learning approach for images based on the DINO framework. Additionally, MSCGRec fuses collaborative and semantic signals by extracting collaborative features from sequential recommenders and treating them as a separate modality. Finally, we propose constrained sequence learning that restricts the large output space during training to the set of permissible tokens. We empirically demonstrate on three large real-world datasets that MSCGRec outperforms both sequential and generative recommendation baselines and provide an extensive ablation study to validate the impact of each component."

The practical use of ECD spectra in predictive modeling remains restricted, as existing approaches offer limited confidence for chiral discrimination. By contrast, theoretical ECD calculations demand substantial computational effort rooted in electronic structure theory, which constrains their scalability to larger chemically diverse molecules. These limitations underscore the need for computational approaches that retain first principles physical rigor while enabling efficient and scalable prediction. Motivated by recent advances in quantum algorithms for chemistry, we introduce a variational quantum framework combined with the quantum equation of motion formalism to compute molecular properties and predict ECD spectra, implemented within a multi GPU or QPU accelerated hybrid quantum/classical workflow. We demonstrate its efficient applicability on 12 clinically relevant chiral drug molecules accessing expanded active spaces. The proposed framework is assessed by comparison with established classical wavefunction based methods, employing Coupled Cluster Singles and Doubles (CCSD) for ground-state energy benchmarks and Complete Active Space Configuration Interaction (CASCI) as the reference method for excited state energies and chiroptical properties within the same active orbital space. Notably, the quantum computed ECD spectra, obtained from chemically relevant active spaces mapped onto quantum circuits of approximately 20 to 24 qubits, exhibit near quantitative agreement with classical reference calculations, accurately reproducing spectral line shapes, Cotton effect signs, and relative peak intensities."

OCRTurk consists of 180 Turkish documents drawn from academic articles, theses, slide decks, and non-academic articles. We evaluate seven OCR models on OCRTurk using element-wise metrics. Across difficulty levels, PaddleOCR achieves the strongest overall results, leading most element-wise metrics except figures and attaining high Normalized Edit Distance scores in easy, medium, and hard subsets.

Despite the effectiveness, we show that current GR models suffer from a critical \\textbf{bias amplification} issue, where token-level bias escalates as token generation progresses, ultimately limiting the recommendation diversity and hurting the user experience. By comparing against the key factor behind the success of traditional multi-stage pipelines, we reveal two limitations in GR that can amplify the bias: homogeneous reliance on the encoded history, and fixed computational budgets that prevent deeper user preference understanding. To combat the bias amplification issue, it is crucial for GR to 1) incorporate more heterogeneous information, and 2) allocate greater computational resources at each token generation step. To this end, we propose CARE, a simple yet effective cascaded reasoning framework for debiased GR. To incorporate heterogeneous information, we introduce a progressive history encoding mechanism, which progressively incorporates increasingly fine-grained history information as the generation process advances. To allocate more computations, we propose a query-anchored reasoning mechanism, which seeks to perform a deeper understanding of historical information through parallel reasoning steps. We instantiate CARE on three GR backbones. Empirical results on four datasets show the superiority of CARE in recommendation accuracy, diversity, efficiency, and promising scalability.

As users move, frequent SFC reconfigurations are required, but these are non-trivial: SFCs can serve users only when all required virtual network functions (VNFs) are available, and VNFs undergo time-consuming lifecycle operations before becoming operational. We show that ignoring lifecycle dynamics oversimplifies deployment, jeopardizes QoS, and must be avoided in practical SFC management. To address this, forecasts of user connectivity can be leveraged to proactively deploy VNFs and reconfigure SFCs. But forecasts are inherently imperfect, requiring lifecycle and connectivity uncertainty to be jointly considered. We present RIPPLE, a lifecycle-aware SFC embedding approach to deploy VNFs at the right time and location, reducing service interruptions. We show that RIPPLE closes the gap with solutions that unrealistically assume instantaneous lifecycle, even under realistic lifecycle constraints."

To gain insight into this question, we introduce the sequential group composition task.

The task can be order-sensitive and requires a nonlinear architecture to be learned. Our analysis isolates the roles of the group structure, encoding statistics, and sequence length in shaping learning. We prove that two-layer networks learn this task one irreducible representation of the group at a time in an order determined by the Fourier statistics of the encoding. These networks can perfectly learn the task, but doing so requires a hidden width exponential in the sequence length $k$. In contrast, we show how deeper models exploit the associativity of the task to dramatically improve this scaling: recurrent neural networks compose elements sequentially in $k$ steps, while multilayer networks compose adjacent pairs in parallel in $\\log k$ layers. Overall, the sequential group composition task offers a tractable window into the mechanics of deep learning."

We introduce an energy functional and show that the macroscopic density evolution has a gradient-flow structure in the Wasserstein-2 space. The associated variational framework yields equilibrium states through constrained energy minimization and illustrates how noise regulates the density and mitigates singular concentration.

Its rich structural diversity, arising from multiple polymorphs accessible under different synthesis conditions, has made Ta2O5 a long-standing subject of interest. However, a unified understanding of the thermodynamic stability and phase transitions of its polymorphs across pressure-temperature (P-T) space has remained elusive. Here, using first-principles calculations, we map the thermodynamic landscape of Ta2O5 and establish a comprehensive P-T phase diagram together with a phase-stability hierarchy. We find that Gamma-Ta2O5 and B-Ta2O5 dominate the phase diagram over a broad range of P-T conditions: Gamma-Ta2O5 is stabilized at low pressures, while B-Ta2O5 becomes thermodynamically favored at higher pressures up to ~ 60 GPa, beyond which Y-Ta2O5 emerges as the most stable phase. Crucially, nuclear quantum effects (NQEs) are shown to play a significant role in determining relative phase stability, contributing substantially to the Gibbs free energy and altering phase boundaries. A re-entrant phase transition between Gamma and B-Ta2O5 is predicted near ~ 2 GPa, revealing unexpected complexity in the phase behavior of this oxide. More generally, we identify a characteristic temperature (T_0), at which zero-point and thermal phonon contributions to the free energy become comparable, and show that T_0 is approximately one-third of the Debye temperature. This relationship provides a simple, physically transparent criterion for assessing the importance of NQEs in phase stability, with implications extending beyond Ta2O5 to a broad class of complex oxides."

Bounding the set of states is crucial for safety-critical applications so that one can ensure that all specifications are met. While numerous approaches have been proposed for nonlinear discrete-time systems, a unified evaluation under comparable conditions is lacking. This paper reviews and implements a representative selection of set-based observers within the CORA framework. To provide an objective comparison, the methods are evaluated on common benchmarks, and we examine computational effort, scalability, and the conservatism of the resulting state bounds. This study highlights characteristic trade-offs between observer categories and set representations, as well as practical considerations arising in their implementation. All implementations are made publicly available to support reproducibility and future development. This paper thereby offers the first broad, tool-supported comparison of guaranteed state estimators for nonlinear discrete-time systems."

    "abstract": "Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enables large language models (LLMs) to produce evidence-based responses, and its performance hinges on the matching between the retriever and LLMs. Retriever optimization has emerged as an efficient alternative to fine-tuning LLMs. However, existing solutions suffer from objective mismatch between retriever optimization and the goal of RAG pipeline. Reinforcement learning (RL) provides a promising solution to address this limitation, yet applying RL to retriever optimization introduces two fundamental challenges: 1) the deterministic retrieval is incompatible with RL formulations, and 2) state aliasing arises from query-only retrieval in multi-hop reasoning. To address these challenges, we replace deterministic retrieval with stochastic sampling and formulate RAG as a Markov decision process, making retriever optimizable by RL. Further, we incorporate retrieval history into the state at each retrieval step to mitigate state aliasing. Extensive experiments across diverse RAG pipelines, datasets, and retriever scales demonstrate consistent improvements of our approach in RAG performance."

    "abstract": "Technological developments and the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) are omnipresent themes and concerns of the present day. Much has been written on these topics but applications of quantitative models to understand the techno-social landscape have been much more limited. We propose a mathematical model that can help understand in a unified manner the patterns underlying technological development and also identify the different regimes in which the technological landscape evolves. First, we develop a model of innovation diffusion between different technologies, the growth of each reinforcing the development of the others. The model has a variable that quantifies the level of development (or innovation, discovery) potential for a given technology. The potential, or market capacity, increases via diffusion from related technologies, reflecting the fact that a technology does not develop in isolation. Hence, the growth of each technology is influenced by how developed its neighboring (related) technologies are. This allows us to reproduce long-term trends seen in computing technology and large language models (LLMs). We then present a three-dimensional system of supply, demand, and investment which shows oscillations (business cycles) emerging if investment is too high into a given technology, product, or market. We finally combine the two models through a common variable and show that if investment or diffusion is too high in the network context, chaotic boom-bust cycles can emerge. These quantitative considerations allow us to reproduce the boom-bust patterns seen in non-fungible token (NFT) transaction data and also have deep implications for the development of AI which we highlight, such as the arrival of a new AI winter."

JEPAs learn to predict in representation space rather than pixel space, avoiding the pitfalls of generative modeling while capturing semantically meaningful features suitable for downstream tasks. Our library provides modular, self-contained implementations that illustrate how representation learning techniques developed for image-level self-supervised learning can transfer to video, where temporal dynamics add complexity, and ultimately to action-conditioned world models, where the model must additionally learn to predict the effects of control inputs. Each example is designed for single-GPU training within a few hours, making energy-based self-supervised learning accessible for research and education. We provide ablations of JEA components on CIFAR-10. Probing these representations yields 91% accuracy, indicating that the model learns useful features. Extending to video, we include a multi-step prediction example on Moving MNIST that demonstrates how the same principles scale to temporal modeling. Finally, we show how these representations can drive action-conditioned world models, achieving a 97% planning success rate on the Two Rooms navigation task. Comprehensive ablations reveal the critical importance of each regularization component for preventing representation collapse. Code is available at https://github.com/facebookresearch/eb_jepa."

Tidal features, typically fainter than 26 ${\\rm mag\\,arcsec^{-2}}$, exhibit a diverse range of appearances depending on the merger characteristics and are expected to be investigated in greater detail with the Rubin Observatory Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST), which will reveal the low surface brightness universe with unprecedented precision. Our goal is to assess the feasibility of developing a convolutional neural network (CNN) that can distinguish between mergers and non-mergers based on LSST-like deep images. To this end, we used Illustris TNG50, one of the highest-resolution cosmological hydrodynamic simulations to date, allowing us to generate LSST-like mock images with a depth $\\sim$ 29 ${\\rm mag\\,arcsec^{-2}}$ for low-redshift ($z=0.16$) galaxies, with labeling based on their merger status as ground truth. We focused on 151 Milky Way-like galaxies in field environments, comprising 81 non-mergers and 70 mergers. After applying data augmentation and hyperparameter tuning, a CNN model was developed with an accuracy of 65--67\\%. Through additional image processing, the model was further optimized, achieving an accuracy of 67--70\\% when trained on images containing only faint features. This represents an improvement of $\\sim$ 5\\% compared to training on images with bright features only. This suggests that faint tidal features can serve as effective indicators for distinguishing between mergers and non-mergers. The future direction for further improvement based on this study is also discussed."

In the three-dimensional whole space, we construct a new class of suitable weak solutions to the Navier-Stokes-Vlasov-Fokker-Planck system satisfying energy estimates and three local or global energy inequalities of different forms. These obtained local energy inequalities play an important role in characterizing the measure of the singularity set of weak solutions. The main difficulties in deriving these inequalities lie in establishing the convergence of the density function $f$ in bounded or unbounded domains and dealing with the convergence of the non-local frictional force term. The strong convergence of both $f$ and $f \\log f$ weighted by $|v|^k$ is proved by exploring some new a priori quantities of the velocity with the help of Tao's $L^p$ decomposition and the DiPerna-Lions compactness method. Moreover, as an immediate consequence of the existence result, we are able to describe the Hausdorff dimension of set of singular points of the fluid velocity $u$ and also establish the $α$-Hölder continuity of $f$ at the regular points of $u$."

There is interest in an alternative analog computing implementation that could match the performance of traditional machine learning while being significantly more energy-efficient. However, it remains unclear how to train such analog computing systems while adhering to locality constraints imposed by the physical (as opposed to digital) nature of these systems. Local learning algorithms such as Equilibrium Propagation and Coupled Learning have been proposed to address this issue. In this paper, we develop an algorithm to exactly calculate gradients using a graph theoretic and analytical framework for Kirchhoff's laws. We also introduce Generalized Equilibrium Propagation, a framework encompassing a broad class of Hebbian learning algorithms, including Coupled Learning and Equilibrium Propagation, and show how our algorithm compares. We demonstrate our algorithm using numerical simulations and show that we can train resistor networks without the need for a replica or readout over all resistors, only at the output layer. We also show that under the analytical gradient approach, it is possible to update only a subset of the resistance values without a strong degradation in performance."

Based on these experiences, we extract common techniques for effective human-AI collaboration in theoretical research, such as iterative refinement, problem decomposition, and cross-disciplinary knowledge transfer.

We compare the performance of quantum circuit cutting with different cutting strategies, and then apply circuit cutting to a QAOA algorithm. Using simulations, we first show that Randomized Clifford measurements outperform both Pauli and random unitary measurements. Second, we show that circuit cutting has trouble providing correct answers in noisy settings, especially as the number of circuits increases."

    "abstract": "The 21 cm intensity mapping provides a promising probe of the large-scale structure. Astrophysical foregrounds, as the main source of contamination to the cosmological 21 cm signal, persist in a wedge-like region of Fourier space due to the inherent chromaticity in radio interferometric observations. The foreground avoidance strategy focuses on utilizing data from relatively clean regions with minimal foreground leakage, at the cost of losing large-scale information. Non-linear structure formation, however, couples Fourier modes across scales, leaving imprints of the missing large-scale modes in the remaining data. In this work, we employ a deep learning approach to test whether large-scale features of the 21 cm brightness temperature fields, particularly the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), can be recovered at the field level using only short-wavelength modes that are beyond the linear scales. To explicitly assess the dependence on the training cosmology, we train the network exclusively on de-wiggled simulations, providing a controlled test of whether the reconstruction arises from physical non-linear mode coupling rather than implicit encoding of BAO features. In the ideal noise-free case, the amplitude and phase of the lost modes can be restored with high fidelity. With instrumental noise included, the reconstructed amplitude becomes biased, while the phase information remains robust. The trained network also exhibits reasonable robustness to variations in the underlying cosmological model. Together, these results suggest that mode restoration offers a complementary approach for extracting cosmological information from future 21 cm intensity mapping analyses."

Our approach leverages domain-informed reward signals that accurately reflect the computational cost of Gröbner basis computations and admits efficient Monte Carlo estimation. Experiments on benchmark problems from systems biology and computer vision show that the resulting learned policies consistently outperform standard heuristics, yielding substantial reductions in computational cost.

In such a mixture, it is possible to define an effective magnetization that acts as a quantum field variable. Using the Stochastic Gross-Pitaevskii equation (SGPE), we prepare thermal equilibrium states in the false vacuum and extract decay rates from the magnetization dynamics. The decay rates show an exponential dependence on temperature, in line with the thermal theory of instantons. Since the SGPE is based on complex scalar fields, it also allows us to explore the behavior of the phase, which turns out to become dynamic during decay. Our results confirm the SGPE as an effective tool for studying coupled magnetization and phase dynamics and the associated instanton physics in ultracold quantum gases."

We then extend the stochastic interpolant framework to admit a larger class of point mass schedules in which the Gaussian base measure collapses to a point mass measure. Under the assumption of Gaussian data, we identify lazy schedule families that make the drift identically zero and show that with deterministic sampling one gets a variance-preserving schedule commonly used in diffusion models, whereas with statistically optimal SDE sampling one gets our point mass schedule.

Whether connecting multiple quantum processing units (QPUs) in clusters or over networks, quantum communication requires entanglement to be generated and distributed over distances. Using entanglement, the remote CX protocol can be performed, which allows the application of the CX gate involving qubits located in different QPUs. In this work, we use a specialized simulation framework for a high-level evaluation of the impact of the protocol when executed under noise in various network configurations using different number of QPUs.

Sequentially sampling tokens from 2D continuous token scenes, a recurrent neural network is trained to predict the upcoming token from current input and a saccade-like displacement. On novel scenes, prediction accuracy improves across the sequence, indicating in-context learning. Decoding analyses reveal path integration and dynamic binding of token identity to position. Interventional analyses show that new bindings can be learned late in sequence and that out-of-distribution bindings can be learned. Together, these results demonstrate how structured representations that rely on flexible binding emerge to support prediction, offering a mechanistic account of sequential world modeling relevant to cognitive science."

    "abstract": "Integrating logical knowledge into deep neural network training is still a hard challenge, especially for sequential or temporally extended domains involving subsymbolic observations. To address this problem, we propose DeepDFA, a neurosymbolic framework that integrates high-level temporal logic - expressed as Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA) or Moore Machines - into neural architectures. DeepDFA models temporal rules as continuous, differentiable layers, enabling symbolic knowledge injection into subsymbolic domains. We demonstrate how DeepDFA can be used in two key settings: (i) static image sequence classification, and (ii) policy learning in interactive non-Markovian environments. Across extensive experiments, DeepDFA outperforms traditional deep learning models (e.g., LSTMs, GRUs, Transformers) and novel neuro-symbolic systems, achieving state-of-the-art results in temporal knowledge integration. These results highlight the potential of DeepDFA to bridge subsymbolic learning and symbolic reasoning in sequential tasks."

    "abstract": "Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) achieve strong performance by generating long reasoning traces with reflection. Through a large-scale empirical analysis, we find that a substantial fraction of reflective steps consist of self-verification (recheck) that repeatedly confirm intermediate results. These rechecks occur frequently across models and benchmarks, yet the vast majority are confirmatory rather than corrective, rarely identifying errors and altering reasoning outcomes. This reveals a mismatch between how often self-verification is activated and how often it is actually useful. Motivated by this, we propose a novel, experience-driven test-time framework that reduces the overused verification. Our method detects the activation of recheck behavior, consults an offline experience pool of past verification outcomes, and estimates whether a recheck is likely unnecessary via efficient retrieval. When historical experience suggests unnecessary, a suppression signal redirects the model to proceed. Across multiple model and benchmarks, our approach reduces token usage up to 20.3% while maintaining the accuracy, and in some datasets even yields accuracy improvements."

To address this, we propose scDiVa, a masked discrete diffusion foundation model that aligns generation with the dropout-like corruption process by defining a continuous-time forward masking mechanism in token space. ScDiVa features a bidirectional denoiser that jointly models discrete gene identities and continuous values, utilizing entropy-normalized serialization and a latent anchor token to maximize information efficiency and preserve global cell identity. The model is trained via depth-invariant time sampling and a dual denoising objective to simulate varying sparsity levels while ensuring precise recovery of both identity and magnitude. Pre-trained on 59 million cells, scDiVa achieves strong transfer performance across major benchmarks, including batch integration, cell type annotation, and perturbation response prediction. These results suggest that masked discrete diffusion serves as a biologically coherent and effective alternative to autoregression."

Utilizing Answer Set Programming (ASP) as a formal framework, we define a notion of irrelevant details to be abstracted over to obtain simplified explanations. Our cognitive experiments, in which participants classified stimuli across domains with explanations derived from an answer set program, show that clustering details significantly improve participants' understanding, while removal of details significantly reduce cognitive effort, supporting the hypothesis that abstraction enhances human-centered symbolic explanations."

    "abstract": "High-resolution radar sensors are critical for autonomous systems but pose significant challenges to traditional tracking algorithms due to the generation of multiple measurements per object and the presence of multipath effects. Existing solutions often rely on the point target assumption or treat multipath measurements as clutter, whereas current extended target trackers often lack the capability to maintain trajectory continuity in complex multipath environments. To address these limitations, this paper proposes the multipath extended target generalized labeled multi-Bernoulli (MPET-GLMB) filter. A unified Bayesian framework based on labeled random finite set theory is derived to jointly model target existence, measurement partitioning, and the association between measurements, targets, and propagation paths. This formulation enables simultaneous trajectory estimation for both targets and reflectors without requiring heuristic post-processing. To enhance computational efficiency, a joint prediction and update implementation based on Gibbs sampling is developed. Furthermore, a measurement-driven adaptive birth model is introduced to initialize tracks without prior knowledge of target positions. Experimental results from simulated scenarios and real-world automotive radar data demonstrate that the proposed filter outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior state estimation accuracy and robust trajectory maintenance in dynamic multipath environments."

By collapsing exterior points onto lower-dimensional surfaces, standard orthogonal projections induce rank-deficient Jacobians, which nullify gradients orthogonal to active constraints and hinder optimization. We introduce Soft-Radial Projection, a differentiable reparameterization layer that circumvents this issue through a radial mapping from Euclidean space into the interior of the feasible set. This construction guarantees strict feasibility while preserving a full-rank Jacobian almost everywhere, thereby preventing the optimization stalls typical of boundary-based methods. We theoretically prove that the architecture retains the universal approximation property and empirically show improved convergence behavior and solution quality over state-of-the-art optimization- and projection-based baselines."

We identify a spin-polarized intercalant-host hybridized band with pronounced out-of-plane dispersion crossing the Fermi level, providing an itinerant channel for interlayer magnetic exchange. This mechanism explains the breakdown of a purely atomic picture and establishes a direct link between lattice geometry, electronic dispersion, and magnetic order. Our findings demonstrate that intercalant-induced itinerancy enables tunable interlayer coupling in otherwise layered magnets, offering a general microscopic framework for engineering magnetic dimensionality in a broad class of intercalated vdW materials."

Nowadays-used semiconductor limiters suffer from high electronic noise and switching delays when approaching the GHz range, which is crucial for the modern generation of 5G communication technologies aiming to operate at the EU 5G high band (24.25-27.5 GHz). The proposed solution is to use ferrite-based Frequency Selective Limiters (FSLs), which maintain their efficiency at high GHz frequencies, although they have only been studied at the macroscale so far. In this study, we demonstrate a proof of concept of nanoscale FSLs. The devices are based on spin-wave transmission affected by four-magnon scattering phenomena in a 97-nm-thin Yttrium Iron Garnet (YIG) film. Spin waves were excited and detected using coplanar waveguide (CPW) transducers of the smallest feature size of 250 nm. The FSLs are tested in the frequency range up to 25 GHz, and the key parameters are extracted (power threshold, power limiting level, insertion losses, bandwidth) for different spin-wave modes and transducer lengths. An analytical theory has been formulated to describe the fundamental physical processes, and a numerical model has been developed to quantitatively describe the insertion losses and power characteristics of the FSLs. Additionally, the perspective of the spin-wave devices is discussed, including the possibility of simultaneously integrating three devices into one: a frequency-selective limiter, an RF filter, and a delay line, allowing for more efficient use of space and energy."

The inclusion of all these mechanisms has been first demonstrated in small systems, composed of a few atoms, before being scaled up to larger structures made of thousands of atoms.

This classification is expressed through the structure of the irrelevant $T\\bar{T}$-like deformations that generate the theories from a Maxwell seed. Using both closed-form and perturbative methods within the Courant-Hilbert (CH) and Russo-Townsend auxiliary field formalisms, we demonstrate a precise correspondence: $\\varphi$-parity-invariant, analytic theories are generated by irrelevant deformations built from integer powers of the energy-momentum tensor scalars, $\\mathcal{O}_λ\\sim \\sum C_m (T_{μν}T^{μν})^{1-m}({T_μ}^μ{T_ν}^ν)^{m}$. Conversely, $\\varphi$-parity-violating, non-analytic theories require deformations involving both integer and half-integer powers, $\\mathcal{O}_λ\\sim \\sum C_m (T_{μν}T^{μν})^{1-m/2}({T_μ}^μ{T_ν}^ν)^{m/2}$. We prove this result in generality via a perturbative CH framework, showing that $\\varphi$-parity invariance imposes specific constraints on the expansion coefficients of the CH function $\\ell(τ)$ which, in turn, force all half-integer powers in the deformation to vanish. The classification is explicitly verified for known closed-form theories: the analytic generalized Born-Infeld model and the non-analytic examples of the $q=3/4$-deformed and \"no $τ$-maximum\" theories. Furthermore, we show how the $\\varphi$-parity transformation is consistently generalized in the presence of a marginal root-$T\\bar{T}$ coupling $γ$, and we derive the corresponding marginal and irrelevant flow equations for the studied theories."

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have recently shown strong performance as zero-shot rankers, yet their effectiveness is highly sensitive to prompt formulation, particularly role-play instructions. Prior analyses suggest that role-related signals are encoded along activation channels that are largely separate from query-document representations, raising the possibility of steering ranking behavior directly at the activation level rather than through brittle prompt engineering. In this work, we propose RankSteer, a post-hoc activation steering framework for zero-shot pointwise LLM ranking. We characterize ranking behavior through three disentangled and steerable directions in representation space: a \\textbf{decision direction} that maps hidden states to relevance scores, an \\textbf{evidence direction} that captures relevance signals not directly exploited by the decision head, and a \\textbf{role direction} that modulates model behavior without injecting relevance information. Using projection-based interventions at inference time, RankSteer jointly controls these directions to calibrate ranking behavior without modifying model weights or introducing explicit cross-document comparisons. Experiments on TREC DL 20 and multiple BEIR benchmarks show that RankSteer consistently improves ranking quality using only a small number of anchor queries, demonstrating that substantial ranking capacity remains under-utilized in pointwise LLM rankers. We further provide a geometric analysis revealing that steering improves ranking by stabilizing ranking geometry and reducing dispersion, offering new insight into how LLMs internally represent and calibrate relevance judgments."

To bridge this gap, we present the AesRec benchmark dataset featuring systematic quantitative aesthetic annotations, thereby enabling the development of aesthetics-aligned recommendation systems. Grounded in professional apparel quality standards and fashion aesthetic principles, we define a multidimensional set of indicators. At the item level, six dimensions are independently assessed: silhouette, chromaticity, materiality, craftsmanship, wearability, and item-level impression. Transitioning to the outfit level, the evaluation retains the first five core attributes while introducing stylistic synergy, visual harmony, and outfit-level impression as distinct metrics to capture the collective aesthetic impact. Given the increasing human-like proficiency of Vision-Language Models in multimodal understanding and interaction, we leverage them for large-scale aesthetic scoring. We conduct rigorous human-machine consistency validation on a fashion dataset, confirming the reliability of the generated ratings. Experimental results based on AesRec further demonstrate that integrating quantified aesthetic information into clothing recommendation models can provide aesthetic guidance for users while fulfilling their personalized requirements."

    "abstract": "As large language model agents tackle increasingly complex long-horizon tasks, effective post-training becomes critical. Prior work faces fundamental challenges: outcome-only rewards fail to precisely attribute credit to intermediate steps, estimated step-level rewards introduce systematic noise, and Monte Carlo sampling approaches for step reward estimation incur prohibitive computational cost. Inspired by findings that only a small fraction of high-entropy tokens drive effective RL for reasoning, we propose Critical Step Optimization (CSO), which focuses preference learning on verified critical steps, decision points where alternate actions demonstrably flip task outcomes from failure to success. Crucially, our method starts from failed policy trajectories rather than expert demonstrations, directly targeting the policy model's weaknesses. We use a process reward model (PRM) to identify candidate critical steps, leverage expert models to propose high-quality alternatives, then continue execution from these alternatives using the policy model itself until task completion. Only alternatives that the policy successfully executes to correct outcomes are verified and used as DPO training data, ensuring both quality and policy reachability. This yields fine-grained, verifiable supervision at critical decisions while avoiding trajectory-level coarseness and step-level noise. Experiments on GAIA-Text-103 and XBench-DeepSearch show that CSO achieves 37% and 26% relative improvement over the SFT baseline and substantially outperforms other post-training methods, while requiring supervision at only 16% of trajectory steps. This demonstrates the effectiveness of selective verification-based learning for agent post-training."

In this work, we studied the nearest L-T brown dwarfs, Luhman 16A and B, to assess the chemical dis-equilibrium in their atmospheres and to investigate their elemental and isotopic composition. As part of the ESO SupJup Survey, we obtained high-resolution CRIRES$^+$ K-band spectra of the binary, which were analysed using an atmospheric retrieval framework. We detect and retrieve the abundances of $^{12}$CO, H$_2$O, CH$_4$, NH$_3$, H$_2$S, HF, and the $^{13}$CO isotopologue. Both atmospheres are in chemical dis-equilibrium with somewhat stronger vertical mixing in Luhman 16A compared to B ($K_\\mathrm{zz,A}\\sim10^{8.7}$, $K_\\mathrm{zz,B}\\sim10^{8.2}\\ \\mathrm{cm^2\\ s^{-1}}$). The tested chemical models, free- and dis-equilibrium chemistry, yield consistent mixing ratios and agree with earlier work at shorter wavelengths. The gaseous C/O ratios show evidence of oxygen trapping in silicate-oxide clouds. While the C/O ratios are consistent with solar, the metallicities are modestly enhanced with $\\mathrm{[C/H]}\\sim0.15$. The carbon isotope ratios are measured at $\\mathrm{^{12}C/^{13}C_A}=74^{+2}_{-2}$ and $\\mathrm{^{12}C/^{13}C_B}=74^{+3}_{-3}$. The coincident constraints of metallicities and isotopes across the binary reinforce their likely shared formation. The $\\mathrm{^{12}C/^{13}C}$ ratios are aligned with the present-day interstellar medium, but lower than the solar-system value.

Deep learning controllers based on gated recurrent units (GRUs) for simultaneous tip position and orientation control, effectively handling the nonlinear coupling between continuum segments, were proposed. The GRU controller was benchmarked against Jacobian based inverse kinematics, model predictive control (MPC), a feedforward neural network (FNN), and a long short-term memory (LSTM) network. In nested-rectangle and Lissajous trajectory tracking tasks, the GRU achieved the lowest position/orientation RMSEs: 1.11 mm/ 4.62° and 0.81 mm/ 2.59°, respectively. For orientation control at a fixed position (four target poses), the GRU attained a mean RMSE of 0.14 mm and 0.72°, outperforming all alternatives. In a peg transfer task, the GRU achieved a 100% success rate (120 success/120 attempts) with an average transfer time of 11.8s, the STD significantly outperforms novice-controlled systems. Additionally, an ex vivo ESD demonstration grasping, elevating, and resecting tissue as the scalpel completed the cut confirmed that DESectBot provides sufficient stiffness to divide thick gastric mucosa and an operative workspace adequate for large lesions.These results confirm that GRU-based control significantly enhances precision, reliability, and usability in ESD surgical training scenarios."

The inner regions are thought to be similarly diverse in structure as the well-observed outer regions probed by ALMA. Combining data and results from previous studies of the VLTI/PIONIER and VLTI/GRAVITY instruments with new, multi-epoch VLTI/MATISSE observations, we aim to provide a comprehensive picture of the structure of the inner regions of the circumstellar disc around the F-type Herbig Ae/Be star HD 142527 A, the primary of a binary star system. We model the multi-wavelength interferometric data using a parametrised, geometrically thin disc model, allowing for azimuthal asymmetry, exploring a first-order disc modulation and an off-centre Gaussian component. We find time-variable structures in the N-band observables, which we reproduce with time-dependent models. This variability manifests as azimuthally asymmetric emission, evidenced by strong, non-zero closure phases in the N-band data. Fits to individual epochs of the N-band observations yield better $χ^2_\\text{r}$ values than fits to all epochs simultaneously. This suggests substantial changes in the geometry of the inner disc emission from ~1 au up to a few astronomical-unit scales from one year to the next. Moreover, our models produce a very close-in inner disc rim $R_\\text{rim}\\approx0.1$ au. All together, we find a very complex, substantially non-point symmetric and temporally-variable disc ($r_\\text{out}\\lesssim6$ au) around the primary.

However, DL struggles to train a high accuracy model when the data distribution is non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) and when the communication topology is static. To address these issues, we propose Morph, a topology optimization algorithm for DL. In Morph, nodes adaptively choose peers for model exchange based on maximum model dissimilarity. Morph maintains a fixed in-degree while dynamically reshaping the communication graph through gossip-based peer discovery and diversity-driven neighbor selection, thereby improving robustness to data heterogeneity. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and FEMNIST with up to 100 nodes show that Morph consistently outperforms static and epidemic baselines, while closely tracking the fully connected upper bound. On CIFAR-10, Morph achieves a relative improvement of 1.12x in test accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art baselines. On FEMNIST, Morph achieves an accuracy that is 1.08x higher than Epidemic Learning. Similar trends hold for 50 node deployments, where Morph narrows the gap to the fully connected upper bound within 0.5 percentage points on CIFAR-10. These results demonstrate that Morph achieves higher final accuracy, faster convergence, and more stable learning as quantified by lower inter-node variance, while requiring fewer communication rounds than baselines and no global knowledge."

While systematic biases arise in the HOD parameters, the cosmological constraints remain unbiased, yielding $3.8\\%$ precision measurement on $fσ_8$ compared to $4.7\\%$ using galaxy clustering alone.

By tuning the coupling parameters this model can accommodate five Altland--Zirnbauer--Cartan symmetry classes, three of which (AIII, BDI and D) support non-trivial topological phases in dimension one. We characterize analytically the spectral properties of the Hamiltonian in terms of a spectral function, and numerically compute the Zak phase to probe the bulk topological content of the insulating phases. Our findings reveal that, while the Zak phase is quantized in classes AIII and BDI, it exhibits non-quantized values in class D, challenging its traditional role as a topological marker in continuum settings. We also discuss the bulk-boundary correspondence for a truncated version of the chain, analyzing how the emergence of edge states depends on both the truncation position and the boundary conditions. In classes AIII and BDI, we find that the Zak phase effectively detects edge states as a relative boundary topological index, although the correspondence is highly sensitive to the parameters characterizing the truncation."

    "abstract": "Impact-induced fragmentation is a fundamental dissipative process in geosciences, yet its stochastic nature makes predicting debris evolution a persistent challenge. Here, we introduce a discrete element framework to resolve fragmentation mechanics across a diverse lithological spectrum, from high-strength siliciclastic units to massive carbonates, validated against high-resolution field data from documented rockfall events. Our results reveal that, despite the inherent randomness of impact dynamics, fragment size distributions consistently follow a universal Weibull scaling law, independent of lithology or initial kinetic energy. By applying a relative breakage index, we demonstrate a remarkable collapse of fragmentation data onto a single statistical signature, bridging the gap between grain-scale fracture and macroscopic debris evolution. We find that this Weibullian signature acts as a proxy for lithological sensitivity, reflecting distinct efficiencies in converting kinetic energy into new fracture surfaces. This framework explicitly resolves the energy partitioning between surviving blocks and comminuted debris, providing a robust predictive link between impact mechanics and structural resilience. From an engineering perspective, our findings enable a shift from idealised single-block impact assumptions toward a realistic assessment of distributed energy in fragmented particle clouds, offering a physical basis for optimising protective galleries and hazard mitigation strategies in complex mountainous terrains."

We propose GFlowPO, a probabilistic prompt optimization framework that casts prompt search as a posterior inference problem over latent prompts regularized by a meta-prompted reference-LM prior. In the first step, we fine-tune a lightweight prompt-LM with an off-policy Generative Flow Network (GFlowNet) objective, using a replay-based training policy that reuses past prompt evaluations to enable sample-efficient exploration. In the second step, we introduce Dynamic Memory Update (DMU), a training-free mechanism that updates the meta-prompt by injecting both (i) diverse prompts from a replay buffer and (ii) top-performing prompts from a small priority queue, thereby progressively concentrating the search process on high-reward regions. Across few-shot text classification, instruction induction benchmarks, and question answering tasks, GFlowPO consistently outperforms recent discrete prompt optimization baselines."

Many existing approaches rely on point contact models due to their computational effi- ciency. Simple contact models are computationally efficient but inherently limited for achieving human-like, contact-rich ma- nipulation, as they fail to capture key frictional dynamics and torque generation observed in human manipulation. This study introduces a Force-Distributed Line Contact (FDLC) model in contact-rich manipulation and compares it against conventional point contact models. A bi-level optimization framework is constructed, in which the lower-level solves an optimization problem for contact force computation, and the upper-level optimization applies iLQR for trajectory optimization. Through this framework, the limitations of point contact are demon- strated, and the benefits of the FDLC in generating efficient and robust trajectories are established. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated by a box rotating task, demonstrating that FDLC enables trajectories generated via non-uniform force distributions along the contact line, while requiring lower control effort and less motion of the robot."

In addition, we implement corrections for truncation bias in observations from the Japanese Kobe Collection, spanning the period from 1933 to 1961. We evaluate the effects of these changes with respect to the previous version of HadSST and compare with the most recent iterations of other SST datasets including ERSSTv6, COBE-SST3 and DCENT. We show that it is possible to remove the WW2 warm anomaly using a physically-based approach that maintains the independence of HadSST from land surface temperature records, and preserves structural diversity within the range of available global SST datasets."

    "abstract": "Standard federated learning algorithms are vulnerable to adversarial nodes, a.k.a. Byzantine failures. To solve this issue, robust distributed learning algorithms have been developed, which typically replace parameter averaging by robust aggregations. While generic conditions on these aggregations exist to guarantee the convergence of (Stochastic) Gradient Descent (SGD), the analyses remain rather ad-hoc. This hinders the development of more complex robust algorithms, such as accelerated ones. In this work, we show that Byzantine-robust distributed optimization can, under standard generic assumptions, be cast as a general optimization with inexact gradient oracles (with both additive and multiplicative error terms), an active field of research. This allows for instance to directly show that GD on top of standard robust aggregation procedures obtains optimal asymptotic error in the Byzantine setting. Going further, we propose two optimization schemes to speed up the convergence. The first one is a Nesterov-type accelerated scheme whose proof directly derives from accelerated inexact gradient results applied to our formulation. The second one hinges on Optimization under Similarity, in which the server leverages an auxiliary loss function that approximates the global loss. Both approaches allow to drastically reduce the communication complexity compared to previous methods, as we show theoretically and empirically."

Here, we describe a physics-structured variational autoencoder (PS-VAE) designed for rapid extraction of voxelwise multi-parameter posterior distributions. Our approach integrates a differentiable spin physics simulator with self-supervised learning, and provides a full covariance that captures the inter-parameter correlations of the latent biophysical space. The method was validated in a multi-proton pool chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) and semisolid magnetization transfer (MT) molecular MRF study, across in-vitro phantoms, tumor-bearing mice, healthy human volunteers, and a subject with glioblastoma. The resulting multi-parametric posteriors are in good agreement with those calculated using a brute-force Bayesian analysis, while providing an orders-of-magnitude acceleration in whole brain quantification.

At the same time, in practical applications, generative data augmentation can be vulnerable to clean-label backdoor attacks, which aim to bypass human inspection. However, based on theoretical analysis and preliminary experiments, we observe that directly applying existing pixel-level clean-label backdoor attack methods (e.g., COMBAT) to generated images results in low attack success rates. This motivates us to move beyond pixel-level triggers and focus instead on the latent feature level. To this end, we propose InvLBA, an invisible clean-label backdoor attack method for generative data augmentation by latent perturbation. We theoretically prove that the generalization of the clean accuracy and attack success rates of InvLBA can be guaranteed. Experiments on multiple datasets show that our method improves the attack success rate by 46.43% on average, with almost no reduction in clean accuracy and high robustness against SOTA defense methods."

Critically, both branches incorporate the advantage function A_t, ensuring that incorrect trajectories receive consistent negative learning signals and preventing reinforcement of confident errors.

We integrate 2H-stacked MoSe$_{2}$/$^{1}$WSe$_{2}$/$^{2}$WSe$_{2}$ heterotrilayer onto a chirped distributed Bragg reflector that acts as a backside mirror. This way, we fabricate a platform that hosts distinct heterotrilayer, heterobilayer, and homobilayer regions with enhanced excitonic features at elevated temperatures. Although the heterobilayer supports temperature-tunable singlet and triplet interlayer excitons, it exhibits low emission yield at 4 K. In comparison, the heterotrilayer shows remarkable excitonic properties, including pronounced band modulation, intervalley interlayer exciton transitions, and a tenfold photoluminescence enhancement along with a sevenfold increase in exciton decay time at cryogenic temperatures compared to the heterobilayer system. Temperature-dependent studies reveal intriguing interlayer exciton dynamics in the heterotrilayer, including the emergence of valley-polarized interlayer excitons, and the ability to maintain optical stability up to room temperature. Our results establish a clear strategy for engineering excitonic states across multilayer van der Waals heterostructures from 4 K to room temperature, providing a versatile platform for excitonic optoelectronics, quantum photonics, and tunable long-lived interlayer exciton states in scalable TMD heterostructures."

However, this convergence guarantee does not hold under linear function approximation. To overcome this limitation, a significant line of research has introduced regularization techniques to ensure stable convergence under function approximation. In this work, we propose a new algorithm, periodic regularized Q-learning (PRQ). We first introduce regularization at the level of the projection operator and explicitly construct a regularized projected value iteration (RP-VI), subsequently extending it to a sample-based RL algorithm. By appropriately regularizing the projection operator, the resulting projected value iteration becomes a contraction. By extending this regularized projection into the stochastic setting, we establish the PRQ algorithm and provide a rigorous theoretical analysis that proves finite-time convergence guarantees for PRQ under linear function approximation."

To this end, we propose Collective Adversarial Data Synthesis (CADS), a novel and general approach to synthesize high-quality, diverse and challenging multimodal data for MLLMs. The core idea of CADS is to leverage collective intelligence to ensure high-quality and diverse generation, while exploring adversarial learning to synthesize challenging samples for effectively driving model improvement. Specifically, CADS operates with two cyclic phases, i.e., Collective Adversarial Data Generation (CAD-Generate) and Collective Adversarial Data Judgment (CAD-Judge). CAD-Generate leverages collective knowledge to jointly generate new and diverse multimodal data, while CAD-Judge collaboratively assesses the quality of synthesized data. In addition, CADS introduces an Adversarial Context Optimization mechanism to optimize the generation context to encourage challenging and high-value data generation. With CADS, we construct MMSynthetic-20K and train our model R1-SyntheticVL, which demonstrates superior performance on various benchmarks."

As computing a minimal meg-set is hard in general, recent works aimed to find polynomial-time algorithms to compute minimal meg-sets when the input belongs to a restricted class of graphs. Most of these results are based on the property of some classes of graphs to admit a unique minimum meg-set, which is then easy to compute.

    "abstract": "Spiking neural networks (SNNs) compute with discrete spikes and exploit temporal structure, yet most adversarial attacks change intensities or event counts instead of timing. We study a timing-only adversary that retimes existing spikes while preserving spike counts and amplitudes in event-driven SNNs, thus remaining rate-preserving. We formalize a capacity-1 spike-retiming threat model with a unified trio of budgets: per-spike jitter $\\mathcal{B}_{\\infty}$, total delay $\\mathcal{B}_{1}$, and tamper count $\\mathcal{B}_{0}$. Feasible adversarial examples must satisfy timeline consistency and non-overlap, which makes the search space discrete and constrained. To optimize such retimings at scale, we use projected-in-the-loop (PIL) optimization: shift-probability logits yield a differentiable soft retiming for backpropagation, and a strict projection in the forward pass produces a feasible discrete schedule that satisfies capacity-1, non-overlap, and the chosen budget at every step. The objective maximizes task loss on the projected input and adds a capacity regularizer together with budget-aware penalties, which stabilizes gradients and aligns optimization with evaluation. Across event-driven benchmarks (CIFAR10-DVS, DVS-Gesture, N-MNIST) and diverse SNN architectures, we evaluate under binary and integer event grids and a range of retiming budgets, and also test models trained with timing-aware adversarial training designed to counter timing-only attacks. For example, on DVS-Gesture the attack attains high success (over $90\\%$) while touching fewer than $2\\%$ of spikes under $\\mathcal{B}_{0}$. Taken together, our results show that spike retiming is a practical and stealthy attack surface that current defenses struggle to counter, providing a clear reference for temporal robustness in event-driven SNNs.

We model wave propagation as a trainable multi-layer network that leverages optimization and deep learning tools to infer the wave velocity distribution. We validate this approach through ultrasound experiments on tissue-mimicking phantoms and human breast tissues, demonstrating its potential for tumour detection and characterization. Our method is broadly applicable to any kind of waves and media for which a reflection matrix can be measured."

Under natural modelling assumptions the probability of seeing a new world record during this new season is shown to be about ten percent.

To address these challenges, we introduce LaVPR, a large-scale benchmark that extends existing VPR datasets with over 650,000 rich natural-language descriptions. Using LaVPR, we investigate two paradigms: Multi-Modal Fusion for enhanced robustness and Cross-Modal Retrieval for language-based localization. Our results show that language descriptions yield consistent gains in visually degraded conditions, with the most significant impact on smaller backbones. Notably, adding language allows compact models to rival the performance of much larger vision-only architectures. For cross-modal retrieval, we establish a baseline using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and Multi-Similarity loss, which substantially outperforms standard contrastive methods across vision-language models. Ultimately, LaVPR enables a new class of localization systems that are both resilient to real-world stochasticity and practical for resource-constrained deployment.

Depending on the characteristics of the wave packet, particles may be pushed away from the wave source or pulled toward it. We also examine particle dynamics in the field of a beat wave generated by two forward-propagating waves with slightly different frequencies. Such a beat wave can emulate a periodic sequence of either forward- or backward-propagating pulses. In particular, this provides a simple mechanism for realizing pulling forces as employed in optical and acoustic `tractor beams'."

Optical tactile sensors have emerged as promising solutions, as they are immune to electromagnetic interference and have high spatial resolution.

In this study, we present a thin, compact, and soft optical tactile sensor featuring an alignment-free configuration. The soft optical sensor operates by capturing deformation-induced changes in speckle patterns generated within a soft silicone material, thereby enabling precise force measurements and texture recognition via machine learning. The experimental results show a root-mean-square error of 40 mN in the force measurement and a classification accuracy of 93.33% over nine classes of textured surfaces, including Mahjong tiles. The proposed speckle-based approach provides a compact, easily fabricated, and mechanically compliant platform that bridges optical sensing with flexible shape-adaptive architectures, thereby demonstrating its potential as a novel tactile-sensing paradigm for soft robotics and wearable haptic interfaces."

I find large, persistent losses in real GDP and GDP per capita, accompanied by sharp declines in foreign direct investment, trade integration, and non-oil exports. These economic effects coincide with substantial and durable deterioration in political stability, rule of law, and control of corruption. Magnitude calculations imply cumulative output losses comparable to civil-war settings, despite the absence of internal armed conflict.

Current practice relies on population pharmacokinetic (PopPK) models based on nonlinear mixed-effects (NLME) methods. However, these models depend on rigid, pre-specified assumptions and may struggle to capture complex, patient-specific dynamics, leading to model misspecification. In this study, we introduce a novel data-driven alternative based on Latent Ordinary Differential Equations (Latent ODEs) for tacrolimus AUC prediction. This deep learning approach learns individualized pharmacokinetic dynamics directly from sparse clinical data, enabling greater flexibility in modeling complex biological behavior. The model was evaluated through extensive simulations across multiple scenarios and benchmarked against two standard approaches: NLME-based estimation and the iterative two-stage Bayesian (it2B) method. We further performed a rigorous clinical validation using a development dataset (n = 178) and a completely independent external dataset (n = 75). In simulation, the Latent ODE model demonstrated superior robustness, maintaining high accuracy even when underlying biological mechanisms deviated from standard assumptions. Regarding experiments on clinical datasets, in internal validation, it achieved significantly higher precision with a mean RMSPE of 7.99% compared with 9.24% for it2B (p < 0.001). On the external cohort, it achieved an RMSPE of 10.82%, comparable to the two standard estimators (11.48% and 11.54%). These results establish the Latent ODE as a powerful and reliable tool for AUC prediction. Its flexible architecture provides a promising foundation for next-generation, multi-modal models in personalized medicine."

However, existing approaches that optimize the high-dimensional initial noise suffer from severe inefficiency, as many search directions exert negligible influence on the final generation. We show that this inefficiency is closely related to a spectral bias in generative dynamics: model sensitivity to initial perturbations diminishes rapidly as frequency increases. Building on this insight, we propose Spectral Evolution Search (SES), a plug-and-play framework for initial noise optimization that executes gradient-free evolutionary search within a low-frequency subspace. Theoretically, we derive the Spectral Scaling Prediction from perturbation propagation dynamics, which explains the systematic differences in the impact of perturbations across frequencies. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SES significantly advances the Pareto frontier of generation quality versus computational cost, consistently outperforming strong baselines under equivalent budgets."

In this paper, we address humanoid skateboarding, a highly challenging task requiring stable dynamic maneuvering on an underactuated wheeled platform. This integrated system is governed by non-holonomic constraints and tightly coupled human-object interactions. Successfully executing this task requires simultaneous mastery of hybrid contact dynamics and robust balance control on a mechanically coupled, dynamically unstable skateboard. To overcome the aforementioned challenges, we propose HUSKY, a learning-based framework that integrates humanoid-skateboard system modeling and physics-aware whole-body control. We first model the coupling relationship between board tilt and truck steering angles, enabling a principled analysis of system dynamics. Building upon this, HUSKY leverages Adversarial Motion Priors (AMP) to learn human-like pushing motions and employs a physics-guided, heading-oriented strategy for lean-to-steer behaviors. Moreover, a trajectory-guided mechanism ensures smooth and stable transitions between pushing and steering. Experimental results on the Unitree G1 humanoid platform demonstrate that our framework enables stable and agile maneuvering on skateboards in real-world scenarios.

This isomorphism partitions the input space into the Normal Fan of a Hypersimplex, revealing that \\textbf{sparsity is combinatorial depth} which scales geometric capacity by the binomial coefficient $\\binom{N}{k}$. Moving beyond ambient bounds, we introduce the concept of \\textit{Effective Capacity} under the Manifold Hypothesis. We prove that while dense networks suffer from capacity collapse on low-dimensional data, MoE architectures exhibit \\textit{Combinatorial Resilience}, maintaining high expressivity via the transversality of routing cones. In this study, our framework unifies the discrete geometry of the Hypersimplex with the continuous geometry of neural functions, offering a rigorous theoretical justification for the topological supremacy of conditional computation."

However, its effectiveness is severely compromised in sparse reward settings. The core limitation lies in the standard paradigm of regressing ground-truth scalar rewards: in sparse environments, this yields a flat, gradient-free landscape that fails to provide directional guidance for planning. To address this challenge, we propose Shaping Landscapes with Optimistic Potential Estimates (SLOPE), a novel framework that shifts reward modeling from predicting scalars to constructing informative potential landscapes. SLOPE employs optimistic distributional regression to estimate high-confidence upper bounds, which amplifies rare success signals and ensures sufficient exploration gradients. Evaluations on 30+ tasks across 5 benchmarks demonstrate that SLOPE consistently outperforms leading baselines in fully sparse, semi-sparse, and dense rewards."

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning algorithms such as group-relative policy optimization (GRPO) have demonstrated strong potential for improving the mathematical reasoning capabilities of large language models. However, prior work has consistently observed an entropy collapse phenomenon during reinforcement post-training, characterized by a monotonic decrease in policy entropy that ultimately leads to training instability and collapse. As a result, most existing approaches restrict training to short horizons (typically 5-20 epochs), limiting sustained exploration and hindering further policy improvement. In addition, nearly all prior work relies on a single, fixed reasoning prompt or template during training. In this work, we introduce prompt augmentation, a training strategy that instructs the model to generate reasoning traces under diverse templates and formats, thereby increasing rollout diversity. We show that, without a KL regularization term, prompt augmentation enables stable scaling of training duration under a fixed dataset and allows the model to tolerate low-entropy regimes without premature collapse. Empirically, a Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B model trained with prompt augmentation on the MATH Level 3-5 dataset achieves state-of-the-art performance, reaching 44.5 per-benchmark accuracy and 51.3 per-question accuracy on standard mathematical reasoning benchmarks, including AIME24, AMC, MATH500, Minerva, and OlympiadBench.

Current compression methods rely on rigid splitting strategies, such as fixed intervals or pre-defined delimiters. We observe that rigid splitting suffers from significant accuracy degradation (ranging from 5.5% to 55.1%) across different scenarios, owing to the scenario-dependent nature of the semantic boundaries. This highlights the necessity of dynamic semantic splitting to match semantics. To achieve this, we face two challenges. (1) Improper delimiter selection misaligns semantics with the KVCache, resulting in 28.6% accuracy loss. (2) Variable-length blocks after splitting introduce over 73.1% additional inference overhead. To address the above challenges, we propose DynSplit-KV, a KVCache compression method that dynamically identifies delimiters for splitting. We propose: (1) a dynamic importance-aware delimiter selection strategy, improving accuracy by 49.9%. (2) A uniform mapping strategy that transforms variable-length semantic blocks into a fixed-length format, reducing inference overhead by 4.9x. Experiments show that DynSplit-KV achieves the highest accuracy, 2.2x speedup compared with FlashAttention and 2.6x peak memory reduction in long-context scenarios."

Here, we develop a general regret-to-coverage theory for interval-valued OCP based on the $(1-α)$-pinball loss. Our first contribution is to identify \\emph{linearized regret} as a key notion, showing that controlling it implies coverage bounds for any online algorithm. This relies on a black-box reduction that depends only on the Fenchel conjugate of an upper bound on the linearized regret. Building on this theory, we propose UP-OCP, a parameter-free method for OCP, via a reduction to a two-asset portfolio selection problem, leveraging universal portfolio algorithms. We show strong finite-time bounds on the miscoverage of UP-OCP, even for polynomially growing predictions. Extensive experiments support that UP-OCP delivers consistently better size/coverage trade-offs than prior online conformal baselines."

In this work, we propose MemCast, a learning-to-memory framework that reformulates TSF as an experience-conditioned reasoning task. Specifically, we learn experience from the training set and organize it into a hierarchical memory. This is achieved by summarizing prediction results into historical patterns, distilling inference trajectories into reasoning wisdom, and inducing extracted temporal features into general laws. Furthermore, during inference, we leverage historical patterns to guide the reasoning process and utilize reasoning wisdom to select better trajectories, while general laws serve as criteria for reflective iteration. Additionally, to enable continual evolution, we design a dynamic confidence adaptation strategy that updates the confidence of individual entries without leaking the test set distribution. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that MemCast consistently outperforms previous methods, validating the effectiveness of our approach.

To address this bottleneck, the token pruning paradigm leverages attention sparsity to selectively retain a small, critical subset of tokens. However, existing approaches fall short, with static methods risking irreversible information loss and dynamic strategies employing heuristics that insufficiently capture the query-dependent nature of token importance. We propose FASA, a novel framework that achieves query-aware token eviction by dynamically predicting token importance. FASA stems from a novel insight into RoPE: the discovery of functional sparsity at the frequency-chunk (FC) level. Our key finding is that a small, identifiable subset of \"dominant\" FCs consistently exhibits high contextual agreement with the full attention head. This provides a robust and computationally free proxy for identifying salient tokens. %making them a powerful and efficient proxy for token importance. Building on this insight, FASA first identifies a critical set of tokens using dominant FCs, and then performs focused attention computation solely on this pruned subset. % Since accessing only a small fraction of the KV cache, FASA drastically lowers memory bandwidth requirements and computational cost. Across a spectrum of long-context tasks, from sequence modeling to complex CoT reasoning, FASA consistently outperforms all token-eviction baselines and achieves near-oracle accuracy, demonstrating remarkable robustness even under constraint budgets. Notably, on LongBench-V1, FASA reaches nearly 100\\% of full-KV performance when only keeping 256 tokens, and achieves 2.56$\\times$ speedup using just 18.9\\% of the cache on AIME24."

In [10], it was shown that, within a particular framework, every almost optimal and general agent necessarily contains sufficient knowledge of its environment to allow an approximate reconstruction of it by querying the agent as a black box. This result relied on the assumptions that the agent is deterministic and that the environment is fully observable. In this work, we remove both assumptions by extending the theorem to stochastic agents operating in partially observable environments. Fundamentally, this shows that stochastic agents cannot avoid learning their environment through the usage of randomization. We also strengthen the result by weakening the notion of generality, proving that less powerful agents already contain a model of the world in which they operate."

    "abstract": "Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has recently emerged as a practical recipe for aligning large language models with verifiable objectives. However, under sparse terminal rewards, GRPO often stalls because rollouts within a group frequently receive identical rewards, causing relative advantages to collapse and updates to vanish. We propose self-hint aligned GRPO with privileged supervision (SAGE), an on-policy reinforcement learning framework that injects privileged hints during training to reshape the rollout distribution under the same terminal verifier reward. For each prompt $x$, the model samples a compact hint $h$ (e.g., a plan or decomposition) and then generates a solution $τ$ conditioned on $(x,h)$. Crucially, the task reward $R(x,τ)$ is unchanged; hints only increase within-group outcome diversity under finite sampling, preventing GRPO advantages from collapsing under sparse rewards. At test time, we set $h=\\varnothing$ and deploy the no-hint policy without any privileged information. Moreover, sampling diverse self-hints serves as an adaptive curriculum that tracks the learner's bottlenecks more effectively than fixed hints from an initial policy or a stronger external model. Experiments over 6 benchmarks with 3 LLMs show that SAGE consistently outperforms GRPO, on average +2.0 on Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct, +1.2 on Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct and +1.3 on Qwen3-4B-Instruct.

In this paper, we analyze Zigbee network traffic from three complementary perspectives: data collection, traffic classification, and storage efficiency. We introduce ZIOTP2025, a publicly available dataset of Zigbee traffic collected from commercial smart home devices deployed under multiple network configurations and capturing realistic interaction scenarios. Using this dataset, we study two traffic classification tasks: device type classification and individual device identification, and evaluate their robustness under both intra-configuration and cross-configuration settings. Our results show that while high classification accuracy can be achieved under controlled conditions, performance degrades significantly when models are evaluated across different network configurations, particularly for fine-grained identification tasks. Finally, we investigate the trade-off between traffic storage requirements and classification accuracy. We show that lossy compression of traffic features through quantization can reduce storage requirements by approximately 4-5x compared to lossless storage of raw packet traces, while preserving near-lossless classification performance. Overall, our results highlight the need for topology-aware Zigbee traffic analysis and storage-efficient feature compression to enable robust and scalable IoT forensic systems."

In this work, we propose a role-separated distillation framework that explicitly disentangles the roles of distilled steps: the first step is dedicated to preserving sample diversity via a target-prediction (e.g., v-prediction) objective, while subsequent steps focus on quality refinement under the standard DMD loss, with gradients from the DMD objective blocked at the first step. We term this approach Diversity-Preserved DMD (DP-DMD), which, despite its simplicity -- no perceptual backbone, no discriminator, no auxiliary networks, and no additional ground-truth images -- preserves sample diversity while maintaining visual quality on par with state-of-the-art methods in extensive text-to-image experiments."

This convex formulation jointly enforces low rank and subspace alignment, providing a single global optimum and substantially improving accuracy under medium and high occlusion. We also study a lightweight implicit subspace-alignment} strategy in which matrices from consecutive days are concatenated to encourage alignment of spatial or temporal singular directions. Although this heuristic offers modest gains when missing rates are low, the explicit SDP approach is markedly more robust when large fractions of entries are missing. Across two real-world datasets (Beijing and Shanghai), SATORIS-N consistently outperforms standard matrix-completion methods such as SoftImpute, IterativeSVD, statistical, and even deep learning baselines at high occlusion levels. The framework generalizes to other spatiotemporal settings in which singular subspaces evolve slowly over time. In the context of intelligent vehicles and vehicle-to-everything (V2X) systems, accurate traffic-density reconstruction enables critical applications including cooperative perception, predictive routing, and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication optimization.

As a geometric application, phase transitions with bounded energy and index in closed four-manifolds have smooth transition layers which behave like minimal hypersurfaces. Consequently, phase transitions exhibit a remarkably rigid behaviour in higher dimensions. This is in stark contrast with the 3D case, in which a wealth of nontrivial entire solutions with finite index (and energy density) is conversely known to exist, by work pioneered by Del Pino--Kowalczyk--Wei. The authors conjectured that any such solution must have parallel ends which are either planar or catenoidal, suggesting it as a parallel to De Giorgi's conjecture in this framework.

With recent large-scale foundation models showing strong zero-shot performance on downstream tasks including classification and segmentation, there has been interest in using the internal feature maps of these models for the semantic correspondence task. Recent works observe that features from DINOv2 and Stable Diffusion (SD) are complementary, the former producing accurate but sparse correspondences, while the latter produces spatially consistent correspondences. As a result, current state-of-the-art methods for semantic correspondence involve combining features from both models in an ensemble. While the performance of these methods is impressive, they are computationally expensive, requiring evaluating feature maps from large-scale foundation models. In this work we take a different approach, instead replacing SD features with a superior matching algorithm which is imbued with the desirable spatial consistency property. Specifically, we replace the standard nearest neighbours matching with an optimal transport algorithm that includes a Gromov Wasserstein spatial smoothness prior. We show that we can significantly boost the performance of the DINOv2 baseline, and be competitive and sometimes surpassing state-of-the-art methods using Stable Diffusion features, while being 5--10x more efficient.

When applied to life-assist agent settings, Risky-Bench uncovers substantial safety risks in state-of-the-art agents under realistic execution conditions. Moreover, as a well-structured evaluation pipeline, Risky-Bench is not confined to life-assist scenarios and can be adapted to other deployment settings to construct environment-specific safety evaluations, providing an extensible methodology for agent safety assessment."

    "abstract": "Transport phenomena play a key role in a variety of application domains, and efficient simulation of these dynamics remains an outstanding challenge. While quantum computers offer potential for significant speedups, existing algorithms either lack rigorous theoretical guarantees or demand substantial quantum resources, preventing scalable and efficient validation on realistic quantum hardware. To address this gap, we develop a comprehensive framework for simulating classes of transport equations, offering both rigorous theoretical guarantees -- including exponential speedups in specific cases -- and a systematic, hardware-efficient implementation. Central to our approach is the Hamiltonian embedding technique, a white-box approach for end-to-end simulation of sparse Hamiltonians that avoids abstract query models and retains near-optimal asymptotic complexity. Empirical resource estimates indicate that our approach can yield an order-of-magnitude (e.g., $42\\times$) reduction in circuit depth given favorable problem structures. We then apply our framework to solve linear and nonlinear transport PDEs, including the first experimental demonstration of a 2D advection equation on a trapped-ion quantum computer."

    "abstract": "Professional job recommendation involves a complex bipartite matching process that must reconcile a candidate's subjective preference with an employer's objective qualification. While Large Language Models (LLMs) are well-suited for modeling the rich semantics of resumes and job descriptions, existing paradigms often collapse these two decision dimensions into a single interaction signal, yielding confounded supervision under recruitment-funnel censoring and limiting policy controllability. To address these challenges, We propose JobRec, a generative job recommendation framework for de-conflating preference and qualification via constrained dual-perspective reasoning. JobRec introduces a Unified Semantic Alignment Schema that aligns candidate and job attributes into structured semantic layers, and a Two-Stage Cooperative Training Strategy that learns decoupled experts to separately infer preference and qualification. Building on these experts, a Lagrangian-based Policy Alignment module optimizes recommendations under explicit eligibility requirements, enabling controllable trade-offs. To mitigate data scarcity, we construct a synthetic dataset refined by experts. Experiments show that JobRec consistently outperforms strong baselines and provides improved controllability for strategy-aware professional matching."

To address these challenges, we propose Test-time Recursive Thinking (TRT), an iterative self-improvement framework that conditions generation on rollout-specific strategies, accumulated knowledge, and self-generated verification signals. Using TRT, open-source models reach 100% accuracy on AIME-25/24, and on LiveCodeBench's most difficult problems, closed-source models improve by 10.4-14.8 percentage points without external feedback."

However, existing CPA schemes are restricted to an idealized setting in which the system cannot tolerate stragglers. In this paper, we extend CPA to straggler-aware distributed computing systems with a pre-specified non-straggler pattern, where exact recovery is required for a given collection of admissible non-straggler sets. Our main results show that exact recovery of the desired aggregation is achievable with fewer worker responses than that required by polynomial codes based on individual decoding, and that feasibility is characterized by the intersection structure of the non-straggler patterns. In particular, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for exact recovery in straggler-aware CPA. We identify an intersection-size threshold that is sufficient to guarantee exact recovery. When the number of admissible non-straggler sets is sufficiently large, we further show that this threshold is necessary in a generic sense. We also provide an explicit construction of feasible CPA schemes whenever the intersection size exceeds the derived threshold. Finally, simulations verify our theoretical results by demonstrating a sharp feasibility transition at the predicted intersection threshold."

While RL generally preserves broader model capabilities (retention) better than SFT, it comes with significant costs: complex reward engineering, instability, and expensive on-policy sampling. In contrast, SFT is efficient but brittle, often suffering from catastrophic forgetting due to $\\textbf{Supervision Mismatch}$: the divergence between the model's evolving policy and static training labels. We address this trade-off with $\\textbf{Trajectory-Mixed Supervision (TMS)}$, a reward-free framework that approximates the on-policy benefits of RL by creating a dynamic curriculum from the model's own historical checkpoints. TMS minimizes $\\textit{Policy-Label Divergence (PLD)}$, preventing the mode collapse that drives forgetting in standard SFT. Experiments across reasoning (MATH, GSM8K) and instruction-following benchmarks demonstrate that TMS effectively shifts the accuracy--retention Pareto frontier. While RL remains the gold standard for retention, TMS significantly outperforms standard and iterative SFT, bridging the gap to RL without requiring reward models or verifiers. Mechanistic analysis confirms that PLD drift accurately predicts forgetting and that TMS successfully mitigates this drift."

    "abstract": "The logic of definitions is a family of logics for encoding and reasoning about judgments, which are atomic predicates specified by inference rules. A definition associates an atomic predicate with a logical formula, which may itself depend on the predicate being defined. This leads to an apparent circularity which can be resolved by interpreting definitions as monotone fixed-point operators on terms, and which is enforced by imposing a stratification condition on definitions. In many instances, it is useful to consider definitions in which the predicate being defined appears negatively in the body of its definition. In the logic $\\mathcal G$, underlying the Abella proof assistant, this is not allowed due to the stratification condition. One such application violating this condition is that of defining logical relations, which is a technique commonly used to prove properties about programming languages. Tiu has shown how to relax this stratification condition to allow for a broader body of definitions including that needed for logical relations. However, he only showed how to extend a core fragment of $\\mathcal G$ with the weakened stratification condition, resulting in a logic he called $\\mathrm{LD}$. In this work we show that the weakened stratification condition is also compatible with generic (nabla) quantification and general induction. The eventual aim of this work is to justify an extension of the Abella proof assistant allowing for such definitions."

    "abstract": "Weakly supervised temporal video grounding aims to localize query-relevant segments in untrimmed videos using only video-sentence pairs, without requiring ground-truth segment annotations that specify exact temporal boundaries. Recent approaches tackle this task by utilizing Gaussian-based temporal proposals to represent query-relevant segments. However, their inference strategies rely on heuristic mappings from Gaussian parameters to segment boundaries, resulting in suboptimal localization performance. To address this issue, we propose Gaussian Boundary Optimization (GBO), a novel inference framework that predicts segment boundaries by solving a principled optimization problem that balances proposal coverage and segment compactness. We derive a closed-form solution for this problem and rigorously analyze the optimality conditions under varying penalty regimes. Beyond its theoretical foundations, GBO offers several practical advantages: it is training-free and compatible with both single-Gaussian and mixture-based proposal architectures. Our experiments show that GBO significantly improves localization, achieving state-of-the-art results across standard benchmarks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficiency and generalizability of GBO across various proposal schemes.

Creativity is hard to capture purely at the social level, as novel ideas are generated through cognitive mechanisms. To address this gap, we introduce a multi-level socio-cognitive agent-based framework in which agents share a common semantic vocabulary and substrate but differ in semantic network topology. A single generative parameter tunes semantic modularity, yielding emergent individual differences in ideational breadth. When agents exchange ideation traces, two canonical social-creativity phenomena arise without being imposed: lower pre-interaction ideation overlap predicts larger stimulation gains, and shared inspiration sources induce network-level redundancy. The framework enables mechanistic theory-building about cognition and social structure in collective creativity."

    "abstract": "One of the chronic problems of deep-learning models is shortcut learning. In a case where the majority of training data are dominated by a certain feature, neural networks prefer to learn such a feature even if the feature is not generalizable outside the training set. Based on the framework of Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK), we analyzed the case of linear neural networks to derive some important properties of shortcut learning. We defined a feature of a neural network as an eigenfunction of NTK. Then, we found that shortcut features correspond to features with larger eigenvalues when the shortcuts stem from the imbalanced number of samples in the clustered distribution. We also showed that the features with larger eigenvalues still have a large influence on the neural network output even after training, due to data variances in the clusters. Such a preference for certain features remains even when a margin of a neural network output is controlled, which shows that the max-margin bias is not the only major reason for shortcut learning. These properties of linear neural networks are empirically extended for more complex neural networks as a two-layer fully-connected ReLU network and a ResNet-18."

Hence, estimating 3D poses of all nearby humans, tracking their movements over time, and understanding their activities within social and environmental contexts are essential for many applications, such as autonomous driving, robot perception, robot navigation, and human-robot interaction. However, most existing 3D human pose estimation datasets primarily focus on single-person scenes or are collected in controlled laboratory environments, which restricts their relevance to real-world applications. To bridge this gap, we introduce JRDB-Pose3D, which captures multi-human indoor and outdoor environments from a mobile robotic platform. JRDB-Pose3D provides rich 3D human pose annotations for such complex and dynamic scenes, including SMPL-based pose annotations with consistent body-shape parameters and track IDs for each individual over time. JRDB-Pose3D contains, on average, 5-10 human poses per frame, with some scenes featuring up to 35 individuals simultaneously. The proposed dataset presents unique challenges, including frequent occlusions, truncated bodies, and out-of-frame body parts, which closely reflect real-world environments. Moreover, JRDB-Pose3D inherits all available annotations from the JRDB dataset, such as 2D pose, information about social grouping, activities, and interactions, full-scene semantic masks with consistent human- and object-level tracking, and detailed annotations for each individual, such as age, gender, and race, making it a holistic dataset for a wide range of downstream perception and human-centric understanding tasks."

    "abstract": "Narrowband perfect absorbers are interesting for spectrum sensing, molecular detection, and infrared imaging. However, their design remains constrained by intuitive, iterative methods that lack flexibility, while also facing challenges in multi-objective optimization. Here, we introduce a deep learning-enabled inverse-design framework that overcomes these limitations through a conditional Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN). The main contribution of this work is a dual-channel image encoding scheme that jointly represents the geometry and thickness of a Si$_3$N$_4$ meta-layer, facilitating the network to learn the distribution of viable structures for a target optical response. This approach naturally solves the inherent ``one-to-many'' design issue, giving a diverse portfolio of functional candidates from a single input spectrum. The designed absorbers achieve exceptional spectral fidelity, with resonance peak errors below 5 nm, a mean squared error (MSE) on the order of $10^{-3}$, and the capacity to produce over 10 distinct, high-performance designs per target. Furthermore, we demonstrate the model's robustness under oblique illumination, showing that it can be efficiently fine-tuned to maintain spectral accuracy across incidence angles from $10^\\circ$ to $40^\\circ$ by transfer learning, thus extending its practical utility to non-normal operating conditions. Full-wave simulations confirm that the generated geometries support a hybrid plasmonic-dielectric resonance, leading to near-perfect absorption and strong near-field enhancement. Our study provides a robust, physics-aware design paradigm that moves beyond conventional parametric optimization. The introduced framework establishes a versatile platform for the on-demand inverse design of advanced photonic devices for sensing, spectroscopy, and optical signal processing."

Such efforts often target one context and low-fidelity stages, limiting the generalizability of findings and obscuring how participants' ideas evolve. To address these limitations, we conducted a 14-week workshop with a multidisciplinary team of 22 participants, centered around how embodied AI can reduce non-value-added task burdens in three healthcare settings: emergency departments, long-term rehabilitation facilities, and sleep disorder clinics. We found that the iterative progression from abstract brainstorming to high-fidelity prototypes, supported by educational scaffolds, enabled participants to understand real-world trade-offs and generate more deployable solutions. We propose eight guidelines for co-designing more considerate embodied AI: attuned to context, responsive to social dynamics, mindful of expectations, and grounded in deployment.

Our proposed method, named HP-GAN, effectively exploits neural network priors through two primary strategies: FakeTwins and discriminator consistency. FakeTwins leverages pretrained networks as encoders to compute a self-supervised loss and applies this through the generated images to train the generator, thereby enabling the generation of more diverse and high quality images. Additionally, we introduce a consistency mechanism between discriminators that evaluate feature maps extracted from Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Vision Transformer (ViT) feature networks. Discriminator consistency promotes coherent learning among discriminators and enhances training robustness by aligning their assessments of image quality. Our extensive evaluation across seventeen datasets-including scenarios with large, small, and limited data, and covering a variety of image domains-demonstrates that HP-GAN consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in terms of Fréchet Inception Distance (FID), achieving significant improvements in image diversity and quality.

We address this challenge by formulating storytelling as a closed-loop constraint enforcement problem and propose MUSE, a multi-agent framework that coordinates generation through an iterative plan-execute-verify-revise loop. MUSE translates narrative intent into explicit, machine-executable controls over identity, spatial composition, and temporal continuity, and applies targeted multimodal feedback to correct violations during generation.

Moreover, $J(x)$ in a strip can be tuned by control wires to produce an inverted $J(x)$ profile with dips at the edges to mitigate current crowding at lithographic defects and block premature penetration of vortices. These conclusions are corroborated by calculations of $J(x)$ in a thin strip coupled inductively with side control wires or in bilayer strip structures by solving the London and Ginzburg Landau equations in the thin film Pearl limit. Thermally-activated penetration of vortices from the edges and unbinding of vortex-antivortex pairs in inverted $J(x)$ profiles are evaluated. It is shown that these structures can be used to develop single-photon strip detectors much wider than $Λ$. Such detectors can be tuned {\\it in situ} by varying current in control wires to reach the ultimate photon sensitivity limited by unbinding of vortex-antivortex pairs.

This scoping review systematically screened 1968 records, analysed 18 studies and identified a critical design paradox: techno-solutionist systems overlook social and cultural barriers, while social-support features often fail in low-activity social networks. To address this gap, we propose the Culturally Embedded Interaction Framework, integrating five dimensions: culturally-grounded measurement, multi-modal interaction, contextual and temporal adaptability, embedded social weaving, and theory-guided cultural adaptation. The framework advances beyond accessibility-focused approaches by mapping behavioural theory to design mechanisms that support sustained and culturally plural participation. We provide actionable design principles to help HCI researchers and practitioners move from one-size-fits-all models toward adaptive, theory-informed, and culturally sustaining design."

    "abstract": "A nonlinear three-dimensional small-deformation theory is presented for a leaky dielectric drop coated with a dilute monolayer of insoluble apolar surfactant and subjected to a uniform DC electric field. The theory is developed within the framework of the Taylor--Melcher leaky dielectric model, and builds on previous work by retaining surface charge convection in the charge conservation equation. Solving the problem in three dimensions and retaining charge convection allows us to capture the transition to Quincke rotation, a symmetry breaking instability wherein a drop begins rotating at a steady angular velocity when the applied electric field strength exceeds a critical value. We derive a system of coupled nonlinear ordinary differential equations for the drop shape, dipole moment, and surfactant distribution, which we solve numerically. We discuss the combined effects of charge convection and surfactant in the Taylor regime -- in which the field strength is too weak to induce Quincke rotation and the drop adopts an axisymmetric spheroidal shape. In the Quincke regime, we find that the presence of a weakly-diffusing surfactant results in a lower critical electric field than that for a drop with uniform surfactant coverage. Varying the elasticity number, which quantifies the variation of the surface tension as a function of the surfactant concentration, can either increase or decrease the critical field strength depending on the diffusivity of the surfactant. Additionally, we find that the experimentally observed hysteresis in the angular velocity of the drop can disappear when surfactant diffusion is sufficiently weak."

While optical systems provide a controlled setting for studying these phenomena, achieving deterministic control over their generation remains challenging. Here, we demonstrate a novel approach to induce and precisely modulate extreme events in a semiconductor VCSEL using polarization-controlled optical feedback. By integrating a $λ$/2-waveplate into a polarization-selective external cavity, we regulate the nonlinear interaction between TE and TM modes. This setup triggers high-intensity, heavy-tailed fluctuations in the TM mode, exhibiting clear signatures of extreme events. We show that these events arise from deterministic energy exchange between modes, as evidenced by strong bipolar correlations and long-range temporal memory. The waveplate angle serves as an effective external parameter, enabling non-monotonic tuning of the event rate, intensity, and temporal clustering. Our study establish a platform for exploring extreme events in dissipative systems, with implications for nonlinear photonics and optical technologies."

By leveraging the inherent boundedness and stochasticity of quantum gradients computed via the parameter-shift rule, Q-ShiftDP enables tighter sensitivity analysis and reduces noise requirements. We combine carefully calibrated Gaussian noise with intrinsic quantum noise to provide formal privacy and utility guarantees, and show that harnessing quantum noise further improves the privacy-utility trade-off. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that Q-ShiftDP consistently outperforms classical DP methods in QML."

Crucially, SEM findings revealed environmental stimuli as the predominant factor, indirectly influencing purchasing behavior through perceived value, contrary to existing literature asserting equal impacts from consumer ethnocentrism, environmental stimuli, and perceived behavioral control. Statistical evidence further demonstrated higher online purchase frequency for premium Wuliangye liquor, aligning with Generation Z's e-commerce preferences. By implementing stricter website-based participant screening than prior studies, this research optimized the analytical model, yielding data-driven strategic recommendations: strengthening e-commerce platforms, enhancing promotional expertise, leveraging cultural localization, and prioritizing premium product development.

    "abstract": "Information graphics, such as hazard maps, evacuation diagrams, and pictorial action guides, are widely used in disaster risk communication. These visuals are important because they convey hazard information quickly, reduce reliance on lengthy text, and support decision-making in time-critical situations. However, despite their importance, disaster information graphics do not work equally well for all audiences. In practice, many graphics remain difficult to interpret, and their accessibility for vulnerable populations is still uneven and underexplored. Despite their central role, there has been little empirical work examining how graphics shape disaster communication, what challenges practitioners face in using them, and, most importantly, how inclusive current disaster graphics are in real-world settings. To address this gap, we examine how information graphics are currently produced and used in disaster communication, what issues emerge in practice, and how inclusivity is addressed. We conducted semi-structured interviews with disaster communication practitioners and researchers to examine the role of graphics across preparedness, warning, and response contexts, as well as the barriers experienced by vulnerable communities. Our findings show that graphics are widely expected and heavily relied upon, yet significant accessibility gaps persist for groups such as people with vision impairments, older adults, and culturally and linguistically diverse communities. Participants also highlighted that inclusive adaptations are difficult to achieve during unfolding emergencies due to operational constraints, limited guidance, and resource barriers. Based on these findings, we outline recommendations for disaster management agencies and graphic designers and identify research directions for technological and adaptive support to make disaster graphics more inclusive at scale."

    "abstract": "We investigate non-equilibrium phase coexistence associated with a first-order phase transition by numerically studying a one-dimensional Hamiltonian-Potts model with fractional spatial derivatives. The fractional derivative is introduced so as to reproduce the low-wavenumber density of states of the standard two-dimensional model, allowing phase coexistence to occur in a minimal one-dimensional setting under steady heat conduction. By imposing a constant heat flux through boundary heat baths, we observe stable coexistence of ordered and disordered phases separated by a stationary interface. We find that the temperature at the interface systematically deviates from the equilibrium transition temperature, demonstrating a clear violation of the local equilibrium description. This deviation indicates that equilibrium metastable states can be stabilized and controlled by a steady heat current. Furthermore, the interface temperature obtained in our simulations is in quantitative agreement with the prediction of global thermodynamics for non-equilibrium steady states. These results confirm that the breakdown of local equilibrium and the stabilization of metastable states are intrinsic features of non-equilibrium first-order phase transitions, independent of spatial dimensionality. Our study thus provides a minimal and controlled numerical model for exploring the fundamental limits of thermodynamic descriptions in non-equilibrium steady states."

    "abstract": "We develop a Bayesian methodology for numerical solution of the incompressible Navier--Stokes equations with quantified uncertainty. The central idea is to treat discretized Navier--Stokes dynamics as a state-space model and to view numerical solution as posterior computation: priors encode physical structure and modeling error, and the solver outputs a distribution over states and quantities of interest rather than a single trajectory. In two dimensions, stochastic representations (Feynman--Kac and stochastic characteristics for linear advection--diffusion with prescribed drift) motivate Monte Carlo solvers and provide intuition for uncertainty propagation. In three dimensions, we formulate stochastic Navier--Stokes models and describe particle-based and ensemble-based Bayesian workflows for uncertainty propagation in spectral discretizations. A key computational advantage is that parameter learning can be performed stably via particle learning: marginalization and resample--propagate (one-step smoothing) constructions avoid the weight-collapse that plagues naive sequential importance sampling on static parameters. When partial observations are available, the same machinery supports sequential observational updating as an additional capability. We also discuss non-Gaussian (heavy-tailed) error models based on normal variance-mean mixtures, which yield conditionally Gaussian updates via latent scale augmentation."

Such extensions are offered by the topologically unique Thurston geometries, which are homogeneous but anisotropic spacetime models.

Current methods mainly rely on large-scale supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, this paradigm suffers from heavy data dependence and limited scalability against the rapid evolution of MLLMs. Although recent zero-shot approaches offer a flexible alternative, their performance remains significantly behind SFT-based methods, due to the straightforward workflow designs. To address these limitations, we propose \\textbf{Refer-Agent}, a collaborative multi-agent system with alternating reasoning-reflection mechanisms. This system decomposes RVOS into step-by-step reasoning process. During reasoning, we introduce a Coarse-to-Fine frame selection strategy to ensure the frame diversity and textual relevance, along with a Dynamic Focus Layout that adaptively adjusts the agent's visual focus. Furthermore, we propose a Chain-of-Reflection mechanism, which employs a Questioner-Responder pair to generate a self-reflection chain, enabling the system to verify intermediate results and generates feedback for next-round reasoning refinement. Extensive experiments on five challenging benchmarks demonstrate that Refer-Agent significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, including both SFT-based models and zero-shot approaches. Moreover, Refer-Agent is flexible and enables fast integration of new MLLMs without any additional fine-tuning costs. Code will be released."

We revisit the backbone and use TIPS-a VLM trained with spatially aware objectives. While TIPS alleviates CLIP's issues, it exposes a distributional gap between global and local features. We address this with decoupled prompts-fixed for image-level detection and learnable for pixel-level localization-and by injecting local evidence into the global score. Without CLIP-specific tricks, our TIPS-based pipeline improves image-level performance by 1.1-3.9% and pixel-level by 1.5-6.9% across seven industrial datasets, delivering strong generalization with a lean architecture.

At BNY Mellon, we conduct a survey with 2989 developer responses and 11 in-depth interviews. Our findings demonstrate that a multifaceted approach is needed to measure AI productivity impacts: survey results expose conflicting perspectives on AI tool usefulness, while interviews elicit six distinct factors that capture both short-term and long-term dimensions of productivity. In contrast to prior work, our factors highlight the importance of long-term metrics like technical expertise and ownership of work. We hope this work encourages future research to incorporate a broader range of human-centered factors, and supports industry in adopting more holistic approaches to evaluating developer productivity."

    "abstract": "Policy gradient methods rely on a baseline to measure the relative advantage of an action, ensuring the model reinforces behaviors that outperform its current average capability. In the training of Large Language Models (LLMs) using Actor-Critic methods (e.g., PPO), this baseline is typically estimated by a Value Model (Critic) often as large as the policy model itself. However, as the policy continuously evolves, the value model requires expensive, synchronous incremental training to accurately track the shifting capabilities of the policy. To avoid this overhead, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) eliminates the coupled value model by using the average reward of a group of rollouts as the baseline; yet, this approach necessitates extensive sampling to maintain estimation stability. In this paper, we propose $V_0$, a Generalist Value Model capable of estimating the expected performance of any model on unseen prompts without requiring parameter updates. We reframe value estimation by treating the policy's dynamic capability as an explicit context input; specifically, we leverage a history of instruction-performance pairs to dynamically profile the model, departing from the traditional paradigm that relies on parameter fitting to perceive capability shifts. Focusing on value estimation at State Zero (i.e., the initial prompt, hence $V_0$), our model serves as a critical resource scheduler. During GRPO training, $V_0$ predicts success rates prior to rollout, allowing for efficient sampling budget allocation; during deployment, it functions as a router, dispatching instructions to the most cost-effective and suitable model. Empirical results demonstrate that $V_0$ significantly outperforms heuristic budget allocation and achieves a Pareto-optimal trade-off between performance and cost in LLM routing tasks."

In this paper, we study DPIC problem under heterogeneous side-information cardinalities. We propose a transmission scheme that coordinates client broadcasts to maximize coding efficiency while ensuring that each client achieves a common target level $T$. In addition, we impose a strict security constraint that no client acquires more than the target $T$ number of messages, guaranteeing that each client ends up with exactly $T$ messages.

Some existing approaches propose unlearning verification methods based on backdooring techniques. However, these methods typically require participation in the model's initial training phase to backdoor the model for later verification, which is inefficient and impractical. In this paper, we propose an efficient verification of erasure method (EVE) for verifying machine unlearning without requiring involvement in the model's initial training process. The core idea is to perturb the unlearning data to ensure the model prediction of the specified samples will change before and after unlearning with perturbed data. The unlearning users can leverage the observation of the changes as a verification signal. Specifically, the perturbations are designed with two key objectives: ensuring the unlearning effect and altering the unlearned model's prediction of target samples. We formalize the perturbation generation as an adversarial optimization problem, solving it by aligning the unlearning gradient with the gradient of boundary change for target samples. We conducted extensive experiments, and the results show that EVE can verify machine unlearning without involving the model's initial training process, unlike backdoor-based methods. Moreover, EVE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art unlearning verification methods, offering significant speedup in efficiency while enhancing verification accuracy. The source code of EVE is released at \\uline{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/EVE-C143}, providing a novel tool for verification of machine unlearning."

While conceptually simple, HySparse strategically derives each sparse layer's token selection and KV caches directly from the preceding full attention layer. This architecture resolves two fundamental limitations of prior sparse attention methods. First, conventional approaches typically rely on additional proxies to predict token importance, introducing extra complexity and potentially suboptimal performance. In contrast, HySparse uses the full attention layer as a precise oracle to identify important tokens. Second, existing sparse attention designs often reduce computation without saving KV cache. HySparse enables sparse attention layers to reuse the full attention KV cache, thereby reducing both computation and memory. We evaluate HySparse on both 7B dense and 80B MoE models. Across all settings, HySparse consistently outperforms both full attention and hybrid SWA baselines. Notably, in the 80B MoE model with 49 total layers, only 5 layers employ full attention, yet HySparse achieves substantial performance gains while reducing KV cache storage by nearly 10x."

Leveraging RoboChart, a domain-specific modelling language with formal semantics, we combine model checking and theorem proving in our approach. Structured requirements are automatically transformed into formal assertions using predefined templates, and verification results are automatically integrated as evidence.

Extensive experiments demonstrate that LogiCls delivers robust, interpretable, and accurate industrial logical anomaly classification, providing both the predicted violation categories and their evidence trails."

    "abstract": "While information securityis a fundamental requirement for wireless communications, conventional optimization based approaches often struggle with real-time implementation, and deep models, typically discriminative in nature, may lack the ability to cope with unforeseen scenarios. To address this challenge, this paper investigates the design of legitimate beamforming and artificial noise (AN) to achieve physical layer security by exploiting the conditional diffusion model. Specifically, we reformulate the security optimization as a conditional generative process, using a diffusion model to learn the inherent distribution of near-optimal joint beamforming and AN strategies. We employ a U-Net architecture with cross-attention to integrate channel state information, as the basis for the generative process. Moreover, we fine-tune the trained model using an objective incorporating the sum secrecy rate such that the security performance is further enhanced. Finally, simulation results validate the learning process convergence and demonstrate that the proposed generative method achieves superior secrecy performance across various scenarios as compared with the baselines."

A motivation to consider non-finite tensor categories is the theory of vertex operator algebras where such categories arise as categories of modules. The mapping class group representations presented in this article admit a factorization homology description. In other words, they are of three-dimensional origin and hence obey a holographic principle. A compact projective symmetric Frobenius algebra endows the representations with a pointing that is mapping class group invariant and compatible with the gluing along intervals. This shows that, at least to some extent, many of the tools for the construction and study of spaces of conformal blocks and correlators remain available in a non-finite, but rigid setting."

    "abstract": "Many decision-making problems require ranking individuals by their treatment effects rather than estimating the exact effect magnitudes. Examples include prioritizing patients for preventive care interventions, or ranking customers by the expected incremental impact of an advertisement. Surprisingly, while causal effect estimation has received substantial attention in the literature, the problem of directly learning rankings of treatment effects has largely remained unexplored. In this paper, we introduce Rank-Learner, a novel two-stage learner that directly learns the ranking of treatment effects from observational data. We first show that naive approaches based on precise treatment effect estimation solve a harder problem than necessary for ranking, while our Rank-Learner optimizes a pairwise learning objective that recovers the true treatment effect ordering, without explicit CATE estimation. We further show that our Rank-Learner is Neyman-orthogonal and thus comes with strong theoretical guarantees, including robustness to estimation errors in the nuisance functions. In addition, our Rank-Learner is model-agnostic, and can be instantiated with arbitrary machine learning models (e.g., neural networks). We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through extensive experiments where Rank-Learner consistently outperforms standard CATE estimators and non-orthogonal ranking methods. Overall, we provide practitioners with a new, orthogonal two-stage learner for ranking individuals by their treatment effects."

PNS trains a dedicated model via reverse reinforcement learning (RL) guided by a composite reward combining format compliance, accuracy inversion, reward model assessment, and chain-of-thought evaluation, generating responses nearly indistinguishable from correct solutions. We further validate PNS as a plug-and-play data source for preference optimization across three backbone models on seven mathematical reasoning benchmarks. Results demonstrate that PNS consistently outperforms other negative sample synthesis methods, achieving an average improvement of 2.03% over RL-trained models."

    "abstract": "Asynchronous pipeline parallelism maximizes hardware utilization by eliminating the pipeline bubbles inherent in synchronous execution, offering a path toward efficient large-scale distributed training. However, this efficiency gain can be compromised by gradient staleness, where the immediate model updates with delayed gradients introduce noise into the optimization process. Crucially, we identify a critical, yet often overlooked, pathology: this delay scales linearly with pipeline depth, fundamentally undermining the very scalability that the method originally intends to provide. In this work, we investigate this inconsistency and bridge the gap by rectifying delayed gradients through basis rotation, restoring scalable asynchronous training while maintaining performance. Specifically, we observe that the deleterious effects of delayed gradients are exacerbated when the Hessian eigenbasis is misaligned with the standard coordinate basis. We demonstrate that this misalignment prevents coordinate-wise adaptive schemes, such as Adam, from effectively leveraging curvature-aware adaptivity. This failure leads to significant oscillations in the optimization trajectory and, consequently, slower convergence. We substantiate these findings through both rigorous theoretical analysis and empirical evaluation. To address this challenge, we propose the use of basis rotation, demonstrating that it effectively mitigates the alignment issue and significantly accelerates convergence in asynchronous settings. For example, our training of a 1B-parameter LLM with basis rotation achieves the same training loss in 76.8% fewer iterations compared to the best-performing asynchronous pipeline parallel training baseline."

We model training as a function-space trajectory and measure sensitivity to single-sample perturbations along this trajectory. We propose a contractive propagation condition and a stability certificate obtained by unrolling the resulting recursion. A small certificate implies stability-based generalization, while we also prove that there exist interpolating regimes with small risk where such contractive sensitivity cannot hold, showing that stability is not a universal explanation. Experiments confirm that certificate growth predicts generalization differences across optimizers, step sizes, and dataset perturbations. The framework therefore identifies regimes where stability explains generalization and where alternative mechanisms must account for success."

While perception information, such as height map, enhances terrain awareness, sensor noise and sim-to-real gaps can destabilize policies in practice. In this work, we provide theoretical analysis that bounds the return gap under observation noise, when the induced latent dynamics are contractive. Furthermore, we present Contractive Mapping for Robustness (CMR) framework that maps high-dimensional, disturbance-prone observations into a latent space, where local perturbations are attenuated over time. Specifically, this approach couples contrastive representation learning with Lipschitz regularization to preserve task-relevant geometry while explicitly controlling sensitivity. Notably, the formulation can be incorporated into modern deep reinforcement learning pipelines as an auxiliary loss term with minimal additional technical effort required. Further, our extensive humanoid experiments show that CMR potently outperforms other locomotion algorithms under increased noise."

    "abstract": "It is intuitive and well known, that if agents in a multi-agent system iteratively update their states in the Euclidean space as convex combinations of neighbors' states, all states eventually converge to the same value (consensus), provided the interaction graph is sufficiently connected. However, this seems to be also true in practice if the convex combinations of states are mapped or radially projected onto any unit $l_p$-sphere or even boundaries of star-convex sets, herein referred to as star boundaries. In this paper, we present insight into this matter by providing a necessary and sufficient condition for asymptotic consensus of the normalized states (directions) for strongly connected directed graphs, which is equivalent to asymptotic consensus of states when the star boundaries are the same for all agents. Furthermore, we show that when asymptotic consensus occurs, the states converge linearly and the point of convergence is continuous in the initial states. Assuming a directed strongly connected graph provides a more general setting than that considered, for example, in gradient-based consensus protocols, where symmetric graphs are assumed. Illustrative examples and a vast number of numerical simulations showcase the theoretical results."

    "abstract": "Machine unlearning aims to remove specific content from trained models while preserving overall performance. However, the phenomenon of benign relearning, in which forgotten information reemerges even from benign fine-tuning data, reveals that existing unlearning methods remain fundamentally fragile. A common explanation attributes this effect to topical relevance, but we find this account insufficient. Through systematic analysis, we demonstrate that syntactic similarity, rather than topicality, is the primary driver: across benchmarks, syntactically similar data consistently trigger recovery even without topical overlap, due to their alignment in representations and gradients with the forgotten content. Motivated by this insight, we introduce syntactic diversification, which paraphrases the original forget queries into heterogeneous structures prior to unlearning. This approach effectively suppresses benign relearning, accelerates forgetting, and substantially alleviates the trade-off between unlearning efficacy and model utility."

However, their practical deployment faces two major limitations: domain shift, where models trained in one environment struggle to generalize to others, and the black-box nature of DNNs, which limits interpretability. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework that integrates a group of variable-length two-dimensional (2D) shapelets with a pre-trained large language model (LLM) to achieve efficient, interpretable, and generalizable RF fingerprinting. The 2D shapelets explicitly capture diverse local temporal patterns across the in-phase and quadrature (I/Q) components, providing compact and interpretable representations. Complementarily, the pre-trained LLM captures more long-range dependencies and global contextual information, enabling strong generalization with minimal training overhead. Moreover, our framework also supports prototype generation for few-shot inference, enhancing cross-domain performance without additional retraining. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed method, we conduct extensive experiments on six datasets across various protocols and domains. The results show that our method achieves superior standard and few-shot performance across both source and unseen domains."

    "abstract": "Quantum chaos is commonly assessed through probe-dependent signatures such as spectral statistics, OTOCs, and entanglement growth, which need not coincide. Recently, a dissipative diagnostic of chaos has been proposed, in which an infinitesimal coupling to a bath yields a finite Liouvillian gap in chaotic systems, marking the onset of intrinsic relaxation. This raises a conceptual question: what is the minimal departure from Clifford dynamics needed for this intrinsically relaxing behavior to emerge? In this work, we investigate the dynamics under the Floquet two-qubit Clifford circuit interleaved with a finite density of Haar-random single-site gates, followed by a depolarizing channel with strength $γ$. For Floquet Clifford circuits built from an \\textit{i}SWAP-class two-qubit gate, our analysis identifies two distinct regimes for the Liouvillian gap in the thermodynamic limit, exemplified by the undoped and fully doped extreme cases. In both regimes, the dissipative diagnostic signals chaotic behavior, differing only in how the gap scales with system size. In the undoped circuit, the gap scales as $Δ\\sim γN$, whereas in the fully doped circuit it remains finite as $N\\to\\infty$. We find that the doping density $p_h$ governs the crossover: as $p_h\\to 0$, any spatial structure remains undoped-like, whereas for finite $p_h$ certain structures can enter a finite-gap regime. These results are analytically established in the strongly dissipative regime $γ\\gg 1$ by deriving lower bounds on the gap as a function of $p_h$ and explicit finite-gap constructions, and their extension toward $γ\\to 0$ is supported by numerics. Importantly, our analytic treatment depends only on the spatial doping structure, so the same gap scaling persists even when the Haar rotations are independently resampled each Floquet period."

For anyon superconductors, the condensate charge is determined unambiguously by the charged local bosons contained in the condensable algebra.

Although recent methodological work has extended estimation and inference tools to multivariate settings, far less attention has been devoted to developing global testing methods that formally assess whether a discontinuity exists anywhere along a multivariate treatment boundary. Existing approaches perform well in large samples, but can exhibit severe size distortions in moderate or small samples due to the sparsity of observations near any particular boundary point. This paper introduces a complementary global testing procedure that mitigates the small-sample weaknesses of existing multivariate RD methods by integrating multivariate machine learning estimators with a distance-based aggregation strategy, yielding a test statistic that remains reliable with limited data. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed method maintains near-nominal size and strong power, including in settings where standard multivariate estimators break down.

Near the detection threshold, the denoiser increases the number of antennas contributing reliable pulse timing by a factor of $\\sim 2-3$, which correspondingly tightens direction reconstruction uncertainties.

Due to their very rich structure, regular (maximally symmetric) maniplexes are always stable. It is thus natural to ask what is the maximum possible degree of symmetry that a maniplex that is not stable can admit. Symmetry in maniplexes is usually measured by the number of orbits on flags (nodes) of their automorphism group. A few families of unstable maniplexes with 4 flag-orbits are known for rank 3.

While the BCS, Fulde--Ferrell--Larkin--Ovchinnikov (FFLO), and normal phases occupy different regions on the phase diagram when the parameters are uniform, a spatial change of pairing strength or spin polarization can drive the system from the FFLO phase to a normal gas or from a BCS superfluid to the FFLO phase in real space. The FFLO phase exhibits its signature modulating order parameter at the FFLO momentum due to population imbalance, and the pair correlation penetrates the polarized normal phase and exhibits proximity effects. Meanwhile, the BCS phase tends to repel population imbalance and maintain a plateau of pairing. Interestingly, a buffer FFLO phase emerges when the spatial change attempts to join the BCS and normal phase in the presence of spin polarization. By analyzing the pairing correlations, interfacial properties, and momentum-space spectra of the inhomogeneous structures, relevant length- and momentum- scales and their interplay are characterized. We also briefly discuss implications of inhomogeneous multi-phase atomic Fermi gases with population imbalance."

    "abstract": "The development of programming languages involves complex theoretical and practical challenges, particularly when addressing modularity and reusability through language extensions. While language workbenches aim to enable modular development under the constraints of the language extension problem, one critical constraint -- separate compilation -- is often relaxed due to its complexity. However, this relaxation undermines artifact reusability and integration with common dependency systems. A key difficulty under separate compilation arises from managing attribute grammars, as extensions may introduce new attributes that invalidate previously generated abstract syntax tree structures. Existing approaches, such as the use of dynamic maps in the Neverlang workbench, favor flexibility at the cost of compile-time correctness, leading to potential runtime errors due to undefined attributes. This work addresses this issue by introducing nlgcheck, a theoretically sound static analysis tool based on data-flow analysis for the Neverlang language workbench. nlgcheck detects potential runtime errors -- such as undefined attribute accesses -- at compile time, preserving separate compilation while maintaining strong static correctness guarantees. Experimental evaluation using mutation testing on Neverlang-based projects demonstrates that nlgcheck effectively enhances robustness without sacrificing modularity or flexibility and with a level of performance that does not impede its adoption in daily development activities."

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly mediate our social, cultural, and political interactions. While they can simulate some aspects of human behavior and decision-making, it is still underexplored whether repeated interactions with other agents amplify their biases or lead to exclusionary behaviors. To this end, we study Chirper.ai-an LLM-driven social media platform-analyzing 7M posts and interactions among 32K LLM agents over a year. We start with homophily and social influence among LLMs, learning that similar to humans', their social networks exhibit these fundamental phenomena. Next, we study the toxic language of LLMs, its linguistic features, and their interaction patterns, finding that LLMs show different structural patterns in toxic posting than humans. After studying the ideological leaning in LLMs posts, and the polarization in their community, we focus on how to prevent their potential harmful activities. We present a simple yet effective method, called Chain of Social Thought (CoST), that reminds LLM agents to avoid harmful posting."

    "abstract": "Real-time cyber-physical systems depend on deterministic task execution to guarantee safety and correctness. Unfortunately, this determinism can unintentionally expose timing information that enables adversaries to infer task execution patterns and carry out timing-based attacks targeting safety-critical control tasks. While prior defenses aim to obscure schedules through randomization or isolation, they typically neglect the implications of such modifications on closed-loop control behavior and real-time feasibility. This work studies the problem of securing real-time control workloads against timing inference attacks while explicitly accounting for both schedulability constraints and control performance requirements. We present a scheduling-based mitigation approach that introduces bounded timing perturbations to control task executions in a structured manner, reducing adversarial opportunities without violating real-time guarantees. The framework jointly considers worst-case execution behavior and the impact of execution delays on control performance, enabling the system to operate within predefined safety and performance limits. Through experimental evaluation on representative task sets and control scenarios, the proposed approach demonstrates that exposure to timing-based attacks can be significantly reduced while preserving predictable execution and acceptable control quality."

    "abstract": "The proportional hazards (PH) and accelerated failure time (AFT) models are the most widely used hazard structures for analysing time-to-event data. When the goal is to identify variables associated with event times, variable selection is typically performed within a single hazard structure, imposing strong assumptions on how covariates affect the hazard function. To allow simultaneous selection of relevant variables and the hazard structure itself, we develop a Bayesian variable selection approach within the general hazard (GH) model, which includes the PH, AFT, and other structures as special cases. We propose two types of g-priors for the regression coefficients that enable tractable computation and show that both lead to consistent model selection. We also introduce a hierarchical prior on the model space that accounts for multiplicity and penalises model complexity. To efficiently explore the GH model space, we extend the Add-Delete-Swap algorithm to jointly sample variable inclusion indicators and hazard structures. Simulation studies show accurate recovery of both the true hazard structure and active variables across different sample sizes and censoring levels. Two real-data applications are presented to illustrate the use of the proposed methodology and to compare it with existing variable selection methods."

Understanding the physical mechanisms governing the recovery of plasma accelerating properties over time is essential for successfully achieving high-repetition-rate plasma acceleration, a key requirement for applicability in both research and commercial settings. In this paper, we present numerical simulations of the early-stage plasma evolution based on the parameters of the SPARC_LAB hydrogen plasma recovery time experiment (Pompili et al., Comm. Phys. 7, 241 (2024)), employing spatially resolved Particle-in-Cell and fluid models. The experiment reports on a non-monotonic dependence of the plasma recovery time on the initial plasma density, an effect for which ion motion has been invoked as a contributing factor. The simulations presented here provide further insight into the role of ion dynamics in shaping this behavior. Furthermore, comparing Particle-in-Cell and fluid approaches allows us to assess the quality of fluid models for describing this class of plasma dynamics."

    "abstract": "The establishment of the UK National Health Service (NHS) in July 1948 was one of the most consequential health policy interventions of the twentieth century, providing universal and free access to medical care and substantially expanding maternal and infant health services. In this paper, we estimate the causal effect of the NHS introduction on early-life mortality and we test whether survival is selective. We adopt a regression discontinuity design under local randomization, comparing individuals born just before and just after July 1948. Leveraging newly digitized weekly death records, we document a significant decline in stillbirths and infant mortality following the introduction of the NHS, the latter driven primarily by reductions in deaths from congenital conditions and diarrhea. We then use polygenic indexes (PGIs), fixed at conception, to track changes in population composition, showing that cohorts born at or after the NHS introduction exhibit higher PGIs associated with contextually-adverse traits (e.g., depression, COPD, and preterm birth) and lower PGIs associated with contextually-valued traits (e.g., educational attainment, self-rated health, and pregnancy length), with effect sizes as large as 7.5% of a standard deviation. These results based on the UK Biobank data are robust to family-based designs and replicate in the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing and the UK Household Longitudinal Study. Effects are strongest in socioeconomically disadvantaged areas and among males. This novel evidence on the existence and magnitude of selective survival highlights how large-scale public policies can leave a persistent imprint on population composition and generate long-term survival biases."

    "abstract": "Materials such as magnetic shape-memory alloys possess an intrinsic coupling between material's magnetisation and mechanical deformation. These materials also undergo structural phase transitions, with phase boundaries separating different phases and the kinetics of the phase boundaries governed by the magnetic field and the mechanical stresses. There is a multiplicity of other materials revealing similar phenomena, e.g. magnetic perovskites. To model the propagation of the phase boundaries in deformable magnetic materials at the continuum scale, three ingredients are required: a set of governing equations for the bulk behaviour with coupled magnetic and mechanical degrees of freedom, a dependency of the phase boundary velocity on the governing factors, and a reliable computational method. The expression for the phase boundary velocity is usually obtained within the continuum thermodynamics setting, where the entropy production due to phase boundary propagation is derived, which gives a thermodynamic driving force for the phase boundary kinetics. For deformable ferromagnets, all three elements (bulk behaviour, interface kinetics, and computational approaches) have been explored, but under a number of limitations. The present paper focuses on the derivation of the thermodynamic driving force for transformation fronts in a general magneto-mechanical setting, adapts the cut-finite-element method for transformation fronts in magneto-mechanics, which allows for an exceptionally efficient handling of the propagating interfaces, without modifying the finite-element mesh, and applies the developments to qualitative modelling of magneto-mechanics of magnetic shape-memory alloys."

We focus on the high-latitude mode with azimuthal wavenumber $m=1$ and the equatorial Rossby modes with $3 \\le m \\le 16$. We use maps of horizontal flows near the solar surface from the GONG and HMI ring-diagram pipelines at a cadence of approximately one day, covering the period 2002--2024. The data are divided into overlapping four-year windows, with central times separated by six months. Within each time window and for each inertial mode, we measure the frequency and the power of the mode from the GONG and HMI data. We find good agreement between the GONG and HMI measurements throughout their overlapping period from 2010 to 2024. In general, the magnitude of the frequency variations increases with increasing $m$, while relative changes in mode power typically exceed 100\\%. For the $m=1$ high-latitude mode, the measured power is anti-correlated with the sunspot number, while its frequency shows no significant temporal variation. For the equatorial Rossby modes, the frequencies are generally anti-correlated with the sunspot number, whereas the mode powers tend to correlate positively with the sunspot number. An exception is the $m=3$ equatorial Rossby mode, whose mode power is strongly anti-correlated with the sunspot number, in contrast to the other equatorial Rossby modes, highlighting its distinct behavior. We find that the frequencies and power of the Sun's inertial modes exhibit significant variability on solar-cycle timescales over the past 23 years. The mode parameters are however not uniformly synchronized with the sunspot number; clear differences are observed both from mode to mode and from one solar cycle to the next. The sensitivity of inertial modes to solar-cycle changes indicates their potential as a diagnostic of solar interior dynamics and magnetism."

There are numerous manifestations of tides, including planetary orbital migration, breaking resonant chains, tidal heating, orbital circularization, spin-orbit alignment, and stellar and planetary spin synchronization. In the present study, we focus on the dissipation of internal gravity waves within stars. We examine two mechanisms: wave breaking in stars with radiative cores and magnetic wave conversion in stars with convective cores. Applying tidal prescriptions modelling these processes, we demonstrate that the enhanced stellar rotation of both TOI-2458 and GJ 504 can be explained by the previous engulfment of a hot Jupiter caused by gravity wave damping. Furthermore, we show that the observed population of hot Jupiters can be divided into two distinct subsamples: those that are too young for gravity wave dissipation and those where it is ongoing. These subsamples exhibit qualitatively different orbital period distributions: young systems have a uniform distribution, while older systems show a steep decline at short orbital periods. Using a population synthesis approach, we successfully reproduce the main features of the older hot Jupiter sample based on the distribution of the younger systems. According to our estimates, up to 20% of the main-sequence stars within the mass range [0.7,1.5] $M_{\\odot}$ that once hosted a hot Jupiter may have since engulfed it. Our results highlight the key role of internal gravity wave dissipation in shaping the orbital architectures of hot Jupiter systems."

For an open set $\\mathcal O$, a set $Z$ is a domain of determination when the values of solutions of the differential equation $Pu=0$ are determined on $Z$ by their values in $\\mathcal O$. Fritz John's global Hölmgren theorem implies that points that can be reached by deformations of noncharacteristic hypersufaces with initial surface and boundaries in $\\mathcal O$ belong to a domain of determination provided that local uniqueness holds at noncharacteristic surfaces. Using spacelike hypersurfaces yields sharp finite speed results whose domains of determination are described in terms of influence curves that never exceed the local speed of propagation. This paper studies deformations of noncharacteristic nonspacelike hypersurfaces. We prove that points reachable by (repeated) deformations by noncharacteristic nonspacelike hypersurfaces coincide exactly with the set of points reachable by (repeated) homotopies of timelike arcs whose initial curves and endpoints belong to $\\mathcal O$. When the set $\\mathcal O$ is a small neighborhood of a forward timelike arc connecting $a$ to $b$, a natural candidate for $Z$ is the intesection of the future of $a$ with the past of $b$. This candidate is exact for D'Alembert's equation. We prove that it is also exact when $a,b$ are points close together on a fixed timelike arc. The timelike homotopy criterion fuels the construction of surprising examples for which the domain of determination is strictly larger (resp. strictly smaller) than the future-intersect-past candidate."

While magnon-magnon interactions are known to critically shape the two-magnon line in spontaneous Raman scattering spectra, their role in coherent time-domain excitations remains unexplored. We report a detailed experimental and theoretical study of the influence of magnon-magnon interactions on coherent two-magnon modes in a cubic antiferromagnet excited via Impulsive Stimulated Raman scattering. We reveal the nontrivial evolution of coherent magnetic dynamics in the time domain and the corresponding spectrum and compare it with the spontaneous Raman scattering spectrum. By extending the spin-correlations based theory for two-magnon modes, we derive a unified description of their spectra in Raman Scattering and Impulsive Stimulated Raman Scattering and highlight the role of magnon-magnon interactions."

    "abstract": "While existing multi-agent systems (MAS) can handle complex problems by enabling collaboration among multiple agents, they are often highly task-specific, relying on manually crafted agent roles and interaction prompts, which leads to increased architectural complexity and limited reusability across tasks. Moreover, most MAS communicate primarily through natural language, making them vulnerable to error accumulation and instability in long-context, multi-stage interactions within internal agent histories. In this work, we propose \\textbf{Agent Primitives}, a set of reusable latent building blocks for LLM-based MAS. Inspired by neural network design, where complex models are built from reusable components, we observe that many existing MAS architectures can be decomposed into a small number of recurring internal computation patterns. Based on this observation, we instantiate three primitives: Review, Voting and Selection, and Planning and Execution. All primitives communicate internally via key-value (KV) cache, which improves both robustness and efficiency by mitigating information degradation across multi-stage interactions. To enable automatic system construction, an Organizer agent selects and composes primitives for each query, guided by a lightweight knowledge pool of previously successful configurations, forming a primitive-based MAS. Experiments show that primitives-based MAS improve average accuracy by 12.0-16.5\\% over single-agent baselines, reduce token usage and inference latency by approximately 3$\\times$-4$\\times$ compared to text-based MAS, while incurring only 1.3$\\times$-1.6$\\times$ overhead relative to single-agent inference and providing more stable performance across model backbones."

We provide an improved analysis of this algorithm, which preserves the accelerated convergence rate under much milder conditions on the perturbations. We show that our new analysis is worst-case optimal, in the sense that the convergence rate cannot be improved, and that the noise conditions we derive cannot be relaxed without sacrificing convergence guarantees. We demonstrate the practical relevance of our results by deriving an accelerated algorithm for decentralized PCA, which has similar communication costs to non-accelerated methods. To our knowledge, this is the first decentralized algorithm for PCA with provably accelerated convergence."

In particular, we model coordinated behavior as a spectrum: at one extreme, agents jointly optimize a common team objective, and at the other, agents make unilaterally optimal decisions given their individual decision variables, i.e., they operate at Nash equilibria. We then demonstrate that reasoning about coordination in differentiable motion-planning problems reduces to reasoning about the second-order properties of agents' objectives, and we provide algorithms that use this second-order reasoning to determine at which times a team of agents should coordinate."

In this context, the statistical characterization of interstellar observations is of prime importance. We open a new perspective on diffuse interstellar matter by analyzing James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations of the Pleiades nebula with NIRCam. These observations are remarkable in that they provide a microscope view at the cold neutral medium (CNM) with a spatial resolution of 0.2 mpc (40 au). A two-dimensional Fourier analysis is used to characterize the structure of PAH emission in regions near and far from the Pleiades star Merope. To produce maps of the interstellar emission, stars and galaxies are filtered out. The final step in the data cleaning involves subtracting a component, in Fourier space, which we infer to be a residual of the near-infrared cosmic background. The PAH emission power spectra are highly anisotropic. They are well fitted with a break-free power-law, suggesting that we do not observe a specific scale for energy dissipation. Power-law indices are -3.5 near Merope and -3 in the more distant field. The magnetic field orientation, as derived from the Planck dust polarization data, aligns with the PAH anisotropy. The power anisotropy is constant across scales. These findings are discussed in relation to interstellar turbulence that may be driven by the Pleiades stars. The JWST observations of the Pleiades offer a new viewpoint for comparing observations and theoretical models, as they examine physical scales at which turbulence in the CNM is subsonic and decoupled from the thermal instability. The observations may indicate that the turbulent energy cascade in the CNM is anisotropic."

Given their importance in applications, it is important to extend EP to nonconservative systems, $\\textit{i.e.}$ systems with non-reciprocal interactions. Previous attempts to generalize EP to such systems failed to compute the exact gradient of the cost function. Here we propose a framework that extends EP to arbitrary nonconservative systems, including feedforward networks. We keep the key property of equilibrium propagation, namely the use of stationary states both for inference and learning. However, we modify the dynamics in the learning phase by a term proportional to the non-reciprocal part of the interaction so as to obtain the exact gradient of the cost function. This algorithm can also be derived using a variational formulation that generates the learning dynamics through an energy function defined over an augmented state space. Numerical experiments using the MNIST database show that this algorithm achieves better performance and learns faster than previous proposals."

Here, using high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy combined with theoretical calculations, we systematically investigate the electronic properties of trilayer nickelates. In La4Ni3O10, we observe pronounced interorbital hybridization, whereas in Pr4Ni3O10, the flat d_(z^2 ) band becomes markedly incoherent and diminishes in spectral weight. By contrast, the dispersive d_(x^2-y^2 ) bands retain coherence in both compounds. This striking incoherence/coherence dichotomy identifies an orbital-selective Mott phase modulated by the interlayer Ni-O-Ni bonding angle. The depletion of the d_(z^2 ) orbitals further frustrates the interorbital hybridization and influences the density-wave transition in Pr4Ni3O10. Moreover, the density-wave gap is substantially reduced in Pr4Ni3O10, likely due to extra scattering channels provided by the local moments of Pr3+ cations. Our findings elucidate the intricate interplay among lattice, orbital, spin, and electronic degrees of freedom and reveal a feasible structural control parameter for the multi-orbital correlated state in trilayer nickelates, which provide a concrete framework for understanding the emergence of superconductivity under high pressure."

However, with the guided prompt, the models uncovered at least 67% of the smells. For secure code generation, we prompted LLMs with 89 vulnerable synthetic scenarios and observed that only 7% of the generated scripts were secure. Adding an explicit instruction to generate secure code increased GPT secure output rate to 17%, while Gemini changed little (8%). These results highlight the need for further research to improve LLMs' capabilities in assisting developers with secure IaC development."

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in code generation and general reasoning, yet their capacity for autonomous multi-stage planning in high-dimensional, physically constrained environments remains an open research question. This study investigates the limits of current AI agents by evaluating them against the 12th Global Trajectory Optimization Competition (GTOC 12), a complex astrodynamics challenge requiring the design of a large-scale asteroid mining campaign. We adapt the MLE-Bench framework to the domain of orbital mechanics and deploy an AIDE-based agent architecture to autonomously generate and refine mission solutions. To assess performance beyond binary validity, we employ an \"LLM-as-a-Judge\" methodology, utilizing a rubric developed by domain experts to evaluate strategic viability across five structural categories. A comparative analysis of models, ranging from GPT-4-Turbo to reasoning-enhanced architectures like Gemini 2.5 Pro, and o3, reveals a significant trend: the average strategic viability score has nearly doubled in the last two years (rising from 9.3 to 17.2 out of 26). However, we identify a critical capability gap between strategy and execution. While advanced models demonstrate sophisticated conceptual understanding, correctly framing objective functions and mission architectures, they consistently fail at implementation due to physical unit inconsistencies, boundary condition errors, and inefficient debugging loops. We conclude that, while current LLMs often demonstrate sufficient knowledge and intelligence to tackle space science tasks, they remain limited by an implementation barrier, functioning as powerful domain facilitators rather than fully autonomous engineers."

We introduce the multi-decoder method to predict speech reception thresholds (SRTs) from EEG recordings, enabling objective assessment for populations unable to perform behavioral tests; such as those with disorders of consciousness or during hearing aid fitting. Approach: The method aggregates data from hundreds of decoders, each trained on different speech features and EEG preprocessing setups to quantify neural tracking (NT) of speech signals. Using data from 39 participants (ages 18-24), we recorded 29 minutes of EEG per person while they listened to speech at six signal-to-noise ratios and a quiet story. NT values were combined into a high-dimensional feature vector per subject, and a support vector regression model was trained to predict SRTs from these vectors. Main Result: Predictions correlated significantly with behavioral SRTs (r = 0.647, p < 0.001; NRMSE = 0.19), with all differences under 1 dB. SHAP analysis showed theta/delta bands and early lags had slightly greater influence. Using pretrained subject-independent decoders reduced required EEG data collection to 15 minutes (3 minutes of story, 12 minutes across six SNR conditions) without losing accuracy."

On the modeling side, we extend a mass-spring model to more accurately capture object dynamics while remaining lightweight enough for high-throughput rollouts during self-supervised learning. On the learning side, we train a neural controller using a task-oriented cost, enabling end-to-end optimization through interaction with the differentiable object model. In addition, we propose a self-supervised DAgger variant that detects distribution shift during deployment and performs offline self-correction to further enhance robustness without expert supervision. We evaluate our method primarily on the rope stabilization task, where a robot must bring a swinging rope to rest as quickly and smoothly as possible. Extensive experiments in both simulation and the real world demonstrate that the proposed controller achieves fast and smooth rope stabilization, generalizing across unseen initial states, rope lengths, masses, non-uniform mass distributions, and external disturbances. Additionally, we develop an affordable markerless rope perception method and demonstrate that our controller maintains performance with noisy and low-frequency state updates. Furthermore, we demonstrate the generality of the framework by extending it to the rope trajectory tracking task. Overall, SPiD offers a data-efficient, robust, and physically grounded framework for dynamic manipulation of deformable linear objects, featuring strong sim-to-real generalization."

    "abstract": "Thermal radiation transport is a challenging problem in computational physics that has long been approached primarily in one of a few standard ways: approximate moment methods (for instance P$_1$ or M$_1$), implicit Monte Carlo, discrete ordinates, and long characteristics. In this work we consider the efficacy of the Method of (Long) Characteristics (MOC) applied to thermal radiation transport. Along the way we develop three major ideas: transporting MOC particles backwards in time from quadrature grids at the end of the timestep, limiting the computational cost of these backward characteristics by terminating transport once optical depths along rays become sufficiently large, and timestep-dependent closures with multigroup MOC solutions for a gray low-order system. We apply this method to a suite of standard radiation transport and radiation hydrodynamics test problems. We compare the method to several standard analytic and semi-analytic solutions, as well as implicit Monte Carlo, P$_1$, and discrete ordinates (S$_n$). We see that the method: gives excellent agreement with known results, has stability for large time steps, has the diffusion limit for large spatial cells, and achieves $\\sim$20-70\\% performance improvement when terminating optical depths at O(10-100) in the grey Marshak and crooked pipe problems. However, for the Coax radiation-hydrodynamics problem, we see that MOC is approximately two to three times slower than IMC-DDMC and S$_n$ in its current implementation."

As a result, model compression has become essential, and -- among compression techniques -- weight quantization is largely used and particularly effective, yet it typically introduces a non-negligible accuracy drop. However, it is usually applied to already trained models, without influencing how the parameter space is explored during the learning phase. In contrast, we introduce per-layer regularization terms that drive weights to naturally form clusters during training, integrating quantization awareness directly into the optimization process. This reduces the accuracy loss typically associated with quantization methods while preserving their compression potential. Furthermore, in our framework quantization representatives become network parameters, marking, to the best of our knowledge, the first approach to embed quantization parameters directly into the backpropagation procedure. Experiments on CIFAR-10 with AlexNet and VGG16 models confirm the effectiveness of the proposed strategy."

LLM-based search, or generative engines, provides direct product recommendations to users, rather than traditional online search results that require users to explore options themselves. However, these recommendations are strongly influenced by the initial retrieval order of LLMs, which disadvantages small businesses and independent creators by limiting their visibility. In this work, we propose CORE, an optimization method that \\textbf{C}ontrols \\textbf{O}utput \\textbf{R}ankings in g\\textbf{E}nerative Engines for LLM-based search. Since the LLM's interactions with the search engine are black-box, CORE targets the content returned by search engines as the primary means of influencing output rankings. Specifically, CORE optimizes retrieved content by appending strategically designed optimization content to steer the ranking of outputs. We introduce three types of optimization content: string-based, reasoning-based, and review-based, demonstrating their effectiveness in shaping output rankings. To evaluate CORE in realistic settings, we introduce ProductBench, a large-scale benchmark with 15 product categories and 200 products per category, where each product is associated with its top-10 recommendations collected from Amazon's search interface. Extensive experiments on four LLMs with search capabilities (GPT-4o, Gemini-2.5, Claude-4, and Grok-3) demonstrate that CORE achieves an average Promotion Success Rate of \\textbf{91.4\\% @Top-5}, \\textbf{86.6\\% @Top-3}, and \\textbf{80.3\\% @Top-1}, across 15 product categories, outperforming existing ranking manipulation methods while preserving the fluency of optimized content."

We say it is a Lee-Yang tensor with radius $r$ if the polynomial is nonzero whenever all variables lie in the open disk of radius $r$. In this work we study quantum states and observables which are Lee-Yang tensors when expressed in the computational basis. We first review their basic properties, including closure under tensor contraction and certain quantum operations. We show that quantum states with Lee-Yang radius $r > 1$ can be prepared by quasipolynomial-sized circuits. We also show that every Hermitian operator with Lee-Yang radius $r > 1$ has a unique principal eigenvector. These results suggest that $r = 1$ is a key threshold for quantum states and observables. Finally, we consider a family of two-local Hamiltonians where every interaction term energetically favors a deformed EPR state $|00\\rangle + s|11\\rangle$ for some $0 \\leq s \\leq 1$. We numerically investigate this model and find that on all graphs considered the Lee-Yang radius of the ground state is at least $r = 1/\\sqrt{s}$ while the spectral gap between the two smallest eigenvalues is at least $1-s^2$. We conjecture that these lower bounds hold more generally; in particular, this would provide an efficient quantum adiabatic algorithm for the quantum Max-Cut problem on uniformly weighted bipartite graphs."

    "abstract": "Since the recent Covid-19 pandemic, mobile manipulators and humanoid assistive robots with higher levels of autonomy have increasingly been adopted for patient care and living assistance. Despite advancements in autonomy, these robots often struggle to perform reliably in dynamic and unstructured environments and require human intervention to recover from failures. Effective human-robot collaboration is essential to enable robots to receive assistance from the most competent operator, in order to reduce their workload and minimize disruptions in task execution. In this paper, we propose an adaptive method for allocating robotic failures to human operators (ARFA). Our proposed approach models the capabilities of human operators, and continuously updates these beliefs based on their actual performance for failure recovery. For every failure to be resolved, a reward function calculates expected outcomes based on operator capabilities and historical data, task urgency, and current workload distribution. The failure is then assigned to the operator with the highest expected reward. Our simulations and user studies show that ARFA outperforms random allocation, significantly reducing robot idle time, improving overall system performance, and leading to a more distributed workload among operators."

    "abstract": "Modern AI agents such as large language models are trained on diverse tasks -- translation, code generation, mathematical reasoning, and text prediction -- simultaneously. A key question is to quantify how each individual training task influences performance on a target task, a problem we refer to as task attribution. The direct approach, leave-one-out retraining, measures the effect of removing each task, but is computationally infeasible at scale. An alternative approach that builds surrogate models to predict a target task's performance for any subset of training tasks has emerged in recent literature. Prior work focuses on linear surrogate models, which capture first-order relationships, but miss nonlinear interactions such as synergy, antagonism, or XOR-type effects. In this paper, we first consider a unified task weighting framework for analyzing task attribution methods, and show a new connection between linear surrogate models and influence functions through a second-order analysis. Then, we introduce kernel surrogate models, which more effectively represent second-order task interactions. To efficiently learn the kernel surrogate, we develop a gradient-based estimation procedure that leverages a first-order approximation of pretrained models; empirically, this yields accurate estimates with less than $2\\%$ relative error without repeated retraining. Experiments across multiple domains -- including math reasoning in transformers, in-context learning, and multi-objective reinforcement learning -- demonstrate the effectiveness of kernel surrogate models. They achieve a $25\\%$ higher correlation with the leave-one-out ground truth than linear surrogates and influence-function baselines. When used for downstream task selection, kernel surrogate models yield a $40\\%$ improvement in demonstration selection for in-context learning and multi-objective reinforcement learning benchmarks."

Although recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved automatic code summarization, the practical usefulness of generated summaries in industrial settings remains insufficiently explored. In collaboration with documentation experts from the industrial HarmonyOS project, we conducted a questionnaire study showing that over 57.4% of code summaries produced by state-of-the-art approaches were rejected due to violations of developers' expectations for industrial documentation. Beyond semantic similarity to reference summaries, developers emphasize additional requirements, including the use of appropriate domain terminology, explicit function categorization, and the avoidance of redundant implementation details. To address these expectations, we propose ExpSum, an expectation-aware code summarization approach that integrates function metadata abstraction, informative metadata filtering, context-aware domain knowledge retrieval, and constraint-driven prompting to guide LLMs in generating structured, expectation-aligned summaries. We evaluate ExpSum on the HarmonyOS project and widely used code summarization benchmarks. Experimental results show that ExpSum consistently outperforms all baselines, achieving improvements of up to 26.71% in BLEU-4 and 20.10% in ROUGE-L on HarmonyOS. Furthermore, LLM-based evaluations indicate that ExpSum-generated summaries better align with developer expectations across other projects, demonstrating its effectiveness for industrial code documentation."

To this end, we propose off-policy log-dispersion regularization (LDR), a novel regularization framework that builds on a generalization of the log-variance objective. We apply LDR in the off-policy setting in combination with standard data-based training objectives, without requiring additional on-policy samples. LDR acts as a shape regularizer of the energy landscape by leveraging additional information in the form of target energy labels. The proposed regularization framework is broadly applicable, supporting unbiased or biased simulation datasets as well as purely variational training without access to target samples. Across all benchmarks, LDR improves both final performance and data efficiency, with sample efficiency gains of up to one order of magnitude."

We propose MIRROR, a fine-tuning-free, end-to-end multi-agent framework that directly translates natural language optimization problems into mathematical models and solver code. MIRROR integrates two core mechanisms: (1) execution-driven iterative adaptive revision for automatic error correction, and (2) hierarchical retrieval to fetch relevant modeling and coding exemplars from a carefully curated exemplar library. Experiments show that MIRROR outperforms existing methods on standard OR benchmarks, with notable results on complex industrial datasets such as IndustryOR and Mamo-ComplexLP. By combining precise external knowledge infusion with systematic error correction, MIRROR provides non-expert users with an efficient and reliable OR modeling solution, overcoming the fundamental limitations of general-purpose LLMs in expert optimization tasks."

We extract the pole position, scattering length, effective range, and the pseudoscalar pion-nucleon coupling constant $g_{πN}^2/(4π)$ at different expansion orders. The low-energy parameters are stable and consistent with established values, while $g_{πN}^2/(4π)$ exhibits larger uncertainties. The extraction of $g_{πN}^2/(4π)$ is data-driven, relying on the analytic constraints from the left-hand cut and phase-shift data within the one-pion-exchange approximation.

    "abstract": "Needle-based interventions are routine in clinical practice, yet clinicians lack reliable, precise, real-time estimates of the tip-to-target distance—–a key determinant of safety and efficiency. To bridge this critical clinical gap, physics-based models that maps electrical bio-impedance (EBI) measurements to the absolute tip-to-target distance by leveraging tissue-intrinsic electrical properties encoded in EBI are presented in this work. A tripolar electrode configuration is adopted to ensure tool-independence and broad compatibility across instruments and anatomical sites. The optimal layout of electrode radius, inter-electrode spacing, and placement was identified through a systematic parametric study. The model was validated across finite-element simulations, saline solution experiments, and <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">ex vivo</i> layered tissue. In all settings, proximity distance estimates were accurate and robust across different insertion angles. In simulation, it achieved 0.55 mm RMSE/1.06 mm MAE when the target layer was less conductive than the first layer and 0.40 mm RMSE/1.21 mm MAE when it was more conductive. In saline, four insertion angles yielded millimeter errors with no angle dependence. In <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">ex vivo</i> layered tissue, accuracy remained near the millimeter level across angles (RMSE 1.00–1.13 mm and MAE 1.30–1.58 mm), which is slightly lower than saline yet consistent across orientations. Together, these results establish a general, instrument-agnostic framework for absolute proximity distance sensing during needle interventions with the potential to enhance safety and efficiency in minimally invasive procedures. Furthermore, by first focusing on a two-layer model, this work provides a clear pathway to multi-layer tissue modeling and broader anatomical generalization."

    "abstract": "Data-driven methods enable online assessment of error states in magnetic-array-type current sensors, and long-term measurement stability can be enhanced through further self-error correction. However, when the magnetic-array-type current sensors are applied to multi-conductor systems such as multi-core cables, the time-varying correlations among conductor currents may degrade the performance of multi-latent-variable data-driven models for error evaluation. To address this issue, this paper proposes a robust self-error correcting method for magnetic-array-type current sensors even under significant variations in phase current correlations (e.g., large fluctuations in three-phase current imbalance). By incorporating phase current decoupling and principal component analysis (PCA), the correlation analysis of multi-latent variables (i.e., multi-conductor currents) is transformed into a single-latent-variable (corresponding to single phase current) modeling problem. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively detects error drifts of magnetic field sensors as low as 2×10<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">−3</sup> in relative error and 2×10<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">−3</sup> rad in phase error. Accurate evaluation and correction of each magnetic field sensor’s error drifts substantially eliminates the overall error drift in the magnetic-array-type current sensor, validating the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed self-error correcting method."

    "abstract": "The rise of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft is accelerating the growth of the low-altitude economy (LAE), enabling mobility beyond conventional ground-based transport. However, aerial vehicles or flying vehicles (FVs) in LAE environments face significant communication challenges due to high mobility, frequent handovers between base stations (BSs), and the susceptibility of mmWave bands to blockage and path loss. Reactive handover mechanisms—triggered only after link degradation—often lead to disconnections and degraded service quality, particularly in dense urban areas. Moreover, uneven FV distribution can cause BS load imbalances, further compromising quality of service (QoS). To address these challenges, we propose a proactive BS association framework for intelligent handover management using artificial general intelligence (AGI). Our approach leverages deep learning to jointly predict future received signal strength indicator (RSSI) and BS load, enabling an autonomous decision algorithm to select optimal BSs for stable, high-throughput connectivity while minimizing unnecessary handovers. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed joint prediction-based strategy significantly reduces handover frequency and improves average throughput compared to reactive, single-metric base-lines and two additional benchmark predictors introduced for extended evaluation. These findings underscore the potential of predictive, AGI-driven mobility management to enhance the stability and performance of communication networks in the emerging LAE ecosystem."

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) is a secure approach to protecting client data privacy by remaining data local. However, semi-honest central servers expose clients to the risk of membership inference attacks (MIA). Differential privacy is often used to defend against MIA in FL, but the differential privacy-based federated learning (DP-FL) still faces the risk of privacy leakage for bit scenarios. This paper designs a novel neuron membership inference attack (NMIA) strategy under semi-honest central servers and bit scenarios, which can compromise DP-FL and obtain client privacy information. Specifically, NMIA generates an inference attack model with low computational overhead by training only in small-scale neurons. The attack model analyzes the gradient outputs of the FL clients and effectively infers information about specific client data. Sufficient conditions for the success of the NMIA have been theoretically proven. To comprehensively evaluate the performance of the NMIA strategy in bit scenarios, two differential privacy protection methods for randomized response encoding applicable to federated learning for bit scenarios (BDP-FL) are proposed. Experimental results show that NMIA can easily defeat traditional DP-FL, achieving an attack accuracy of over 99%, while NMIA’s attack accuracy in bit scenarios is about 20% higher than the existing attack strategies. In addition, NMIA can still defeat the optimized encoding BDP-FL with an attack accuracy of up to 90%, while the symmetric encoding BDP-FL can only mitigate NMIA at the cost of severe FL utility loss."

The designed amplifying metasurface is then fabricated as a prototype and experimentally measured. The experimental measurements demonstrate good agreement with the simulated results.

    "abstract": "Internal combustion engines have long been the backbone of mechanical motion in automotive and industrial systems. However, increasing focus on sustainable alternatives and the need to reduce carbon emissions has driven innovation in electromagnetically driven systems. This paper presents a simulation-based design of a V8 solenoid engine — a system that replaces conventional fuel-based combustion with electromagnetic linear actuators (solenoids) to mimic piston-like motion. Unlike traditional electric motors, solenoids offer high instantaneous torque and direct electromagnetic force application, making them suitable for high-load, low-speed applications such as educational EV prototypes or automation systems. The primary aim of this research is to explore the feasibility, energy efficiency, and mechanical performance of such a system through simulation tools. We use Proteus to simulate solenoid activation via control circuitry and Fusion 360 to model the mechanical components, including the pistons and crankshaft. By integrating circuit-level control with realistic mechanical modeling, this project bridges the gap between electronics and mechanical motion, serving as a proof-of-concept for solenoid-based engine alternatives in future electromechanical systems."

In this work, a compact two-port CP-DRA is modelled and refined in ANSYS HFSS for operation near 28 GHz to support 5G MIMO deployments. Circular polarization is accomplished through geometric shaping of the resonator and an offset ground aperture that excites orthogonal modes with approximately 90° phase separation. The realized design provides excellent impedance matching at 27.36 GHz(|S<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">11</inf> | ≈ - 38 dB), an axial ratio under 3 dB, and inter-port isolation close to -30dB. The antenna features a broadside gain of 5.5 dBi while exhibiting greater than 95 % radiation efficiency. The associated diversity analysis revealed an ECC of <0.02, diversity gain of ~ 10 dB, and CCL of <0.1 bits/s/Hz. The innovation lies in the compact dual-feed architecture that maintains high isolation and stable circular polarization without additional decoupling networks. The findings corroborate that the suggested Circularly Polarized Dielectric Resonator Antenna (CP-DRA) presents an efficient and dependable platform for 28 GHz 5 G MIMO systems."

This choice yields strong perceptual obfuscation at low computational cost while keeping the encoder unmodified. By designing the scrambling in a precinct-wise manner aligned with the JPEG XS packetization, the impact on rate-distortion (RD) performance is minimized, preserving compression efficiency. On 8K content under Main444.12, the method provides visually effective obfuscation with negligible bit-rate overhead for within-precinct line permutations and small overhead for cross-precinct reordering."

The objective is to maximize the overall EE subject to constraints on the monostatic transmitter power budget, the minimum communication data rate, and the maximum allowable sensing Cramér-Rao bound (CRB). The resulting optimization problem is non-convex and challenging due to the fractional objective function and the unit-modulus constraints of the RIS coefficients. To overcome these challenges, we propose an efficient solution framework that combines Dinkelbach's method with error reformulation techniques to transform the problem into a more tractable form. We then apply the successive convex approximation approach within each iteration to handle the non-convex components, yielding a computationally efficient solution. Simulation results confirm the convergence and effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.

To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes a unified two-stage data preprocessing strategy that integrates anomaly detection and isolation with data reconstruction. In the first stage, a parallel Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)Residual Network (ResNet) architecture is employed for fault detection and isolation to identify and separate abnormal data. In the second stage, an improved masked autoencoder model is applied to reconstruct the data at the detected anomaly positions, thereby leveraging the complementary strengths of fault detection and data reconstruction across different anomaly magnitudes.

This paper presents an empirical investigation of a passenger weight detection system that uses air suspension and tire pressure sensors on an 18.75-meter articulated battery overhead bus. The focus is on measurements conducted at bus stops during typical operational cycles. Through static tests conducted in a workshop and on-route at-stop tests that simulated passenger events (20 kg to 80 kg), the performance of the system was evaluated under various conditions, including kneeling and vehicle pre-loading. The results demonstrate that the approach maintains a high level of accuracy for non-kneeling scenarios even on-route (e.g., 80 kg: MPE -0.24%, StdDev PE 1.02% for front entries). However, kneeling operations caused significant performance degradation, as initial events were obscured and measurement variability increased. While the tire pressure sensor showed a good averaged calibration fit, its single-event accuracy during on-route kneeling tests was limited (StdDev PE 8.32% for 80 kg). Pressure changes induced by passenger weight were notably modified in size by vehicle pre-loading, underscoring the necessity for adaptive calibration. While the research validates the potential of direct, pressure-based measurement systems for determining weight on-route, successfully deploying them in real-world conditions requires integrating advanced signal processing algorithms and self-adapting calibration protocols."

For this purpose, fast multi-tau correlators have been developed in dedicated hardware, in software, and on FPGAs. However, for methods such as X-ray Photon Correlation Spectroscopy (XPCS), which requires to calculate the autocorrelation function independently for hundreds of thousands to millions of pixels from high-resolution detectors, current approaches rely on offline processing after data acquisition. Moreover, the internal pipeline state of so many independent correlators is far too large to keep it on-chip. In this work, we propose a design approach on FPGAs, where pipeline contexts are stored in off-chip HBM memory. Each compute unit iteratively loads the state for a single pixel, processes a short time series for this pixel, and afterwards writes back the context in a dataflow pipeline. We have implemented the required compute kernels with Vitis HLS and analyze resulting designs on an Alveo U280 card. The design achieves the expected performance and for the first time provides sufficient throughput for current high-end detectors used in XPCS."

The training data was reduced using two methods: one that removes samples based on a threshold applied to the envelope amplitude of the PA output signal, and another that employs random sampling. The resulting models were evaluated and compared in terms of Adjacent Channel Power Ratio (ACPR), Error Vector Magnitude (EVM), AM/AM and AM/PM characteristics, demodulated signal constellations, and ARVTDNN training time, in order to identify the most effective reduction method. To compress the training data while minimizing degradation in model performance, it is important to extract samples with a well-balanced amplitude distribution. In particular, when the random sampling method was applied, it was confirmed that a 50% reduction in data resulted in only a 2.6 dB degradation in ACPR, while the training time was reduced by approximately 57.5%. This level of performance degradation remains within the acceptable range defined by the 3GPP standard (TS 38.104), demonstrating that the proposed method satisfies current regulatory requirements."

    "abstract": "Decision making and planning are critical components of Autonomous Driving (AD) systems. The integrated decision making and planning approach captures the coupling between these two modules, offering enhanced interpretability and intelligence. However, in highly dynamic complex driving environments, existing integrated modeling approaches suffer from high time complexity or poor applicability. In this article, we present a soluble and intelligent framework called Integrated Decision Making and Planning (IDMP), which decompose the AD decision making and planning problem into two layers: optimal trajectory selection layer and optimal trajectory tracking layer. The optimal trajectory selection layer leverages historical planning information to predict the ego vehicle’s trajectory and employs a fast decision making strategy based on the predicted trajectory to select the optimal path, which is subsequently tracked to achieve a tightly coupled decision making and planning module. Based on these, we designed a closed-loop structure composed of upper-layer decision guidance and lower layer planning feedback. Finally, we validated the proposed framework through comparative experiments using the CARLA-SUMO simulation. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method has advantages in a series of complex autonomous driving scenarios."

    "abstract": "Pressure ulcers, or bedsores, are a frequent and serious condition in bedridden or immobile patients, especially in hospitals and long-term care facilities. They are caused by sustained pressure, friction, and moisture on the skin, which causes tissue injury and infection if not treated promptly. Although different monitoring systems exist, most of them are expensive, do not provide real-time feedback, or monitor only specific parameters. All of them do not offer an all-around solution that incorporates motion, pressure, and environmental inputs, all of which are necessary in the early detection and prevention of pressure ulcers. In this study a sensor-based detection system for patient movement that uses Force Sensitive Resistors, a temperature and humidity sensor, and a motion sensor, all interfaced to an Arduino microcontroller and an LCD display for real-time monitoring is used. The system is designed to sound alarms in cases of prolonged pressure on body regions, prolonged inactivity in the patient's movements for some period, and when temperature and humidity levels rise beyond comfort zones. All the sensors operate cooperatively to determine quickly any factors that pose risk, with warning offered through buzzers and LEDs. The system effectively identified the high-risk condition and responded by sounding the alarm appropriately. The findings show the system to be capable of monitoring key changes in patient status so that caregivers can react in a timely manner. This project illustrates the potential of low-cost embedded systems to improve patient safety by preventing pressure ulcers through early intervention, thus enabling improved healthcare outcomes in clinical, elderly care, and home settings."

A composite Lyapunov function is devised to set the issue of convergence of tracking errors and estimation errors conclusively. Simulation and experimental verifications establish the controller’s better transient performance, disturbance rejection robustness, and lower energy consumption in comparison with traditional approaches.

As the participation of renewable sources increases and conventional synchronous generators decrease, grid stability may be affected since PV inverters lack inherent inertia. A current control model for the DC-Link is proposed to improve the inertia, integrating a two-stage single-phase inverter with a bidirectional boost converter and a battery bank. This system acts as a synthetic inertia source, using battery charge and discharge to smooth power transitions and enhance grid stability. Based on the Swing Equation of synchronous generators, the strategy implements a virtual inertia response, reducing oscillations and improving system dynamics. Simulations on a 3 kW inverter show improved response time and smoother transitions, indicating this approach is a promising solution to increase renewable energy integration while maintaining grid stability."

Combining time-varying contact stiffness and contact deformation enables the investigation of the motion and force characteristics of faulty bearings. The proposed dynamic model is found to be in agreement with experimentally measured acceleration and strain signals in terms of both acceleration and outer race forces, thus validating its accuracy."

    "abstract": "The advent of millimeter wave (mmWave) frequencies in wireless communication systems has opened new frontiers for high-data-rate applications. However, mmWave signals are highly susceptible to atmospheric impairments, particularly rain attenuation, which significantly degrades system performance. This paper investigates the impact of rain attenuation on the efficiency of wireless communication systems operating in the mmWave band, focusing on frequencies ranging from 30 GHz to 300 GHz. A comprehensive analysis is conducted using empirical rain attenuation models, including the ITU-R P. 838 and P. 837 recommendations, to estimate the specific attenuation under various rainfall intensities. The study evaluates the effects of rain on signal degradation, link budget, and system availability. Simulation results demonstrate that rain attenuation introduces substantial signal loss, which can reduce link reliability and throughput in mmWave systems. Strategies such as adaptive modulation, power control, and site diversity are discussed to mitigate these effects. The findings underscore the critical need for robust design and planning of mmWave wireless links to ensure efficient and reliable communication in rain-prone environments."

Moreover, intelligent emotion prediction enhances adaptability and responsiveness in brain-computer interface systems, thereby improving the efficiency of human-computer interaction. In this paper, we propose an efficient hybrid deep learning model for emotion detection using electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. The framework first performs optimal channel selection, followed by the extraction of band power features from four EEG frequency bands. The resulting feature sets are then used to validate One-Dimension Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN), Long-Short Term Memories (LSTM), and a hybrid 1D CNN-LSTM model using 5-fold cross-validation. Among them, the 1D CNN-LSTM model achieves the best performance with an accuracy of 95.00 %, precision of 95.93 %, recall of 95.07 %, and an F1-score of 95.50 % for arousal classification. Similarly, this model achieves an accuracy of 94.85 %, precision of 95.12 %, recall of 95.02 %, and an F 1 -score of 94.95 % for valence classification.

    "abstract": "Smart Dynamic Wireless Charging Lane for EVs Electric vehicles (EVs) are gaining global momentum; however, long-distance travel remains limited due to insufficient access to fast-charging infrastructure, particularly in highway and remote settings. Additionally, high ambient temperatures in regions like the GCC increase battery drain due to air conditioning loads, further exacerbating range anxiety. This research proposes a smart dynamic wireless charging lane that enables continuous inductive power transfer to EVs during motion, powered by a hybrid renewable system combining solar panels and hydrogen fuel cells. The embedded transmitter coils, designed with a switching frequency of 85–150 kHz, are capable of achieving up to ∼85% power transfer efficiency at standard highway speeds (60 km/h). The system architecture includes a mobile application for real-time energy monitoring and lane interaction, integrated with the vehicle via onboard receivers. The energy management strategy prioritizes solar input where available, with hydrogen storage units serving as backup to ensure reliability in low-radiation conditions. The system is capable of supplying a net SoC gain of 17–21% over a 2 km lane segment at 60 km/h, extending vehicle range by up to ∼120 km in emergency or off-grid environments. Safety measures include insulated coils and authenticated EV access control to ensure user protection and system integrity. This approach minimizes reliance on centralized grid infrastructure by decentralizing energy delivery and enhances EV usability in infrastructure-constrained regions. The proposed system aligns with national sustainability and smart mobility objectives, contributing to reduced emissions and increased renewable energy utilization."

Despite several advantages, grading using IFAT® cards for a final exam of a typical first-year course requires several manual hours. To ease this tedious process, this paper discusses an automated approach for grading exams conducted using scratch card-based IFAT. An algorithm that uses the OpenCV image processing library that can detect scratched, unscratched, and varying degrees of partially scratched boxes with high accuracy has been developed and implemented to create a logical representation of the IFAT® card.

Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) reduces this burden using image-level labels, but existing methods based on Class Activation Maps (CAM) often capture only small discriminative object regions, yielding incomplete pseudo masks. We introduce a CAM-SAM fusion framework that combines the semantic cues of CAM with the strong boundary localization capabilities of the Segment Anything Model (SAM). Specifically, we propose Semantic-Aware Prompting (SAP), where highresponse CAM peaks to guide SAM in generating detailed masks, and a Mask Fusion Algorithm that intelligently integrates CAM and SAM outputs to produce reliable pseudo labels. Evaluations on PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO 2014 show that our method produces sharper and more complete masks, leading to significant improvements in segmentation accuracy over CAM-only baselines. These results highlight the effectiveness of integrating foundation models into WSSS for high-quality segmentation with minimal supervision."

However, most existing methods model data in the time domain, which presents challenges in capturing global periodic anomalies and subtle structural changes, and they are susceptible to local noise. To address these limitations, we propose a novel unsupervised learning framework for anomaly detection named Multivariate time frequency anomaly detection(MTFAD). The core idea of MTFAD is to shift the main analysis process from the traditional time domain to the frequency domain. Specifically, the framework first maps the input sequence to the frequency domain via Fourier Transform and innovatively introduces a Frequency Patching strategy to decompose the spectrum into multiple frequency patches representing different frequency bands. The model's training is jointly supervised by a time-frequency dual-loss function, ensuring consistency in both the waveform and spectral structure of the reconstructed signal. Our experiments on multiple public datasets show that MTFAD can effectively identify diverse anomaly patterns and surpasses current state-of-the-art methods on several key metrics, providing a new perspective for time series anomaly detection by combining time and frequency domains."

The dispersion equation for this structure is derived, and numerical analysis shows that its characteristics closely match those of the original configuration over a wide frequency range, except near the higher cutoff frequency.

In this paper, a multibeam configuration for IRS is proposed, which is established based on 2-bit PIN diode unit cells with high reflectivity. Its reflection phase configurations are optimized by using genetic algorithm. To achieve the multi-beam operation, the IRS is configured by dividing into smaller sub-arrays, and each is independently configured to steer the reflected beam toward the desired direction.

    "abstract": "Turbochargers are widely used in highperformance internal combustion engine systems such as automobiles, aerospace, and marine applications. The floating ring bearing (FRB)-rotor system, as the core component, directly dictates turbocharger performance and durability. Its defining dual-oil-film structure enhances vibration damping on one hand, but simultaneously gives rise to significant nonlinear dynamic challenges, such as oil whirl, subsynchronous vibration, and bifurcation. A lubrication model for the FRB is developed based on the Reynolds equation with JFO cavitation boundary conditions. This model is then integrated with a finite element rotor model to establish a comprehensive nonlinear dynamic model of the turbocharger FRB-rotor system. Based on this, speed-up simulations were conducted for the system under balanced conditions and under different unbalanced conditions, systematically analyzing oil film instability behavior. The research results indicate that unbalanced excitation has a significant regulatory effect on oil whirl shedding, and the system may enter a chaotic state under specific operating conditions. Additionally, through methods such as waterfall plots, Poincare maps, and bifurcation analysis, the evolutionary of the system's nonlinear response was revealed. The findings deepen the insight into the physical mechanisms governing oil film instability in turbochargers, thereby contributing to the theoretical foundation needed for enhanced system design and more accurate vibration fault diagnosis."

We define multi-spectral image fusion as overlaying RGB and thermal imagery, enabling a combined view that leverages both modalities. Through extensive simulations, we verified that the Quadrant Scanline Fill algorithm consistently outperforms others in speed and efficiency, making it the most suitable choice for directing RPAS in search operations."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a conversational smart assistant architecture that integrates a resource-constrained microcontroller frontend with a cloud-based large language model (LLM) backend. The device captures user query audio, compresses it, and streams it in real time to the server over a lightweight custom TCP protocol. On the server, Google Speech-to-Text (STT) transcribes the input, which is then processed by OpenAI's Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) model for natural language understanding. Depending on the query, the model either generates a direct response or issues structured function calls to access real-time information (e.g., breaking news) via public APIs or a headless browser, or to execute taskoriented functions such as reminder scheduling and voice note recording. The final response is synthesized into speech using Google Text-to-Speech (TTS), compressed and streamed back to the device for playback. Experimental results show low latency, efficient bandwidth usage, and cost-effective operation, demonstrating the practicality of the proposed architecture for embedded conversational interfaces and wearable IoT assistants."

    "abstract": "In over-the-air computation-assisted federated learning (OTA-FL), devices transmit their local models to a parameter server over a shared time-frequency resource. Model aggregation occurs automatically due to the superposition property of the wireless channel. We derive a novel upper bound on the convergence of the optimality gap of OTA-FL that applies to any choice of device transmit powers and receiver scaling. The bound is based on less restrictive assumptions compared to the literature. It leads to the insightful concept of an effective learning rate that captures the dependence of the convergence of OTA-FL on the gains of the channels between the devices and the parameter server. We jointly optimize the transmit powers and the receiver scaling to minimize the error floor implied by the bound while controlling the effective learning rate. This leads to a novel controlled descent algorithm (CDA) and a new variant that adapts the effective learning rate. CDA can be implemented using a low overhead protocol. We benchmark CDA against several transmit power, receiver scaling, and device selection schemes. For both linear regression and multi-class logistic regression, CDA requires fewer iterations and a lower sum energy to achieve a target optimality gap or testing accuracy."

    "abstract": "Inversion of three-dimensional Ground-Penetrating Radar (3D GPR) data risks nonlinear electromagnetic wave propagation and the structural diversity of subsurface targets. Existing deep learning methods typically adopt fixed-depth architectures for all inputs, disregarding variations in structural complexity among varying targets. This results in redundant computation in non-target background and limited accuracy for specific types of underground targets. In response, we propose the Category-driven Depth-Scalable Inversion (CDSI) framework that integrates target classification with category-driven inversion. CDSI simultaneously extracts dynamic features (i.e., the wave changing information) via specific reservoir computing and captures spatial features through a convolutional network. A cross-attention mechanism fuses these features to predict the target category. Guided by the predicted category, a depth-scalable inversion network further adjusts its depth to reconstruct permittivity maps. Experimental results on synthetic 3D GPR datasets demonstrate that CDSI consistently outperforms existing methods in both accuracy and computational efficiency."

This study innovatively integrated multi-source remote sensing parameters via Google Earth Engine to systematically compare three feature space models (Albedo-NDVI, Albedo-MSAVI, Albedo-KNDVI) and five machine learning algorithms for AD monitoring, while applying the Optimal Parameter Geographic Detector (OPGD) to quantify natural-anthropogenic driving mechanisms. High-resolution AD classification (5-year intervals, 2000–2020) revealed spatiotemporal dynamics, with machine learning models consistently outperforming feature space models. Random Forest (RF) achieved the highest accuracy (97.7%) and Kappa coefficient (0.967), effectively distinguishing non-desertified areas from extreme desertification. Temporal analysis showed a significant AD reversal: total desertified area declined to 30,166.35 km² by 2020, driven by ecological policies and climate amelioration. OPGD analysis indicated soil texture as the strongest single driver (q > 0.48), but factor interactions (e.g., SD ∩︀ LU) exerted greater explanatory power, highlighting compound effects of natural and anthropogenic factors. This study provides a robust framework for high-precision AD monitoring in semi-arid agro-pastoral zones, supporting global efforts toward zero land degradation."

The machine learning analytical tools utilize the ability to analyze large amounts of data to identify minute trends and predictive indications that historic methods might miss. The focus is on the role of digital marketing channels, such as social media platforms, where AI-based analysis of the sentiment and the engagement will present fine-grained views of consumer-brand interaction. The paper continues to analyze cognitive and emotional aspects of brand perceptions discussing the ways and dynamics of building loyalty. The outcomes demonstrate that brand recognition plays a key role in the purchase process and that conversational analytics supported by AI can streamline the segmentation of the audience, predict the purchase patterns, and channelspecific actions. The findings reaffirm the tactical value of incorporating AI in brand management with the view of promoting specific outreach, enhancing customer retention, and the ability to gain competitive advantage sustainably in a dynamic market.

We propose Opt360, a DASH-compliant optimization framework that generalizes tile assignment into multi-tier priority zones, incorporates prediction accuracy and window length directly into the optimization, and enforces hard constraints on stalls and quality switches. The resulting mixedinteger formulation, coupled with a segment-internal tile scheduler, adapts to diverse viewport models while remaining real-time feasible. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that Opt360 ensures smooth playback, remains resilient to viewport variations, and effectively utilizes bandwidth for improved video quality, even under challenging network conditions."

    "abstract": "Critical workloads are stored in cloud data centers and require a continuous availability of the service; however, these telemetry streams are highly dimensional and complex, and it is difficult to perform timely anomaly detection. Old thresholding and linear statistical models are not always good at modeling non-linear dependencies and dynamic multitenant behavior, resulting in delayed or inaccurate alerts. To counteract these problems, a Convolutional Autoencoder (CAE) model is used to estimate heterogeneous cloud measurements in the form of hierarchical tensors and train compact latent images of normal operations. The CAE is that which makes use of dualpath convolutional encoding to make use of spatial-temporal correlations and probabilistic reconstruction-error modelling of adaptive thresholding. The framework was tested on large-scale datasets of Google Cluster Trace and Alibaba Cloud, scoring 97.4 % precision, 96.1 % recall, 96.7 % F1-score, and 0.985 AUC while maintaining an average inference latency of 180 ms and 2.1GB GPU memory. The results indicate the effectiveness of the method in real-time and scalable detection of anomalies and its possible impact on improving reliability and resilience in cloud data centers."

Their performance directly affects system efficiency, depending on parameters such as gain and input impedance matching with the rectifier circuit, which are essential for maximizing power transfer. The physical configuration of antennas must often be adapted to different environments and installation constraints. In this context, integrating antennas into window structures in buildings or vehicles presents a promising approach, offering a large surface area for energy collection without compromising usable space. To enable this integration while maintaining the optical properties of the window, this work investigates the use of glass as the dielectric substrate and a graphene-based film as the conductive element. Various deposition techniques for applying graphene onto glass substrates are evaluated, with emphasis on measuring electrical conductivity, and scattering parameters. These experimental results support the design of a patch antenna, optimized for operation at 5,8 GHz using CST Studio Suite software. A prototype is fabricated based on the selected graphene film, and its scattering parameters are measured and compared to both simulation results and to those obtained from a reference antenna of identical geometry using copper as the conductive material. This comparative analysis assesses the viability of graphene as a conductor in antenna applications."

In practice, the effective boost inductance deviates from its nominal value due to tolerances, temperature, aging, and operating condition dependence. This degrades the MPCC current prediction and increases input current distortion, especially near the voltage zero crossing point. The proposed controller incorporates an extended Kalman filter (EKF) that estimates the inductance online at every sampling instant and injects it into the MPCC prediction model. A 2 kW FPGA-based TPPFC converter experimental setup is used to evaluate the method for two inductors (2.5/5.0 mH) and two load conditions (1/2 kW). Experimental results demonstrate that EKF-based inductance adaptation improves current prediction and sinusoidal current shaping without compromising power factor (PF) or efficiency. These results indicate that the proposed approach provides a practical solution for accurate MPCC implementation in TPPFC converters."

    "abstract": "Accurate remaining useful life (RUL) prediction of lithium-ion battery packs is essential for ensuring the reliability and safety of energy storage systems. However, the cross-domain transfer health prognosis from single cells to packs faces two major challenges: nonlinear and asynchronous degradation behaviors, and multimodal noises that violate the single-Gaussian assumption commonly used in traditional models. To address these issues, this study proposes an integrated framework for lithium-ion battery packs RUL prediction, synergistically combining an adaptive step-size differential model decomposition based on local curvature (ASDMD), and a Gaussian mixture model-based Unscented Transformation (GMM-UT). ASDMD adaptively regulates differential step sizes by local curvature estimation, ensuring the reduction of noise interference in smooth degradation phases and accurate capture of inflection points in steep degradation phases. GMM is employed to simultaneously model the statistical distributions of measurement noise and differential noise, while the UT realizes probabilistic propagation across domains. Three comparison methods are conducted to verify the accuracy and robustness of the proposed method. Experimental results show that the proposed method significantly improved prognostics performance for battery packs. In the migration prediction from battery cells to battery packs, the root mean square error for RUL prediction is less than 4 %, providing reliable guidance for maintenance scheduling and second-life utilization of battery systems."

A systematic review was carried out using databases such as Scopus, ScienceDirect, ALICIA, CONCYTEC, and Google Scholar, covering publications from 2012 to 2025. Selection criteria included articles and theses focused on technological interventions. The PRISMA technique was used, resulting in a final review of 28 articles selected for the topic. The results indicate that the identified technological interventions include exoskeletons, wearable sensors and devices, and motion capture systems. However, identified limitations included the high cost of devices, poor ergonomic design, and a lack of long-term studies. In conclusion, technological ergonomic interventions represent effective strategies for MSD prevention, although the identified limitations need to be addressed to enhance their effectiveness in occupational settings."

To enhance multicast efficiency and system scalability, we propose a large-scale fading coefficients-based clustering scheme that partitions users and access points (APs) into disjoint clusters, achieving dual benefits: significant precoding complexity reduction and enhanced multicast transmission efficiency. Unlike conventional methods, our approach enforces a critical constraint ensuring the number of cluster transmit antennas exceeds user antennas, thereby guaranteeing sufficient independent spatial streams. Subsequent to cluster formation, we implement fully distributed power allocation, substantially reducing system overhead compared to centralized alternatives. We derive closed-form expressions for the average sum rate (ASR) and ergodic sum rate (ESR) lower bounds under distributed operation, and develop a graph convolutional network (GCN) power allocation algorithm. Simulation results validate the superiority of our approach."

    "abstract": "Arabic abstractive text summarization remains a challenging task due to the language’s morphological richness, syntactic variability, and limited availability of highquality annotated corpora. This paper introduces the Contrastive and Reinforcement-enhanced Summarization System (CSRS), a novel hybrid framework that integrates contrastive semantic pretraining with reinforcement learning optimization to enhance summary fidelity and factual consistency. The model first employs a contrastive alignment module to maximize semantic coherence between the source and target summaries, followed by a reinforcement learning stage that optimizes task-specific rewards based on ROUGE-L, factual consistency, and coherence metrics. Experiments conducted on ArSumNews and Arabic Gigaword datasets demonstrate that CSRS achieves a ROUGE-L score of 43.12, outperforming AraBART and AraT5 by 3.6% and 2.8%, respectively, while improving BERTScore (F1) to 88.4. Furthermore, contrastive pretraining reduces semantic drift by 15% compared with conventional cross-entropy training. These results confirm the effectiveness of integrating semantic representation learning with reward-based optimization, offering a robust, contextually faithful, and human-oriented summarization framework for Arabic. The proposed CSRS sets a new benchmark in Arabic abstractive summarization and provides a foundation for future multimodal and crosslingual extensions."

    "abstract": "This paper investigates range-depth localization of an orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) source using a single hydrophone, which serves as a portable scheme suitable for small underwater platforms. We consider a typical shallow-water propagation model, where the rich position information embedded in multipath delays and amplitudes offers the potential to achieve the above purpose. Specifically, we exploit the frequency-domain input-output relationship of pilot subcarriers to construct a measurement model and incorporate joint processing of multiple OFDM symbols to enhance localization performance. To characterize random fluctuations in path gains caused by scattering from the rough surface and bottom, we introduce the Rician fading model. Under this assumption, each complex path amplitude comprises a deterministic component associated with the source position and a random perturbation. To fully leverage the parametric model, we adopt the stochastic maximum likelihood principle. The resulting high-dimensional optimization problem is iteratively solved by the developed expectation-maximization-type algorithm. In addition, a stable initialization scheme is designed to strive for convergence to the global optimum. To quantitatively evaluate the sensing capability of the integrated system, we derive the Cramér-Rao bound on the mean square error of the localization result and elucidate the performance gain from the joint processing. For completeness, we also present a tailored communication processing chain for symbol detection. Simulations and laboratory experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm over existing matched field processing-based positioning techniques."

However, in practical applications, kinematic parameters may change. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a robust learning and fuzzy control (RLFC) model that possesses kinematic learning and simultaneous control capabilities, enabling the estimation of unknown kinematic parameters and achieving adaptive control for redundant robots. Specifically, the RLFC model comprises two components: an integral-enhanced recurrent neural dynamics (IERND) and a fuzzy-enhanced recurrent neural dynamics (FERND). The IERND is designed to enhance the noise tolerance in kinematic parameter learning. Based on the learned kinematic parameters, the FERND, which incorporates a fuzzy logic system for dynamically adjusting convergence parameters, achieves effective position and orientation tracking of the end-effector in the redundant robot. Theoretical analyses are provided to demonstrate the convergence of the RLFC model. Simulations and experiments validate the effectiveness of the RLFC model in parameter learning, noise tolerance, and kinematic control.

Recently, processing-in-memory (PIM) has been getting increasing popularity as one of the emerging technologies for future computing with a focus on data-centric operations due to increasing applications which deal with large amounts of data. 2T DRAM has advantages at high-speed inference operations, cell scalability with truncation of the bulky capacitor, and full Si processing-capability, which makes the 2T DRAM PIM more favorable in chip implementation. However, the 2T DRAM cell has a weakness in that it is highly susceptible to coupling, because the storage node (SN), where data is stored, exists between the two transistors at floating state. This work investigates the cause of the CC and explains how to the precharge voltage is used to reduce the effect of CC in 2T DRAM. Furthermore, the disturbance based on the data stored in each cell of a 32 × 32 array is analyzed to determine its impact on read operations. The overall circuit simulations are based on the 65-nm standard process and the effects of parameters in its model library are examined."

Existing object encoding approaches typically rely on appearance-based representations, leading to poor performance in environments with multiple visually similar objects, which can compromise downstream task accuracy. Inspired by human perception of objects through both appearance and structure, we introduce DGOE, a novel object encoding method, which adopts a dual-graph embedding scheme. Rather than treating object representation as a single-level appearance encoding problem, DGOE explicitly models object discriminability through a dual-level structural formulation, decomposing it into intrinsic inner-object structure and cross-object relational context. DGOE leverages graph structures as the carrier to integrate object intrinsic appearance and cross-object spatial features. This unified framework leads to more distinctive and reliable object representations. Additionally, we use multi-head self-attention to learn cross-object graph structures for extracting cross-object spatial features. Experimental evaluations on multiple publicly available datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our method in object-level matching tasks, underscoring its effectiveness and robustness."

The 2020 COVID-19 lockdown resulted in substantial reductions of AQI values because of reduced human activity. The highest pollution levels occurred in 2019, but the AQI readings stayed mostly between 75 and 135 which falls under the ‘Moderate’ category.

Internal Model Control (IMC) is one of the most effective approaches for tuning PID controller parameters. Typically, first-order low-pass filters are employed in the IMC-based process control, where the filter has only one tuning parameter, namely closed-loop time constant, $\\lambda$. Even when a second-order filter is used, it still has only one tuning parameter. This study investigates the effect of second-order filtering with two userdefined parameters and employs analog filter denominator polynomials to determine the initial controller parameters. A novel second-order filtering model is proposed for first-order plus time delay (FOPTD) processes, and second-order low-pass Butterworth and Bessel polynomials are utilized to derive initial PID tuning parameters. The performance of the resulting controllers is evaluated through simulations in terms of setpoint tracking, load disturbance rejection, and robustness to model uncertainties for two FOPTD processes."

Conventional microphones suffer from severe performance degradation in long-distance sound acquisition due to acoustic energy attenuation and environmental interference, while laser-based solutions are limited by high cost and sensitivity to ambient conditions. To address these challenges, we propose an approach that employs a frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) radar system to measure the phase variations of reflected microwave signals, thereby estimating the minute vibrations of sound-producing objects and reconstructing the corresponding acoustic signals. The vibration measurement principle is derived in detail, and multiple experiments are conducted with sound sources placed up to 10 meters away. The results verify that the proposed method effectively acquires various types of sound signals at long range while maintaining robustness against environmental noise. This work demonstrates the feasibility of microwave-based acoustic sensing as a promising alternative to conventional methods for remote sound acquisition."

Acquiring such data, particularly for fault prognostics, faces multiple challenges. First, constructing an experimental test rig requires substantial investment and multidisciplinary expertise in mechanical design, control systems, and measurement technologies. Second, generating meaningful prognostic datasets demands large numbers of bearing failures under diverse operating conditions to adequately represent different degradation patterns. Third, the degradation process often takes several days to months, making it both time- and resource-intensive. As a result, few comprehensive datasets are publicly available due to commercial confidentiality and limited test capacities. To address these challenges and contribute to the CM community, we present the KU Leuven Bearing Prognostics Setup (KUL-BPS), a novel, modular, and cost-effective Accelerated Lifetime Testing (ALT) platform designed for systematic bearing degradation testing. Unlike existing ALT setups, which are often limited to low loads <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$(&lt;10 \\text{kN})$</tex>, low speeds (<3000 RPM), or artificially induced faults, KUL-BPS offers several key advantages: (a) It supports high loads up to 35 kN and speeds up to <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$18,000 \\text{RPM}$</tex>, enabling realistic wear and fatigue processes; (b) It utilizes a robust self-aligning bearing, which is easy to install, inspect, and replace; (c) It allows experiments under both constant and time-varying load-speed profiles to reflect real-world operating conditions. Furthermore, KUL-BPS enables synchronized acquisition of multiple sensing modalities, including vibration, torque, speed, force, acoustics, displacement, and temperature, facilitating comprehensive CM studies. The platform also supports virtual sensing research, such as estimating internal forces or torques from indirect measurements."

This paper proposes an integrated solution that unites wind resource evaluation, machine learning–based predictions, physics-constrained simulation, and techno-economic optimization to enhance the reliability and profitability of offshore wind farms. The model integrates high-resolution spatiotemporal information with a prediction module using the Extra Trees regressor, having a determination coefficient of R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> = 0.999. The simulation of physics-based turbine dynamics and high-voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission is used to calculate the operational stability and transmission loss. In addition, Monte Carlo-based measures of risk including De-Risked Wind Power Availability (DWPA) and Weighted Annual Revenue Reliability (WARR) are employed to quantify the impact of uncertainty in the market returns. A case study of a 1 GW offshore installation off the coast of Tamil Nadu illustrates a mean capacity factor of about 48% and a levelized cost of energy of 65–75 USD/MWh.

This paper presents a rigorous technical analysis of the evolutionary pathway for TUoS charges, drawing upon well-established international benchmarks. Utilizing a comprehensive phased modeling approach—progressing from a simple postage stamp model to the current peak-coincident framework and finally to an advanced zonal pricing methodology—this study applies a simplified DC load flow analysis, executed in a Python environment, to a representative model of the Saudi national grid. The modeling results provide quantifiable evidence of significant locational disparities in network costs, demonstrating that a strategic transition to a zonal model would substantially enhance economic efficiency by providing transparent, cost-reflective signals to guide optimal generation siting and demand-side management. Furthermore, this analysis establishes a technically robust and defensible foundation for calculating precise wheeling charges between zones—an important institutional enabler for third-party market access and competition, in line with broader liberalization goals. This study also offers practical insights into how Saudi Arabia's tariff structures could align with global technical practices, helping to support the Kingdom's Vision 2030 objectives for economic and energy diversification. The analysis is conducted with full respect for the significant progress already achieved by the national utility and regulator, and is intended solely as a technical contribution to the ongoing dialogue on strengthening the Kingdom's energy sector governance for a sustainable and efficient future [1]."

To address these issues, this article proposes a fault decoupling and fault-tolerant control (FTC) scheme for distributed piezoelectric stack actuators (PSAs), enabling self-diagnosis and self-recovery. A temperature perturbation observer (TPO) is designed to estimate temperature-induced disturbances, and a fault decoupling sliding mode observer (FDeSMO) is developed to decouple layer breakdown faults from lumped disturbances. The coordination between the two observers allows accurate detection of broken layers under temperature variations. Subsequently, a fault-tolerant controller is integrated to reallocate control signals and ensure system stability.

However, FHE poses notable performance challenges, especially in processing aggregation queries. These challenges stem from the need to homomorphically evaluate selection predicates via a linear scan over encrypted rows and from the resultant accumulation of redundant data. Overcoming these limitations necessitates innovative solutions that transcend traditional FHE optimizations. We propose a scheme, named Accelerated Homomorphically Encrypted DataBase (AHEDB), to enhance the efficiency of aggregation queries in homomorphically encrypted databases. In the scheme, we employ Encrypted Multiple Maps (EMM) to reduce the computational load inherent in homomorphic operations, thereby achieving significant improvements over existing encryption schemes. We further introduce Single Range Cover (SRC) algorithm for range and equality indexing to address potential security vulnerabilities. We implement our scheme and conduct comparative analyses with FHE-based database system. Our experiments demonstrate that our scheme offers significant advantages in querying overheads, striking a balance between security and efficiency."

The objective is to provide an efficient encryption method suitable for devices with limited processing power, such as IoT devices. The model was simulated using Qiskit, achieving an average quantum bit error rate of 0.00%, protocol efficiency of 49.72 %, and quantum fidelity of 1.000 under certain conditions. During eavesdropping scenarios, the error rate increased to 16.90 %. The simplified AES achieved a 50.14 % avalanche effect and an encryption time of 0.3073 ms, reducing latency by 17 % compared to standard AES.

Unlike conventional Proportional - Integral (PI) controllers, which are sensitive to parameter uncertainties and external disturbances, ADRC actively estimates and compensates both internal and external perturbations, thus improving overall system robustness. Simulation results show that ADRC reduces speed oscillations by up to 80% during load variations and maintains frequency deviations within 2% of the nominal value, without overshoot. These results underscore ADRC's effectiveness in enhancing stability and power quality in hybrid renewable energy applications."

Such attacks exploit gradient magnitude, direction, sign, and BatchNorm statistics to reconstruct private inputs with high fidelity. In this paper, we introduce a lightweight defense mechanism based on parametric nonlinear gradient transformations. By applying tunable nonlinear mappings to selected gradients before transmission, our approach obfuscates exploitable geometric patterns while preserving convergence. Unlike noise injection or compression, the transformation directly targets the structural cues that enable inversion, thereby providing protection with minimal overhead. Comprehensive experiments on MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and LFW confirm that the proposed defense significantly reduces reconstruction quality, achieving higher MSE and lower PSNR/SSIM, while maintaining competitive accuracy compared to baseline FL models. These results highlight the practicality of nonlinear transformations as an effective and composable privacy-preserving technique for federated learning."

However, under fault conditions, VSGs exhibit prominent transient instability, and the unclear transient stability boundary significantly impair their voltage/frequency support capability. To this end, this paper proposes a voltage deviation adaptive feedforward method, aiming to optimize the transient stability operating boundary of VSG. First, coupling relationship between reactive power-voltage droop characteristics and transient power angle characteristics is analyzed. Based on this, the coupling characteristics are harnessed to propose a transient stability control architecture incorporating voltage deviation feedforward. Furthermore, with the objective of optimizing the transient stability boundary of VSG, the voltage deviation feedforward coefficient is adaptively designed to enhance its transient stability performance. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed strategy in this paper is verified through simulations and experiments."

Traditional approaches based on High-Gain Observers (HGOs) enhance state estimation but are highly sensitive to sensor noise, limiting their reliability in practical scenarios. This paper presents an Extended High-Gain Observer (EHGO)-assisted feedback linearization controller for a single inverted pendulum (SIP) model of human standing posture subject to actuator noise. By explicitly incorporating noise as an augmented state, the EHGO achieves robust state estimation while ensuring disturbance compensation. The controller simulates central nervous system (CNS) regulation by shaping nonlinear dynamics into a double-integrator form regulated via Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR). Simulation results under three perturbation magnitudes (1.27, 1.37, and 1.47 rad) demonstrate fast recovery (<1.7 s), minimal overshoot, negligible steady-state error, and smooth torque transients free of high-frequency chatter, even in noisy conditions. Compared with existing observer-based approaches such as Linear Extended State Observer–Sliding Mode Control (LESO-SMC) exoskeleton control, the proposed design provides equally strong disturbance rejection while preserving continuous, physiologically consistent torque outputs. These results confirm that the SIP model, when augmented with EHGO-based control, remains a valid and powerful framework for analyzing postural stability and developing robust, human-inspired controllers for assistive and rehabilitation technologies."

    "abstract": "Conventional empirical global ionospheric models, such as the Klobuchar model and the International Reference Ionosphere (IRI), utilize a limited set of parameters to represent global ionospheric Total Electron Content (TEC). These models are extensively employed in Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) positioning. However, the accuracy of these models is inherently restricted by their reliance on predefined mathematical functions, particularly during periods of intense space weather activity. While Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) offer significant advantages in modeling nonlinear relationships and have demonstrated promising results for ionospheric prediction, their efficacy specifically for the domain of empirical ionospheric modeling remains largely unexplored. This study aims to fill this gap by proposing a multi-channel Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) method for empirical ionospheric modeling. The base architecture, CEIMv1, integrates fundamental solar-geometric parameters. Building upon this foundation, CEIMv2 incorporates the solar-geomagnetic indices as additional inputs, while CEIMv3 further extends the input data by including Mean Global Electron Content (MGEC) data. Validation against reference products shows that CEIMv2 and CEIMv3 achieve root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) of 6.40 TECU and 4.06 TECU, corresponding to accuracy gains of 26.0% and 17.1% over IRI-2020 and 46.6% and 49.9% compared to the Klobuchar model. Notably, CEIMv3 exhibits a minimal variation in precision of merely 3.66 TECU between high- and low-activity solar years, significantly outperforming conventional models. These results demonstrate a shift from traditional function-based methods toward a data-driven, multi-channel machine learning strategy, offering significantly improved ionospheric delay correction for single-frequency GNSS users."

    "abstract": "With the rapid growth of data, redundancy among different users in cloud environments has become increasingly prominent. Detecting and removing these redundant parts can effectively improve storage efficiency. But these processes may dramatically degrade the system performance, especially when dealing with similar data. Although deduplication and delta compression are common data reduction techniques, their high overhead can outweigh the benefits. As a result, users often cannot determine in advance whether compression is worthwhile for their datasets. Some approaches have attempted to solve this, but each has important limitations. Danny Harnik et al. proposed a sampling-based deduplication estimation method using linear programming, which efficiently estimates redundancy from exact duplicates. However, it fails to capture redundancy arising from similar data, thus underestimating the full compression potential. To address this limitation, we propose Smart-to-Compress, a predictive compression decision framework. We introduce the Super Feature Frequency Histogram (SFH) to capture redundancy among similar data. Combined with the Duplication Frequency Histogram (DFH), our method estimates the overall Data Reduction Ratio (DRR) without scanning the entire dataset. Furthermore, we design a game-theoretic decision model to weigh compression benefits against predicted costs, providing users with guidance on whether compression should be applied. Experiments on real-world datasets show that our method accurately predicts compression value, reduces unnecessary overhead, and offers reliable decision-making support for users."

This paper introduces an adaptive resampling framework called the Hybrid Sampling Ratio Selection Algorithm (HSRSA), designed to enhance fraud detection performance in smart grid systems. The method systematically explores combinations of random undersampling and SMOTE-based oversampling ratios to optimize classifier sensitivity under low false positive rate (FPR) constraints. We evaluate the effectiveness of HSRSA across four ensemble-based models—CatBoost, LightGBM, XGBoost, and Decision Tree—using a real-world dataset from Vietnam Electricity comprising over 22 million smart meter records. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly improves partial AUC (pAUC) scores compared to baseline resampling, particularly in the critical <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$FPR \\leqslant 0.2$</tex> region.

    "abstract": "Image Steganography without Embedding (SWE) is an emerging data hiding paradigm. Instead of embedding a secret message into a container image, SWE synthesises a novel image by using the secret message as a latent code. Current SWE methods have achieved high synthesis quality and strong resistance to steganalysis tools. However, it remains challenging to apply the SWE due to two reasons: (i) lack of synthesis diversity and (ii) recovery of secret messages under malicious image attacks. In this paper, we present a novel SWE framework with a disentanglement autoencoder to tackle the above challenges. Specifically, the autoencoder disentangles an image into a structure and texture representation. Then, we exploit the stability of the structure representation to improve secret message recovery reliability, while increasing synthesis diversity by randomising texture representations and employing a chaotic system for structure randomisation to enhance its security. To further achieve a robust message recovery under malicious attacks, an adversarial learning strategy is introduced into our framework, which guarantees high recovery accuracy. Our method outperforms other state-of-the-art SWE methods in terms of synthesis quality, synthesis diversity and secret message recovery accuracy under various image attacks.

    "abstract": "This work presents a cascaded control strategy for underactuated autonomous surface vehicles, integrating an extended state estimator within a path-following controller. Although path-following control has been extensively addressed in the literature, its experimental implementation continues to face significant challenges, particularly in real-world environments characterized by dynamic uncertainties, unmodeled disturbances, and measurement noise. The proposed architecture preserves the classical structure of cascade control, applying a surge-guided line-of-sight-based guidance law at the kinematic layer and a modified robust-adaptive backstepping controller at the dynamic layer. Both controllers take advantage of a nonlinear set-membership extended state observer, reformulated to incorporate a recently identified kinetic model that accounts for uncertainties in both the inertial dynamics and the propulsion system. The main contributions of this work include the reformulation of the observer to incorporate the identified model and the integration of angular velocity measurements, as well as the demonstration of the input-to-state stability of the low-level tracking errors with respect to estimation errors. Another significant contribution is the experimental validation of the complete strategy on a catamaran-type autonomous surface vehicle, operating under real-world conditions with unmeasured disturbances. The experimental results demonstrate robust and accurate performance in both estimation and control across various circuit exercises."

However, existing methods typically rely on complex camera calibration processes and are sensitive to dynamic environments. To address these limitations, we propose ECTFormer, an innovative calibration-free multi-view 3D HPE framework that seamlessly combines Transformer-based spatiotemporal modeling with CNN-based local feature extraction. The primary contents of this paper are: Firstly, we introduce a hierarchical multi-view spatio-temporal feature extraction network. This network avoids interference between noise from different viewpoints through hierarchical learning and employs a transformer to capture spatio-temporal features within views for subsequent fusion. And then, we design a CNN-Transformer fusion module (CTFM) that efficiently aggregates multi-view features, enabling accurate 3D pose regression. Extensive experiments on a public 3D human pose benchmark demonstrate that our approach attains superior performance without relying on calibration. For real-world environments equipped with dynamic camera sensors, ECTFormer can efficiently perform human pose estimation."

These issues can lead to motor stalling, industrial disruptions, and costly interruptions. This paper proposes a novel solid-state transformer (SST) control strategy to mitigate FIDVR, enhance motor stability, and improve low-voltage ride-through (LVRT) capability in systems with largescale photovoltaic (PV) integration. The SST employs advanced control techniques to dynamically manage active and reactive power, ensuring voltage stabilization, preventing motor stalling during faults, and maintaining system reliability. Unlike conventional solutions such as STATCOMs or SVCs, the SST integrates seamlessly with PV systems, offering superior fault mitigation and performance in renewable energy integration. Furthermore, the SST approach adheres to LVRT grid codes, ensuring compliance with voltage stability standards during fault events. MATLAB/Simulink simulations in a realistic gridconnected PV system validate the proposed approach, demonstrating its effectiveness in stabilizing voltage, maintaining critical motor operation, and addressing FIDVR. The results highlight significant improvements in system reliability, reduced downtime, and enhanced adaptability to increasing renewable penetration, establishing the SST as a transformative solution for modern power systems."

Our approach employs a right-invariant error formulation to ensure robustness against navigation-frame transformations and compatibility with body-frame sensor measurements.A federated architecture divides the estimation process into an IMU local filter, which tracks the full state, and a DVL local filter, which focuses on body-frame velocity. A master filter integrates estimates using information-based weighting, with feedback ensuring consistency.

The study examines the ROI of AI in business divisions, utilizing machine learning algorithms to identify predictive information and key factors influencing financial performance. Key performance factors, including installation cost, revenue before and after AI adoption, cost reduction, and management rating, were analyzed using real-world statistics from 20 businesses across various departments, including marketing, finance, human resources, IT, and operations. To enhance the conventional cost-benefit analysis, the ROI was estimated, and feature significance was measured using supervised learning models, including random forest and linear regression. Research indicates that the use of AI significantly improves operations and revenue, particularly in businesses with marketing and IT divisions, and that ROIs are often more than 300 percent. The features analysis's significance revealed that the department type, implementation cost, and managers' satisfaction with the outcomes were all reliable predictors of return on investment. The study not only calculates the financial cost or benefit of integrating AI, but it also suggests a data-structure-based decision-making process to direct their activities. By incorporating historical performance patterns into proactive investment strategies, machine learning elevates the degree of analysis. The study offers a forward-looking perspective on AI-based corporate transformation via the use of predictive modeling in conjunction with empirical performance data.

    "abstract": "Magnification has become the standard approach to tackle accuracy problems in eye-tracking based interaction systems, but suffers many problems itself. Magnification can be inefficient and oftentimes occludes contents in direct proximity to the magnifier, which is especially problematic when dealing with inaccuracies. While some of these problems can be tackled with special magnifying shapes, like hybrid linear-fisheye lenses, most approaches are rather limited one-size-fits-all approaches agnostic to user characteristics and content semantics. This limits the ability of magnification approaches to help users in scenarios where they encounter a below average accuracy or interact with targets that are especially small or crammed together. This paper presents Adaptive Magnification: a novel approach that is personalized to user-specific parameters and also context-aware by utilizing and mapping the screen content's semantic information to choose a magnification factor and size to optimally support interaction. The approach was evaluated against the use of no magnification and the use of hybrid linearfisheye magnification in a user study (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathrm{n}=20$</tex>). Task effectivity was evaluated by measuring the misclick count, while task efficiency wasn't measured as the approach is not focused on speed increase but on functionality and usability improvements. The user study revealed a 95.7% lower misclick count when compared to the use of no magnification and 13.1% fewer misclicks compared to hybrid linear-fisheye magnification."

    "abstract": "Cardiac pacemakers are a type of medical device that have been developed to control abnormal cardiac rhythms by administering electrical stimuli. Globally, more than 1.5 million pacemakers are being implanted each year. This highlights the critical role of these devices in modern medical practice. However, available studies have found that traditional pacemaker implants provide unnecessary stimulation in some 30 to 40 percent of patients, thus hastening battery depletion, increasing the frequency of replacement implantation, and raising health risks and costs. These shortcomings highlight the urgency of more complex and flexible pacing agents in the field of cardiovascular medicine and biomedical engineering. Addressing these deficits is necessary to improve patient safety and reduce complications and long-term healthcare spending. A customized pacing paradigm is suggested to overcome these difficulties by means of deep learning. The current approach uses a hybrid ResNet-BiLSTM system as a way to properly label the individual heartbeats by using labeled data of the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database. The results of the classification support a decision pipeline that takes into consideration heart rate variability, beat classification weights, deviation of resting heart rate, and non-regular RR intervals to assess the need for pacing. Unlike traditional pacemakers, which are activated only once heart rates drop below a set limit, this new method evaluates both the intensity and progression of arrhythmic conditions. As a result, the decisions made about the pace become more accurate, clinically relevant, and specific to a particular patient."

When applied to Quranic content, these hallucinations can manifest as fabricated verses, incorrect diacritical marks, or misattributed sources, potentially leading to unacceptable distortion of sacred text. This paper addresses LLM hallucinations in Quranic text retrieval through an agentic framework that leverages external knowledge tools rather than relying on potentially flawed model memorization. We present two primary contributions: First, a benchmark quantifying hallucination rates across various LLMs on Quranic verse generation, revealing exact match rates below 1% for most open-source small language models and up to 69% for the best commercial models. Second, the preliminary result of our novel Islamic agentic approach that enables smaller, deployable models to achieve over 95% accuracy through SQL-based retrieval tools, providing a cost-effective, transparent, and locally deployable solution for accurate Islamic text retrieval."

    "abstract": "The rapid rise of deep generative models has enabled realistic synthetic media, posing severe risks to healthcare communication where trust and accuracy are essential. Existing deepfake detectors, mostly trained on entertainment-oriented datasets, degrade sharply in medical contexts, where domainspecific terminology and evidence-based discourse are critical. Moreover, post-hoc moderation is often too slow to mitigate the spread of health-related disinformation, underscoring the need for timely, domain-adapted solutions. We address these gaps by (i) curating a multimodal healthcare-oriented corpus of in-the wild and synthetically generated deepfakes, (ii) benchmarking state-of-the-art monomodal detectors for video, audio, and text, and (iii) introducing a late-fusion framework that integrates their predictions via ensemble methods. Our experiments show that late fusion consistently outperforms individual detectors, yielding notable gains in macro-F1 and AUC (+0.159 and +0.131, respectively), particularly under domain-shift and lowresource conditions. These findings demonstrate the importance of multimodal integration for robust detection of health-related deepfakes and contribute toward building trustworthy AI systems to safeguard medical communication.

    "abstract": "Power control in Device-to-Device networks is still a challenging learn-to-optimize problem, although recent AI-empowered approaches (e.g., PCGNN/GRLinQ/UFPLinQ) have made remarkable progress regarding effectiveness and in-domain generalization. There is still some concern about whether or not purely data-driven approaches are generalizable across domains with diverse interference patterns. To clear such a concern, we propose a powerful data-driven approach, PCGFormer, enabled by a novel graph transformer architecture with fast attention mechanisms, answering the question in the affirmative. By extensive experiments in both strong and weak interference regimes, PCGFormer exhibits excellent sum rate performance comparable to the state-of-the-art model-based/driven methods, e.g., FPLinQ and UFPLinQ, with substantially reduced computational complexity. More impressively, PCGFormer demonstrates excellent cross-domain generalization across diverse interference patterns – scaling law still rocks – breaking through a key bottleneck of small-scale data-driven approaches, e.g, PCGNN. These findings establish PCGFormer as a practical and powerful candidate for large-scale wireless resource allocation."

Firstly, a new voltage regulator is designed by the time-varying scaling function and the dynamic average consensus protocol of multi-agent systems. Meanwhile, in order to avoid the dependence of the algorithm on the global network information, an edge-based adaptive control update rate is proposed. Secondly, by applying the prescribed-time stability theory, it is rigorously proven that the bus voltage can be restored to its desired value under the presented voltage regulator within a prescribed time, and the current is allocated according to the droop coefficient ratio. Finally, the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed algorithm are verified through Matlab/Simulink simulation under different working conditions, and it is compared with the existing asymptotic consensus algorithm to demonstrate the superiority of the algorithm presented in this paper."

    "abstract": "Existing remote sensing spatiotemporal fusion methods often suffer from excessive smoothing at object boundaries, insufficient modeling of global contextual information, and underutilization of temporal change features. To improve these issues, a triple-branch convolutional neural network is proposed, consisting of a dual-stream spatial network and a temporal difference network.Within the spatial branches, a spatiotemporal adaptive modulation (STAM) module is integrated, in which spatial attention is combined with squeeze-and-excitation (SE) channel attention to enhance feature discrimination. In the temporal branch, lightweight depthwise separable convolutions are employed to efficiently refine temporal difference features. Furthermore, a composite loss function is designed to simultaneously optimize pixel-level accuracy, structural fidelity, and edge detail restoration. Experiments on the CIA, LGC, and AHB datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves marked improvements over current models in reconstructing high-frequency edges and low-frequency structures, maintaining global semantic consistency, and suppressing dynamic change noise, with an average increase of 1.46 dB in PSNR and an average decrease of 0.15 in ERGAS."

    "abstract": "The Segment Anything Model (SAM), with its prompt-driven paradigm, exhibits strong generalization in generic segmentation tasks. However, applying SAM to remote sensing (RS) images still faces two major challenges. First, manually constructing precise prompts for each image (e.g., points or boxes) is labor-intensive and inefficient, especially in RS scenarios with dense small objects or spatially fragmented distributions. Second, SAM lacks domain adaptability, as it is pre-trained primarily on natural images and struggles to capture RS-specific semantics and spatial characteristics, especially when segmenting novel or unseen classes. To address these issues, inspired by few-shot learning, we propose ViRefSAM, a novel framework that guides SAM utilizing only a few annotated reference images that contain class-specific objects. Without requiring manual prompts, ViRefSAM enables automatic segmentation of class-consistent objects across RS images. Specifically, ViRefSAM introduces two key components while keeping SAM’s original architecture intact: (1) a Visual Contextual Prompt Encoder that extracts class-specific semantic clues from reference images and generates object-aware prompts via contextual interaction with target images; and (2) a Dynamic Target Alignment Adapter, integrated into SAM’s image encoder, which mitigates the domain gap by injecting class-specific semantics into target image features, enabling SAM to dynamically focus on task-relevant regions. Extensive experiments on three few-shot segmentation benchmarks, including iSAID-5<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><i>i</i></sup>, LoveDA-2<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><i>i</i></sup>, and COCO-20<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><i>i</i></sup>, demonstrate that ViRefSAM enables accurate and automatic segmentation of unseen classes by leveraging only a few reference images, and consistently outperforms existing few-shot segmentation methods across diverse datasets."

    "abstract": "Accurate and efficient brain tumor segmentation and survival prediction are crucial tasks in medical image analysis, providing essential information for early diagnosis, treatment planning, and improved clinical decision-making. Motivated by these challenges, we propose a multimodal deep learning framework that integrates 3D MRI scans with tabular clinical data to simultaneously perform brain tumor segmentation and patient survival prediction. The proposed multitask model combines a 3D U-Net and a 3D Vision Transformer (3DViT) for volumetric segmentation, along with a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) branch that processes clinical data for survival estimation. The features extracted from both imaging and tabular modalities are fused through a broadcasting mechanism, enabling effective interaction between spatial and non-spatial representations. The integrated feature space is trained in an end-to-end fashion using a dual-task objective that simultaneously optimizes voxel-wise segmentation and survival prediction. Experimental results on the BraTS 2020 dataset demonstrate that the proposed framework achieved a mean Dice score of 0.78, an IoU of 0.72 for tumor segmentation, and a mean squared error (MSE) of 0.022 with a C-index of 0.88 for survival prediction. These results demonstrate strong segmentation performance and clinically relevant survival predictions."

Our system was trained and evaluated on a large-scale Vietnamese credit card transaction dataset comprising over 6.2 million records collected over three months. The preprocessing pipeline systematically compared encoding strategies (ordinal, one-hot, entity embedding, graph-based) and scaling methods to optimize feature representation. In semi-automatic evaluation, the model flagged the top 20 anomalous transactions per week for four weeks, with human reviewers confirming that 25 % of these required further investigation, demonstrating the system's practical utility. The results are presented via a Streamlit-based operator interface, serving as a proof-of-concept for integration into existing manual detection workflows. While the approach shows promise, further work is needed to enhance robustness and scalability for production deployment."

    "abstract": "Critical infrastructure such as power grids, manufacturing and water treatment plants are increasingly targeted by cyberattacks that can disrupt physical processes and cause service outages. While honeypots are useful for misleading attackers, the frequent use of high-quality deception can consume network and computing resources, slowing legitimate control operations and affecting system stability. This paper proposes a resilience-oriented reward function for reinforcement learning (RL) agents that defend critical infrastructure networks. The reward aims to maintain process uptime and stability while controlling the operational cost of deception. The RL agent assesses current system conditions—such as bandwidth use, computing load, and service health—before selecting a defensive action. This enables more selective use of both high-fidelity and lower-cost honeypots. The method is implemented and trained in a detailed critical infrastructure simulation environment, and compared with a baseline RL agent using a conventional cyber-focused reward. The evaluation covers both normal operations and scenarios where deception approaches introduce operational stress. Results show that while both agents maintained high availability in basic settings, the resilience-oriented model achieved steadier performance under resource constraints, highlighting the trade-offs between strong deception and system stability."

The parameters of these models are typically obtained through direct measurement. Although this approach offers high accuracy, its applicability is limited by equipment constraints, highlighting the need for more scalable methods. To address this issue, this study employs a parameter estimation method based on an asymmetric vocal fold oscillation model, enabling the direct inference of vocal fold parameters from speech signals for dynamic modeling and source characterization. Meanwhile, we propose a time-preference residual-weighted optimization strategy that assigns monotonically increasing weights to residuals over time, thereby reinforcing phase consistency and amplitude constraints of the steady-state cycles and effectively suppressing large local residuals at model onset. In glottal flow simulations of healthy speech, this strategy reduces RMSE by 0.031 (a 12.8 % decrease). We further validate the method in more complex speech scenarios. The results show robust performance across diverse conditions, which provides a feasible solution for vocal fold dynamic modeling based on speech signals and enabling high-accuracy classification with inverted-parameter features."

    "abstract": "The superior environmental performance of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) has led to their widespread application in transportation, distributed power generation, and other fields. Accurate degradation prediction of PEMFCs is crucial for reducing costs and enhancing the reliability of equipment operation. However, capturing the degradation details of PEMFCs from measurement data with high-frequency noise is a challenging task. To address this, this paper proposes a hierarchical pure convolution data-driven model, ConvTimeNet, which focuses on local degradation modeling while capturing the multi-scale dependencies between degradation data. Specifically, this study introduces a deformable patch layer to perceive the local patterns of temporal dependence units. The extracted local patterns undergo multi-scale dependency analysis on the designed hierarchical pure convolution blocks. Consequently, both local patterns and multi-scale dependencies are effectively modeled, thereby enabling health status monitoring of PEMFCs. The proposed method is also validated in multi-step forecasting scenarios; for a <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{6 4}$</tex>-step horizon, the MAPE is only <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{0. 2 0 3 \\%}$</tex>."

    "abstract": "As modern FPGAs continue to scale, the routing architecture increasingly dominates both area and delay. However, traditional homogeneous routing architectures struggle to efficiently accommodate spatially varying routing demands, often resulting in imbalanced routing resource utilization across different regions. This inefficiency contributes to increased routing area and critical path delay (CPD). To address this limitation, this paper proposes a hybrid FPGA routing architecture that introduces spatial heterogeneity into interconnect block configurations. The proposed architecture is fully parameterized, allowing different regions of the FPGA fabric to adopt distinct routing topologies tailored to local connectivity requirements. To support this architecture within the Verilog-to-Routing (VTR) toolchain, we extend the architecture description file format and enhance the routing resource graph (RRG) generator to support region-specific interconnect features. Furthermore, to efficiently search the vast parameter space, we employ a parallel Bayesian optimization (BO)-based design space exploration (DSE) framework for automated identification of optimal architecture configurations. Experimental results on the VTR benchmark suite demonstrate that the proposed hybrid routing architecture achieves up to 7.9% reduction in routing area, 2.5% improvement in CPD, and 10.1 % improvement in area-delay product (ADP) compared to the state-of-the-art VIB architecture. Additional analysis also shows a 38.09 % reduction in routing detour, confirming the effectiveness of the hybrid architecture in improving routing compactness and reducing wire overhead."

Although the benefits of e-invoicing are widely recognized, Malaysian banks face challenges such as compliance requirements, system integration, high initial costs, and staff resistance to change. This paper presents a qualitative case study on a Malaysian bank’s experience in implementing e-invoicing, analyzed through SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) analysis. Data were collected via interviews with three staff members directly involved in the e-invoicing initiative. Findings show that while e-invoicing improves efficiency and compliance, challenges remain in system integration, training and change management. Practical strategies are suggested to support smoother adoption."

This has a twofold objective: verifying the effect of an IBR in the stability assessment of electric power systems, and explaining the performance of the dot product with the Equal Area Criterion (EAC). Results show that the IBR power plant affects, indeed, system stability, but it does not interfere with stability assessment, while the point at which dot product detects instability, in which the dynamic trajectory of the system crosses the potential energy boundary surface of the unstable cases, is precisely the same at which the EAC detects instability."

The framework begins with Gaussian smoothing and normalization of the inputs and face detection and removal, creating regions of interest for gesture recognition. Both hands are segmented through HSV thresholding followed by instance-level separation. Key points of interest are extracted from the hand using ORB, Shi-Tomasi corner detection, and morphological thinning, skeletal endpoints and branch points of the hand provide further structural information. Geometric descriptors are computed and are concatenated into an overall feature vector. A Graph Neural Network (GNN) classifier is applied to model spatial dependencies and Salp Swarm Optimization strategies are applied to improve training overall. During evaluation, this method achieves 69.2% accuracy of gestures from the KARSL-190 dataset and demonstrates that interpretable features, graph-based learning, and gesture recognition that leverage precision provide a not only robust but essential method for any RGB-based approach to accurate gesture recognition."

This paper explores the application of YOLOv8nseg, a lightweight deep learning model, to the task of realtime vehicle segmentation in dynamic driving environments. Building upon the architectural strengths of previous YOLO versions, YOLOv8n-seg introduces modular improvements aimed at balancing inference speed with segmentation precision. Our proposed framework leverages this architecture to segment five vehicle categories-car, bus, motorcycle, truck, and truck3-with a focus on robustness in complex urban scenarios. The methodology includes training on a curated vehicle re-annotation dataset representative of diverse driving conditions, followed by extensive evaluation of classification accuracy, precision-recall trade-offs, and qualitative segmentation results. The experimental results demonstrate that YOLOv8n-seg achieves a mean Average Precision (mAP${\\$}$0.5) of 0.936 across all categories, with particularly strong performance for cars $(0.973)$ and buses $(0.952)$. The model further maintains high stability in training and validation losses, confirming robust convergence and generalization capabilities."

This research aims to build an autonomous maze-solving robot that utilizes position offset from the walls and alignment angle as key control factors. The robot is developed with ultrasonic sensors to measure perpendicular distance from the wall to itself and calculate alignment, allowing an adjustment of velocity and movement direction accordingly. A wall-following algorithm navigation and curvature-based turning enable the robot to efficiently explore maze environments. Experimental results demonstrate that the robot is able to maintain position during straight-line movement, execute smooth turns based on real-time position offset calculations, and successfully navigate both orthogonal and curvilinear mazes. The finding suggests that integrating omnidirectional control with position offset and wall alignment-based navigation can improve maze-solving efficiency and may have applications in certain robotic exploration tasks."

    "abstract": "Asian countries exhibit an extensive range of crop biodiversity due to varying climates and agricultural practices. This situation can make it challenging to develop automated mapping systems that accurately classify numerous crop types. To prevent these complexities, an automated method such as dynamic time warping with time series multispectral data is used for crop Growth identification and mapping. This paper presents a dynamic method for the identification of crop growth stages and their patterns for four years (2019-2022) in the Kanigiri region of Prakasam district, India, with the help of Sentinel-2 Time series multispectral data and Dynamic method of time Warping. The tools used for this project are GEE, and QGIS for downloading remote sensing images and preprocessing respectively. The dataset mainly contains a series of 12 TIFF files for each year, taken from Sentinel-2 satellite data, and a reference CSV file containing crucial reference & ground data, including longitude, latitude, crop type, and crop duration. The TWDTW technique used in this project is to find the best similarity alignment between the two-time series data and also to align and compare NDVI time series, which enables the identification of particular crop growth patterns and their temporal evolution. The resulting crop type maps provide important insights into the dynamics of agricultural land use in the study area. This approach demonstrates the standards of remote sensing and time-series analysis to automate the different crop type classification, mapping and monitor landuse changes for multiple years."

    "abstract": "Peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading frameworks are mostly implemented for decentralized energy trading among participants in a residential community. While economically effective, these platforms are susceptible to cyber-physical threats such as false data injection attacks (FDIAs). This paper proposes a novel class of zero-sum FDIAs especially designed to disrupt supply-demand ratio-based P2P energy trading markets without modifying the daily net energy consumption of individual prosumers. The objective of these attacks is to economically alter the local electricity market, decreasing the profitability of legitimate energy trading and undermining trust in the system. By injecting tactically crafted false demand data during the P2P trading period, the attacker exploits the supply-demand balance within the community, thereby impacting internal selling and buying prices to shift market outcomes. FDIAs are simulated at various attack percentages of targeted prosumers, analyzing both operational and economic effects at both the community and prosumer levels. Results indicate that even low-intensity FDIAs affecting a large portion of prosumers can significantly degrade prosumer utility and alter market prices while remaining stealthy. The results highlight the vulnerability of P2P energy trading frameworks to undetectable injections, reinforcing the need for robust anomaly detection and attack mitigation techniques in P2P energy trading systems."

This paper addresses the task of selecting k points within a polygonal domain and maximizing all pairwise distances. The exponential increase in objectives with larger k makes this formulation computationally demanding, with applications in sensor placement, facility location, and wireless network deployment. To address this challenge, we apply two state-of-the-art metaheuristics: the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm III (NSGA-III), representing evolutionary optimization, and Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO), representing swarm intelligence. Both algorithms were tested on convex and concave polygon-constrained domains and evaluated using hypervolume, spread, and convergence metrics. Results show that MOPSO achieves superior convergence and diversity of Pareto fronts, while NSGA-III provides competitive performance with reduced runtime, making it effective for time-sensitive applications. These findings highlight the suitability of multi-objective metaheuristics for solving many-objective geometric optimization problems under spatial constraints."

Conventional JEDEC-based extraction relies on detecting the divergence of thermal capacitance curves measured with and without grease, but this criterion is highly sensitive to interface variability and capacitance-delta noise, often leading to inconsistent or overestimated R<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">thJC</sub> values. To address these limitations, we present an analytical extraction method that applies derivative and curvature analyses to the structural function, enabling clear identification of thermal boundaries and quantitative separation of chip-, die attach-, and lead frame-level thermal resistances. A series-resistance model is used to validate internal consistency by reconstructing the total R<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">thJC</sub> from the extracted layer components.

To address these challenges, we propose a Joint Clustering-based Autoencoder (JCAE) framework that integrates deep embedded clustering with autoencoder-based representation learning in a joint optimization process. Unlike conventional approaches that separate feature extraction and clustering, JCAE simultaneously optimizes reconstruction and clustering objectives, leading to more discriminative latent representations. The learned encoder is further combined with multiple anomaly detectors to identify anomalous behaviors in IoT traffic. We conduct extensive experiments on five widely used IoT datasets (N-BaIoT, Edge-IIoT, CIC-Ton-IoT, IoT-23, and IoT-NID). Results demonstrate that JCAE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models in terms of detection accuracy, false alarm rate, and missed detection rate, while maintaining feasible execution time.

In conventional load flow algorithms, the Jacobian matrix is derived from nonlinear trigonometric power flow equations, which vary significantly between grid-connected and islanded operational modes. With the increase in size and complexity of such networks, the computational complexities of the traditional Jacobian evaluation increase, which leads to an increase in load flow computational time. The proposed approach streamlines the Jacobian computation process by employing matrix-based operations that reduce computational steps while maintaining accuracy. This method applies to grid-connected and islanded configurations and incorporates a frequency-dependent exponential load model to enhance realism. The effectiveness and scalability of the technique are validated through simulations on a modified 10-bus system and standard 33-bus, 38-bus, 69-bus, 118-bus, and 136-bus microgrids under both modes of operation."

The study focuses on the application of Grid-Following (GFL) and Grid-Forming (GFM) control strategies, comparing the performance of the PI controller in these two architectures under strong and weak grid conditions, with X/R ratios of 10 and 3, respectively. Simulations carried out in Matlab/Simulink demonstrated robust control performance, ensuring stable and high-quality current injection even under load variations and different grid characteristics.

    "abstract": "This paper presents an event-triggered control strategy that integrates a relative threshold mechanism with prescribed performance constraints for multi-quadrotor slung-load transportation systems. The proposed approach addresses the challenges posed by strong nonlinearities and limited onboard computational resources. A dynamic model that explicitly considers load geometry and cable tension constraints for a multi-quadrotor slung-load transportation system is obtained through the application of the Udwadia-Kalaba equation. This model effectively captures the coupled nonlinear dynamics between the slung-load and the quadrotors during transportation maneuvers. Based on consensus theory, a cooperative control architecture is designed for the multi-quadrotor formation. Leveraging an adaptive backstepping control framework, a prescribed performance function is implemented to map the tracking error into a constrained domain. This mapped error signal is further integrated into a relative threshold event-triggered mechanism that dynamically adjusts the control signal update frequency based on the current error state, thereby reducing computational resource consumption while ensuring precise tracking. Simulation experiments, including complex scenarios like load landing and unloading, were conducted. The results demonstrate that the proposed control method significantly reduces the number of control updates and computational burden, while also improving tracking accuracy and dynamic response."

    "abstract": "Achieving more reliable communication necessitates precise beam management, a process often challenged by the dynamic and unpredictable nature of mobile environments. This study proposes an advanced prediction methodology that integrates a beam sweeping technique to acquire user prototype trajectory information. The method leverages received signal strength (RSS) and interference signal to noise ratio (SINR) metrics collected over a defined period to construct a prototype trajectory that reflects the behavior of user equipment (UE) over time. To enhance the accuracy of user movement predictions, two distinct Kalman filter approaches-the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) are applied to the prototype trajectory and data from proximity sensors. These filters are used to predict the user’s position and derive an average path representing the movement from one point to another. This comparative analysis enables the evaluation of prediction accuracy and its implications for adaptive beam steering in future. The findings demonstrate the potential of this approach that enable us to dynamically direct beams toward the user, thereby enhancing connectivity and overall network performance in mmWave-based systems. Such advancements are instrumental in addressing the challenges posed by high mobility and intermittent connectivity in nextgeneration wireless communication networks."

This evaluation exploits extensions of the method of types to continuous alphabets, the saddle-point method of integration, and basic tools from large deviations theory. The first class of bounds is obtained via the entropy power inequality (EPI), and therefore applies exclusively to continuous-valued inputs. The second class, by contrast, is more general, and it applies to discrete input alphabets as well. It is based on a direct manipulation of mutual information, and it yields stronger and tighter bounds, though at the cost of greater technical complexity. Numerical examples illustrating both types of bounds are provided, and several extensions and refinements are also discussed."

Our system uses computer vision and AI to extract 33 body landmarks from a standard webcam feed using the MediaPipe model. It measures ergonomic angles between major joints to detect slouching and sends both notifications-visual and aural style notifications to raise awareness for correction in our posture behavior. Slouchometer is a non-intrusive and it is easy to deploy on ordinary computers with webcams or mobile devices, unlike existing intrusive wearable-based solutions. The proposed system also offers a session wise insights through an integrated dashboard. An experiment conducted with over 15 participants resulted in significantly improved user posture awareness and behavior over time, with excellent classification accuracy of 93.2% with less than 0.2 seconds of feedback latency.

This study evaluates some state-of-the-art deep learning architectures, including point-based, voxel-based, and attention-based models, for segmenting LiDARscanned eucalyptus trees. A dataset comprising 55 clonal eucalyptus trees was constructed using an iPhone 12 Pro Max LiDAR sensor, with diameter measurements taken at four key heights. The performance of PointNet, PointNet++, DGCNN, PointMLP, PointNeXt-S, Point Transformer, and Point Voxel Transformer (PVT) was assessed using the mean $\\mathrm{mIoU} \\%$ metric. Results indicate that transformer-based models achieved superior segmentation accuracy, while classical point-based networks demonstrated competitive performance with lower computational costs. Despite dataset limitations, the models effectively delineated key tree structures, demonstrating their applicability to forestry tasks.

    "abstract": "When sensing the shape and movement of objects in the near field, light waves and radio waves have been used as the medium so far. Methods using light waves include sensors such as cameras and ToF (Time of Flight) sensors, which can achieve high-resolution sensing. However, light waves are weak to shielding and greatly affected by obstacles, making it difficult to sense hidden objects. On the other hand, radio waves have superior transmission performance compared to light waves, but due to their long wavelength, it is difficult to secure resolution. Therefore, in recent years, terahertz waves have been attracting attention as a sensing medium that combines the features of both light waves and radio waves. Terahertz waves are electromagnetic waves with a frequency located between light waves and radio waves, from 100 GHz to 10 THz. They can sense targets behind obstacles with high accuracy and high resolution, and are particularly expected to be applied in fields related to safety and security, such as body scanners and infrastructure inspections. Also, a feature of the terahertz band is that it can achieve high-precision tomographic imaging using wideband radar signals. In this paper, we describe the configuration of the proposed terahertz wave tomographic imaging system, show the results of principle verification experiments using the 300 GHz band, and discuss high-precision design techniques for 300 GHz band integrated circuits and their application examples."

Traditional empirical approaches, such as Taylor’s tool life equation, often fail to capture the complex nonlinear relationships between machining parameters, material properties, and tool degradation, particularly under dynamic industrial conditions. To overcome these limitations, this study proposes a data-driven Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) framework for tool wear prediction based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network architecture. The proposed model leverages multisensory signals—including vibration, spindle current, and temperature-collected from industrial CNC milling processes conducted under variable cutting conditions and high-speed operations. Comprehensive pre—processing and data normalization techniques are applied to enhance model convergence and predictive accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed stacked BiLSTM model achieves superior performance, with a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.0353 and a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.0307, validating its robustness and suitability for real-world PHM applications. Overall, the developed approach offers an effective and flexible solution for predictive maintenance, enabling optimized tool utilization and reduced unplanned downtime in modern manufacturing environments."

At the same time, contact degradation during repeated breaking operations significantly affects their reliability and service life. This paper proposes a remaining useful life (RUL) prediction method for circuit breakers based on comprehensive condition assessment to address the progressive deterioration of contact performance with increasing breaking cycles. A finite element simulation model of the contact system is developed to analyze the arcing erosion characteristics under various breaking conditions. Experimental measurements of the contact surface morphology after breaking operations are conducted to validate the accuracy and reliability of the simulation model. Based on this, a mapping relationship between contact performance degradation and the operational state of the circuit breaker is established by incorporating arc energy. This framework enables predictive analysis of the circuit breaker’s remaining useful life, providing a robust reliability assessment and lifecycle management approach."

To mitigate the problem, we propose pFedKD in this paper, a personalized Federated Learning algorithm with knowledge distillation. During FL training, pFedKD identifies the optimal round with the best local accuracy for each client as the teacher model for knowledge distillation while treating the final round as the student model. Then, the knowledge distillation module extracts desired information for each client’s local model, ensuring the accuracy and efficiency of pFedKD. Finally, our extensive experiments on Cifar10 outperform vanilla FedAvg, FedProx, and other SOTA personalized FL algorithms by at least 1.2%, underscoring the superiority of pFedKD."

This approach is a two-stage process, in which, we remove non-informative snps using Kruskal-Wallis test and then select the significant snps based on a predictive model variable importance measure.

A custom MATLAB simulation framework was used to benchmark Local TDV against both an idealized global-state reactive protocol and a static baseline. Results demonstrated that Local TDV improves path stability by nearly 80 % in high-velocity scenarios while avoiding latency penalties, underscoring the effectiveness of predictive, mobility-aware routing for next-generation FANETs."

Although, in real life claim settlement and other hefty processes trap the farmers in a loop of huge paperwork and wasted time. Farmers have to rely on intermediaries to get updates on their policy status or claim guarantees, which decreases confidence in existing systems. AgriSure is a prototype crop insurance platform that integrates blockchainbased record management with AI-assisted claim verification. Insurance-related transactions are stored on a distributed ledger, while smart contracts are used to execute predefined claim conditions. AI components support verification tasks to reduce manual effort rather than fully automate decisions.By limiting intermediary involvement and partial automation of the workflow, the system seeks to improve traceability and operational efficiency.

    "abstract": "Low-frequency oscillations (LFOs) are a growing concern for power system stability, as they can degrade power quality, damage equipment, and even trigger blackouts. These oscillations, typically in the 0.01–4 Hz range, are becoming more unstable with increasing integration of inverter-based resources (IBRs) and the prevalence of weak grid conditions. This paper analyzes three recent LFO events observed in the North-Eastern Region (NER) grid of India. Using the matrix pencil method for mode identification and the dissipating energy flow method for source localization, the study examines oscillation characteristics, damping behavior, and origin. The results show that IBR control actions, STATCOM reactive-power regulation, generator control responses, and inter-regional tie-line interactions all influence the observed oscillations. A key factor worsening stability is the high impedance of the NER grid. Grid strength assessment, based on short-circuit capacity relative to the ±800 kV HVDC system rating at Biswanath Chariali, gives a ratio of about 2.34 in the Assam system, indicating weak conditions. With around 4.6% solar penetration by installed capacity, the study highlights the need for enhanced monitoring, advanced analytical techniques, and coordinated mitigation strategies to ensure secure operation of future renewable-rich grids."

Recently, such generative diffusion-based segmentation models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in this task. However, their large number of parameters hinders the deployment in real-world clinical and mobile settings. A key challenge is how to compress these models while preserving their reliability in diagnosis. To this end, we propose an edge-focused knowledge distillation (EFKD) strategy for the generative diffusion-based skin lesion segmentation, prioritizing contour information transfer from teacher to student. Accordingly, we introduce LiteDermoSegDiff, a lightweight diffusion-based lesion segmentation model that integrates knowledge distillation with boundary-aware supervision. This design ensures that the student network maintains sharp lesion boundaries while significantly reducing model parameters. Extensive experiments on the common ISIC2018 and HAM10000 dermoscopic benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves up to 88.9% parameter reduction while maintaining competitive segmentation accuracy. These results show that diffusion-based segmentation models can be substantially compressed without compromising boundary awareness, paving the way for efficient and clinically deployable solutions in resource-constrained environments.

Integrating autonomous flight control, RF signal-based localization, and deep learning-based visual recognition, the system enhances victim detection in complex and constrained terrains.

Conventional forecasting models often achieve high accuracy for short-term predictions but exhibit limited performance in long-term scenarios, while also lacking transparency and data privacy guarantees. To address these challenges, this paper presents a hybrid deep learning framework that integrates Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, temporal attention mechanisms, and federated learning for longterm EV energy demand prediction. The LSTM module captures temporal charging patterns, the attention mechanism enhances interpretability by identifying influential time steps, and federated learning enables collaborative model training across geographically distributed regions without sharing raw data. The proposed framework is evaluated using multi-regional datasets covering Denmark, Greece, Portugal, Slovenia, Europe, and global projections. Experimental results demonstrate a reduction of $22-35 \\%$ in long-term mean absolute error compared to conventional LSTM and CNN-RNN models. Furthermore, federated training achieves comparable performance to centralized learning with less than a $3 \\%$ accuracy reduction, ensuring privacy preservation. The proposed approach offers a scalable and interpretable solution for EV demand forecasting to support grid stability and infrastructure planning."

    "abstract": "Sub-millimeter tracking accuracy is an important requirement for high-fidelity simulation in Virtual Reality (VR)-based medical training systems. Conventional optical tracking systems suffer from significant errors during occlusion, while standalone Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) usage leads to severe drift accumulation. This study proposes an Adaptive Extended Kalman Filter (AEKF)-based sensor fusion algorithm that integrates optical tracking, IMU, and force/torque sensors. The key technical contributions are: (1) a force feedback-based position drift correction mechanism, (2) innovation-based adaptive process noise adjustment, and (3) real-time tissue stiffness estimation through a 21-dimensional state vector. To evaluate the proposed algorithm’s performance, we generated simulation datasets for three standard medical scenarios (laparoscopic suturing, catheter insertion, and needle biopsy) and quantitatively compared five sensor fusion algorithms: (A) optical-only, (B) IMU-only, (C) standard EKF (optical+IMU), (D) Unscented KF (optical+IMU), and (E) proposed method (optical+IMU+force). Simulation-based experiments show that the proposed algorithm achieves an average position tracking error of 0.75mm (±0.19mm) in controlled simulation conditions, representing 95.5% improvement over optical-only (<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">P</i> < 0.05) and 85.4% improvement over standard EKF (<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">p</i> < 0.01) within the simulation environment. Furthermore, it maintains stable performance below 1.2mm even during simulated optical occlusion and achieves computational latency of 2.1ms on the tested hardware platform. This research focuses on algorithmic development and simulation-based validation, and does not include hardware prototype implementation, user studies with medical professionals, or clinical validation. The results demonstrate algorithmic feasibility under idealized simulation conditions rather than validated performance in real clinical environments."

    "abstract": "In multi-intersection traffic signal timing (TST) the use of a uniform cycle time reduces efficiency at low-volume intersections and signal changes which can alter vehicle flows and degrade communication quality. This paper presents a solution to this problem introducing a Twin-Timescale model whereby a multi-intersection TST method is jointly considered with communication resource allocation (CRA) strategies. For each intersection, a Twin-Timescale Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm is proposed, by considering both CRA and TST as the Short- and the Long- Timescale models, respectively, and jointly formulating their rewards. Based on the characteristics of this Twin-Timescale model, the reward function is constructed as a singularly perturbed model (SPM), and a state feedback controller that can ensure asymptotic stability is designed. Furthermore, a novel asynchronous time Multi-Agent Coordinated RL algorithm is proposed, which allows each intersection to generate each own joint parameters for its decision strategy which are based upon information obtained from neighboring intersections at asynchronous time. In addition, the use of Federated Learning (FL) in conjunction with the proposed algorithms is investigated, and its advantages in enhancing the resistance to malicious attacks are discussed. Using real traffic data, various performance evaluation results obtained by means of extensive computer simulation experiments have confirmed that the proposed TST-CRA joint optimization approach significantly improves traffic indicators and maintains the quality of the overall communication performance. Through numerical calculations, the state feedback controller coefficients have been determined."

At the first stage (day-ahead), the BES degradation range over the scheduled day is optimally allocated under day-ahead forecast of random variables. To accurately quantify BES degradation under temperature impact, a convex BES electrothermal-aging model is constructed. Then, a dynamic model constraint coefficient determination method is proposed for optimizing BES lifetime degradation using the historical operation and updated current information. At the second stage (real-time), an approximate dynamic programming method is developed to real-time optimize the MG operation after multiple uncertainties are realized. Considering the temperature dependent constraints of BES, a sequential decomposed value function slope update method is designed for enhanced optimization feasibility, BES aging quantification accuracy, and training efficacy, which can deliver high-quality solutions under uncertainties. Case studies on a MG system demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach."

    "abstract": "Aerial image object detection has gained increasing attention recently. Compared to natural scenes, this task is more challenging due to two main factors: 1) a large number of densely packed tiny objects with blurred appearances that hinder detection accuracy, and 2) non-uniform data distributions that limit detection efficiency. To address these challenges, we present YOLD (You Only Look Denseness), a simple yet efficient detection framework. Specifically, for dense small objects, we propose an end-to-end anchor-free detector guided solely by point supervision, improved from the classical CenterNet, the key difference of which lies in using localization-based distance transform maps instead of heatmaps. To tackle non-uniformly data distribution, a straightforward and effective Dense Region Extraction (DRE) module is designed to identify clustered regions containing challenging instances such as dense tiny objects, thereby improving detection efficiency. Additionally, we design the regression loss by incorporating the Generalized Euclidean Distance (GED) with an adaptive weighted mechanism based on objects’ areas, which improves the detection accuracy of tiny object detection. Finally, extensive experiments are carried out on three publicly available large-scale aerial image object detection datasets, namely VisDrone, UAVDT, and DTOD. The results confirm both the effectiveness of the proposed approach and its superiority over state-of-the-art methods."

This article investigates discrete-time, finite-horizon linear-quadratic (LQ) problems where both the state weight matrix and input weight matrix are unknown, with the presence of both process noise and observation noise. In addition, each player’s cost function incorporates a player-specific, unknown linear term with respect to the state. Under this framework, first, sufficient conditions are established for the solvability of the weight matrices. Subsequently, it is proved that the inverse dynamic games problem involving heterogeneous unknown target states is structurally identifiable, unaffected by process noise. Building on the necessary conditions for Nash equilibrium solutions in forward problems, the estimation of the cost function parameters is formulated as a nontrivial solution to a homogeneous linear estimation problem, which can be implemented in a distributed manner. Furthermore, the proposed estimator achieves statistical consistency under the influence of observation noise. The effectiveness is illustrated through a multivehicle spring-coupled dynamic game and an interactive steering control scenario."

This approach will modify the traditional economic dispatch model into an integrated system with a feedback control loop that includes crucial ancillary services. Moreover, an analysis will be conducted to contrast the conventional AGC framework with the new integrated model, which provides for ancillary services, presenting their connections and the effects on its functionality. The proposed approach uses MATLAB Simulink to model both classical and integrated AGC configurations, allowing for a comprehensive assessment of their operational dynamics and optimal market price.

A systematic literature review (SLR) of 16 peer-reviewed studies published between January 2022 and June 2025 was conducted following PRISMA 2020 and CASP guidelines. Results show that visual formats such as infographics, dashboards, and data comics outperform text-only approaches, particularly when tailored to audience expertise and domain context. Relevant, well-integrated visuals improve memory retention, engagement, and comprehension, whereas irrelevant or overly complex visuals can increase cognitive load. The synthesis draws on Dual Coding Theory, Cognitive Load Theory, and Cognitive Semiotics to explain these effects. Despite growing adoption of PSE-based approaches, challenges persist in developing standardized design guidelines, accurately measuring cognitive load, and adapting visuals for diverse audiences.

However, most of the EEG sampling equipments are expensive and the system design is always very complicated. All these bring limitations in the application of EEG controlled equipment in practice. This work has designed a low cost EEG controlled artificial hand that the control commands were generated by an α based brain-computer interface (BCI). The BCI designed in this work sampled EEG through an inexpensive wireless EEG device EMOTIV EPOC+. The system can output control commands to grasp and release objects by detecting α wave generated by users. The local controller can not only receive the control commands from BCI but also can control the detail movements of artificial hand based on current feedback, which makes the artificial hand can grasp objects of any shapes. By combining these two parts, the artificial hand can control and grasp things well according to the user's will by EEG. The experiment results show that the success rate of each subject finishing the experiments reached greater than or equal to 90%. This verifies that the artificial hand can be controlled well by the system designed in this work."

    "abstract": "The variability of solar and wind resources creates fluctuations in power generation outputs, which might threaten power system security and stability. In this context, developing an accurate prediction tool is essential with a high share of variable renewable energies and in the electricity market. This study applies advanced machine learning (ML) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks to predict the expected power production of variable renewable generation in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The work considers several forecasting models, such as K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Gradient Boosting-and Long Short-Term Memory. To do so, meteorological variables such as solar irradiation, ambient and cell temperatures, relative humidity, and wind speed, are introduced into models for predicting power outputs. To ensure the fairness of our results, we adopted the parameter as a setting in the baseline models. Performance evaluation of the results was conducted using MSE, RMSE, R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>, and MAE metrics."

A primary feature of neural network operations is the use of matrix computations, particularly repeated multiplications and additions. If these repetitive steps can be optimized, the inference time can be shorted. This paper presents the design of an FPGA-based testbed for exploring neural network operations in hardware, with a focus on fixed-point arithmetic, matrix multiplication, and activation functions. The testbed enables detailed examination of data flow and performance characteristics of neural network inference in constrained environments. This work aims to make the implementation details available to support future research and education in embedded machine learning, offering a practical reference for deploying neural networks for real-time, resource-constrained applications. The results from implementing a feedforward deep neural network, initially trained in MATLAB, and implemented on an Artix-7 FPGA using an 8.8 fixed-point format to reflect real-world resource limitations are also provided."

    "abstract": "Recent few-shot medical image segmentation models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities to generate precise masks given minimal user guidance. However, this reliance on user-provided precise prompts for optimal performance represents a limitation in their applicability to automate high-throughput clinical workflows where manual intervention is impractical. Currently, retrieval-augmented approaches address this process by finding similar examples in a support set. Nonetheless, they face a critical challenge that the best semantic matching is often not the best morphological matching, leading to inaccurate prompt generation and poor segmentation. In this work, we propose Morph-RAG-SAM, a trainingfree retrieval-based framework for few-shot medical image segmentation. Our key contribution is a hybrid re-ranking module fusing a robust semantic similarity metric, i.e., Mahalanobis distance, with a morphological similarity score, i.e., dice coefficient, to select superior support exemplary samples. This exemplar is then used to generate a multi-point positive prompt for an initial coarse mask prediction. Then, this initial mask is analyzed to create a prompt constructed from positive and negative points to guide the final refinement step. We successfully demonstrate our contributions through extensive experiments on three public medical datasets: PH2, HAM10000, and ISIC2018. Our proposal significantly improves upon a strong semantic-only retrieval baseline, achieving an increase in Dice score of 15.64% on PH2, 13.42% on HAM10000, and 16.95% on ISIC2018.

    "abstract": "The increasing variability of renewable generation and rising demand pose significant challenges for multi-micro grid operation. This paper proposes an Adaptive Intelligent Renewable Energy Management System (AIREMS), a hierarchical EMS framework that employs a trigger-based load management strategy implemented via reinforcement learning (RL). When a load peak is detected, the system engages the Adaptive Peak Shaving and Coordination (APSC) algorithm to dynamically adjust load shifting, peak shaving, and energy storage dispatch. In the absence of peak events, AIREMS feeds system data into a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm to refine forecasts and load profiles. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of AIREMS in both performance and efficiency, achieving a 30% reduction in total power consumption, improving the system-wide load factor to 0.72, and reducing operating costs and peak demand by 23.8% and 26%, respectively, compared with alternative systems. These results underscore the potential of AIREMS as a scalable and intelligent solution for next-generation energy systems, offering a robust framework for real-time, adaptive, and cost-effective multi-micro grid management."

    "abstract": "With the increasing penetration of Renewable Energy Sources (RESs) into power systems, maintaining the balance between supply and demand has become more challenging due to the inherent variability and uncertainty of these sources. Wind power, in particular, exhibits significantly higher stochasticity and volatility, necessitating reliable forecasting methods for the Independent System Operator (ISO), ensuring supply and demand balance. Traditional point forecasts, such as median-based predictions, are inadequate for capturing the nonstationary and heteroskedastic nature of wind generation. In contrast, quantile forecasts provide upper and lower bounds on expected generation, offering a more robust foundation for operational decision-making. In this work, we propose an Auto-Regressive Quantile Random Forest (ARQRF) regression model for multi-horizon wind power forecasting, covering lead times from day-ahead up to three hours ahead. The model captures temporal dependencies using auto-regressive features, in conjunction with weather-based predictors, to generate quantile-based probabilistic forecasts. These forecasts are intended to assist ISOs in optimal reserve procurement and ramp management. The performance of ARQRF is evaluated using publicly available wind generation data from the California ISO (CAISO) and benchmarked against several state-of-the-art forecasting methods. Results demonstrate that ARQRF delivers superior predictive accuracy while maintaining high computational efficiency."

The main idea is to let the graph component handle the global structure, how sentences are connected, while the neural component focuses on capturing the semantic importance of each sentence. The two scores are then combined using an adaptive fusion rule that maintains a balanced trade-off between coverage and precision. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that Nyx produces concise yet meaningful and readable summaries. It outperforms or matches several well-known extractive systems in terms of relevance and clarity. Moreover, the method remains computationally lightweight and interpretable, making it suitable for real-world applications such as news summarization, research paper screening, and business content analysis."

    "abstract": "Japanese SNS sentiment analysis has broad applications in marketing, public opinion surveys, and mental health support. However, because posts are often short, colloquial, and elliptical, they tend to be misclassified. To address this issue, we propose three methods that incorporate syntactic information into a Japanese BERT classifier. Using the GiNZA dependency parser, we extract four types of syntactic features—POS tags, dependency labels, parent position, and tree depth—and encode them via: (1) an embedding-based method that adds syntactic embeddings, (2) a syntactic positional encoding method that applies sinusoidal encodings to positional information, and (3) a hybrid method that combines these two methods. Experiments on the WRIME ver. 2 dataset show that the embedding variant utilizing POS tags and parent position achieves the best performance in 5-class polarity classification, while the hybrid method combining all syntactic features yields the best results in 8-class emotion classification. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic study demonstrating the effectiveness of syntactic integration for Japanese SNS sentiment analysis and identifying optimal combinations of syntactic features."

Existing Siamese-based and motion-centric methods often require additional parameters and specialized architectures, resulting in high computational demands and failing to fully utilize advancements in 3D object detection. In this paper, we believe that if the search region is sufficiently localized, 3D SOT can be reformulated as a sequential detection problem within these regions. Based on this insight, we propose a novel 3D SOT framework, DetTrack, which comprises two core components: a search region estimator to predict the potential region including tracking target, and a modular 3D detector switcher to integrate pretrained 3D detectors for object localization. Our framework simplifies the tracking pipeline, eliminates the need for specialized 3D SOT models, and significantly reduces computational costs. Furthermore, the 3D detector switcher enables DetTrack to seamlessly integrate various state-of-the-art 3D detectors, making the framework highly adaptable and future-proof. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art 3D SOT methods on multiple datasets while enabling real-time inference speed."

Within this area, the manufacture of other types of transportation equipment is a strategic axis for industrial and technological progress, complementing and strengthening the growth of other productive sectors. However, despite its relevance, a lack of accurate and timely financial information has been identified for companies in this sector, leading to inadequate investment decisions, poor analysis and ineffective planning. This study analyzes the financial risk of 35 companies engaged in this activity, using information corresponding to the year 2023, obtained from the Superintendency of Companies, Securities and Insurance. For the analysis, the Z 1 and Springate models were used for this analysis. The results show that 26 % of the companies are at high risk of bankruptcy according to Altman Z1, while 23 % represent a critical risk according to the Springate model. It is concluded that a significant proportion of the sector faces worrying levels of financial fragility and faces important risks, so urgent measures must be taken to avoid the insolvency of these companies."

    "abstract": "The rapid growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) has led to a significant increase in connected devices, necessitating efficient and scalable solutions for data processing and analysis. Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising approach that enables collaborative training of machine learning (ML) models while preserving data privacy. However, the iterative nature of FL and the resource-constrained environment of edge devices present challenges in terms of energy efficiency, computational overhead, and communication noise. To address these issues, this work proposes an adaptive structured pruning strategy that dynamically prunes and regrows model filters based on the clients’ local accuracy thresholds. By adapting to client-specific communication conditions, such as channel noise and varying signal-to-noise ratios (SNR), the proposed method ensures robust performance and enhanced energy efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate significant energy savings of up to $30 \\%$ and notable model size reductions while maintaining competitive accuracy. These findings validate the efficacy of the approach in optimizing FL for resource-constrained IoT ecosystems."

    "abstract": "The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization has recognized bananas as the fourth-largest food crop in developing countries, with 500 million people worldwide depending on them as a staple food. However, in mountainous and hilly areas where vehicle deployment is challenging, banana transportation from plantations to processing sites mainly relies on manual labor. This transportation method often leads to bruising of the banana fruits, and labor costs are high. Establishing cableways or laying tracks entails significant investment, long construction periods, and low utilization rates. While unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV s) are increasingly used in agricultural production, there is still a lack of practical devices for grabbing and transporting banana bunches with UAVs. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a UAV-based banana bunch grabbing and transporting device, capable of operating in hilly and mountainous banana plantations by relying solely on the UAV platform and its vision system. The design and material selection of the device are discussed, incorporating principles from mechanics, material science, and fluid dynamics to perform relevant calculations. Kinematic simulations were carried out using SolidWorks Motion. Results indicate that the device can grip banana bunches with diameters ranging from 40mm to 172mm, exhibiting smooth movement and uniform speed. Static finite element analysis, conducted using SolidWorks Simulation, demonstrates that the device can stably carry a 30-kg banana bunch even in wind speeds of 20 m/s. Additionally, the paper identifies areas of high stress in the gripping section and proposes optimization solutions. A damage analysis of the gripped banana bunch stalk is also included, showing that the device does not cause destructive damage. Furthermore, modal analysis is conducted to determine the suitable frequency range for the UAV motor. This paper offers potential solutions for UAV -based banana bunch transportation and serves as a reference for the UAV transportation of other fruits, timber, or goods."

Existing graph structures are unable to effectively mine spatio-temporal correlation information or lose a lot of valid information in the modeling process. For this reason, this paper proposes an ultra-short-term regional distributed PV power forecasting method based on two stage clustering and Hierarchical Graph Convolutional Neural network. First, a two-stage clustering method is used to optimize the clustering results on the basis of the existing K-means clustering method to maximize the use of PV power data to mine the deep similarity between PV power stations; then, based on the optimal clustering results, sub-graph and global graph are constructed by taking into account the hierarchical structure of distributed PV systems; finally, a Hierarchical Graph Convolutional Neural network forecasting model is constructed to further mine deep spatio-temporal correlation between PV power stations to achieve ultra-short-term regional distributed PV power forecasting. The superiority of the proposed method is verified by a real dataset in China."

The proposed array's electromagnetic excitation parameters (amplitudes and phases) were iteratively adjusted by coupling the GA with Ansys High Frequency Structure Simulator (HFSS) to minimize a defined objective function. A population of 20 individuals and 200 iterations resulted in 4,000 simulations per objective direction. Convergence analysis considering four beam steering scenarios (0°, 30°, 60°, and 90°) demonstrated the GA's robust capability, achieving significant objective function error reductions ranging from 71% to 81%, with a lower final error of 0.78 for the 0° case. The optimized radiation patterns confirmed effective beam steering and beam forming. This work validates the GA as an efficient tool for complex antenna array optimization, providing reliable setups for practical implementation and contributing to advancements in 5G connectivity and mobile service quality."

    "abstract": "Microwave imaging stands as a promising early cancer detection technique which uses the dielectric tissue contrast between cancerous and normal tissue types with nonionising radiation. The research develops normal breast phantom and tumour constructs from agarose-NaCl-corn oil composites to fulfil the important requirement of realistic phantom development. In this work, dielectric properties of the phantoms were measured through a Keysight N9952A vector network analyser alongside the Keysight N1501 open-ended coaxial probe over the 2-3 GHz frequency range. At 2.5 GHz, clear numerical differences in electromagnetic properties were observed between the phantom, the phantom with tumour content, and the tumour tissue, highlighting their potential for cancer detection. The conductivity of the phantom is 0.45 S/m, while the phantom with tumour content shows a significant increase to about 2.6 S/m. The tumour tissue exhibits the highest conductivity, reaching 3.3 S/m. Similarly, permittivity values follow a comparable trend: the phantom registers 5, the phantom with tumour content 35, and the tumour tissue 55. These substantial differences - up to 7 times higher conductivity and over 10 times higher permittivity in tumour tissue compared to normal phantom - demonstrate a strong dielectric contrast. This quantifiable distinction supports the application of microwave imaging and electromagnetic-based diagnostic techniques for reliable, non-invasive cancer detection and characterisation."

Digital image forensics addresses this challenge by detecting inconsistencies between image content and metadata.

We propose a physics-guided latent triad regression framework that predicts these parameters directly from image pixel content while enforcing exposure value (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$E V$</tex>) consistency through the exposure equation.

Lidar-captured point clouds are crucial for these systems, offering precise spatial data and detailed environmental representations.

However, obtaining real-world data is costly, and capturing specific scenarios, especially dangerous or rare cases, is impractical. As a result, synthetic point cloud generation is emerging as a promising alternative. Despite increasing interest and techniques, there is no comprehensive survey on synthetic point cloud generation for autonomous driving. This article addresses this gap by exploring the challenges in generating synthetic point clouds, outlining the methods used, and cataloging available datasets. This survey aims to provide a foundational understanding of the state of the art in synthetic point cloud generation, promoting further research in this critical area of autonomous driving technology."

Traditional manual identification is slow, errorprone, and dependent on expert knowledge, motivating the need for automated and reliable image-based classification systems. This paper proposes a Multi-Scale Transformer-CNN Fusion framework with Metric Learning for robust medicinal plant identification using the publicly available Kaggle dataset comprising twenty plant species. The model integrates a Swin Transformer to extract global contextual representations and an EfficientNetV2 branch to capture fine-grained local texture information. The outputs from both branches are fused through an attention-based module (CBAM) to emphasize discriminative regions. To enhance class separability, an ArcFace metric-learning layer is incorporated during training. Dimensionality reduction through Principal Component Analysis is applied to reduce redundancy and improve convergence. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that the proposed hybrid model achieved higher accuracy and F1-score than conventional CNNs and transfer-learning approaches, confirming its effectiveness in identifying visually similar medicinal plant species."

The absorber is composed of an array of VO2 resonators, arranged in a periodic pattern on a 50 μ m thick silicon substrate, which is then backed by a thin gold ground plane of 0.2 μ m, Vanadium Dioxide is a classic phase-change material and was chosen for its natural ability to provide a mechanism for actively tunable absorption of the absorber's overall electromagnetic response. However, this study focuses on the device operating in the metallic phase. The underlying electromagnetic characteristics of the design were numerically investigated using the Finite Element Method (FEM) in ANSYS HFSS. Sharply peaked resonances were observed that exhibit a high absorption efficiency of 97.6% for unpolarized light at a resonant frequency of 440 GHz. This strong absorption occurs due to the excitation of coupled electric and magnetic resonances within the VO2 resonator, which results in large ohmic losses within each resonator. The design shows considerable promise as a highly compact, high-performance, and dynamically controllable THz absorption device suitable for different applications."

    "abstract": "Power transformers serve as critical components in electrical transmission networks, continuously exposed to severe electromechanical stresses that lead to winding faults including Axial Displacement (AD), Radial Deformation (RD), and inter-disk Short Circuit (SC). Early detection of these faults is crucial for preventing catastrophic failures and ensuring grid reliability. While Frequency Response Analysis (FRA) has gained global acceptance as a sensitive diagnostic tool, its primary challenge lies in the subjective interpretation of complex frequency responses. This paper presents an automated, quantitative framework that leverages two parallel visualization methodologies: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for optimal feature compression and noise reduction within hybrid amplitude-phase feature space, and Fuzzy Clustering Analysis (FCA) for managing uncertainties in transitional and combined fault conditions. The proposed approach implements a structured two-stage identification process: initially distinguishing healthy from faulty states, followed by specific fault classification. Experimental validation on a 1 MVA transformer under various fault severity levels demonstrates outstanding performance, with PCA and FCA achieving accuracies of 98.9% and 99.0%, respectively. The dual visualization system independently presents results from both methods, significantly reducing dependency on specialized expertise and enabling clearer, more objective interpretation. This research represents a significant step toward standardizing FRA interpretation and offers a practical, reliable solution for transformer condition assessment in industrial applications."

    "abstract": "Tag recommendation systems (TRS) are a crucial component of social and academic platforms, assisting users in efficiently organizing and exploring information. Traditional Collaborative Filtering (CF) methods rely mainly on linear similarity measures such as Cosine or Pearson, which cannot fully capture the complex nonlinear dependencies among users, resources, and tags. This paper proposes a novel model that integrates Distance Correlation (dCor) into CF to detect nonlinear relationships, thereby improving tag recommendation accuracy. dCor, derived from energy statistics, is a powerful measure capable of identifying both linear and nonlinear dependence, with a value of zero if and only if the variables are independent. Unlike traditional similarity measures (Cosine, Pearson) that only capture linear dependencies, dCor is the only measure that satisfies: <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$d \\operatorname{Cor}(X, Y)=0$</tex> if and only if <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$X$</tex> and <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$Y$</tex> are independent. This property is critical for tag recommendation systems, where user-tag and item-tag relationships exhibit complex nonlinear patterns that linear measures completely fail to detect. The proposed model follows a pipeline consisting of data preprocessing, distance correlation computation, neighbor selection, and tag recommendation. Experimental results on the MovieLens-20M dataset with a 5-fold cross-validation setup demonstrate that the proposed EnDist-Tag model achieves Precision =0.4502, Recall =0.2443, F1=0.2458, outperforming baseline methods including UserCF, ItemCF, and Matrix Factorization. These findings confirm that integrating distance correlation significantly enhances tag recommendation quality compared to traditional CF approaches."

VILOD is designed to make the AL process more transparent and steerable, empowering expert users to implement diverse, strategically guided labeling strategies that extend beyond algorithmic query strategies. Through comparative case studies, we evaluate three visually guided labeling strategies against a conventional automated AL baseline. The results show that a balanced, human-guided strategy—leveraging VILOD's visual cues to synthesize information about data structure and model uncertainty—not only outperforms the automated baseline but also achieves the highest overall model performance. These findings emphasize the potential of visually guided, interactive annotation to enhance both the efficiency and effectiveness of dataset creation for OD."

It integrates topographic effects into the heat conduction equation for temperature profiles and treats ice as Rayleigh scatterers to address volume scattering. Channels 4–6 of Juno Microwave Radiometer data, sensitive to the surface diurnal layer, are applied to investigate the microwave emission of bright terrains of Ganymede. Comparisons between observed and simulated brightness temperatures (<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">TBs</i>) reveal no significant Rayleigh volume scattering across 5-22 GHz in either Xibalba Sulcus (XS) or Tros crater.

This challenge is further exacerbated when such audio is affected by compression-induced noise and may also include content generated by unknown models. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework to enhance audio forgery localization by capturing the differences across different forged audio regions and applying distinct strategies to each region. Specifically, we introduce a Cluster-Based Mixture of Experts (CMoE) framework designed to dynamically allocate specialized experts to distinct regions of forged audio. Furthermore, we introduce a learnable masking module to effectively extract robust and generalizable features from large-scale pre-trained models. We also design a group contrastive loss function to enhance the ability to distinguish differences between different audio regions. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves superior performance on generalization and robustness while also effectively localizing forgeries across diverse compression formats and unknown generative models."

We perform single-object calibration on the camera to obtain the internal parameter matrix and distortion coefficient of the single camera. It is a single-camera virtual binocular sensoring vision sensoring system based on reflection, subsequent binocular determination only needs to obtain the rotation matrix and translation vector. The intrinsic parameter matrix and distortion coefficient of the binocular camera should be the parameters of the single camera.

The system establishes an optical link between a Central Station and a Remote Sensor, which includes a LoRaWAN module, a Distributed Feedback Laser (DFB), and a passive photodetector. The LoRa signal, operating in the AU915 band, modulates a 1550 nm optical carrier to transmit sensing data back to the Central Station. Experimental results demonstrate successful bidirectional RoF communication using LoRaWAN with received optical power as low as −55 dBm at both photodetectors. This allows for LoRaWAN transmission over distances exceeding 100 km, significantly greater than the typical 10 km range of wireless-only links. The system was designed to operate with reduced power consumption at the Remote Sensor, enabling an integration with Power-over-Fiber (PoF) technology. Overall, the proposed setup is a reliable and energy-efficient solution for IoT sensing in harsh industrial environments, using a secure optical link that is immune to interference and protected against unauthorized access."

The control design is based on a thorough six-state dynamic model that incorporates the important relationships between pump dynamics, the heart, and the vasculature. In spite of limitations such actuator saturation, simulation findings show that the LQR controller maintains system stability while providing faster and more precise monitoring of physiological reference signals, including step, square, triangle, and sinusoidal waveforms.

This paper develops a comprehensive formulation for the 24-hour dynamic dispatch problem by incorporating probabilistic models of wind and solar generation to properly capture their inherent uncertainties. The proposed model considers practical nonlinear operational constraints of conventional generating units, including valve-point effects, ramp-rate limits, and prohibited operating zones. To efficiently solve the resulting multi-objective optimization problem, an improved particle swarm optimization algorithm with enhanced local–global search capabilities and entropy-based Pareto sorting is introduced. The algorithm aims to simultaneously minimize fuel cost and pollutant emissions while ensuring system reliability. Benchmark tests on standard 6-unit, 10-unit, and 30-unit systems demonstrate that the enhanced PSO achieves fast convergence and superior solution quality compared to conventional evolutionary techniques. The results further highlight the significant impact of renewable energy penetration on optimal dispatch schedules and overall generation cost, validating the effectiveness of the proposed optimization framework for next-generation power system operation."

The model is trained on a dataset comprising pressure and velocity fields generated from high-fidelity CFD simulations across a variety of building designs and wind parameters like velocity and direction, including some building layouts from the NUST campus. Geometry is encoded using signed distance functions, and inlet flow conditions are explicitly conditioned to allow generalization across varying scenarios. The trained model accurately predicts flow fields around unseen geometries with MAE 0.032 and MSE 0.002, demonstrating its potential as a fast surrogate for early-stage urban design and building aerodynamic assessments."

This iterative procedure allows the network to progressively refine temporal representations and capture higherorder dependencies in highly non-stationary and noisy signals. The method is evaluated on a challenging synthetic dataset designed to mimic the degradation of milling machines, capturing phenomena such as exponential amplitude growth, nonlinear frequency drift, impulsive tool impacts, and strong stochastic noise. Experimental results demonstrate that the REXpandedLSTM outperforms conventional LSTM models, achieving a root mean squared error of 0.201 compared to 0.253, a mean absolute error of 0.185 compared to 0.236, and an $R^{2}$ of −4.43 compared to −7.61. The predictions closely follow the true Health Index (HI) trajectories and exhibit stable convergence across training rounds. The framework achieves these improvements without requiring extensive preprocessing or manual feature engineering, offering a robust and generalizable approach for sequential time-series prediction in milling machine prognostics, condition monitoring, and other data-driven modeling applications."

    "abstract": "The triethylene glycol (TEG) dehydration system is an integral component of the natural gas processing flow, and its proper functioning is essential for maintaining the efficiency and stability of the overall process. Any failure within this system can have substantial and detrimental effects on the entire natural gas processing operation. To overcome the limitations of traditional diagnostic methods, such as incomplete fault identification, lack of probabilistic quantification, and difficulty in tracing causal factors, this study proposes an advanced fault diagnosis approach based on fault tree analysis (FTA) and fuzzy Bayesian networks (FBN). Initially, a fault tree model is constructed utilizing process knowledge and expert insights to identify potential failure modes. Subsequently, the mapping relationship between the fault tree model and the Bayesian network is established to define the network's structure. To address the uncertainty inherent in expert judgments, fuzzy set theory is employed to derive the prior probabilities for basic events. The conditional probability tables of the Bayesian network are then determined through logic gates, completing the parameter learning phase. Forward inference of the Bayesian network reveals a current fault probability of 0.79, indicating a high likelihood of system failure, which necessitates enhanced operational and maintenance efforts. Additionally, backward inference pinpoints TEG foaming and improper human operations as the primary contributors to the elevated risk. Sensitivity analysis further identifies the most probable causal chains of events. In conclusion, the proposed fuzzy Bayesian network-based fault diagnosis approach provides a robust and accurate methodology for identifying critical fault factors and causal relationships, offering valuable support for accident prevention and informed maintenance decisionmaking. This approach holds significant practical implications for engineering operations and maintenance management."

Although deep learning and other machine learning models have significantly improved diabetes diagnosis and prediction accuracy, their black-box nature limits interpretability and trust among healthcare professionals. This study introduces a Feature Interaction and Rule-based Explainability (FIRE) framework that combines the predictive accuracy of a Deep Neural Network (DNN) with the interpretability of an XGBoost surrogate model. The proposed approach uses polynomial feature transformations and attention mechanisms to capture nonlinear interactions among features.

    "abstract": "Accurate and optimized localization of the target position in an unknown environment remains a challenging problem, particularly when considering cost-effectiveness and computational efficiency in large environments. Although optimized localization can be achieved using a multi-sensor mobile robot, it increases both system cost and computational complexity. To address these challenges, a mobile robot is developed to determine destination positions using only LiDAR sensors reliably. A robust approach is proposed to build the map and navigate the mobile robot in unknown environments. This approach employs a combination of Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) and a path planning technique, known as Simultaneous Path Planning, Localization, and Mapping (SPLAM), which integrates Graph-SLAM as the SLAM method with the D* (improved A* for dynamic environments) path planning algorithm. A ROS-based system and a real-time embedded system are developed to achieve the desired results. Simulated results are implemented in Robotic Operating system (ROS) with Noetic version, and successfully integrating mapping and target localization within an unknown environment. It effectively combines map construction and goal-reaching using LiDAR data. In parallel, a real-time robotic platform is also designed to implement the SPLAM framework in a real environment with an area of 25×40 feet, enabling simultaneous path planning, localization, and mapping in dynamic and real-world conditions."

    "abstract": "Nowadays, there are various proposals to promote the use of alternative energies globally. In this regard, wind turbines present a prominent option because they are a clean and renewable energy source, which contributes to reducing environmental impact. Wind turbines are systems that convert the wind's kinetic energy into electrical energy; however, for efficient performance, the system must be in healthy condition. Therefore, it is important to have monitoring and diagnostic strategies in place to detect wind turbine failures. This paper presents a proposal for the characterization of blade fracture failures in low-power wind turbines. The proposal is based on the use of Hjorth parameters (HPs) to analyze triaxial vibration signals. A multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) and comparison of means are performed to statistically validate the HPs' ability to characterize the signals. An experimental validation of the proposal was performed with a low-power wind turbine in a controlled environment with a wind tunnel, where different levels of failure severity were analyzed (healthy, light, intermediate and severe). The results show the effectiveness of HPs as indicators capable of characterizing vibration signals according to the case studies considered."

The simulation results show that the proposed approach enables early and accurate fault detection, which contributes to improving the operational reliability of the system."

An experimental evaluation is conducted to assess the performance, where the results show competitive accuracy of 95.8% for counting, along with profound results for detection and tracking metrics noted.

This paper proposes an optimization-based power flow control strategy for offshore wind farms to minimize active transmission losses. The approach integrates the New-ton-Raphson power flow algorithm with an optimization function, adjusting reactive power outputs of individual turbines. Two topologies, star and radial, were assessed under varying loading conditions. Results show that the method shifts reactive power support from the onshore grid to the turbines, decreasing reactive power at the connection point by about 30% in both topologies without increasing overall system consumption. This internal compensation improves voltage profiles and operational security. Additionally, active power losses were reduced by up to 29.84% in the star topology and 28.03% in the radial topology under low-load scenarios, with higher relative savings at lower generation levels."

    "abstract": "The use of cloud resources, such as virtual machines or containers, has been rapidly increasing. Consequently, the environmental impact of cloud data centres is becoming a major issue. On the enterprises’ side, the massive use of cloud services induces high financial costs. One way to reduce both the environmental and financial costs of cloud services is to optimize reserved resources. Major cloud providers propose autoscaling methods that automatically add or remove resources based on the current or predicted load, but these might cause issues when the workload varies rapidly. Other approaches make long-term resource reservation plans, often based on forecasting. However, long-term forecasting is a difficult task. Moreover, sporadic usage spikes might be observed, yet models are unable to predict them. The proposed approach handles this issue by giving a description of the different states of the workload based on HMM clustering. The use of periodic time variables such as the hour of the day or the day of the week allows the model to recommend weekly resource reservation plans. Experiments on simulated data show that the method is able to describe periodic and aperiodic behaviours in an accurate yet understandable way."

This paper targets Correlation Power Analysis (CPA) [7], a type of side-channel attacks, and proposes a dedicated hardware design for AES that is effective against attacks on the last-round. The paper demonstrates that the proposed approach is highly effective against CPA-based last-round attacks while achieving implementation with significantly lower overhead compared to the WDDL [9] countermeasure. In the evaluation presented in this paper, it was demonstrated that the proposed design method, when applied to a dedicated AES hardware design without countermeasures, incurs virtually no overhead in combinational logic, introduces approximately 12 % overhead in register utilization, and is capable of almost completely preventing secret key leakage through side-channels against CPA-based last-round attacks."

All methods include a 10–500 Hz bandpass prefilter. These techniques are compared using experimental superficial electromyographic (sEMG) data. The results show that wavelet achieves optimal harmonic suppression (- 60.4684 dB), while spectral substraction best preserves temporal features (RMSE = 0.013) with the lowest computational load.

To this end, the NSGA-II algorithm is employed to optimize both the network architecture—namely, the number of radial basis functions—and the corresponding network parameters. By leveraging a tailored chromosome encoding strategy in conjunction with a rigorously formulated objective function, the algorithm effectively determines the optimal number of basis functions and their associated parameters, thereby improving MPPT efficiency. The case study focuses on a standalone PV system comprising a Kyocera KC200GT PV module supplying a resistive load through a boost converter.

As molecules pass through the pore, they change the ionic current, producing a very small signal (<1 nA). Since translocation events are very short, a large BW(>MHz) is required in the sensing circuit [1]. Another example is scanning ion conductance microscopy, where a pipettewith an opening of a fewhundred nanometers is scanned over a small object (e.g., a cell or bacterium). The ionic current (hundres of pA) through the pipette varies with the object’s distance, thus a topographical image can be generated. To achieve high scan rates, a large BW(>100kHz) is required in the analog sensing front-end [2]."

The conventional communication protocols, such as ZigBee offer energy efficiency but is not always effective in supporting tight latency constraints in high mobility and traffic congestion. The work introduces the architecture and analysis of a low-latency data transmission system with an optimized MQTT-SN protocol, augmented with the packet aggregation and priority-based scheduling, dynamic channel allocation and cross-layer optimization. The proposed system is verified by extensive MATLAB simulations and testbed experiments on ESP32. Findings show that the reduction in latency is up to 60% over that of ZigBee with an average delay of 18.6 ms at 10 nodes and 69.1 ms at 100 nodes. Throughput is increased by 10-15, and MQTT-SN with optimization attains 430.7 kbps at 500 kbps load or less. A packet delivery ratio (PDR) of over 97% is ensured at low mobility and 86.9% even at <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$5 ~\\mathrm{m} / \\mathrm{s}$</tex> mobility speeds. Consumption of energy per packet is cut by 25 to 30% and jitter is less than 15 ms, guaranteeing predictable performance of control. The general accuracy of the system expressed as the percentage of successful and timely packet transmissions had an average of 96.4% which was higher than the 89.5% observed in the ZigBee system. The solution proposed has better control of latency, reliability and efficiency, which has made it very appropriate to use in applications of mobile sensors that require latency control. Such results indicate its capability to be applied in actual smart environments."

    "abstract": "Remote sensing Change Detection (RSCD) is a critical research direction in the field. Recently, Vision foundation models (VFMs) (such as Fast Segment Anything Model, FastSAM) have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in image segmentation tasks. SAM-CD employs a FastSAM-based encoder (pre-trained on large-scale vision datasets) to extract multi-scale features from bi-temporal images independently, followed by feature fusion prior to final interpretation, generating high-precision change detection results. However, current research in change detection has not adequately explored the utilization of features extracted from VFMs. Therefore, this study proposes the DDSAM-CD model, which primarily consists of a dense feature aggregation network (DFAN) and a differential enhancement network (DEN). The DFAN comprehensively fuses multi-scale features derived from FastSAM. In the DEN, bi-temporal features are first differentially fused to capture temporal change information. Subsequently, low-scale features extracted by FastSAM are incorporated and fused with the differential features through multi-scale feature integration. The optimized differential enhancement module significantly improves edge-region accuracy while resolving scale discrepancies, thereby delivering more reliable results for change detection tasks. The quantitative and qualitative analyses demonstrate that the proposed DDSAM model outperforms state-of-the-art RSCD methods on both the LEVIR-CD and WHU-CD datasets. Specifically, DDSAM achieved Precision, Recall, F1-score, and mIoU values of 93.79%, 90.97%, 92.38%, and 92.37% on LEVIR-CD, respectively; corresponding metrics on WHU-CD were 92.93%, 88.72%, 90.79%, and 91.24%. Additionally, the DDSAM model has achieved significant improvements in the accurate identification of edge regions."

    "abstract": "Centrifugal pumps are essential assets in industrial installation, where they support continuous dynamic operation in manufacturing processes, power plant, water distribution system facilities. In a small and medium scale industries, pump failure/faults are often detected only after noticeable performance deterioration, resulting in increased unplanned down time, energy consumption and higher operational risks. Traditional fault predictive maintenance strategies typically rely on single-sensor vibration analysis or standalone statistical indicators, which tend to lose reliability when nonlinear behaviour arises from coupled hydraulic and electrical interactions. To overcome this limitations, this study proposes a Hybrid Wiener–Hammerstein ensemble method for predictive maintenance (HWE–PM) that integrate physical system dynamics with data driven learning approach. The primary premise is that incipient faults are reflected not only in conventional signal features but also in structured residual patterns that signify deviation from normal operating conditions. A nonlinear-linear-Wiener-Hammerstein representation is employed to organize time and frequency domain information while an ensemble of heterogeneous classifiers–Random Forest (RF), XGBoost and <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">k</i>-Nearest Neighbours (kNN) is used to learn fault specific decision boundaries. The probabilistic output of these base learners is subsequently combined through a logistic regression meta learner using cross validated stacking, maximizing prediction stability under various operating conditions. The proposed work is evaluated using synthetic multimodal dataset developed to emulate the operating characteristics of a Crompton Greaves CG-IPM-15, three phase centrifugal pump and instrumented with 26 sensing channels. The HWE-PM model achieves an overall classification accuracy of 97.6% with a low false alarm rate of 2.3%, outperforming all individual base classifiers. The results demonstrate effective discrimination among multiple degradation modes, including bearing wear, aging of insulation, impeller imbalance and cavitation. Further implementation and model deployment on Jetson Nano and ESP32 edge devices confirms the feasibility of real time fault monitoring environment. Overall, the proposed HWE-PM based framework offers an interpretable and scalable predictive maintenance solution aligned with the requirement of Industry 4.0 environments."

    "abstract": "Parallel Concatenated Block (PCB) codes are conventionally constituted by two identical linear systematic block codes, as component codes, linked by an interleaver. In general, the interleaver length of the PCB code (or message length) is the square of the message length of the constituent codes. This feature enables the interleaver to distribute bits from a message block across various interleaved blocks. Such a permutation process is not achievable from a PCB code whose interleaver length is shorter than the square of the message length of its component codes. As more than one bit of a message block is placed at an interleaved block, the minimum weight of the PCB code can be obtained from messages with weight greater than one. Such a structure will consequently deteriorate the PCB code's error-correcting performance. To overcome this problem, the paper presents a new scheme of interleavers for PCB codes, whose lengths are multiples but not squares of the message length of PCB's component codes. A permutation algorithm is implemented based on the low-weight distribution of component codes to ensure that the PCB code has an outstanding error-correcting capability. Indeed, the interleaver rearranges message bits such that the minimum weight of the PCB code is obtained from messages with weight one. The analysis and simulation results confirmed that the newly proposed interleaver outperforms the conventional interleavers for PCB codes. The improvement is achieved at medium to high signal-to-noise ratios, where the code's error floor is encountered. It is also concluded that PCB codes constructed using the proposed interleaver outperform the well-known Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC)-polar codes used in global standards. This is evident for long-length-based codes."

    "abstract": "This work presents a comparative electromagnetic analysis of two horn antennas designed for C-band operation, both sharing the same Computer-Aided Design (CAD) geometry but fabricated with different materials. The first antenna, serving as a reference, was machined from aluminum, while the second was manufactured from ABS thermoplastic using Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) 3D printing technology. Numerical simulations were conducted in ANSYS HFSS to evaluate key performance indicators, including reflection coefficient, gain across frequency, beamwidth, and operational bandwidth. Following simulation, the ABS antenna prototype was internally coated with a high-adhesion conductive silver-based paint to enable high-frequency operation. Practical measurements were then performed on the ABS prototype, including a 5G signal transmission test using the aluminum antenna as the transmitter and the ABS antenna as the receiver. The experimental setup ensured direct line-of-sight between antennas. The study assesses both simulated and measured results, highlighting the influence of the material on antenna performance. The findings demonstrate that, with proper internal coating, polymer-based antennas can approximate the electromagnetic behavior of metallic counter-parts, offering a viable alternative for rapid prototyping and testing in C-band communication scenarios."

Traditional manual debugging and testing are inefficient, high-risk in harsh environments, and inaccurate in fault localization. To address these issues, this paper proposes an automatic debugging method for power equipment PCBs using multi-modal Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) inspection data. A UAV system with multiple sensors collects visible light, thermal imaging, and vibration data, which is processed via a fusion model integrating deep learning and classic computer vision. An automated workflow for fault detection, localization, and debugging is developed, verified through laboratory and on-site tests. This strategy enhances automation and fault detection accuracy, filling the gap of integrating UAV remote sensing, multi-modal data processing, and PCB-specific debugging."

    "abstract": "The accelerating global shift toward clean and sustainable energy has catalyzed the evolution of power systems from centralized architectures to decentralized energy models, particularly through the emergence of virtual power plants and small-scale embedded generation, including rooftop solar PV installations and distributed micro-generators. These decentralized systems play a pivotal role in reducing carbon emissions and enhancing flexibility, resilience, and responsiveness of modern power grids. The integration into legacy distribution networks originally built for one-way, centralized power delivery, presents series of technical and operational challenges. High penetration of distributed energy resources decentralized energy resources introduces bidirectional power flows, voltage instability, and grid management complexities, especially in systems not designed for such dynamic behavior. This paper conducts a comprehensive technical evaluation of decentralized generation integration within a distribution network using DIgSILENT PowerFactory application. The study focuses on critical performance metrics including power flow characteristics, and system reliability, comparing scenarios with and without the presence of small-scale embedded generation. The results underscore both the transformative potential and systemic limitations of decentralized energy resources integration, offering insights into practical strategies for modernizing distribution networks to accommodate a more virtual, sustainable, and smarter energy future."

    "abstract": "Reliable fault detection in ac microgrids is challenging because of dynamic changes brought by distributed generations as well as varying grid/isolated modes. This paper proposes an enhanced differential admittance-based relaying scheme for fault detection in ac microgrids. Differential admittance (DA) is computed from positive-sequence voltage and current phasors retrieved from both line ends. The absolute value of the Derivative of the Differential Admittance Angle (DADA) is calculated using DA information. It captures sharp transients at fault inception and can be suitably incorporated as a fault indicator enabling fast and robust detection. In our proposed algorithm, a two-bus equivalent model establishes the mathematical framework and evaluates fault scenarios. The devised scheme is implemented and tested for a microgrid testbed integrated with the utility grid, wind farms, solar PV, transformers, and loads. Simulation results show that the DADA index improves sensitivity, enhances fault detection under high-resistance faults, and ensures reliable operation in both grid-connected and islanded modes with variable DG penetration. Compared to existing protection algorithms, our proposed technique demonstrates superior adaptability and robustness, making it a promising solution for microgrid fault detection."

Mostly existing work employs the the first-order measurement difference method to resolve the colored noise. In this paper, we augment the colored measurement noise onto the system state vector to whiten the colored noise. To handle the heavy-tailed noise in state model, we model it as the Student’s t distribution, and it is decomposed into a hierarchical Gaussian structure of Gaussian distribution and Gamma distribution. Subsequently, the variational Bayesian method combined with the inverse Wishart prior describing the uncertainty of the scale matrix, is used to achieve the joint posterior estimate of the system state. Then a variational Bayesian and augmented state (VB-AS) joint estimation algorithm is proposed for the state estimate of dynamic system with colored heavy-tailed noise. Illustrative examples verify the validness of the proposed algorithm."

Task offloading has become increasingly crucial for accelerating execution, minimizing latency, and conserving energy. Task execution and efficient resource use enhance the Quality of Service (QoS). So, researchers have proposed heuristic and rule-based dynamic offloading policies. However, they typically fail to balance exploring multiple solution spaces and using high-quality solutions, resulting in imbalanced task allocation convergence.

Initially, a detailed road surface profile is created by combining five successive LiDAR scans within a sliding window. Building 3D point cloud data (PCD) is an efficient way to identify a road’s profile. The YOLO model is used to identify several types of road faults, including cracks, potholes, and ruts. The GPS sensor provides precise geographic coordinates in the form of latitude and longitude for the detected problems, which is useful for future maintenance and fixing.

    "abstract": "Graph mining has become increasingly important in domains such as social network analysis and bioinformatics. Processing-in-memory (PIM) offers high parallelism and reduces costly data transfers by performing logical operations directly in memory. A hybrid architecture combining content-addressable memory (CAM) and PIM leverages the strengths of both, delivering improvements in performance and energy efficiency. However, real-world graphs are highly irregular, and mapping them onto fixed-size PIM arrays leads to underutilized computing resources, limiting overall efficiency. In this work, we remove the fixed-size constraint at the hardware level and propose two task scheduling strategies that adapt dynamically to varying PIM array sizes, significantly improving graph mining throughput. Furthermore, while prior implementations on this hybrid architecture were limited to k-clique counting, we extend its applicability by implementing an enumeration and counting algorithm for sub-graphs with a central node. Experimental results show that our scheduling strategies achieve an average speedup of 3.0 × over the baseline on k- clique counting, while our new algorithm broadens the range of supported graph mining tasks."

    "abstract": "Optimizing the operation of heating, ventilation, and air Conditioning (HVAC) systems is crucial for improving energy efficiency, enhancing user comfort, and maximizing system performance. This paper proposes a machine learning (ML)-based method that leverages environmental sensor data to predict high room occupancy, enabling more efficient HVAC operation. It integrates multiple ML techniques to enhance energy efficiency by minimizing HVAC operation in unoccupied spaces while maintaining occupant comfort. The methodology involves using sensor readings, such as temperature, humidity, light, and CO<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</inf> levels to improve occupancy detection accuracy. It exploits advanced techniques such as synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE)-Tomek for data balancing, eXtreme Gradient Boosting for robust classification, multi-layer artificial neural networks (ML-ANN) for capturing nonlinear relationships, and long short-term memory (LSTM) models for time-series forecasting. To further improve prediction accuracy, a probabilistic voting classifier is implemented by combining the predictions of the above individual models, leveraging a soft voting mechanism to generate more reliable occupancy forecasts. The results show that the proposed solution achieves highly competitive performance on a publicly available dataset. Index Terms-Ensemble learning, HVAC, machine learning, time series analysis."

A high-fidelity simulation framework is proposed and validated, which leverages the ANSYS High-Frequency Structure Simulator (HFSS) for electromagnetic scattering analysis, integrated with MATLAB for subsequent signal processing and image formation. The study systematically investigates the influence of five distinct geometric and material configurations using a detailed 3D F16 aircraft model. Results demonstrate that target geometry, surface shape, and material reflectivity are the primary determinants of image clarity and recognition capability. The analysis successfully quantifies dominant scattering centers, identifying the engine ducts as the source of the peak backscatter intensity of 14.591 kW/m<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> at a range of 0.6 meters. The findings confirm that high-resolution ISAR imagery is contingent upon precise target design, with the final optimized model achieving superior performance through strategic manipulation of component size and surface structure.

    "abstract": "On-chip learning is the most advantageous feature of spiking neural networks (SNNs) that allows realizing lowpower artificial intelligence (AI) systems, especially for the edge computing technique and edge AI devices. Although there is still no principal learning method for SNNs, the spike timingdependent plasticity (STDP) learning rule is the most popular. Most implementations of the method predominantly defined synapses as conductors. This approach results in common on-chip training designs for digital systems that typically require finite state machines (FSMs) and look-up tables (LUTs), which evaluate and update the values of all neurons and synapses within a neural network. This combination limits the responding time of an SNN. An auto-plasticity synapse, which defines plasticity based on spike-time delay and independently controls this property, offers a solution to address this limitation. In this work, we proposed a 4-layer fully-connected SNN that uses 96 auto-plasticity synapses to validate this new type of synapse. This network synthesized into a <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{2 8}-\\mathbf{n m}$</tex> field-programmable gate array (FPGA) Cyclone V with just 14.5 % of resources, allowing the making of an edge AI system on a chip (SoC).

Simulations are carried out using MATLAB with Simulink over Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) and fading channels (Rician and Rayleigh) for different values of the Energy per Bit to Noise Power Spectral Density Ratio $\\left(E_{b} / N_{0}\\right)$. The system is analyzed under spatial multiplexing conditions to evaluate the impact of noise and fading on signal quality.

The proton therapy market size is expected to keep growing in the next decade, but the size and initial cost still need to face challenges. High Temperature Superconductors (HTS) could be a possible way to enable particle treatment with a reduction of the facility size and the operational costs. However, the extraction of Rare-Earth materials such as the ones used for the most commercialized HTS tapes is extremely pol luting if compared to copper. In that sense, when designing a mag net for an emerging technology, it is important to minimize the environment impact by minimizing the size of the coil. This paper, with the help of a case study, aims at showing how the CO<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>-eq emissions can change as a function of design parameters, such as the current margin and the operative temperature.

Accurate and timely flood mapping is critical for informed emergency response and disaster risk management. While deep learning has significantly advanced flood area segmentation using remote sensing imagery, traditional methods rely on centralized data aggregation, posing substantial challenges due to privacy restrictions, data heterogeneity, and data ownership concerns. This paper presents a federated learning (FL) framework for robust flood segmentation across distributed, multisource remote sensing data. By enabling multiple institutions to collaboratively train models without exchanging raw data, the proposed system preserves data privacy while leveraging the diversity of geographically and sensor-varied datasets. Experimental results show that our federated approach achieves segmentation performance comparable to centralized training and generalizes better across unseen domains. This framework lays the foundation for scalable, privacy-preserving, and operationally viable flood mapping, especially in data-sensitive environments."

This study evaluates the websites of 14 Malaysian state public libraries using a checklist-based Web Content Analysis (WCA) under seven categories: accessibility, navigation and links, authority and currency, general information, user support and resource discovery tools, services, and Web 2.0 tools. The results show that overall performance is moderate, with Kuala Lumpur, Selangor, and Sabah achieving the highest compliance, while Perlis, Perak, Pulau Pinang, and Johor lag behind. Strengths include universal WebOPAC adoption, integration of social media platforms such as Facebook and Instagram, and consistent copyright/domain authority. Weaknesses include poor update practices, limited disability features, absence of fair use policies, and minimal adoption of interactive tools such as live chat and feedback systems. The findings highlight that while Malaysian public library websites provide basic access and visibility, they underutilize features essential for inclusivity, interactivity, and user education. This study recommends standardizing website development, enhancing accessibility, and integrating user-centered policies to optimize digital platforms and improve remote library services."

    "abstract": "Crowdfunding is a fundraising process by which money is raised from many people. Each person donates a relatively smaller amount. This is typically done through the online medium. Many crowdfunding sites support donation for humanitarian purposes. These face challenges due to lack of transparency, presence of intermediaries, and centralization. This problem in crowdfunding is solved through the combination of Blockchain Technology and the ‘Model View Controller’ architecture. We conducted a literature review to analyze the reported challenges of Nonprofit Organizations (NPOs). These challenges are validated through a survey among NPOs in Pakistan. The proposed solution overcomes majority of the problems identified in our survey. The smart contracts ensure that all the donations are received directly in NPOs. These Organizations can further use the donations for buying products from allocated ‘E-stores’. Each transaction would be stored in the decentralized ledger. The donors can track the spending of NPOs based on their donation. The ‘MVC architecture’ ensures that there is ‘maintainability’ and ‘separations of the concerns’ as the ‘Blockchain Technology’ is evolving continuously."

    "abstract": "Rural roads are vital for the transportation of persons and goods, but are vulnerable to animal-vehicle collisions, which cause substantial environmental, economic and public health impacts every year. WiFi sensing has recently emerged as a cost-effective approach to detect hazardous situations on roads, overcoming some limitations of traditional monitoring systems. However, scaling WiFi sensing to cover long road sections introduces challenges, including interference between WiFi nodes and with other protocols operating in the same Industrial, Scientific, and Medical (ISM) bands, such as IEEE 802.15.4. In this work, we present a scalable, low-cost architecture for WiFi-based monitoring of rural roads. We develop and optimize machine learning models for real-time detection and classification of pedestrians, vehicles, and animals using low-cost IoT devices, achieving over 95% accuracy and a miss rate of only 0.7%. We evaluate the models under varied conditions, including different sensor distances, light rain, and previously unseen rural locations, demonstrating robustness across environmental variations. Additionally, we conduct network simulations to assess the coexistence of WiFi sensing with IEEE 802.15.4 communications and perform LoRaWAN experiments in rural environments to validate long-range data transmission. We also release an open dataset containing all evaluated scenarios to support reproducibility and further research. Our results confirm the feasibility of the proposed system in terms of sensing accuracy, network performance, and deployment cost."

Drawing upon the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) as the theoretical foundation, this study employs a quantitative approach to examine the influence of Starbucks mobile applications, loyalty programs, and brand image on customer loyalty. All data was acquired from 355 valid respondents and then used SEM-PLS for further examination. The findings demonstrate that loyalty programs significantly influence customer loyalty, while brand image does not have a significant effect on customer loyalty. Mobile applications, however, have a significant impact on brand image and customer loyalty, indicating an important role. These results highlight the theoretical contribution of extending TAM into the context of mobile applications and loyalty programs in the coffee shop industry, as well as providing practical insights for enhancing customer loyalty. The study suggests that coffee shops can strengthen business sustainability by mobile applications, offering excellent service, and implementing loyalty programs. This study provides both theoretical and practical implications, encouraging future strategies to improve competitive advantage and overall business performance."

However, these frameworks struggle in cluttered environments primarily because they utilize auxiliary modules for low-level motion planning and control. Motion planning remains challenging due to the high dimensionality of the robot’s configuration space and the presence of workspace obstacles. Neural motion planners have enhanced motion planning efficiency by offering fast inference and effectively handling the inherent multi-modality of the motion planning problem. Despite such benefits, current neural motion planners often struggle to generalize to unseen, out-of-distribution planning settings. This paper reviews and analyzes the state-of-the-art neural motion planners, highlighting both their benefits and limitations. It also outlines a path toward establishing generalist neural motion planners capable of handling domain-specific challenges.

The cobalt-catalyzed CL method provided higher signal output about 85–90 a.u. with a linear range of 0.1–0.9mM, a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.0131mM (13 μM), and a limit of quantification LOQ of 0.043mM (43μM). In contrast, graphite electrode–based ECL achieved linear detection range 0.4–0.9mM, an LOD of 0. 036mM (36 μM) and an LOQ of 0.120mM (120 μM). The time analysis further revealed rapid emission and falloff kinetics, necessary for accurate quantification.

To address these issues, we propose a contrastive-based method called <bold xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">P</b>seudo-Label <bold xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">S</b>imilarity <bold xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">G</b>raph-driven Multi-<bold xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">V</b>iew <bold xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">C</b>lustering (PSGVC). Specifically, to uncover the potential semantic relationships between samples, we construct a pseudo-label similarity graph based on the consensus representation. Then, we design a similarity graph-based contrastive loss, which utilizes the pseudo-label similarity graph as a global supervision signal to guide the optimization of cross-view embedded representation, thereby indirectly improving the quality of consensus representation. Additionally, we propose a weighted cluster-aware contrastive loss to align the consensus representation with view-specific representation. It leverages the cluster structure contained in the pseudo-label similarity graph to achieve cluster-level contrastive learning, further enhancing the quality of the consensus representation. Extensive experimental results show that our PSGVC achieves state-of-the-art clustering performance across multiple datasets."

    "abstract": "This paper introduces an innovative adaptive scoring framework for children with Neurodevelopmental Disorders (NDD) that integrates multiple metrics, such as spatial attention patterns, temporal engagement, and game performance data, to provide a comprehensive assessment of learning that extends beyond traditional game scoring. The framework employs a progressive difficulty adaptation method that focuses on specific stimuli at each level and dynamically adjusts weights to accommodate increasing cognitive load and learning complexity. Additionally, it includes capabilities for temporal analysis, such as detecting engagement periods, rewarding sustained attention, and implementing an adaptive multiplier framework based on performance levels. To avoid over-rewarding high performers while maximizing improvement potential for struggling students, the designed framework features an adaptive temporal impact framework that adjusts performance scales accordingly. We also established a multi-metric validation framework using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Pearson correlation, and Spearman correlation, along with defined quality thresholds, to assess deployment readiness in educational settings. This research bridges the gap between technical eye-tracking metrics and educational insights by explicitly mapping attention patterns to learning behaviors, enabling actionable pedagogical interventions."

    "abstract": "With the rapid growth of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, securing their communication and authentication has become a critical challenge. Traditional authentication methods struggle in heterogeneous IoT systems due to incompatibility with diverse devices, reliance on centralized models, costly cryptographic operations, and issues with scalability, trust, and single points of failure. To address these challenges, this paper presents a decentralized authentication framework for IoT nodes based on blockchain technology and digital certificates. In this approach, each IoT device is equipped with a digital certificate that authenticates its identity, while the blockchain is used to securely validate these certificates in a decentralized manner. A lightweight blockchain architecture employing a Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism is proposed to validate nodes’ certificates. The consensus is conducted on these certificates, with blocks created and appended to the chain, reducing the computational and storage overhead of traditional blockchains. By leveraging blockchain’s immutability and transparency, the system enhances IoT node authentication security and integrity while minimizing resource consumption and delays. Designed for heterogeneous IoT systems, the architecture ensures seamless communication, security, scalability, and efficiency."

To address this, we propose HaarReformer, a single-stage low-light enhancement network that integrates Haar wavelets with a lightweight Transformer architecture. To improve computational efficiency, an illumination-guided cross-channel context aggregation module is introduced, which fuses cross-channel context with expanded receptive fields to enhance self-attention, striking a balance between global modeling and computational overhead while achieving linear complexity. For high-frequency information preservation, we construct a Haar wavelet-based downsampling scheme with multi-scale invertible decomposition, enabling representative feature learning. Furthermore, an ultralightweight dynamic upsampling module is introduced for efficient feature reconstruction, leveraging a learnable point sampling mechanism within a plug-and-play framework. Experimental results validate that HaarReformer effectively enhances low-light images with low computational overhead, while demonstrating superior performance in preserving color fidelity, structural integrity, and textural details."

    "abstract": "Although deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved remarkable success in computer vision, they remain vulnerable to adversarial examples. Numerous studies have evaluated the robustness of vision models, but most generate adversarial images by adding perturbations to transformed inputs (i.e., post-transformation). A recent study investigated a more realistic setting, where perturbations are applied to raw inputs before transformation and model prediction (i.e., pre-transformation). The results suggest that models are generally more robust in this setting, as attackers lack information about the transformation and can only access the raw image, making it more challenging to generate effective perturbations. However, prior work has not provided a comprehensive evaluation across diverse models and attack types. In this paper, we evaluate the robustness of vision models against diverse adversarial attacks under both posttransformation and pre-transformation settings. Experiments on various models and attack methods, including both white-box and black-box attacks, demonstrate that vision models are highly vulnerable to perturbations crafted by white-box attacks under any setting. In contrast, the effectiveness of black-box methods is significantly reduced when shifting from post-transformation to pre-transformation. Notably, vision models suffer no damage from frame-based attacks when perturbations are applied only to raw input images."

Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) can serve as an aerial Base Station (BS) and provide coverage to locations where the Line of Sight (LoS) communication link between users and BS is hindered by obstacles. UAVs offer flexibility, and careful trajectory planning enhances their Energy Efficiency (EE). This work focuses on maximizing the EE of a UAV communication system incorporating IRS in a Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) framework by jointly optimizing user power, phase shifts of IRS, and UAV trajectory using the Sequential Convex Approximation (SCA) method.

Here, we present FingerWrap, a high-density pneumatic pin-array display that wraps around the finger and activates the widely distributed mechanoreceptors. FingerWrap uses 337 pins arranged at 13 pins/cm<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$^{2}$</tex-math></inline-formula>, which cover the ventral, dorsal, and lateral surfaces of the finger up to 45mm from the fingertip, enabling precise spatiotemporal stimulation across continuous regions of the finger skin. Across six perceptual experiments, we show that FingerWrap can provide tactile experiences that ventral-only displays cannot achieve. These include the discrimination of stimulus locations and motion trajectories across multiple regions of the finger skin, the recognition of three-dimensional shape features, and the perception of realistic resistance when the finger is immersed in virtual liquids. This display, which enables a rich and realistic touch experience, could serve as a platform for exploring novel tactile interactions and basic scientific research."

    "abstract": "Predicting material properties is a cornerstone of materials discovery but remains challenging for geometrically complex crystals (e.g., those with large unit cells or low symmetry), where conventional descriptors fail to capture multiscale structural irregularities and graph-based models incur high computational costs. Existing approaches often struggle to balance representational expressivity with data efficiency. In this study, we propose FractalNet-Plus, a dual-branch architecture that addresses this gap by combining domain-informed geometric features with multiscale fractal characterizations. Our method extracts six complementary fractal metrics—box-counting, mass, correlation, and information dimensions, lacunarity, and multiscale entropy—applying adaptive weighting to identify the most informative scales. Evaluations on complexity-filtered subsets of five Matbench tasks (thermodynamic stability, band gap, shear modulus, perovskite band gap, 2D exfoliation energy) demonstrate that our hybrid representation consistently improves accuracy, achieving MAE reductions of 17% for thermodynamic stability and 13% for band gaps compared to state-of-the-art baselines. For geometrically complex crystals, FractalNet-Plus achieves substantially lower prediction error while using fewer parameters and training more efficiently than graph neural networks, offering a computationally efficient and interpretable approach for materials property prediction."

The proposed approach leverages cooperative Received Signal Strength (RSS) measurements and a hybrid logarithmic path-loss model to automatically localize network anchors and build radio maps that can be used to localize user nodes. Starting from a limited initial number of known anchor nodes, position estimates are propagated to the rest of the network using an iterative strategy guided by a learning-based Dilution of Precision (DOP) metric. To address the challenge of unknown anchor locations at initialization, a novel Gaussian Process Regression (GPR)-based method is introduced to estimate the DOP values without requiring ground-truth coordinates. This enables a self-organizing deployment process that adapts to varying indoor deployments. The system is validated through Cramér–Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) analysis, simulations, and real-world experiments in ZigBee-based networks. Results demonstrate a root-mean-square localization error of 3 meters in a typical indoor 15m x 30m office environment covered by seven partially known anchors without prior site survey using only RSS measurements, providing a balance between cost, deployment complexity, and localization accuracy.

The SMA-based portfolio optimization is performed on two distinct datasets from the NASDAQ and the NSE, with optimal parameter settings fine-tuned using Sobol’s sensitivity analysis and random and grid search methods. Rigorous benchmarking experimentation against three widely used metaheuristics, the Genetic Algorithm (GA), the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and the Differential Evolution (DE), over multiple independent runs, demonstrates the performance superiority of SMA over others. Statistical tests like the KruskalWallis H test and the post-hoc Dunn’s test also confirm a significant performance difference among the four algorithms.

These capabilities collectively enable low-latency, resilient media delivery even under network congestion conditions. The experimentation also conducts the identification of key operational challenges for MEC-based CDN deployments, including virtualization gaps, lack of telemetry standards, proxy discovery limitations, and cross-domain orchestration needs critical for scalable and interoperable 5G streaming solutions.

In this paper, we propose MaxMpox-Det, a dual-input object detection model designed for robust localization of mpox lesions in clinical and dermoscopic images. The model processes both raw RGB and CLAHE-enhanced images through parallel MaxViT-Tiny encoders to extract complementary color and contrast-aware features. These features are fused in a stage-wise manner and refined using multi-head self-attention, enabling the network to capture both fine-grained lesion details and global contextual patterns. A Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) and a Cascade R-CNN head further enhance multi-scale detection and bounding box precision. Evaluated on a custom mpox dataset, MaxMpox-Det achieved an <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$m A P {@} 0.5$</tex> of 0.852, <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$m A P {@}[0.5: 0.95]$</tex> of 0.472, and an F1-score of 0.850, outperforming several state-of-the-art baselines. These findings underscore the effectiveness of dual-stream input and attention-based feature fusion in advancing medical object detection tasks."

    "abstract": "Vietnam's rapid adoption of cryptocurrency and pioneering regulatory reforms have created a dynamic yet underserved market for personalized financial information. The need for reliable, up-todate news is critical for both policymakers and market participants, especially as digital technologies accelerate and regulatory demands grow. To address these challenges, we propose a novel AI Agent system powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) and RetrievalAugmented Generation (RAG), designed to deliver personalized news aggregation and address information overload for Vietnamese users. Our framework integrates OpenAI's GPT-4 with advanced recommendation algorithms such as MINER and Prompt4NR, and utilizes two specialized datasets-VOZ FINANCE and VOZ CRYPTO-sourced from the VOZ forum, covering over 4,000 articles and 130,000 user interactions. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that Prompt4NR significantly outperforms baseline models, achieving an AUC of 0.7990 on the cryptocurrency dataset and a 31.5 % improvement over MINER, while the Agentic RAG system achieves high context recall for real-time news synthesis. This research highlights the potential of scalable, AI-driven news recommendation systems to support informed decision-making and regulatory compliance in emerging digital economies, particularly in low-resource language settings."

    "abstract": "Successful adoption of a new technology often relies as much on effective policy as it does on technical contributions. Despite near universal agreement that mandatory deployment of connected vehicle (CV) technology and the exchange of vehicle position and status information through Basic Safety Messages (BSMs) could significantly improve road safety, reduce traffic congestion, and streamline commercial vehicle operations, North American lawmakers have not yet been persuaded that the benefits outweigh the deployment challenges. To date, proponents have focused on the possibility of using the technology to prevent road accidents and traffic fatalities by drawing a driver’s attention to hazardous situations and instigating corrective action. Here, we argue that extending the use of BSM data to road safety analysis and traffic management considerably enhances the value proposition and makes the case for mandatory deployment even more compelling. We further argue that a three-stage approach to connected vehicle technology deployment that prioritizes low-risk but high-readiness applications will maximize return to stakeholders, minimize operational risk, and increase confidence in the technology. Finally, we argue that conventional approaches to assessing technology readiness are not adequate here, and propose an alternative way to assess deployment readiness."

    "abstract": "Adversarial patch attacks pose a serious threat to deep learning systems, particularly in security-critical applications where patches can be physically deployed. Recent work such as CamoPatch has shown that camouflaged, visually inconspicuous patches can fool classifiers while remaining stealthy to human observers. However, CamoPatch relies on a fixed mutation stepsize in its evolutionary strategy, which limits efficiency and adaptability under black-box constraints. In this paper, we present NES-CamoPatch, an extension of CamoPatch that integrates antithetic gradient estimation from Natural Evolution Strategies (NES) with gradient-guided mutation in the patch parameter space. By periodically invoking NES, our method leverages queryefficient gradient information while retaining the robustness of mutation-based search. This hybrid design balances exploration and exploitation, reducing query costs without sacrificing visual stealthiness. Extensive experiments on ImageNet and CIFAR-10 demonstrate that NES-CamoPatch achieves equal or superior attack success rates compared to state-of-the-art baselines, while maintaining stealthiness. These results highlight the effectiveness of combining evolutionary search with NES guidance for blackbox adversarial patch optimization and point toward promising extensions to real-world physical attacks."

This work conducts a multi-dimensional operational bottleneck analysis for a sendingend power grid in Northwest China. Operational restriction indicators are introduced to quantitatively characterize multidimensional bottlenecks affecting power balance and system security. A bottleneck identification model is then developed, incorporating constraints such as power balance and spinning reserve capacity. Using current operational and long-term planning data, the identified bottleneck scenarios are categorized and analyzed based on restriction indicators. Sensitivity analysis examines the effects of wind-solar mix and demand response capacity on operational bottlenecks. The results indicate that renewable curtailment scenarios primarily occur during high power output periods, such as spring and autumn, while power supply shortages are concentrated in the heating season."

    "abstract": "The Ising model provides an efficient framework for solving combinatorial optimization problems. Stochastic simulated bifurcation (sSB) is a parallel numerical method that can rapidly find solutions to the Ising model. However, stochastic bit operations in sSB are not inherently supported by general-purpose CPU or G PU architectures. In contrast, the fine-grained reconfigurable structure of FPGAs makes it well suited for implementing stochastic bit operations and enabling large-scale parallel updates of spin states. This paper presents an FPGA-based sSB architecture that fully exploits the strengths of FPGAs through three innovations: bit-width-optimized stochastic arith-metic, symmetric matrix compression, and conflict-free block traversal. As a result, the proposed architecture achieves high performance on a single FPGA chip for a 2000-node max-cut problem, with reduced data movement and improved computational efficiency. On a Xilinx XC7Z020 FPGA operating at 71 MHz and 1.6 W, the solution reaches 99 % of the optimal cut value with >50% probability in 1.1 ms."

In this paper, we propose Stable-Hair v2, a novel diffusion-based multi-view hair transfer framework. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to leverage multiple-view diffusion models for robust, high-fidelity, and view-consistent hair transfer across multiple perspectives. We introduce a comprehensive multi-view training data generation pipeline to generate high-quality triplet data, including bald images, reference hairstyles, and view-aligned source-bald pairs. Our multi-view hair transfer model integrates polar-azimuth embeddings for pose conditioning and temporal attention layers to ensure smooth transitions between views. To optimize this model, we design a novel multi-stage training strategy consisting of Pose-Controllable Latent IdentityNet training, Hair Extractor training, and Temporal Attention training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method accurately transfers detailed and realistic hairstyles to source subjects while achieving seamless and consistent results across views, significantly outperforming existing methods and establishing a new benchmark in multi-view hair transfer.

The RIS is equipped with a smart controller, and the functions of content caching and energy harvesting (EH) are endowed to the controller. We design a two-phase transmission policy. In the first phase, the requested contents that are not cached are delivered by the base station (BS) to RIS, and the controller conducts EH from surrounding radio frequency signals. In the second phase, the controller distributes cached contents utilizing non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) transmission with harvested energy, while the RIS forwards fetched contents sent from the BS to users. The beamforming vectors of the BS, RIS phase shifts, and NOMA power allocation factors are jointly optimized to maximize the achievable sum rate. The problem is intractable owing to coupled variables. After using the methods of fractional programming and quadratic transformation, we divide it into three sub-problems. The first sub-problem is solved by introducing auxiliary variables; the second one is addressed using the Riemannian manifold optimization; and the third one is converted to be convex by transforming the quality of service constraint. The sub-optimal solutions are achieved by alternatively solving the sub-problems. Simulation results reveal that the problem converges quickly, and the proposed algorithm outperforms benchmarks in terms of the sum rate."

Hence, there is an imperative need for enhanced study of cyber threats in smart grids to establish the appropriate countermeasures. This paper introduces a novel problem formulation to identify the power grid system’s critical lines under a Load Redistribution (LR) attack. Additionally, a bi-level attack model is developed to target these identified lines and evaluate system vulnerability. The approach is validated on the IEEE 14-bus test system, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method in identifying critical line and quantifying the operational impact of LR attacks."

Traditional optimization techniques, namely LP and NLP, have slow convergence, difficulty in constraints handling, and the requirement of algorithm-specific control parameters during relay coordination. However, their performance is often limited by the highly nonlinear nature of the problem in the DG-penetrated system. This paper proposed a BGA to improve the optimal coordination of DOCRs with a system penetrated with DGs. The effectiveness of both GA and BGA is assessed on the IEEE 14-bus system operating with DGs that have been modeled and simulated using ETAP, and a MATLAB program has been developed to achieve optimal coordination of DOCRs. The objective is to reduce the overall operational time of primary relays and to optimize relay coordination under defined constraints. Mean simulation time per run, without DGs, becomes 34.0739 sec and 8.0647 sec, and with DGs, 21.8931 sec and 7.8175 sec, respectively, by implementing GA and BGA. Hence BGA gives a lower total CTI between P/B relay pairs compared to GA."

The fibers were preconditioned by cutting, washing, and drying, using a standard length of 2.5 cm. Four concrete mixtures were designed with varying fiber contents (0 %, 0.5 %, 1.0 %, and 2.0 %), maintaining a constant water-to-cement ratio of 0.50. Workability, temperature, and density were assessed in the fresh state, and prismatic specimens were prepared and subjected to accelerated drying conditions according to ASTM C1579-13. Additionally, cylindrical specimens and standard beams were fabricated to evaluate the mechanical properties of hardened concrete at 7, 14, and 28 days. The results showed a 37.5% reduction in the surface crack width with a 2.0 % fiber content, without significantly affecting compressive strength, while flexural strength improved. It is concluded that the use of horsehair fibers represents a viable, accessible, and sustainable alternative to control plastic shrinkage and enhance the early durability of concrete, while promoting the use of low-impact natural materials."

In this research work, an efficient Federated Deep Learning (FDL) framework is proposed for estimating users’ sentiments toward a specific topic, product, or service. More precisely, we employed Deep Learning (DL) models to train decentralized devices using FL that maintains data locally without transferring the raw data during training. Nevertheless, the non-IID genre of the data when distributed among multiple clients renders FL a challenging task. To address this, we employed an efficient Quantity-level Dirichlet Allocation strategy for data distribution among multiple clients. Two DL models have been trained, namely, LSTM and BERT, using the proposed FDL framework on local datasets. For model aggregation, a robust aggregation strategy called FedMedian is used, which efficiently handles non-IID data. The efficiency of the proposed framework is estimated using two distinct sentiment datasets: (i) Sentiment140 dataset and (ii) Yelp reviews dataset. The experimental outcomes illustrate that the proposed model surpass centralized learning on both coarse (two-class) and fine-grained (five-class) sentiment classification tasks. Further, the models are evaluated on a secure aggregation environment integrated with the proposed FL framework. The study reports that the model’s performance is consistent with secured aggregation, ensuring data privacy."

By measuring the resonance frequency difference at varying water concentrations, the sensor enables detection at low moisture levels. The sensor comprises a microstrip transmission line and metamaterial resonator unit. Simulation of different resonator structures determined that a four-arm resonator configuration yields optimal sensor performance. Physical testing of the designed sensor using a network analyzer revealed that as water content increased from 0 ppm to 300 ppm, the sensor's resonant frequency decreased from 5.876 GHz to 5.8 GHz, exhibiting a linear relationship. The sensor designed in this paper is capable of detecting the moisture content of transformer oil with an accuracy of 50 ppm. This verifies the feasibility of using this sensor for the detection of transformer oil moisture content, providing a new solution for the condition monitoring of transformer oil."

Intelligent diagnosis driven by class-incremental learning offers a promising approach to ensuring safe operation throughout the equipment lifecycle. However, existing class-incremental learning methods fall short in addressing the challenge of efficient incremental transfer diagnosis under cross operating conditions. To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes a cross domain intelligent diagnostic method driven by class-incremental transfer diagnostic (CITD). Firstly, a novel knowledge distillation strategy is developed to mitigate catastrophic forgetting in incremental transfer diagnostic scenarios. Then, a generalization training and fast adaptation strategy is introduced to improve the generalization ability of the model for incremental transfer diagnosis. Experimental validation on a subway train transmission system dataset demonstrates that the proposed CITD method effectively adapts to cross-domain incremental transfer diagnosis tasks, delivering superior performance and outperforming several state-of-the-art class-incremental learning methods."

The paper presents power, performance, and area trade-offs for highly scaled quantum computing systems using different types of qubits (spin and transmons). The first considered design uses a direct digital synthesis (DDS) approach to provide a wide bandwidth (1−18 GHz) control solution for spin qubits. As this design point was implemented in two technology nodes (14 nm and 7 nm CMOS), it offers a window into the benefits for this application arising from technology scaling. Furthermore, the DDS architecture offers flexibility to meet the requirements of the rapidly evolving requirements of spin qubits and naturally supports a high degree of programmability of the amplitude, phase, duration, frequency and spacing of control waveforms. The DDS-based wideband radio frequency digital to analog converter (DAC) was demonstrated operational over the full 1 to 18 GHz target operating range, providing sufficient bandwidth for control signals for state-of-the-art spin qubit platforms. The second design approach uses various techniques for highly reconfigurable, low power control waveform generation for transmon qubits using current mode analog design.

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel approach to Radio Frequency transmitter classification that adapts audio recognition techniques to enhance device identification accuracy. By leveraging Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) and spectral characteristics traditionally used in audio processing, combined with a hybrid CNN-LSTM deep learning architecture, our method achieves $93.6 \\%$ classification accuracy across 8 devices in same-scenario testing. The approach demonstrates strong initial performance comparable to state-of-the-art RF fingerprinting methods, while also providing insights into cross-scenario challenges under varying operational conditions. Our experimental results, conducted using a dataset of commercial RF transmitters, highlight both the potential of audio-inspired features for RF fingerprinting and the persistent challenge of maintaining classification reliability across different operational conditions. This work contributes to the growing field of physicallayer security by demonstrating how cross-domain adaptation of proven audio processing techniques can enhance RF device identification."

    "abstract": "The assignment of resources dynamically is a decisive issue in the new paradigms of computations including cloud, edge, fog computing, and the Internet of Things (IoT). These are heterogeneous resource environments, decentralized control environments, and overload environments that vary at a rapid pace and require adaptive and intelligent allocation schemes. The paper suggests a hybrid quantum-game-theoretic model, which combines quantum optimization approaches and multi-agent game theory to solve the problems of multi-agent resource allocation in dynamic systems. Using the quantum concept of superposition and entanglement, the framework can explore the solution spaces in parallel and therefore increase convergence speed and allocation efficiency.A quantum game-theoretic model is developed, which entails price-motivated system to control the strategic interaction of rational agents, in addition to maintaining stability, autonomy and equilibrium. The resource allocation problem is formulated as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem and solved with the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) algorithm. The proposed approach is proved to be useful as simulation results show significant gains to classical baselines in terms of utility gain, fairness, and system throughput. The results highlight the possibilities of the quantum-game-theoretic paradigm as a fundamental engine of next-generation computing infrastructures, including networked cloud, edge and IoT with networked computing nodes in VPN-enabled networks."

    "abstract": "High-speed Pipeline Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADCs) often suffer from nonlinear distortion and structural mismatch, significantly limiting dynamic performance. Volterra-based behavioral modeling can uniformly characterize memory effects and nonlinear interactions, but their parameters grow exponentially with order and memory length, which causes redundancy, unstable identification and excessive complexity. Existing simplification methods, relying mostly on post-hoc pruning or sparsification, lack unified structural constraints and struggle to balance performance and complexity. This paper proposes a calibration method based on OrderDependent Volterra and Dynamic Deviation Reduction (ODVDDR). By introducing order-dependent memory allocation and dynamic deviation control in the structure generation stage, it systematically reduces parameter scale, improves the matrix condition number, and maintains the model's ability to represent nonlinear distortions. Compared with existing methods, ODV-DDR achieves a better balance between calibration accuracy and model complexity, providing a generalizable modeling approach for efficient and stable nonlinear calibration. Verification results on a behavioral-level simulation platform show that ODV-DDR significantly improves the SFDR and SNDR under the condition of coexisting typical non-ideal errors. Its performance is close to that of the full Volterra model, while the parameter scale is significantly reduced. Therefore, this method demonstrates good practical value in balancing implementation complexity and performance, and provides a new approach for the digital calibration of highspeed ADC systems."

To address these challenges, this paper proposes BOAMLS, a Bayesian optimization framework with an attention mechanism for FPGA logic synthesis, enhancing high-dimensional design space exploration efficiency. Furthermore, an adaptive acquisition function is designed to prevent the Bayesian optimization process from getting trapped in local optima, thereby strengthening the overall robustness and global search performance. Experimental results on the EPFL benchmark show that, compared with RESYN2, the proposed framework achieves a geometric mean reduction of 11.44% in LUT-6 count under timing constraints."

    "abstract": "History has demonstrated the critical importance of initiating power generation units independently of the external grid, a capability known as a \"Black start\". This capability is essential for recovering power systems from instabilities and disasters. To ensure equipment reliability, maintain system health, and provide operators with valuable restoration experience, regular black-start mock drills are conducted, including those performed prior to the commercial operation of new units.This paper presents insights from black start mock drill case studies conducted in the North East region of India and the use of Synchrophasor technology to analyze such cases at load despatch centers. The exercise involves initiating the black start of a unit, charging a dead bus, energizing a transmission line, and synchronizing with the grid at a remote end. During such exercises, synchronized phasor measurements are leveraged to monitor real-time conditions, including frequency and phase angles, in both the islanded system and the power grid. The paper explores the use of synchrophasor data to analyze both successful and unsuccessful attempts at synchronizing the incoming generator with the grid. The findings provide valuable lessons and data that can improve future black-start procedures and enhance the resilience of power systems."

This design suppresses irrelevant background features such as dense tissue textures in mammography and speckle noise in ultrasound, while enhancing salient lesion boundaries. The model was evaluated independently on three public datasets spanning both mammography and ultrasound: DMID mammography, UDIAT ultrasound, and BUSI ultrasound. The proposed approach achieved Dice scores of 74.28%, 88.38%, and 95.60%, respectively, outperforming standard U-Net and several state-of-the-art models.

    "abstract": "Occupants' activities strongly influence electricity use in residential buildings. Modeling and evaluating the relationships between occupants and the electricity consumed by appliances is essential for improving energy-efficient occupant behavior in dwellings. This paper examines activity-related electricity consumption of domestic appliances. Because appliance operation differs across household activities, activity contexts produce distinct electricity-use patterns. To capture these effects, we propose a contextual approach to model the electricity consumption associated with activities in houses. Specifically, Bayesian Networks are used to infer predefined consumption levels for studied appliances (e.g., microwave, toaster, washing machine). A case study with activities was used to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach. The results show the variation in appliance electricity levels both within a given activity and across activities. To evaluate the approach, simulated electricity from the proposed model was compared with sensorbased observations for multiple appliances. The results indicate that, when activity labels were available, the model effectively characterized the electricity levels linked to occupants' activities and effectively reproduced the activity-related consumption of appliances across multiple activities. It was also shown that even for the same activities, occupants may operate appliances in different ways and that their usage patterns change over time, a dynamic the current model only partially captures."

    "abstract": "Accurate and early diagnosis of plant diseases is critical for global food security and for minimizing economic losses in agriculture. Deep learning, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), has emerged as a powerful tool for automating this process. This study presents a direct comparative analysis between two state-of-the-art CNN architectures, EfficientNetV2 and ConvNeXt, for the task of multi-class plant disease classification. Both models were trained using a transfer learning approach on a public dataset of 20,639 images across 15 distinct classes of plant leaves. While this dataset is extensive, it is primarily composed of images taken in controlled, uniform settings, which presents a known limitation for real-world generalization. This work provides a direct, up-to-date benchmark of two leading modern CNNs, revealing not only their performance and efficiency but also their distinct failure modes through a qualitative error analysis. Our evaluation demonstrates that EfficientNetV2 achieves a significantly higher overall test accuracy (84.72%) compared to ConvNeXt (74.71%). Furthermore, with approximately 4.6 times fewer parameters, EfficientNetV2 is a more efficient and effective architecture. The error analysis revealed that EfficientNetV2 correctly classified 292 images that ConvNeXt misclassified, whereas the reverse was true for only 87 images, confirming its superior robustness. These findings highlight the architectural superiority of EfficientNetV2 for this application and suggest key areas for future research."

This paper addresses introducing multi-level modulation for improving spectral efficiency in MWHCDM. The analysis shows that pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) is suitable for the multi-level primary modulation. Although multi-level phase-shift keying also improves spectral efficiency, it impairs the anti-PB capability of MWHCDM.

    "abstract": "Employee turnover poses a critical challenge for organizations by increasing operational costs, disrupting team productivity, and affecting long-term workforce stability. Although machine learning techniques have shown promising results in predicting employee attrition, most existing approaches suffer from limited transparency and fail to incorporate relational organizational knowledge. Explainable AI (XAI) techniques improve interpretability but often operate on flat feature representations, overlooking hierarchical and collaborative workforce structures. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a hybrid framework that integrates knowledge graphs (KGs) with explainable machine learning models for transparent and fair employee turnover prediction. The proposed approach embeds organizational relationships such as reporting hierarchies and team interactions into KG-derived features, which are combined with interpretable classifiers. Post-hoc explanation techniques, including SHAP and LIME, are employed to provide actionable insights, while fairness-aware optimization reduces bias across protected attributes. Experimental evaluation on realworld HR data demonstrates that the proposed model achieves an accuracy of 88.7% and a fairness score of 0.78, outperforming baseline methods such as Random Forests and graph neural networks. The results highlight the effectiveness of combining structured organizational knowledge with explainable AI to support ethical and data-driven human resource decision-making."

    "abstract": "The exponential rise of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has significantly extended attack surface of new networks, making intrusion detection a critical element of IoT cybersecurity. Conventional Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and shallow ML approaches struggle to cope with evolving threats, class imbalance, and the computational limitations of resource-constrained IoT environments. To address these issues, this paper develops a novel DL-based IDS using Hitchcock Bird-Inspired Algorithm optimized Siamese Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (HIBASiamese BiLSTM). This model integrates a Siamese BiLSTM network with HIBA for hyperparameter optimization. The Siamese BiLSTM architecture learns discriminative temporal embeddings of IoT traffic and leverages contrastive learning to effectively differentiate between benign and malicious patterns, including zero-day attacks. HIBA is employed to optimize critical hyperparameters, including learning rate, dropout, and BiLSTM units, thereby enhancing accuracy and decreasing false positives. The proposed framework is evaluated on benchmark IoT cybersecurity datasets, namely IoT-23, UNSW-NB15, and TON_IoT, and achieves 99.91%, 99.99%, and 99.99% accuracies, respectively, while maintaining lightweight computational requirements suitable for IoT edge deployment. This work establishes a foundation for adaptive, efficient, and generalizable IoT intrusion detection, paving the way toward robust cybersecurity in smart and connected environments."

    "abstract": "Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS), a predominant hormonal disorder causes various reproductive issues in women starting from their early reproductive period and prevailing for a lifelong period of time. It can be critical when left undiagnosed, causing life threatening cardio vascular diseases. So early prediction of the syndrome can prove to be an essential step in the diagnosis of PCOS. Manual prediction of this hormonal disorder is quite challenging as the exact cause is still unknown and the prediction can be erroneous. For such a situation deep learning models can employ as a aiding means by the medical adepts in analyzing the presence of PCOS. Ultrasonographic images being the most important factor in the prediction is labelled into two categories as infected and non-infected. This image dataset with 2 classes is used to train different models for prediction. This work focuses on training various pre- trained models and a separate deep learning Convolutional Neural Network model (CNN) doing a comparative analysis on the accuracy of prediction. Out of all the pretrained models and the built CNN model, then latter gave high accuracy prediction where training time is less. With high accuracy of 99% CNN is employed by Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanation (LIME) explainable model to assist the medical adepts in giving error free precise predictions at the earliest."

An enhanced stacking ensemble classifier for the prediction of heart disease is proposed in this paper. Three Level 0 base learners XGBoost, Random Forest, and LightGBM are integrated into the model to identify various patterns and connections in clinical data. A Level 1 meta-classifier then combines and processes their probabilistic outputs, learning the best weighting for each base model to get the final prediction. The dataset used in this study include important clinical characteristics like cholesterol, blood pressure, and age. The Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) was used to combat class imbalance, while RandomizedSearchCV was used to optimize hyperparameters and improve model performance. The suggested ensemble outperforms individual classifiers, according to experimental results, with an accuracy of 0.9783 and a ROC-AUC score of 0.9897. The proposed method provides a better solution in early detection of heart disease and overall healthcare outcomes."

The investigated device exhibited a well-defined threshold around 0.95 V, followed by a rapid increase in output power with increasing anode voltage. The maximum fundamental-mode output reached approximately 38 mW at 3.0 V, while higher-order modes were significantly suppressed, demonstrating favorable single-mode operation at elevated bias. Thermal analysis revealed minimal self-heating, with the device temperature increasing by 7 K under high-bias conditions, thereby confirming stable operation and efficient heat dissipation. The results establish the capability of the proposed VCSEL design to achieve high power with controlled mode confinement, making it suitable for applications in optical interconnects, sensing, and integrated photonic systems."

The Synchronous Series Compensator (SSSC), one of the FACTS devices, enables series injection of synchronous and controllable AC voltages to adjust line impedance, improve stability, regulate voltage, and damp oscillations. During voltage sags, SSSC is operated using an intelligent control strategy. In this context, combined d-q control with Fuzzy logic control is employed to achieve a highly adaptive, optimized and comprehensive approach for power quality enhancement. Simulation results obtained demonstrate that Fuzzy Logic Control offers a rapid and robust response to voltage disturbances. Furthermore, a THD of 2.64% confirms the system’s performance in compliance with IEEE Std 519-2022 guidelines. This optimized technique is particularly vital for increased system efficiency that leads to lower carbon footprint, and a power system that supports eligibility for green energy incentives for interconnection with microgrids even under unstable conditions."

The study commences with an extensive literature review encompassing foot pressure measurement techniques, auxetic structures, and the significance of foot pressure distribution in diagnosing foot problems. By critically reviewing existing methods, the review identifies their inherent challenges and limitations, thus emphasizing the pressing need for an accurate and innovative foot pressure distribution and measurement device.

To ensure the utmost reliability and validity, the device undergoes meticulous calibration procedures. The results unequivocally demonstrate the effectiveness and dependability of the proposed device in accurately capturing foot pressure patterns and promoting pressure equalization across the foot through the integration of auxetic structures.

    "abstract": "Recently introduced bidirectional GaN switch technologies can potentially revive Current Source Converters (CSCs), since the conduction losses for a given chip area are approximately halved. However, our vision in this work is that the highest potential of CSCs lies in implementing converters with reduced material usage and low overall losses to minimize environmental impacts. To this end, the size of the passive components (l, Cs, and EMC filter components) is reduced by operating at higher switching frequencies. Although GaN transistors reduce switching losses, these remain a fundamental limitation. The solution pursued here is the implementation of novel modulation strategies that achieve Zero Voltage Switching (ZVS) in all devices. The main challenge is enabling ZVS without a significant increase in the circulating currents, which requires accurate knowledge of the current waveforms during switching transitions. Mathematical models are therefore derived and used to define advanced modulation strategies that fulfill this goal. Two modulation schemes are proposed: Trapezoidal Current Modulation (TrCM) and Advanced Trapezoidal Current Modulation (A-TrCM). Preliminary results predict a semiconductor efficiency of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\eta \\approx 99.55 \\%$</tex> at the nominal operation point of 6.75 kW.

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a method for accurately measuring the angular speed of rotating machinery based on corner transformation and designs a corresponding sensor system. The system primarily consists of a grating and a highspeed camera. By attaching a specific rectangular pattern to the shaft surface, a phase-modulated signal is generated during the shaft's rotation. The instantaneous angular speed (IAS) is then extracted using image feature tracking and corner detection algorithms. Unlike traditional encoders, which rely on resolution, this method theoretically enables angular speed detection with infinite resolution, making it particularly suitable for condition monitoring at low speeds or even near-zero speed. This paper first establishes a rotating shaft model in a simulation platform to simulate the sensor imaging process and validate the method's feasibility through corner detection. An experimental testbed is then constructed to test the sensor under constant and variable speed conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that this method maintains high detection accuracy at extremely low speeds and during dynamic acceleration and deceleration, with the measurement results highly consistent with the motor's setpoints. Further error analysis reveals that the grating attachment accuracy, lighting conditions, and mechanical vibration have some influence on the measurement results, but image preprocessing and feature normalization methods can effectively reduce these errors. Research shows that this method not only has high accuracy and stability, but also has the advantages of simplicity, low cost, and a wide application range. It can provide a new technical approach for condition monitoring, process control, and predictive maintenance of rotating machinery."

This paper introduces a novel Multimodal Attention and Stacking Framework that incorporates DomainDriven Feature Extraction (DDFE), Global Fusion Integration (GFI), and an Improved Attention Optimization with Hybrid Stacking (IAO-HS) mechanism for intelligent wind turbine fault classification. Initially, the framework extracts discriminative features from mechanical, electrical, and environmental signals using DDFE. These features are subsequently fused globally to capture both intra- and inter-modal relationships, followed by an attention-based hybrid stacking ensemble that dynamically weights each modality and aggregates predictions from multiple classifiers. Extensive evaluations on simulated and real-world datasets show that the proposed framework substantially outperforms traditional single-modality and early-fusion methods, achieving accuracy up to 99.98% while maintaining robustness under diverse operating conditions. The findings demonstrate the effectiveness of combining physically interpretable features with data-driven multimodal learning for highly reliable wind turbine fault diagnosis."

However, these algorithms fail to provide the same results in adverse weather conditions which hampers autonomous vehicles widespread utilization. As a result, analyzing the performance of autonomous vehicle sensors in severe environments is very important. This paper evaluates the performance of camera sensors under diverse weather scenarios using the BDD100k dataset. Specifically, we compare the detection accuracy of models trained and tested on individual weather conditions, such as rain, snow, and clear weather including different times like day and night. In addition, a general model is trained on aggregated data to compare the performance of models specifically trained for a weather condition with a generalized model. Metrics such as mean Average Precision, Recall, and Precision are calculated and assessed for 3 types of object groups categorized as small, medium, and large objects. The results demonstrate that weather-specific models perform better in their respective weather conditions, particularly for small and medium objects. However, the general model provides consistent and robust performance across all weather scenarios, making it suitable for general-purpose applications. Additionally, the paper highlights the trade-offs between model generalization and specialization, time of the day, and the impact of object size on detection accuracy. These findings contribute to the development of more reliable and adaptable object detection systems for adverse weather environments."

These findings demonstrate the potential of AI-assisted tools to streamline software development, enhance collaboration, and make technical workflows accessible to non-technical stakeholders. While promising, challenges such as computational overhead and reliance on language models require further research. This study lays the groundwork for integrating AI into model-driven engineering, advancing efficiency and collaboration in software design."

    "abstract": "In Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) systems, LiDAR odometry inevitably accumulates drift in pose estimates, leading to significant trajectory deviations and inconsistencies in the global map. Loop closure detection plays a crucial role in mitigating this cumulative error through closedloop optimization strategies. In this paper, we propose a hybrid algorithm for loop closure detection in LiDAR SLAM that leverages both global point cloud density and local triangular features. Specifically, the algorithm first filters candidate keyframes using a ring descriptor based on global point cloud density, followed by fine-grained triangle matching and geometric verification within each candidate frame to identify the optimal loop closure frame. The proposed method was evaluated on the publicly available Park dataset, with experimental results demonstrating a reduction in the RMSE of trajectory error to 0.051 m, representing a 59 % improvement over the original odometry results, and outperforming other benchmark algorithms in terms of trajectory error reduction. Additionally, the precision-recall (PR) curve of the proposed algorithm exhibited the widest coverage, achieving a maximum F1 score of 0.92, thereby outperforming existing mainstream loop closure detection algorithms."

    "abstract": "Terahertz (THz) technology, as a novel nondestructive testing (NDT) approach, has shown great potential in thickness measurement and damage location of various non-metallic materials due to its superior detection accuracy and safety. However, when THz wave penetrates the material, the inherent physical properties of the electromagnetic wave will cause it to exhibit different degrees of dispersion, which will limit the temporal-spatial resolution performance of THz NDT. Thus, in this work, a dispersion suppression and compensation method of THz waves is proposed based on U-Net with residual blocks. Firstly, the transmission characteristic of the THz wave is analyzed. The key to dispersion compensation is to obtain the sparse pulse sequence related to the time-of-flight of the structure. Then, the U-Net with residual blocks network is proposed to capture the sparse pulse sequence from dispersive THz signals. Specifically, during the training process, the Dynamic Focus Sparse Regression Loss (DFSR Loss) and Impulse Localization Overall Score (ILOS) are proposed to enhance the network's attention to sparse pulses. Finally, a series of numerical experiments on single-layer and multi-layer structures verifies the effectiveness of the proposed method in suppressing and compensating for complex dispersive THz signals."

    "abstract": "Adversarial prompt injection attacks pose a critical security threat to Large Language Models (LLMs) by manipulating model instructions through malicious inputs. In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of prompt injection vulnerabilities in LLMs. We develop a taxonomy encompassing direct, indirect, and multi-stage (chained) prompt injection attacks, detailing various exploits from simple “ignore previous instructions” overrides to covert multi-turn schemes. Through case studies and experimental evidence from recent literature, we demonstrate that even state-of-the-art models (e.g. GPT-4) can be consistently coerced into producing disallowed content, leaking confidential data, or executing unintended actions. We evaluate real-world risks via documented incidents (such as system prompt leaks and compromised LLM-integrated applications) and quantitative benchmarks, finding adversarial success rates exceeding $80 \\%$ in many scenarios. To address these threats, we propose a defense-in-depth mitigation framework. Our framework combines prompt sanitization (input filtering and normalization), context isolation (segregating user input from system instructions and external data), and model hardening (enhanced alignment tuning and adversarial training) to substantially reduce injection success. We also outline practical defensive strategies including role-based privilege restriction, output validation, and continuous red-teaming. Finally, we discuss the broader implications of prompt injection for AI safety, ethics, and policy, and highlight directions for future work in building robust, secure LLM systems."

In 2024, equipment availability was 82%, below the industry standard (90%), due to an increase in unplanned downtime and deficiencies in material supply management, a critical situation given that semi-trailer suspensions represent the main sales line. To address this problem, an intelligent supply management system was proposed and implemented, based on limited-memory artificial intelligence and integrated with the Total Productive Maintenance (TPM) methodology. This solution allowed realtime monitoring of machine status, improved forecasting of material requirements, and synchronized logistics activities, thus reducing operational downtime. As a result, availability was increased to 88%, stockout-related downtime was reduced from six to three days, and key maintenance indicators and key indicators such as Mean Time to Repair (MTTR) and Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) showed marked improvement. The proposal was validated through a TPM pilot test and a simulation of the supply system using Arena software, version 16."

As power system is evolving with increasing renewable energy integration, network complexity, and the need for real-time operational security, there is growing interest in upgrading existing despatch practices such as merit order despatch through advanced optimization techniques. Security constrained economic despatch (SCED) for state load despatch centres (SLDCs) is a complementary approach to support the transition towards smart, secure, and optimized power system operations. SCED incorporates all types of constraints like transmission constraints, generating unit constraints- declared capacity, technical minimum, ramp-up and ramp-down limits, etc. This work describes the SCED implementation for SLDC Gujarat from 15.06.2025-15.07.2025, for day-ahead and first window of real-time generation scheduling to take decision about the amount and price of power to be acquired from the electricity market. The optimization problem is formulated as linear programming to minimize the operational cost, respecting generating unit constraints (declared capacity, technical minimum, ramp-up, and ramp-down). The simulation study is carried out using the CPLEX solver in the GAMS software."

This study models using hydrogen as a seasonal storage medium to capture excess offshore wind energy during high-wind months while delivering electricity during low-wind months. An hourly, full-year model based on ERA5 wind data for the Gulf of Mannar and a 50 MW peak microgrid demand profile is used. The system simulates electrolysis, compression, gaseous storage, and reconversion using fuel cells while accounting for conversion efficiency, compression losses, and storage leakage. The results reveal that hydrogen permits seasonal energy shifting with a round-trip efficiency of 30% to 40%, depending on component efficiencies and storage losses. Sensitivity analysis shows that tank capacity and leakage are the most important factors influencing supply reliability. These findings evaluate hydrogen’s potential for long-term offshore wind balance and offer practical recommendations for coastal grid development."

    "abstract": "Spectral variability and nonlinear mixing interactions critically degrade spectral unmixing accuracy, especially in heterogeneous environments. To address these challenges, this study proposes a robust nonlinear spectral variability-aware unmixing model, AD-HKFCM, which integrates fuzzy clustering, kernel-driven nonlinear mapping, and intra-class/inter-class affinity cohesion. The model introduces a hybrid kernel function combining polynomial and radial basis kernels to enhance linear separability in high-dimensional space. By replacing conventional FCM prototypes with SVDD-derived hypersphere centers, the model reduces dependency on pure pixels and adaptively suppresses outliers through adaptive penalty weight optimization. A physics-informed affinity distance metric is designed to explicitly quantify spectral variability by penalizing intra-class dispersion and amplifying inter-class separation, thereby enabling the precise inference of “virtual pure endmembers” from intimately mixed data. Experiments on simulated (including Orchard 2EM/3EM benchmarks and synthetic hyperspectral) and real satellite datasets demonstrate that AD-HKFCM achieves 5–26% lower abundance estimation errors compared to the best-performing comparative methods, particularly in densely mixed regions with seasonal vegetation variability. This work unifies spectral variability compensation and nonlinear unmixing into a cohesive architecture, offering a generalizable solution for robust unmixing in complex environments."

    "abstract": "Functional ultrasound localization microscopy (fULM) enables brain-wide mapping of neural activity at micron-scale resolution but suffers from limited sensitivity due to sparse and noisy microbubble (MB) detections. Extending fULM into three dimensions (3D) further exacerbates these challenges because of low-frequency matrix arrays, reduced localization efficiency, and severe data sparsity. To address these limitations, we developed a statistical framework that models MB arrivals in 3D as a Poisson process accounting for localization efficiency, detection probability, and backscattered amplitude. This analysis predicts that integrating amplitude with count-based fULM improves functional sensitivity, particularly under high MB concentrations where localization saturates. Three-dimensional MB advection simulations confirmed these predictions, showing that backscattering fULM (B-fULM) maintains sensitivity at higher MB concentrations where conventional fULM fails. In rat brain experiments, B-fULM yielded stronger and more robust stimulus-evoked responses, with SNR gains of 18% in the somatosensory cortex and 61% in the thalamus, while preserving super-resolved spatial detail (33.4 μm for B-fULM vs 35.7 μm for fULM). These results establish B-fULM as a practical and sensitive approach for super-resolved 3D functional neuroimaging"

    "abstract": "In recent years, deep learning-based methods have been increasingly applied to hyperspectral image (HSI) anomaly detection (HAD). Due to the unique nature of the HAD task, which lacks prior supervisory information, existing methods often reconstruct both background and anomalous pixels to some extent. Moreover, the neglect of spatial information in HSI creates difficulties in separating anomalous pixels from background pixels during detection. To address these issues, we propose a novel purification window spectral-spatial self-supervised network that trains a network to reconstruct only background pixels while fully leveraging HSI spatial information. The Purification Window module first cleanses the dataset, significantly mitigating the problem of insufficient supervisory information in HAD. Inputting the processed dataset into the network shortens the training time while enhancing the model performance. The processed image data is then input into a lightweight reconstruction network based on KAN convolution and depthwise separable convolution, which ensures strong feature representation capabilities with low computational complexity. We summarize and improve upon previous guided image filtering methods, introducing a new approach to incorporate spatial information that further suppresses the reconstruction of anomalous pixels. The proposed network focuses on spectral information, and its combination with the guided filtering method further improves the accuracy of HAD. Extensive comparative experiments on three datasets demonstrate that Lightweight KAN Convolution Spectral-Spatial Network with Purification Window(KSSN) outperforms other popular detectors in terms of effectiveness and superiority."

We adopt a transparent protocol (held-out test set; stratified 80/20 train/validation from the official train split), prioritize macro-F1 for class imbalance, and report results for classic CNNs (AlexNet, GoogLeNet with aux), Transformers (ViT-B/16, Swin-T), and compact custom CNNs. Using a simple, Kaggle-ready recipe (AdamW + cosine decay, early stopping, AMP, robust DataLoader), we obtain competitive, field-grade baselines; e.g., AlexNet, GoogLeNet with aux, and Swin-T lead among pretrained models, while a small residual CNN reaches within ≈ 2% of their performance along with per-class reports to surface hard categories (e.g., fine-grained grape and tomato diseases). Despite high scores, few crop-disease interactions remain systematically difficult (as in grape, fig, and cherry). Hence, errors concentrate in a small, long-tail subset."

Early identification of vulnerable students and intervention tailored to their needs are crucial in enhancing retention and academic performance. This paper proposes a data-informed predictive framework utilizing official transcript data to assess student performance and identify dropout risks. A total dataset of 200 CS undergraduate students was gathered from the University of Management and Technology, Sialkot campus, covering several semesters with regular as well as repeating students. The most important variables were GPA, credit hours, course grades, attendance, and student status. Using the preprocessed and encoded dataset, clustering algorithms were used to discover performance-based clusters. Later, Gradient Boosting Regression predicted grades, and the Random Forest Classifier was used to classify at-risk students. The results indicated that clustering distinguished between student groups clearly, whereas regression analysis predicted grade advancement moderately with better accuracy upon hyperparameter tuning. The classification model differentiated between regular and repeating students with more than 97% accuracy, successfully identifying students at risk of academic failure. These results emphasize the promise of predictive analytics to make available timely, individualized academic assistance and inform institutional policy in an effort to decrease dropout rates. Although limited to one institution and omitting qualitative factors related to teaching, the research exhibits a scalable model for enhancing student retention by using data-driven decision-making."

Prompt-based learning methods adapt pre-trained VLMs to video action recognition tasks using task-specific learnable text tokens. However, these tokens often struggle to generalize to unseen categories, as they tend to forget general textual knowledge. To address this, we construct knowledge prompts composed of handcrafted and descriptive prompts and introduce a novel knowledge-guided context mapping to enhance the generalization of learnable prompts to unseen categories. This approach mitigates the forgetting of fundamental knowledge by reducing the discrepancy between learnable prompts and knowledge prompts while simultaneously allowing the prompts to extract rich contextual knowledge from LLM data. Then, incorporating the knowledge-guided context mapping into the contrastive loss enables zero-shot transfer of prompts to new categories and data, providing discriminative prompts for both seen and unseen tasks. In addition, we propose an advanced temporal aggregation method that refines uniform mean pooling by incorporating frame-level textual relevance scoring. Extensive evaluations on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that learning to prompt with refining text knowledge is an effective quick-tuning method, achieving superior sample generalization performance without increasing training parameters."

To examine this phenomenon, we outline a multi-stream feature fusion framework designed to classify each exercise using RGB images by leveraging both binary silhouettes of the human participant and RGB frames of the exercising individual. For silhouettes, a DeepLabV3 model is used to extract the human's form, a model path that we found to be the most accurate and useful, to analyze movement in relation to a static position of the participant's body. For RGB frames, we extract body joint keypoints from YOLOv8 and use Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) statistics assessing texture measures including contrast, correlation, entropy, energy, and homogeneity. To quantify the human movement from binary silhouettes, we extract Fourier descriptors, Radon transforms, and distance transforms that also describe contour and spatial geometry. Features are fused into a single feature vector that is optimized using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). We use a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) for the classification model. When applying the framework to the UCO Rehab dataset, we achieved a 96.1% recognition accuracy, demonstrating that complementary uses of visual cues can improve rehabilitation-based action recognition."

To address this issue, we propose a Backpro Pagation (BP) neural network-finite element modeling framework. First, a dynamic model of the angular contact ball bearing is constructed. Second, representative assembly process parameters are selected as inputs, and performance indicators are defined as outputs, with the dataset generated via finite element simulations. Third, a surrogate model is developed to predict bearing service performance. Finally, the effectiveness and accuracy of the surrogate model are validated experimentally, thereby providing a solid theoretical foundation and technical support for condition-based maintenance and intelligent health management of bearings."

The proposed architecture uses adaptive fixed-point numeric precisions down to 1-bit in the forward pass and 4-bit in the backward pass. The accelerator is mapped to a Zynq UltraScale+ MPSOC and integrated within the PyTorch framework, delivering scalable performance with multiple configuration options that include varying the number of hardware threads and compute units available in each thread. Each hard-ware thread uses a hierarchical dataflow with fine and coarse-grained components. The coarse-grained dataflow is composed of aggregation, combination, and attention stages. Hardware-aware quantization is used to optimize the parameter width of weights, features, attention coefficients, and graph connectivity expressed in the normalized adjacency matrix. Performance evaluation using popular Planetoid graph datasets shows acceleration factors higher than 2 orders of magnitude for GCN and GAT compared with on-device CPU execution. The experimental measurements compared with other FPGA, mobile GPU, and CPU hardware show up to 50x better performance per Joule."

Recent advances in deep learning have leveraged convolutional neural networks and multi-head self-attention (MSA) mechanisms to achieve substantial improvements over traditional machine learning approaches. Furthermore, several studies have demonstrated that dual-branch architectures can markedly enhance performance in aerial image segmentation. In this work, we propose the Dual Swin Transformer DeepLabV3+ (DSTD) network. This hybrid architecture combines Swin Transformers with a dual-branch design to enhance contextual and spatial feature understanding. This design improves feature fusion, achieving high segmentation performance while maintaining computational efficiency. Experimental results show that DSTD outperforms state-of-the-art methods such as BiSeNet, ST-UNet, and SwinCNN, achieving up to 91.94 % global accuracy, 82.79 % mean Intersection-over-Union, and 90.13 % mean Boundary F1-Score on the ISPRS Vaihingen dataset.

    "abstract": "This study presents a systematic review and detailed probabilistic analysis of hourly wind speed and solar irradiance data for the La Rumorosa region, Baja California, Mexico. A total of 87,360 hourly wind speed data points were analyzed over a 10-year period to identify the probability distribution function (PDF) that best characterizes the monthly statistical behavior of the wind resource. While the literature indicates that the Weibull distribution is most suitable for wind resource studies, it does not always provide the optimal fit, demanding exploration of alternative PDFs. Five commonly employed probability distributions were evaluated: Weibull, Log-normal, Gamma, Rayleigh, and Normal; using statistical metrics including root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and the coefficient of determination (R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>), complemented by the Kolmogorov–Smirnov (K-S) goodness-of-fit test. For wind data, results confirmed that the Weibull distribution demonstrated optimal performance in most months (RMSE: 0.0069, MAE: 0.0042, R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>: 0.984, K-S: 0.027), although the Normal distribution yielded better results in some cases (RMSE: 0.0035, MAE: 0.0025, R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>: 0.996, K-S: 0.010). For solar resource assessment, 51,100 hourly data points were analyzed, focusing on the 14 most representative daylight hours. Initial application of unimodal forms of the aforementioned PDFs yielded unsatisfactory results. Consequently, a bimodal approach—combining two probability distributions—was implemented, enabling adequate representation of intra-daily variability under mixed atmospheric conditions. For solar irradiance data, results indicated that bimodal analysis more effectively captured the variability and intermittency inherent in solar data. The primary contribution of this work lies in the development and application of a robust methodology based on comprehensive statistical analysis and validation through multiple error metrics, designed for precise sizing of solar–wind hybrid systems. This approach provides enhanced characterization of regional renewable resources and supports the design of more efficient energy storage and operational strategies to address intermittency challenges."

The main goal is to enhance reliability and robustness across dynamic operations, while maintaining low complexity through model reduction per SHAP’s recommendations. Using a light observer, PINN-based SOC is first realized and validated. The framework is then optimized using SHAP analysis to retain only the most influential features that ensure similar performance. Experimental results against dynamical scenarios and critical temperatures demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed XAI -enhanced framework with RMSE<1.4% and high explanation fidelity, showcasing its potential to meet the accuracy, safety, and deployment requirements of next-generation BMS."

Traditional steganographic techniques have had difficulties merging adequate security with low visibility, resulting in secure video storage data becoming unembeddable while losing essential video quality. This study implements a two-tiered security system to combat these concerns by integrating the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) encryption with a more sophisticated steganography technique. The AES with the use of 128-bit encryption in the first tier encrypts the secret data, whereas the second tier is an enhanced steganographic process with the Least Significant Bit (LSB) encoding that utilizes an 8-directional pixel selecting process for conveying the encryption data within the video frame without sacrificing the visual fidelity. The proposed Model surpassed current techniques, as indicated by the excellent PSNR of 74.082 and SSIM of 0.999992913 obtained for the Daffodil Varsity (DV) frame. These outcomes reflect the suitability of the proposed Model in ensuring maximum security with imperceptibility and demonstrating its potential for secure video steganography."

    "abstract": "In the current era of globalization, with increasing vessel cargo and limited port resources, the operational efficiency of container terminals is of paramount importance. Berth allocation and quay crane allocation problems (BACAPs) emerge as pivotal focal points, especially in large-scale container terminals. Although preventive maintenance for quay cranes is crucial for reducing equipment failures and widely implemented in real-world operations, it is often overlooked in existing studies. Lately, few methods are proposed considering maintenance activities. However, their performance are unsatisfied in terms of large-scale problems and hard to meet the requirement of efficiency. To deal with this challenge, in this paper, we present a mixed integer bi-objective optimization model and further propose a novel algorithm to address the large-scale BACAP with quay crane maintenance activities. This model aims to minimize vessel turnaround durations and the penalty of unscheduled maintenance. Meanwhile, based on NSGA-II, the model called RTAA utilizes a novel decoding method with <bold xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">R</b>ecurrent <bold xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">T</b>emporal berth <bold xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">A</b>llocation and quay crane <bold xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">A</b>ssignment, which can greatly reduce the probability of generating infeasible solutions in a heuristic way. Moreover, the island model is involved to improve the efficiency and parallelism of the model and enhance the diversity of the Pareto-front solutions. Compared to the existing methods in both small and large instances, the RTAA demonstrates its efficacy in discovering superior and more diverse solutions. In particular, for large-scale problems involving 100 vessels, as well as more berths and quay cranes, our model still delivers superior performance with a significant reduction in computation time. Additionally, our approach shows excellent scalability, as it can be easily adapted to scenarios that do not consider maintenance activities."

The existing solutions aim to optimize user service experience in terms of delay or energy efficiency, but this fundamentally assumes that all tasks are completable. We highlight that all computational tasks in practical application environments have specific delay constraints. As such, it is unrealistic to consider that all tasks can always be completed on schedule when resources fall short of demand. To this end, we propose a service-maximized bilevel (SMax-bilevel) optimization scheme, and formulate a task completion rate maximization problem. Due to its non-convex complexity, we decompose the original problem into a tractable bilevel structure. At the upper level, an encoding mechanism-enhanced adaptive differential evolution algorithm (ADEEM) is developed to determine UAV deployment locations that maximize service coverage. At the lower level, a theorem is presented to guide user selection, task offloading, and resource allocation, aiming to maximize the number of completed tasks within their delay constraints. The two levels iteratively interact to produce an optimal solution. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed SMax-bilevel scheme significantly enhances system service capacity while reducing algorithmic complexity, outperforming existing benchmark solutions."

    "abstract": "Wafer probing is a critical inspection stage in semiconductor manufacturing, where the electrical behavior of on-wafer circuits is evaluated prior to packaging. Most existing wafer anomaly detection approaches have primarily relied on image-based inspection, while recent time-series–based models such as SwinProbeFormer have focused on detecting over-gain anomalies in probing signals. In contrast, undergain anomalies have received relatively little attention due to their subtle deviation from normal probing behavior, despite their significant impact on probing efficiency and test-cell throughput. In this paper, we propose M-WAD, a multimodal wafer anomaly detection framework that jointly leverages time-series signals, data-specific visual representations, and textual prompts to effectively detect undergain anomalies during wafer probing. M-WAD introduces a domain-aware residual image generation strategy that amplifies subtle motion degradations and enables robust multimodal representation learning. Extensive experimental results on real-world wafer probing datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in undergain anomaly detection and consistently outperforms existing methods, including models tailored for wafer probing. These results highlight the effectiveness of multimodal learning for capturing subtle probing anomalies and its potential for practical deployment in industrial wafer testing environments."

Validation of the framework was conducted using the Fuzzy Delphi Method (FDM) with twelve domain experts representing Islamic jurisprudence, Islamic economics, ICT and Islam, Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), and waste management. Two rounds of expert review identified 12 core persuasive elements comprising of reduction, tunneling, tailoring, personalization, self-monitoring, simulation, rewards, reminders, suggestion, liking, authority and verifiability. The findings demonstrate the potential of embedding Islamic ethical values within persuasive system design to strengthen intrinsic motivation, and behavioural compliance in waste management practices and provides actionable guidance for designing ethical and culturally relevant waste management solutions."

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the challenging task of recognizing severely degraded laser-etched serial numbers on copper surfaces, where conventional OCR and scene text recognition models struggle due to noise, incomplete characters, and limited training data. To overcome these challenges, we proposed a data augmentation pipeline leveraging generative adversarial networks (GAN) for finetuning a transformer-based text recognition model. The pipeline consists of 3 three main modules: (1) character-free background generation module using a LaMa inpainting model to remove existing characters from real images, (2) Character Generation module using four CycleGAN models trained on different appearance groups to synthesize diverse textured characters to create character images, and (3) a text insertion module combines these synthesized characters onto the generated backgrounds. Fine-tuning the pretrained TrOCR model with our augmented dataset achieved an absolute accuracy of 88.5 %, representing a 72.79 % improvement over the baseline. This highlights the effectiveness of our approach for extreme degradation and its potential for broader industrial serial number recognition applications."

    "abstract": "Healthcare systems in resource-constrained settings face systemic challenges, including workflow inefficiencies and clinician overload, which directly threaten patient safety and quality of care. Although Artificial Intelligence (AI) has shown substantial promise, current approaches predominantly emphasize isolated analytic models, leaving unaddressed the central challenge of optimizing the clinical workflow itself. This gap between singlepoint predictions and end-to-end workflow optimization remains a critical barrier to impact. To address this, this paper introduces the Vietnam Health-Agent System (VHAS), a system-theoretic framework to build agentic healthcare ecosystems. Its core component, the Clinical Workflow Orchestrator, functions as a meta-agent that coordinates specialized tool-using agents and employs Reinforcement Learning to dynamically compose, execute and adapt workflows in real time. We argue that medical AI must shift from building standalone tools to orchestrating coordinated, adaptive workflows. VHAS provides a scalable architectural blueprint for this transition, enabling efficient, reliable, interpretable, and equitable healthcare systems."

The proposed architecture supports two remote units (RUs), referred to as midhaul and fronthaul, employing a single hybrid optical cable composed of single-mode fibers (SMFs) and multimode fibers (MMFs). Digitally modulated RoF signals at 3.5 GHz and 700 MHz are transmitted simultaneously over the same SMF to the midhaul and fronthaul stations, respectively. Optical power is delivered throughout the MMF using a high-power laser diode (HPLD) at 808 nm to supply a receiver module (Rx) with a 20 dB amplifier at 200 m. Additionally, a laser diode (LD) at 1550 nm is coupled to a second SMF to power a photodetector (PD) located at 5.2 km. The system achieved optical power transmission efficiencies (OPTE) of 74.3% and 66.8%, and power transmission efficiencies (PTE) of 33.9% and 17.7% for the midhaul and fronthaul links, respectively. Error vector magnitude (EVMRMs) values remained within 3GPP limits for 64-QAM and 256-QAM modulations, confirming the feasibility of simultaneous photonic power delivery and high-quality RF signal transmission in a unified RPoF link for B5G applications."

    "abstract": "Football is a global industry with significant commercial potential, yet analyzing long matches to extract key events remains challenging. Event spotting in football videos focuses on detecting predefined events and localizing their temporal boundaries within a match. This task faces two main challenges. First, feature aggregation methods such as NetVLAD and NetVLAD++ operate on frame-level features without adequately capturing correlations across neighboring frames. Second, the dataset is highly imbalanced, where frequent events dominate rare ones. To model inter-frame dependencies more effectively, we propose AttNetVLAD and AttNetVLAD++, which integrate self-attention before NetVLAD and NetVLAD++. In addition, we replace binary cross-entropy with Focal Loss and introduce a novel resampling strategy to mitigate the class imbalance. Experiments on the SoccerNet-v2 dataset show that AttNetVLAD and AttNetVLAD++ with Focal Loss achieve the best performance when evaluated using a-mAP under the Loose criterion within the Visible group, with average precision of 49.12 and 50.81, respectively. These results represent improvements of 13.59 and 8.22 over the baseline NetVLAD and NetVLAD++ trained with binary cross-entropy. Overall, the results demonstrate the effectiveness of integrating self-attention with imbalance-aware learning for football event spotting."

Traditional evoting mechanisms, although convenient, suffer from a range of vulnerabilities - including voter impersonation, double voting, identity leaks, and tampering by insiders or external adversaries. ECC-EXONUM-eVOTING was previously proposed to mitigate many of these issues through elliptic curve cryptography (ECC), Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP), and Exonum private blockchain. In this paper, we extend the capabilities of ECC-EXONUMeVOTING by integrating two novel modules aimed at enhancing both system intelligence and accessibility. First, we implement an AI-based fraud detection system using unsupervised anomaly detection techniques that proactively identify and block fraudulent voting behaviors in real time. Second, we introduce a secure offline voting architecture designed for voters in remote or lowconnectivity regions, using QR-based tokenization and Merkle-root-based integrity proofs for delayed blockchain synchronization. Through simulations, algorithmic validation, and comparative analysis, we demonstrate how these enhancements significantly increase the robustness, scalability, and real-world applicability of blockchain-based voting systems."

The available measurements are analyzed to assess the extent of the unbalance problem. The distribution of the negative sequence current injections obtained from the measurements is then used to perform Monte-Carlo simulations to estimate the negative sequence voltages under contingency and emergency conditions. The studies indicate that while unbalance is not significant under normal conditions, it could be so under certain contingency conditions. The worst-case scenario occurs under black start conditions, when large thermal stations have not started up, and high-priority railway loads are among the first to be energized. The variable nature of unbalanced loads and their spatial distribution necessitate flexible compensation devices, such as STATCOMs. A methodology is proposed and applied to assess the effect of compensation at multiple locations in this system."

To address these issues, we propose a novel Uncertainty-Guided and Top-k Codebook Matching SR (UGTSR) framework, which incorporates three key components: (1) an uncertainty learning mechanism that guides the model to focus on texture-rich regions, (2) a Top-k feature matching strategy that enhances feature matching accuracy by fusing multiple candidate features, and (3) an Align-Attention module that enhances the alignment of information between LR and HR features. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in texture realism and reconstruction fidelity compared to existing methods.

To improve computational efficiency, an illumination-guided cross-channel context aggregation module is introduced, which fuses cross-channel context with expanded receptive fields to enhance self-attention, striking a balance between global modeling and computational overhead while achieving linear complexity. For high-frequency information preservation, we construct a Haar wavelet-based downsampling scheme with multi-scale invertible decomposition, enabling representative feature learning. Furthermore, an ultralightweight dynamic upsampling module is introduced for efficient feature reconstruction, leveraging a learnable point sampling mechanism within a plug-and-play framework. Experimental results validate that HaarReformer effectively enhances low-light images with low computational overhead, while demonstrating superior performance in preserving color fidelity, structural integrity, and textural details."

The proposed design employs a synchronous buck-boost inverter for bidirectional energy transfer, avoiding DC offsets and maintaining cell charge balance during measurement. Excitation signals are generated by a microcontroller, and both single-sinusoidal and multi-sinusoidal excitations are supported. The multi-sinusoidal approach significantly reduces measurement time by simultaneously probing multiple frequencies. A hardware demonstrator was developed and validated on commercial lithium-ion cells. Results show that the proposed system reproduces the key features of impedance spectra when compared with a commercial reference instrument, with good accuracy across the low- and mid-frequency range. The method demonstrated high energy efficiency and preserved the state of charge during measurement. Overall, the approach represents a practical step toward integrating EIS directly into battery management systems for real-world applications."

Among the most in-demand applications is the Search and Rescue (SAR) task, particularly in high-risk environments where human entry is unsafe. Specifically, teleoperated SAR platforms deploy dedicated sensors and control algorithms to optimize search effectiveness and mitigate risks incurred by human responders. This systematic review analyzes 74 research papers published between 2016 and 2024, with a focus on the role of robots in SAR operations (sensor integration), the types of robots employed, and the control algorithms used. The work classifies robotic systems in the context of SAR as either aerial, ground, or marine platforms and analyzes their sensor technologies, autonomous navigation functions, and human-robot interaction capabilities. A major contribution of this survey is the proposal and design of a five-layered architecture for robotic SAR systems, which categorizes system functions into clearly differentiated layers; namely, the HRI Layer, Perception Layer, Navigation Layer, Control Layer, and Robot Layer. Such a structured method enables modular, scalable, and real-time decision-making under dynamic disaster conditions. Moreover, this paper identifies several research challenges, including multi-robot coordination, AI-based real-time decision-making, and energy efficiency, providing a related analysis for the future development of robotic SAR systems."

As a promising solution, physical layer security (PLS) technology leverages the inherent characteristics of wireless channels to provide security assurance. Particularly, stacked intelligent metasurface (SIM) directly manipulates electromagnetic waves through their multilayer structures, offering significant potential for enhancing PLS performance in an energy efficient manner. Thus, in this work, we investigate an SIM-assisted secure communication system for MUs under the threat of an eavesdropper, addressing practical challenges such as channel uncertainty in mobile environments, multiple MU interference, and residual hardware impairments. Consequently, we formulate a joint power and phase shift optimization problem (JPPSOP), aiming at maximizing the achievable secrecy rate (ASR) of all MUs. Given the non-convexity and dynamic nature of this optimization problem, we propose an enhanced proximal policy optimization algorithm with a bidirectional long short-term memory mechanism, an offpolicy data utilization mechanism, and a policy feedback mechanism (PPO-BOP). Through these mechanisms, the proposed algorithm can effectively capture short-term channel fading and long-term MU mobility, improve sample utilization efficiency, and enhance exploration capabilities. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that PPO-BOP significantly outperforms benchmark strategies and other deep reinforcement learning algorithms in terms of ASR."

The aim of this paper is to use an Unknown Input Observer (UIO) to detect faults in a wind turbine system equipped with a Doubly-Fed Induction Generator. The system’s non-linear dynamics are accurately described under different operating conditions using a multi-model representation. The observer that is being suggested is assessed on its sensitivity to ITSC faults and its ability to handle external disturbances. Simulation results demonstrate that the UIO can efficiently detect and isolate stator ITSC faults while maintaining high robustness to wind speed variations. Based to the findings, confirm that the suggested UIO based fault recognition design is effective and reliable to improve the dependability of wind turbine systems."

It becomes difficult to analyze the data and the documents holding information systematically, which leads to a Big Data challenge. A successful methodology to unfold this complex digital data holds considerable potential for aiding legal scholars and providing a foundation for data-driven policies. This work introduces and evaluates a computational framework which is specifically designed to identify both thematic and geospatial patterns within this legal data. Utilizing a pipeline constructed on Apache Spark, the framework comparatively analyzes four distinct clustering algorithms: K-Means, Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM), Density - Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN), and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). The main objective is to determine which of these unsupervised machine learning methods is most effective for the complex domain of processing and clustering based on the legal text. The later findings reveal a dilemma between the statistical cluster quality and practical, thematic interpretability. GMM produced the most mathematically cohesive partitions, while LDA proved substantially more effective at generating clusters that aligns more with the human understandable legal concepts."

    "abstract": "This paper verifies an improved control method of a capacitively isolated bidirectional DC-DC converter with auxiliary converters, designed for electric railway systems. The converter consists of four unidirectional power devices, two capacitors for galvanic isolation, two inductors, and two auxiliary converters. Each auxiliary converter comprises three full-bridge cells connected in cascade. To downsize the isolated capacitors, as well as the filter capacitors and inductors on the primary and secondary sides, the switching frequency of the main converter should be set higher than 500 Hz, as used in [1]. However, it leads increased losses in the auxiliary converters because the sinusoidal inductor currents used for archiving power balance between the auxiliary converters. To address the above issue, this paper proposes an inner power control method based on triangular inductor currents, allowing the switching frequency of the main converter to be set higher. The operating principles of this inner power control method are validated experimentally using a 1.2-kW, 120-V down-scaled model, in which the switching frequency of the main converter can be set at 4 kHz."

This paper presents a proof-of-concept for a rehabilitation system that integrates a hybrid force myography (FMG) and surface electromyography (sEMG) interface with a prosthetic digital twin in a virtual reality (VR) serious game. The system architecture incorporates an FMG sensor based on fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors, a commercial sEMG device, and Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) to capture muscle activity and arm motion. Participants interacted with a modified Virtual Reality Southampton Hand Assessment Procedure (VR-SHAP) to evaluate the system's performance. A comparative analysis of six machine learning algorithms was conducted in order to classify user gesture intentions from sensor data. The results from the machine learning evaluation identified the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier as an optimal model, achieving a mean accuracy of 99.63% across all subjects. The experimental protocol confirmed that all users could successfully operate the system to complete a series of complex virtual tasks. This study demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed hybrid FMG-sEMG system as an accurate, engaging, and promising platform for the rehabilitation and training of prosthesis users."

Simulations were performed using Ansys Lumerical INTERCONNECT to evaluate the system's performance over 100 km of standard single-mode fiber, with data rates ranging from 6.25 Gbps to 12.5 Gbps. The analytically derived weights enable effective CDC at higher rates, with BER remaining below 0.001 in relevant scenarios.

In addition to the physical blockage constraints that have been considered in various existing studies, we also account for the capacity constraints of mmWave BSs, which limit the maximum number of concurrent user requests. To address the inherently stochastic nature of mobile user traffic, we utilize teletraffic theory and specifically apply the Erlang Fixed-Point Approximation to accurately and efficiently estimate blocking probabilities. Then, we propose a low-complexity algorithm by identifying the submodularity structure of the deployment problem to determine the optimal deployment strategy that minimizes the number of BSs. Extensive numerical results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in both solution accuracy and computational efficiency."

However, the absence of robust security measures on the CAN bus exposes vulnerabilities, enabling attackers to potentially compromise vehicles remotely. Many cryptography based methods are proposed to enhance the security of CAN bus, but they rarely involve key management issues. In this paper, we propose a lightweight group key management scheme that innovatively utilizes the residual part of the Message Authentication Code (MAC) of data stream to maintain a synchronized fields between Electronic Control Units (ECUs), which is called hippocampus. Each ECU executes the refresh process by applying the XOR operation between hippocampus and old key. Moreover, we provide formal security proofs and informal analyses for the robustness of the proposed scheme. Afterwards, a series of evaluations on three typical hardware platforms are detailed. The results demonstrate that the additional time overhead introduced by our scheme remains within acceptable limits and validate its advantage, efficiency, and flexibility by comparing it with other methods."

This application alerts its users about meteorological and oceanographic conditions that could be dangerous for navigation in the coastal areas of Colombia. The research focused on integrating a new variable, wind speed, which, along with the already existing variables within the application, such as the magnitude and depth of earthquakes, allows for the analysis of maritime phenomena. To achieve these objectives, both generative and traditional artificial intelligence were incorporated into the project. Taking advantage of the fact that the application already had fuzzy logic integrated into its prediction model, it was possible to interpret data from multiple meteorological sources, such as the OpenWeatherMap API and DIMAR, improving the application's ability to generate early and accurate alerts. The project followed the SCRUM and Participatory Action Research (PAR) methodologies. The SCRUM methodology helped organize the work into short sprints, allowing for continuous corrections and prioritizing feedback among developers, while the PAR methodology engaged coastal communities and local experts in the process, ensuring that the improvements reflected their specific needs, which are now incorporated into the application. Functional, unit, and automated tests demonstrated the correct operation of the adjusted model, validating the incorporation of the new variable in different scenarios. With this improvement, the application is useful for commercial, tourism, and fishing activities by providing a reliable, real-time tool that aids in decision-making and, at the same time, protects users' safety at sea."

    "abstract": "With the rapid growth of cloud services, the storage of images in cloud environments requires secure and effective data encryption methods. Many thumbnail-preserving encryption (TPE) methods have thus been proposed to balance privacy and usability of image data. However, the exposure of thumbnail information in TPE methods may introduce privacy leakage risk, and a systematic evaluation of their security has not yet been conducted. In this paper, we propose a new Mamba-Transformer cooperation Network (MTNet) to recover the original images from the limited exposed thumbnail information, highlighting the information disclosure problem in TPE. Specifically, the core model component integrates a Mamba block and a Transformer block, which employ the powerful capabilities of the Mamba for wide field dependency modeling and the Transformer for effective channel interaction. Besides, the cascade architecture incorporates an intermediate output that provides supplementary information and achieves multilevel supervision, thereby improving the quality of the final output. Finally, to better utilize the subtle details in different levels, we propose a multi-scale fusion module that adaptively integrates features from various stages of the encoding process. The experimental results achieved by our proposed MTNet reveal that the privacy risk associated with TPE is significantly underestimated and more robust defense mechanisms are required.

It enhances image quality and facilitates downstream applications such as remote sensing, medical diagnostics, and robotics. Despite significant advancements, current MMIF methods still face challenges such as modality misalignment, high-frequency detail destruction, and task-specific limitations. To address these challenges, we propose AdaSFFuse, a novel framework for task-generalized MMIF through adaptive cross-domain co-fusion learning. AdaSFFuse introduces two key innovations: the Adaptive Approximate Wavelet Transform (AdaWAT) for frequency decoupling, and the Spatial-Frequency Mamba Blocks for efficient multimodal fusion. AdaWAT adaptively separates the high- and low-frequency components of multimodal images from different scenes, enabling fine-grained extraction and alignment of distinct frequency characteristics for each modality. The Spatial-Frequency Mamba Blocks facilitate cross-domain fusion in both spatial and frequency domains, enhancing this process. These blocks dynamically adjust through learnable mappings to ensure robust fusion across diverse modalities. By combining these components, AdaSFFuse improves the alignment and integration of multimodal features, reduces frequency loss, and preserves critical details. Extensive experiments on four MMIF tasks-Infrared-Visible Image Fusion (IVF), Multi-Focus Image Fusion (MFF), Multi-Exposure Image Fusion (MEF), and Medical Image Fusion (MIF)-demonstrate AdaSFFuse's superior fusion performance, ensuring both low computational cost and a compact network, offering a strong balance between performance and efficiency.

The results indicate that the optical fiber detects a mixture of seismic wave types—specifically S-waves, P-waves, Rayleigh waves, and Love waves—based on comparisons between the measured directivity and simulations from the literature. Furthermore, DAS was found to exhibit sensitivity to apparent seismic velocities higher than the actual values, consistent with observations from conventional geophone-based methods. This study highlights the potential of DAS for seismic applications, showing that its response can be corrected with appropriate algorithms for accurate seismic analysis, despite the mixed nature of the detected waves."

    "abstract": "Depression has become one of the most prevalent mental disorders among adolescents. However, its clinical etiology remains unclear, and unlike many other diseases, it lacks objective biochemical or medical imaging indicators for assessment and severity evaluation. To address this gap, this study presents a multi-sensing wearable wristband that integrates audio, activity, and heart rate sensors. Furthermore, this system is used to capture physiological and behavioral data for investigating how these parameters evolve in depressed adolescents during hospitalization. To identify meaningful digital biomarkers from the collected data, a multi-step analytical method has been constructed. Firstly, statistical methods such as correlation analysis, variance analysis, and non-parametric tests are employed to eliminate redundant, unrelated, and non-differential features, thereby narrowing the feature space. Moreover, a variational autoencoder is applied to address class imbalance, and focal loss is incorporated to enhance model sensitivity to difficult samples. Secondly, an XGBoost-based framework is developed to classify depression improvement levels and the model achieve a validation accuracy of 0.8. Finally, feature contribution analysis based on the proposed model is conducted using Shapley values and linear model coefficients, providing both individualized and global interpretations of differential feature sets before and after treatment. By integrating insights from these analyses, a set of objective digital biomarkers has been identified that may aid in screening and diagnosing adolescent depression."

The latter assesses the economic effects of outages via line failure rates, repair durations, and the Value of Lost Load (VOLL). An aggregated satisfaction degree (DS), obtained by sigmoid-based fuzzy normalization with weights of 0.6 for ${J}_{1}$ and 0.4 for $J_{2}$, serves to equilibrate efficiency and reliability while guaranteeing consistent convergence. The methodology is validated on a modified IEEE 33-bus test system, employing three metaheuristic algorithms: Equilibrium Optimizer (EO), Gorilla Troops Optimizer (GTO), and Geometric Mean Optimizer (GMO). Results indicate that EO regularly attains the highest DS (0.3), diminishing daily energy losses by 17.79% and enhancing minimum bus voltage from 0.9045 pu to 0.9678 pu, surpassing the other methods for all evaluation criteria."

    "abstract": "Visual-inertial odometry (VIO) is widely used for mobile robot localization in indoor areas. Recent studies show that integrating global sensors such as ultra-wideband (UWB) into VIO can improve long-term robustness, but existing multi-sensor fusion schemes still face challenges. First, visual feature tracking, a core component of VIO, is easily degraded under low-texture, low-light, or fast-motion conditions, where current visual enhancement methods remain ineffective. Second, most fusion strategies are constrained to a single coupling paradigm (loose/tight) and a single estimation scheme (filter/optimization), which makes it difficult to jointly balance accuracy, efficiency, and robustness. To address these issues, we propose EVIU-link, an event-based VIO-UWB fusion framework. The key innovations are twofold: (1) an event-enhanced vision module, where feature-density monitoring dynamically triggers event-flow tracking to maintain robust feature matching under challenging visual conditions; and (2) a hierarchical fusion strategy that performs local pose estimation within a VIO-UWB constrained factor graph, while simultaneously applying UWB ranging constraints at the global level to correct accumulated drift. Experiments on public datasets and real-world indoor scenarios demonstrate that EVIU-link achieves superior performance in challenging environments, indicating its promising application potential."

    "abstract": "Remote sensing imagery is often degraded by atmospheric scattering and suspended particles, which suppress brightness, distort colors, and obscure fine details. To mitigate these degradations, we introduce a dehazing approach termed BDSA that integrates brightness decomposition with saturation adjustment to restore visual clarity and fidelity. Specifically, our first performs a nonlinear transformation on the luminance channel of the YCbCr color space, wherein a logarithmic modulation scheme is applied to strengthen the visibility of dark regions while an exponential modulation strategy is simultaneously adopted to retain the fidelity of bright structures, thereby ensuring balanced enhancement across the entire dynamic range of the image. Meanwhile, we employ a multi-scale gamma correction strategy in the RGB space to generate image sequences with varying exposure levels, and calculate a saturation adjustment factor combining luminance and color difference information to restore color. Finally, we employ a multi-scale feature fusion strategy to extract structural features and texture details at different resolution levels, progressively guiding the reconstruction of high-quality remote sensing images. Extensive experimental results clearly demonstrate that our BDSA method consistently achieves superior dehazing performance across a wide range of remote sensing scenarios, empirically validating its advantage over state-of-the-art approaches in terms of contrast enhancement, detail restoration, and color fidelity."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel fiber Bragg grating (FBG)-based sensor for precise 2-degree-of-freedom (DoF) ankle angle monitoring. The proposed sensor primarily comprises two symmetric torsion springs, a planar spring, and three FBG-embedded optical fibers. Symmetric torsion springs are employed to measure plantarflexion/dorsiflexion (PF/DF) rotation, while a planar spring targets inversion/eversion (INV/EVE) motion, effectively minimizing cross-axis interference due to their distinct stiffness characteristics. Crucially, the sensor's high in-plane compliance accommodates the physiological shift of the ankle’s rotation center, enabling enhanced wearing comfort. Moreover, a symmetric differential fiber configuration compensates for rotation-axis variations and ensures high measurement accuracy. Structural optimization was conducted to maximize sensitivity and minimize crosstalk. Experimental results demonstrate high sensitivities of 37.09 pm/° (PF/DF) and 224.70 pm/° (INV/EVE) over ±55° and ±23°, respectively. The structural decoupling is validated by a low maximum crosstalk of 3.56%. Furthermore, the sensor maintains accuracy against rotation center offsets, with sensitivity deviations kept below 2.8% under a 2-mm misalignment. Dynamic tests at 50°/s and 300°/s yielded maximum root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) of 2.47° and 1.27° for PF/DF and INV/EVE, respectively. Finally, on-body validation, including seated range-of-motion tests, squat-to-stand exercises, and level walking, confirmed the sensor's ability to capture high-fidelity kinematic profiles for rehabilitation applications."

    "abstract": "Facial identification in consumer electronics is increasingly threatened by deepfakes, requiring robust and adaptive defenses. Modern generative adversarial networks (GANs) and diffusion models generate highly realistic forgeries that bypass conventional verification, particularly in resource-constrained and compressed-input settings. Current deepfake detectors face two critical challenges: i) they suffer from catastrophic forgetting when learning sequential forgery types, and ii) they remain vulnerable to adversarial perturbations. These issues are addressed in isolation with continual learning that reduces forgetting but neglects robustness. Conversely, adversarial defenses improve resilience but fail to retain prior knowledge. This paper proposes a novel framework, Forgery-Robust Continual Learning (FRoCL), a unified approach that balances plasticity, stability, and robustness. FRoCL integrates supervised learning with knowledge distillation, feature alignment, contrastive objectives, and adversarial consistency, supported by an uncertainty-driven replay buffer under strict memory constraints. Extensive experiments on FaceForensics++, Celeb-DF, and DFDC under sequential clean and adversarial task protocols show that FRoCL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving less than or equal to 5% forgetting and up to 40% improvements in adversarial robustness, while preserving efficiency at inference. These findings confirm the potential of FRoCL as a practical and future-proof solution for integrating forgery detection into consumer electronics."

Here, we review recent advances in GaN devices for transportation electrification. We first examine the industrial multilevel framework of device reliability qualification for automotive applications, aiming to better inform device researchers of application requirements. We then survey recent GaN device innovations targeting higher voltages and improved robustness. We also discuss monolithic bidirectional switches (MBDSs) and their enabling advantages in ac power conversion.

However, conventional received signal strength indicator (RSSI)-based handover mechanisms often lead to high latency, frequent handover, and ping-pong effects in dynamic settings. This paper proposes a novel two-stage handover strategy to optimize WiFi transitions in mobile environments. In the first stage, a deterministic access-point nomination is performed based on instantaneous throughput. The second stage integrates fuzzy-inspired stability checks to mitigate frequent handover and ping-pong affects. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed framework addresses a trade-off between responsiveness and stability. In terms of throughput and latency, the proposed scheme outperforms traditional fuzzy-based policies under competitive handover and ping-pong conditions, while maintaining performance comparable to the deterministic RSSI-based approach, with significantly reduced handovers and ping-pong events."

    "abstract": "Wind turbines are a key technology in sustainable energy generation, but their performance is often challenged by strong aerodynamic disturbances, parameter uncertainties, and rapidly varying operating conditions. Achieving reliable maximum power point tracking (MPPT) under such conditions requires control strategies with fast dynamic response and strong robustness. This paper proposes a robust high-gain control scheme for MPPT of variable-speed wind turbines. The method uses high-gain feedback to enforce accurate rotor speed tracking while attenuating the effects of unmodeled dynamics and external disturbances. By appropriately tuning the gain parameters, the controller achieves rapid error convergence without sacrificing robustness or stability. A rigorous Lyapunov-based analysis establishes closed-loop stability under model uncertainties. Simulation studies, conducted under both smooth and highly turbulent wind profiles, demonstrate that the proposed high-gain control achieves faster tracking, improved disturbance rejection, and higher energy capture efficiency, while maintaining smooth control actions suitable for practical implementation."

This work introduces a novel optimization framework based on Quantum-Inspired Hybrid Swarm Intelligence (QiHSI), in which quantum-inspired mechanisms are embedded within a multi-objective salp swarm optimization process to strengthen global search capability and preserve population diversity in complex, high-dimensional decision spaces. In addition, a decision-maker-in-the-loop strategy is incorporated to incorporate adaptive expert guidance, enabling the optimization process to respond dynamically to changing design priorities and system constraints. The effectiveness of QiHSI is assessed using established multi-objective benchmark problems as well as a practical ADAS calibration scenario. Experimental comparisons with several state-of-the-art evolutionary and swarm-based algorithms, including MSSA, MOPSO, MOEA/D, SPEA2, NSGA-III, and RVEA, show that the proposed method consistently produces well-distributed Pareto-optimal solutions with faster convergence and improved adaptability. These findings demonstrate that QiHSI offers a reliable and scalable approach for intelligent ADAS calibration, supporting the development of more responsive, efficient, and safety-oriented autonomous driving technologies."

This paper analyzes the feasibility of Power-Domain Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (PD-NOMA) as a complement to Multiple-Input Multiple-Output Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) in dense 6G cellular networks. Using an open-source simulation framework developed on Sionna 0.16, we model MIMO systems with <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$1\\times 2,\\ 2 \\times 2$</tex>, and <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$4 \\times 4$</tex> antenna configurations. We incorporate PD-NOMA by superimposing two non-orthogonal streams per MIMO layer under clustered delay line channel models from 3GPP Technical Report 38.901, while preserving the same spectral efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate that PD-NOMA can double the number of streams (or users) with minimal Eb/N0 overhead. In non-line-of-sight environments, reception diversity helps mitigate the resulting interference, whereas line-of-sight scenarios benefit from stronger channel eigenvalues, which reduce error propagation. We further quantify the influence of power allocation ratios and MIMO order on the block error rate, providing practical guidelines for system parameter tuning under diverse channel conditions. Finally, we analyze limitations due to interstream interference remaining after minimum mean square error detection and propose residual leakage metrics, highlighting open research challenges in advanced interference cancellation. Overall, the results support PD-NOMA as a low-complexity and costeffective strategy for enhancing spatial capacity in 6 G networks, assuming sufficiently accurate channel state information and feasible iterative decoding at the receiver."

Based on the reverse deduction of the three-step theory of photoemission, this paper systematically elaborates on the basic principles of Inverse Photoemission, constructs a three-step physical model that includes photon generation by electron incidence, photon transport, and photon escape at the interface, and employs the Monte Carlo numerical simulation method to conduct quantitative analysis of each stage. The probability of photon excitation by electrons is calculated using the bremsstrahlung differential cross-section. Combined with random sampling, the photon transport trajectory and energy loss are simulated. The Fresnel equations and critical angle criterion are applied to analyze the laws of interface reflection and refraction. Simulation results of 100,000 electrons show that the probability of emitted photons is stable and consistent with the data reported in existing literature, which verifies the reliability of the proposed model. This study provides a theoretical and simulation framework for the research on the unoccupied electronic structure of materials."

However, standard deep learning models often struggle with opacity, failing to explicitly learn interpretable and invariant features across different domains. To overcome this limitation, we present a novel framework: the Learnable TQWTEnhanced Unrolling Net (LTQU-Net). This method synergizes signal processing with deep learning through two key mechanisms. First, we introduce a differentiable TQWT Subband Alignment and Fusion module, which allows for the end-to-end extraction of physically interpretable time-frequency signatures. Second, by leveraging the deep unfolding paradigm, we map the iterative sparse coding optimization into a fixed-depth neural network, thereby inheriting the theoretical transparency of dictionary learning. Coupled with tailored objective functions, LTQU-Net is optimized for robust cross-domain performance. Experiments on public benchmark confirm that our approach not only outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in accuracy but also offers a transparent solution suitable for intelligent industrial monitoring."

This accurate approach enables precise identification of relevant events, even in noisy conditions. The proposed methodology was experimentally validated using trapezoidal profiles in velocity designed to present jerk pulses at known time instants.

    "abstract": "Melanoma, the most dangerous form of skin cancer, requires early and accurate automated diagnosis to improve patient prognosis. While state-of-the-art deep learning models, particularly Vision Transformers (ViT), achieve high diagnostic accuracy, their inherent computational complexity and excessive parameter count (often exceeding 80 million parameters) create significant barriers to practical deployment in resource-constrained clinical settings. To specifically address this critical efficiency challenge in dermoscopic image diagnosis, we introduce the Compact CNN-Transformer (CCT), an optimized hybrid architecture. The CCT ingeniously combines the local feature extraction capabilities of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with the powerful global dependency modeling strengths of standard Transformers, all within a highly efficient framework. Evaluated on a comprehensive skin lesion dataset, the CCT achieves competitive diagnostic performance with 0.85 accuracy and F1-score, demonstrating strong generalization. Our comparative analysis reveals a critical balance: the CCT achieves this high performance with only 4 million parameters, representing a parameter reduction of over 95% compared to the standard ViT while incurring a marginal performance loss of only 1-2%. Furthermore, the CCT exhibits superior deployment efficiency, requiring low FLOPs and low inference latency. This optimal balance between diagnostic performance and model complexity makes the CCT a highly viable and efficient solution for automated skin lesion classification in low-resource clinical environments."

In recent time, significant decrease in voltage control is observed during switching-in of 765kV shunt reactors at the nodes located in close proximity to Renewable Energy Source Generating (RES) plants. During these switching-in operations, the shape of voltage curve in the time series (observed by using phasor measurement unit) is also found different from other nodes directly connected with load or thermal generation. This paper aims to establish the relation between reduction of effective voltage control gained by switching-in a shunt reactor with the reactive resources installed at RES plants connected to same or surrounding nodes. Authors have also shared observations of real-time / live system trial operation that confirm the reactive resources installed at RES plants as a source of additional reactive power supply that is causing reduction of voltage control."

Construction projects identify and monitor risks that may impact them; some of these risks in the specified context have been acknowledged. However, literature indicates that significant effects are not adequately addressed as the project progresses. The study adopts a mixed-methods approach, integrating quantitative surveys, structured interviews, and data analysis from a representative sample of 239 business establishments in the Marly neighborhood (N = 636, 95% confidence). The results reveal significant financial pressures due to reduced sales and disrupted pedestrian flow during the construction process, predominantly affecting small and medium-sized enterprises. Furthermore, the study shows a deterioration in community safety, an increase in financial vulnerability, and additional operational costs for many business owners. Nevertheless, the majority of businesses remain resilient and continue their operations by employing strategies to cope with financial stress while retaining employment and preserving their services. This case underscores the necessity for policymakers, stakeholders, and city planners to account for the social and economic impacts of major infrastructure projects. Implementing mitigation mechanisms, fostering community participation, and employing a holistic framework can contribute to reducing adverse effects and strengthening the resilience of local businesses and communities. The study's findings provide valuable empirical insight and may guide future mass transportation initiatives toward socially responsible, environmentally sustainable, and broadly beneficial outcomes for all stakeholders."

This paper develops a novel dynamic landing control framework for the UAVUSV to carry out high-precision path-following mission. The main features of the developed scheme are threefolds: (a) The logic virtual aircraft and the logic virtual ship (LVA-LVS) guidance principle is constructed to generate reference route and signals for the UAV-USV system. A triggered rule is designed based on the distance boundary to reduce the continuous update for the attitude signals to the controller. (b) The prescribed performance control (PPC) method is introduced to ensure the convergence of position errors to the prescribed region even the initial condition is inconsistent. The output errors of the UAV will be transformed by using the transformation function to be stabilized. Moreover, the L-function is used to approximate the external disturbances and the nonlinearity terms. (c) Semi-Globally Uniformly Ultimate Boundness (SGUUB) stabilities of the closed-loop control system are guaranteed via the Lyapunov theory. Finally, the advantages and validity of the proposed algorithm are evaluated through the simulation experiments."

    "abstract": "Integrating multimodal radiological images and clinical data is critical for survival prediction in rectal cancer. However, existing methods often lack sufficient consideration of 1) modality heterogeneity (caused by rectal peristalsis, noise artifacts, and missing modalities) and 2) site heterogeneity (caused by different imaging protocols and patient populations). These factors hinder the model from capturing reliable cross-modal relationships and adapting to distribution shifts across clinical sites. In this work, we propose UICSurv, a novel multimodal Survival prediction framework highlighted by Uncertainty-guided Iterative Contrastive fusion, to capture robust cross-site multimodal interactions while leveraging sample-level uncertainty to enhance fusion reliability. Specifically, UICSurv initializes a shared multimodal embedding and iteratively refines it by fusing each heterogeneous modality via the cross-attention mechanism. In each iteration, a novel Survival Contrastive Learning (SCL) strategy is designed to progressively enhance both cross-site alignment and survival discriminability of the multimodal embedding space. Moreover, we design an EvidenceHit module, which employs temporally consistent evidential learning to jointly estimate survival probabilities and uncertainty. The estimated uncertainty further guides the embedding alignment by reducing the interference of unreliable samples. All components operate synergistically within UICSurv to reinforce reliable survival prediction in rectal cancer. Extensive experiments on multimodal datasets of rectal cancer (collected from three sites) demonstrate the superiority of our method both in survival prediction and uncertainty estimation. The code is available open-source: https://github.com/ScorpioBao/UICSurv."

    "abstract": "Fine-tuning (FT) large language models (LLMs) is crucial for adapting general-purpose models to specific tasks, enhancing accuracy and relevance with minimal resources. To further enhance generalization ability while reducing training costs, this paper proposes Federated LoRA with Dropout (FedLoDrop), a new framework that applies dropout to the rows and columns of the trainable matrix in Federated LoRA. A generalization error bound and convergence analysis under sparsity regularization are obtained, which elucidate the fundamental trade-off between underfitting and overfitting. The error bound reveals that a higher dropout rate increases model sparsity, thereby lowering the upper bound of pointwise hypothesis stability (PHS). While this reduces the gap between empirical and generalization errors, it also incurs a higher empirical error, which, together with the gap, determines the overall generalization error. On the other hand, though dropout reduces communication costs, deploying FedLoDrop at the network edge still faces challenges due to limited network resources. To address this issue, an optimization problem is formulated to minimize the upper bound of the generalization error, by jointly optimizing the dropout rate and resource allocation subject to the latency and per-device energy consumption constraints. To solve this problem, a branch-and-bound (B&B)-based method is proposed to obtain its globally optimal solution. Moreover, to reduce the high computational complexity of the B&B-based method, a penalized successive convex approximation (P-SCA)-based algorithm is proposed to efficiently obtain its high-quality suboptimal solution. Finally, numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in mitigating overfitting and improving the generalization capability."

However, their computational complexity and irregular memory access patterns pose significant challenges for deployment on FPGAs in hardware trigger systems, where strict latency and resource constraints apply. In this work, we propose JEDI-linear, a novel GNN architecture with linear computational complexity that eliminates explicit pairwise interactions by leveraging shared transformations and global aggregation. To further enhance hardware efficiency, we introduce fine-grained quantization-aware training with per-parameter bitwidth optimization and employ multiplier-free multiply-accumulate operations via distributed arithmetic. Evaluation results show that our FPGA-based JEDI-linear achieves 3.7 to 11.5 times lower latency, up to 150 times lower initiation interval, and up to 6.2 times lower LUT usage compared to state-of-the-art GNN designs while also delivering higher model accuracy and eliminating the need for DSP blocks entirely. This is the first interaction-based GNN to achieve less than 60 ns latency and currently meets the requirements for use in the HL-LHC CMS Level-1 trigger system. This work advances the next-generation trigger systems by enabling accurate, scalable, and resource-efficient GNN inference in real-time environments. Our open-sourced templates will further support reproducibility and broader adoption across scientific applications."

Four decision tree-based classifiers were implemented and evaluated using stratified train-test splits. Missing values were imputed using the k-nearest neighbors algorithm, and class imbalance was addressed through the application of the synthetic minority over-sampling technique. Among the models, CatBoost achieved the highest performance, reaching an area under the curve of 0.952, along with a sensitivity of 0.824 and specificity of 0.902, indicating a robust ability to classify both positive and negative cases correctly. SHapley Additive exPlanations analysis was conducted to interpret model predictions, identifying time to event months, HgbA1C, and eGRF baseline as the most influential features. These findings support the utility of CatBoost for severity classification in chronic kidney disease, particularly due to its effective handling of categorical variables and reliable predictive capabilities."

Both antennas are fed by stripline-based Wilkinson power dividers to improve the CP radiations. To improve the beamwidths and therefore the beam-scanning performance, a back-cavity structure is employed in the design. In addition, a quarter-wavelength opened stubs are integrated into the feeds of the elements, which is functioned as band-stop filters to suppress out-of-band radiation, and hence, the cross-band isolation can be improved. The phased array is prototyped and characterized experimentally, demonstrating the phased array antenna has a beam-scanning range of ±65° in both the K and Ka bands, respectively, with an average scanning loss of less than 4 dB."

    "abstract": "Suppressing dark noise in silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) remains highly challenging because Geiger-mode operation inherently leads to high dark count rates (DCR). Although epitaxial silicon layers grown on heavily doped substrates are widely employed, high-temperature epitaxial processing often induces dopant autodoping and the formation of interface states, which significantly exacerbate noise. In this work, we demonstrate that SiPMs fabricated on antimony (Sb)-doped substrates exhibit approximately 20% lower DCR, up to 40% higher photon detection efficiency, and about 15% improvement in single-photon timing resolution at an excess bias of 8 V, compared with their arsenic (As)-doped counterparts. These performance enhancements are attributed to the larger covalent radius and higher diffusion activation energy of Sb, which effectively suppress autodoping and minimize interface-state formation at the epitaxial–substrate boundary, thereby enabling low-noise, high-precision SiPM operation."

To tackle these challenges, we propose QUIDS, a QUality-informed Incentive-driven multi-agent Dispatching System, which ensures high sensing coverage and sensing reliability under budget constraints in NVMCS systems. QUIDS improves QoI by introducing a novel metric, Aggregated Sensing Quality (ASQ), designed to quantitatively capture the concept of QoI by integrating both sensing coverage and sensing reliability. Moreover, we develop a Mutually Assisted Belief-aware Vehicle Dispatching algorithm that estimates sensing reliability and allocates monetary incentives under uncertain vehicle conditions, thereby further improving ASQ. Evaluation using real-world data collected from a deployed NVMCS system in a metropolitan area demonstrates the effectiveness of QUIDS. The ASQ metric shows a 38% improvement over non-dispatching scenarios and a 10% enhancement over state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, QUIDS reduces reconstruction map errors by 39–74% across various reconstruction algorithms, validating its efficacy in improving QoI within NVMCS systems. Addressing the often-overlooked issue of sensing reliability in existing studies, the QUIDS system leverages non-dedicated vehicles and incorporates a quality-informed incentive-driven dispatching system to jointly optimize sensing coverage and sensing reliability. This enables low-cost, high-quality, and scalable urban environmental monitoring without the need for dedicated sensing infrastructure, and makes the system applicable to diverse smart-city scenarios such as traffic monitoring and environmental sensing."

However, most of these systems still rely on simple scoring rules or ID-based collaborative filtering that ignore rich multimodal food information (ingredients, cooking methods, images, nutrient profiles) and lack explicit nutritional reasoning. To address this gap, we propose <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">NutriRec</i>, a multimodal LLM-based framework for personalized dietary recommendation that links nutritional reasoning with collaborative dietary patterns.We uses a multimodal LLM to generate unified representations of meals and food items from textual descriptions, ingredient lists, nutrient profiles, and images, capturing both sensory and nutritional attributes. On top of these content-based embeddings, NutriRec incorporates collaborative filtering signals through a post-alignment mechanism that aligns user representations from an ID-based sequential model with those from the multimodal LLM. This design enables explainable dietary reasoning by grounding each recommendation in concrete nutritional evidence (e.g., lower sodium, higher fiber, heart-healthy tags) while still reflecting behavioral patterns learned from large-scale consumption logs. We evaluate NutriRec on realistic dietary recommendation scenarios with long-term, multimodal food interaction histories. Across these settings, NutriRec not only yields stronger recommendations than sequential and LLM-based baselines, but also provides more explainable dietary reasoning by explicitly linking suggestions to nutrient profiles, meal composition, and simple guideline-based constraints."

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising technique in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) by enabling distributed devices to collaboratively train models without sharing raw data. In FL, ensuring data privacy and secure authentication becomes essential due to the sensitivity of industrial data and the potential for adversarial attacks. This paper highlights a security flaw in a recently proposed FL authentication protocol designed for IIoT environments. Specifically, the scheme is analyzed to be susceptible to public-key replacement attacks. We propose a secure, lightweight authentication scheme for privacy-enhanced federated learning (SLAPE) to address vulnerabilities in participant registration, group key distribution, local data training, and aggregation processes. SLAPE leverages the Elliptic Curve Cryptography with the Chinese Remainder Theorem to support malicious group member traceability, revocation of compromised identities, and efficient batch verification of multiple messages. It effectively resists Type-I attacks that previous schemes could not, while also incorporating forward and backward security essential for IIoT applications. We rigorously demonstrate SLAPE’s resilience against prevalent threats through both formal and informal analyses. Our evaluation results indicate that SLAPE demonstrably enhances the security and privacy of existing schemes, with improvements in computational efficiency for both proof generation and verification, while keeping communication overhead relatively low."

Though both the perspectives are informative, their relationship remains unclear – the question of ”which one is better and under what circumstances?” is left open. In this paper, we introduce the probability-probability (PP) plot as a common framework for explaining the mathematical foundations of the CDF-based techniques, facilitating an intuitive understanding of different variant strategies. Then, we propose a novel distinguisher based on the Mann-Kendall test, where the key identification task is reformulated as a goodness-of-fit test checking whether a key-dependent sequence originates from a random binomial distribution. Compared to the existing methods, it delivers substantial gains within the CDF-based family. Finally, we explore the symmetry and dual counterpart of CDF in mathematics, developing an interesting technique based on the inverse cumulative distribution function (ICDF). We present a general discussion of its bridging role and, on this basis, establish the relationships among moment-based, ICDF-based, and CDF-based techniques, thereby enabling the evaluation of CDF-based techniques using metrics originally proposed for the moment-based family. Our theoretical analysis accounts for the empirical observations in practice, and further shows that the improvement achieved by the Mann–Kendall distinguisher is near-optimal."

However, existing schemes often encounter issues such as low re-encryption efficiency, inflexible access control, and susceptibility to collusion attacks. To address these challenges, we propose UR-CP-ABE, an efficient user revocation scheme built upon a double encryption method. Specifically, UR-CP-ABE stores both valid and revoked users' identity information in a binary tree. This design enables flexible user authority revocation by modifying only the binary tree's relevant secret sub-items. Moreover, the scheme limits the scope of revocation-induced binary tree updates to a single sub-item. This key optimization resolves the critical issue where re-encryption overhead scales linearly with the number of attributes of revoked users. In addition, we eliminate the possibility of attackers constructing secret sub-keys, preventing the collusion attacks. UR-CP-ABE also supports bidirectional revocation, allowing for the revocation and restoration of user rights, which is not available in other related schemes. Our theoretical analysis and experiments demonstrate that UR-CP-ABE has better performance than other schemes, especially in the re-encryption stages. Moreover, UR-CP-ABE has been proved to be secure based on the decisional <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">q-parallel BDHE</i> hardness assumption in the standard model."

However, their low signal-to-noise ratio and coherence variability pose challenges for large-scale screening. To address this, we develop a transfer learning–based convolutional neural network for automatic recognition of fault-related deformation in single wrapped interferograms. Built on SarNet and fine-tuned with globally curated Sentinel-1 data, the model achieves 92.25% validation accuracy (AUC 0.9689) with a low false-alarm rate. Cross-mission tests on ALOS-2 (L-band) and ENVISAT (C-band) confirm strong portability (accuracy 87.24%, precision 95.54%, recall 78.13%, F1 85.96%, AUC 0.9686), though recall decreases due to sensor-specific domain shifts. Grad-CAM visualizations indicate that the classifier relies on meaningful interferometric fringes rather than noise artifacts, supporting physical interpretability. These results show that transfer learning enables robust and scalable automated recognition of fault-related deformation, thereby supporting systematic, large-scale mining of multi-sensor InSAR archives."

This study investigates the role of Islamic mobile applications in enhancing religious engagement among Gen Z Muslims in Jakarta. Utilizing a framework based on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT/UTAUT2) and an extended Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), the study investigates how attitudes, behavioral intentions, and actual usage of Islamic apps are influenced by perceived utility, perceived ease of use, trust, privacy concerns, social influence, and habit, as well as how these elements affect religious engagement. An online survey was used to gather data from 210 Gen Z respondents, and Structural Equation Modeling with Partial Least Squares (SEM-PLS) was used to analyze the model. The results show that attitudes are considerably shaped by perceived ease of use, while attitudes and intentions are not much impacted by perceived usefulness. Actual usage is a powerful indicator of religious engagement, while social influence and habit are important determinants of behavioral intention. It's interesting to see that attitudes are positively impacted by privacy worries, indicating a privacy paradox among Gen Z consumers. By expanding technology acceptance models into the field of digital religion, this study advances both theory and practice by providing guidance to developers, educators, and legislators on how Islamic apps can encourage young people to engage in faith-based activities."

Based on an innovative test platform, on-state resistance degradations have been in-situ observed immediately after overcurrent stresses in both forward and reverse directions simultaneously. Furthermore, the similarities and distinctions in degradation effects caused by stresses have been demonstrated through the repetitive on-board test strategy. More severe degradation of on-state resistance has been observed under overcurrent stress in reverse conduction compared to forward conduction. With the help of TCAD simulations, the positive substrate voltage induced by reverse overcurrent has been verified to cause partial channel electrons to inject into the buffer layer. The injected electrons are subsequently captured by intrinsic traps leading to more pronounced on-resistance degradation, which is validated by C-V characterizations."

    "abstract": "Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), as an aerial extension of the Internet of Things (IoT) sensing layer, have played an increasingly important role in applications such as environmental monitoring, disaster assessment, and precision agriculture. These tasks can be uniformly abstracted as Coverage Path Planning (CPP), which aims to achieve efficient scanning and surveying while ensuring complete coverage of single or multiple disconnected regions. While single-region CPP has been extensively studied, in multi-region settings existing methods often rely on predefined coverage patterns to guarantee completeness, which to some extent limits their flexibility. Meanwhile, constraints on UAV energy and onboard computation impose higher performance requirements on planning methods. To address these challenges, this paper targets an energy-constrained multi-UAV cooperative scenario and proposes a cross-layer, energy-constrained path optimization framework based on multi-agent reinforcement learning (CLMPO-EC). Specifically, the framework organizes the overall task into two layers—CPP and multi-agent path planning—and, on this basis, integrates Back-and-Forth Planning (BFP) with multi-agent reinforcement learning under a centralized training and distributed execution paradigm to construct a unified, interactive, and structured environmental model. CLMPO-EC further introduces a lightweight cross-layer connection network that propagates raw state information to higher layers to enhance learning efficiency. In addition, building on BFP, an entrance–exit exploration factor is proposed to dynamically adjust the exploration probability of regional entrances and exits in CPP according to the training phase and batch, thereby improving the efficiency of searching for optimal solutions. Theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance in terms of optimality and efficiency."

    "abstract": "Digital and physical identity authentications are often implemented concurrently to meet strict access control for online services. Although privacy-preserving digital credentials provide strong guarantees such as anonymity and minimal disclosure, these benefits are compromised if holders must simultaneously present physical identification (e.g., government issued IDs) to establish ownership. To securely bind digital credentials to their physical holders while preserving privacy, a new protocol called card-based anonymous credentials (cbAC) was proposed by Hesse et al. (USENIX Security'23). However, this approach faces two significant drawbacks: the size of the communication during credential presentation scales linearly with the number of disclosed attributes, and it lacks revocability, which is essential for internal governance, including identity management and accountability. In this paper, we bridge the above gap by first introducing a constant-size two-party proof of knowledge protocol in asymmetry settings, where there exists a disparity in storage and computational resources between the two parties. Furthermore, building upon this two-party proof of knowledge protocol and utilizing signatures with randomizable keys, we meticulously design a cbAC scheme that is both efficient and capable of supporting revocation. We formalize all notions and conduct a rigorous security proof of the proposed construction. Finally, we present benchmarks from our implementation to illustrate the better than-state-of-the-art performance and features of our solutions."

However, existing ABKS schemes primarily cater to the single-owner model and lack effective mechanisms to trace or revoke access from malicious users who leak decryption keys. In this paper, we introduce TR-ABCKS, a traceable and revocable attribute-based conjunctive keyword search scheme. Designed for the multi-to- multi model, TR-ABCKS supports conjunctive keyword search and features an efficient revocation mechanism utilizing binary trees with multilinear maps to revoke access permissions from malicious users. Additionally, TR-ABCKS achieves white-box traceability, preventing malicious users from leaking decryption keys for economic gain. Our comprehensive security analysis confirms TR-ABCKS's semantic security, validated by experimental simulations, showcasing its effectiveness."

    "abstract": "Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) is critical for adapting pretrained models to specialized downstream tasks. Federated LLM fine-tuning enables privacy-aware model updates by allowing data owners (DOs) to contribute a global LLM without exposing local data. However, full-parameter fine-tuning in federated settings incurs significant computational and communication overhead, while frequent gradient exchanges increase the risk of privacy leakage, such as memorized data inference. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) with differential privacy (DP) offers a low-overhead alternative with formal privacy guarantees, but fails to strike privacy-utility tradeoff under heterogeneous privacy preferences: individual DOs may inject excessive DP noise to maximize privacy, whereas the curator aims to minimize noise to preserve model quality. In this paper, we present an innovative game-theoretical framework that enables dynamic privacy trading within differentially private federated LLM fine-tuning. In the game, DOs strategically adjust their local DP noise levels in exchange for customized incentives from the curator, thereby balancing privacy and utility. We begin by establishing a theoretical convergence bound that quantifies the influence of locally injected noise on the global model utility. Under this bound, we analytically characterize the pure-strategy Nash equilibrium of the game, accounting for DO heterogeneity, curator budget constraints, and noise estimation errors. For mixed-strategy settings with incomplete information, we design a hierarchical reinforcement learning algorithm that jointly learns DOs’ optimal noise-saving strategies and the curator’s optimal pricing policy without presupposing their private information. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed scheme improves DO utility, reduces curator cost, mitigates free-riding, and accelerates convergence compared to existing methods."

    "abstract": "Prostate cancer is one of the most prevalent causes of cancer in men in terms of cancer morbidity and mortality. Multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) has become more effective in tumor detection and characterization of lesions, yet it still has a significant problem of inter-reader variation and overdiagnosis, resulting in unnecessary biopsies. New developments in deep learning (DL) have proven to be able to complement or even substitute PI-RADS assessment, avoiding up to 49 percent of biopsies with high diagnostic accuracy. This paper models and tests an ensemble DL model with ResNet, EfficientNet, and Vision Transformer models, and trained on harmonized large-scale mpMRI data such as PI-CAI (10,207 cases of patients) and PROSTATEx (346 participants). The system was sensitive and specific at over 90 percent and AUC at more than 0.90 in the detection of clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa). Notably, the model decreased the number of unnecessary recommended biopsy by 25-30 percent and enhanced risk stratification accuracy in low, intermediate, and high risk groups. AI assistance when incorporated into the workflows of radiologists, enhanced diagnostic confidence, inter-reader agreement, and decreased the time of interpretation. The findings highlight the promise of DL-enhanced mpMRI to reduce overdiagnosis, improve treatment planning, and standardize of diagnosis of prostate cancer. The future research will be aimed at potential multi-center validation and the smooth incorporation of AI-assisted mpMRI into clinical workflows."

Even though the direct torque control exhibits first-rate dynamics, it has drawbacks like higher ripple content in torque and flux profiles and variable switching frequencies. The 5-phase induction motors have several benefits over conventional induction motor like additional fault tolerant capability, higher power/torque density, less weight. In this paper, a carrier based constant switching controller based DTC is proposed for open ended winding five phase induction motor. The proposed method reduces ripple content of torque and flux, current distortion by restricting the torque controller to follow triangular carrier wave without disturbing the general structure or simplicity of direct torque control method. The proposed method enhances the use of 5-phase induction motor in electrical vehicles and marine applications. The effectiveness of proposed method for ripple content of torque, flux and current distortion over traditional method is tested with the Simulation software."

    "abstract": "Underwater environment denoising and target recognition are vital tasks in underwater acoustic perception. Recent advances in deep learning have greatly improved these tasks, but their performance remains limited by the quality of sensor-acquired data. Fiber-optic hydrophones (FOHs) which are widely used in underwater acoustic data collection suffer from inherent phase noise. This noise introduces random perturbations to the captured data and hence reduces the effectiveness of learning-based methods. Embedding a reference sensor in FOH is a promising solution to reduce FOH phase noise, but is complex to be implemented. To address this challenge, this study proposes a simplified method for implementing a reference sensor-embedded FOH. In the proposed architecture, the signal and reference sensors are made all-passive and share a common input and output via time-division multiplexing. To reduce computational complexity in the demodulation, the conventional ellipse fitting algorithm is replaced with a self-orthogonal component superposition method for nonlinear distortion compensation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed FOH can suppress phase noise by up to 9.33 dB compared to conventional FOH, and achieves a Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) of -33.71 dB. Using the proposed FOH, deep learning-based environment denoising is improved by 3.73 dB and underwater target recognition accuracy is enhanced by 6.96%. These findings validate the effectiveness of the proposed FOH and highlight the significance of phase noise reduction in enhancing deep learning-based underwater acoustic perception."

In this work, we examine the coexistence of these two types of applications and propose a method through which to improve its efficiency. To this end, we model the performance of NarrowBand IoT (NB-IoT) latency and 5G New Radio (NR) throughput for IoT and 5G applications performance respectively. Using these models, we formulate two methods through which to statically divide bandwidth between the two networks. Further, we provide a Dynamic Spectrum Sharing (DSS) scheme, allowing NB-IoT users to opportunistically utilize unused 5G spectrum, minimizing unused spectrum. Finally, we reconsider the static bandwidth division methods with our DSS scheme enabled, showing that the addition of our scheme allows more bandwidth to be allocated to the 5G network, resulting in a higher tolerance for variance in the notoriously volatile 5G traffic distributions."

    "abstract": "The hybrid EEG-fNIRS Brain-computer interface (BCI) combines the high temporal resolution of electroencephalography (EEG) with the high spatial resolution of functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to enable comprehensive brain activity detection. However, integrating these modalities to obtain highly discriminative features remains challenging. Most existing methods fail to effectively capture the spatiotemporal coupling features and correlations between EEG and fNIRS signals. Furthermore, these methods adopt a holistic learning paradigm for the representation of each modality, leading to unrefined and redundant multimodal representations. To address these challenges, we propose a disentangled multimodal spatiotemporal learning (DMSL) method for hybrid EEG-fNIRS BCI systems, which simultaneously performs multimodal spatiotemporal coupling and disentangled representation learning within a unified framework. Specifically, DMSL utilizes a compact convolutional module with one-dimensional temporal and spatial convolution layers to extract complex spatiotemporal patterns from each modality and introduces a multimodal attention interaction module to comprehensively capture the inter-modality correlations, enhancing the representations for each modality. Subsequently, DMSL designs an adaptive multi-branch graph convolutional module based on reconstructed channels to effectively capture the spatiotemporal coupling features, incorporating modality consistency and disparity constraints to disentangle common and modality-specific representations for each modality. These disentangled representations are finally adaptively fused to perform different task predictions. The proposed DMSL demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on publicly available datasets for mental arithmetic, motor imagery, and emotion recognition tasks, exceeding the best baselines by 2.34%, 0.59%, and 1.47%, respectively. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of DMSL in improving EEG-fNIRS decoding and its strong generalization ability in BCI applications."

EEG signals were preprocessed and classified using two deep learning models: EEGNet and CCNN. Experimental results on a 12-class SSVEP dataset show that CCNN outperforms the other, achieving 90.28% accuracy versus 88,56% for EEGNet.

Comparative analysis showed that VAE and Transformer achieved high classification performance (accuracy > 90%), LSTM demonstrated superior capability in predicting actual energy sharing (kWh) with reduced RMSE and improved temporal stability. A Raspberry Pi 5- based prototype, communicated with smart meters via RS-485, MQTT, and dashboard for real-time visualization.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we had investigated how higher order sectorization can improve network performance in 6G mmWave environments. We had divided the area into more sectors and tested how it affects throughput, interference, and energy efficiency. The simulations showed that using more sectors helps to handle more users and keeps the signal strong even with obstacles like buildings blocking the way. We had used beamforming and power optimization to make the network work better. The results looked very much like real-world situations and showed how these techniques help in keeping connection stable and fast. This work gives a good way to make future wireless networks more efficient, reliable, and capable of serving many users in tough conditions. It's useful for next generation communication systems."

    "abstract": "Hashed Timelock Contracts (HTLCs) underpin atomic swaps and payment channel networks by combining a hashlock with a timelock, yet their economic soundness remains fragile under rational adversarial behavior. We analyze the griefing attack, in which an adversary withholds the preimage until expiry to immobilize an honest counterparty's liquidity at negligible cost, thereby imposing material opportunity loss without risking principal. To formalize this asymmetry, we develop a game-theoretic model together with a Python-based, discrete-time simulation framework that quantifies both the attacker's cost and the victim's lock duration under realistic protocol timelines. Building on this foundation, we propose the Commitment Bond HTLC (CB-HTLC), a lightweight mitigation that requires the initiator to post a small, non-refundable bond prior to lock creation. This bond introduces an unavoidable, upfront cost that converts strategic delay into a strictly loss-making action, restoring incentive alignment for rational participants. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that, whereas the classic HTLC permits zero-cost griefing with full-duration liquidity lock, CB-HTLC reshapes the payoff landscape: the attacker's inaction becomes economically irrational while atomicity and liveness for honest participants remain intact. Crucially, the mechanism is lightweight, protocol-agnostic, and immediately deployable, offering a rare example of a security enhancement that is both effective and practical without disruptive network-wide upgrades. Our contri-butions-formalization of griefing as a strategic game, development of an open simulation tool, and empirical evidence that commitment bonds realign incentives-advance HTLC-based systems toward genuine economic robustness rather than cryptographic sufficiency alone."

    "abstract": "Aerosols and particulate matter (PM) play a significant role in altering atmospheric composition and radiative balance through complex physical and chemical processes. Understanding their optical and mass characteristics is essential for evaluating both climate forcing and air quality. In the present study, ground-based measurements of particulate matter (PM 2.5 and PM 10) obtained from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) were compared with satellite-retrieved Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) at 500 nm from the AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) over Jaipur, India. The analysis covers the period from April 2018 to November 2024 and aims to examine the interrelationship between AOD and PM concentrations under varying seasonal conditions. Results indicate that both AOD and PM levels reach their maximum during the pre-monsoon season, while relatively high values are also recorded in winter months due to stagnant meteorological conditions. The lowest AOD values occur during spring, corresponding to cleaner atmospheric conditions. A gradual decline in AOD and PM levels during successive winters suggests a possible reduction in biomass burning and industrial emissions. The observed strong correlation between AOD and PM underscores the reliability of AOD as a proxy for surface aerosol loading."

    "abstract": "This study employs Bayesian methods to analyze the level of knowledge and awareness about tuberculosis (TB) among patients. Using survey data, we estimate posterior distributions of awareness levels and examine associations with demographic factors, treatment adherence, and outcomes. The Bayesian framework allows for robust inference even with small or uncertain samples, integrating prior knowledge with observed data to yield credible intervals and probabilistic interpretations. Objectives: To study the effect of different demographic and socio-economic factors on awareness of tuberculosis (TB). Methods: The study was conducted from January, 2021 to March 2021, employing a expressive, observational research design with a quantitative approach to explore the awareness of tuberculosis (TB) patients in the Dhemaji district of Assam, India. Results: Results indicate that age, occupation, and alcohol consumption are significant predictors, as their 95 % credible intervals do not include zero, suggesting a reliable positive association with the outcome variable. Specifically, older individuals, those in certain occupations, and those who consume alcohol tend to have higher predicted values on the outcome. In contrast, variables such as sex, caste, educational level, and smoking status do not show statistically significant effects, as their credible intervals span zero, indicating considerable uncertainty in their influence. Overall, the model suggests that demographic and behavioral factors like age and alcohol use play more consistent roles in shaping the outcome than socio-cultural indicators like caste or education. Conclusion: This analysis demonstrates that age, occupation, and alcohol consumption are robust and statistically significant predictors of the outcome, each exhibiting a clear positive association. In contrast, variables such as sex, caste, educational attainment, and smoking status show no meaningful or consistent effects, suggesting their limited relevance within the current model. These results highlight the critical influence of demographic and behavioral factors-particularly age and lifestyle choices-on the outcome of interest. Moreover, model comparison metrics (DIC, Log Marginal Likelihood, and log Bayes Factor) strongly and consistently favor Prior1, indicating that its underlying assumptions provide a markedly better fit for the data. Together, these findings offer valuable insights for targeting interventions and refining predictive models."

Traditional offloading strategies often struggle to balance real-time responsiveness, energy efficiency, and knowledge retention in heterogeneous vehicle clusters. To address these issues, this paper proposes a federated continual reinforcement learning framework with asynchronous updates and spatiotemporal knowledge fusion. An optimized multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm with lazy agent updates (OMADDPG-LA) is introduced to reduce policy conflicts while improving communication efficiency. Additionally, a spatiotemporally decoupled knowledge retention mechanism adjusts parameter importance weights based on vehicle-specific behaviors and incorporates generative replay to alleviate storage constraints. A federated aggregation paradigm with credibility-aware weighting further enhances adaptability to dynamic tasks. Experimental results show that the proposed framework significantly improves information freshness, energy efficiency, and communication overhead compared to existing methods. It also achieves better convergence stability under dynamic conditions, providing a privacy-preserving and scalable solution for collaborative intelligence in large-scale VANETs."

    "abstract": "Using training-free (TF) metrics as proxies for network performance is an effective and efficient approach in neural architecture search (NAS). Recent studies have shown that TF metrics can outperform training-based metrics in identifying robust networks when integrated as search objectives in both single-objective and multi-objective evolutionary NAS (ENAS) methods. However, prior work has typically evaluated robustness without applying adversarial training. While adversarial training can improve the robustness of deep neural networks, it has the drawback of reducing performance on clean data. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of ENAS with two types of performance metrics (i.e., training-based and training-free) in discovering networks that simultaneously achieve high accuracy on both clean and adversarial data. Extensive experiments on NAS problems built upon the newly proposed adversarial NAS benchmark (i.e., NAS-RobBench-201) demonstrate that multiobjective ENAS with TF metrics as search objectives can efficiently identify networks with high performance on clean data and strong robustness against various adversarial attacks."

In this regard, we consider federated learning (FL)-trained deep neural networks for distributed anomaly detection on IoT device data collections and report anomalies on a permissioned blockchain database to achieve tamper-proof auditability measures. When we simulated the network (using NS3 and a blockchain simulator) under various trouble scenarios, the ML-enhanced system could detect cyber-attacks (e.g., data exfiltration, DDoS, and malicious device behavior) with $\\mathbf{{\\gt} 9 5 \\%}$ accuracy and also considerably reduced the false alarms compared with the baseline methods. Blockchain only provides data visibility and traceability for supply chain events. The following are our contributions: (1) proposing a new federated ML framework for distributed anomaly detection in IoT supply chains, (2) designing a layer on the blockchain to store alerts and trained models, and (3) performing a comprehensive simulation study of the overall system, which demonstrates how combining both systems surpasses non-ML or non-blockchain configurations.

The evaluation of NoC design performance depends mainly on simulation, which becomes very slow with increasing architectural size and needs more information about how different design parameters affect the actual performance of the network. As a result, using simulation for optimization is exceedingly challenging, and these systems must be verified using distinct simulated traffic flows of various topological sizes. Thus, we present a Machine Learning (ML) framework to examine the design parameters of 2D and 3D NoC architectures paired with multiprocessing since these need to be evaluated on different configurations. The Multiprocessing Regression Framework (MRF) is the name of this framework. By utilizing different machine learning regression models, this approach forecasts NoC parameters while considering a range of various simulated traffic flows. The proposed approach can be tested on 2D and 3D NoC designs and may be used to analyze performance, area, and power architectures. The outcomes were compared with those produced by the popular cycle-accurate Booksim NoC simulator. Topology sizes ranging from 2×2 to 50×50 were tested alongside varying injection rates, virtual channels, and various network traffic behaviors.

The proposed framework integrates the coupled dynamics of the propulsion system, hierarchical control architecture, and hull surge motion within a single circuit-theoretic structure, enabling a consistent representation of electrical, mechanical, and hydrodynamic interactions. Key dynamic phenomena including torque generation, inertial responses, and hydrodynamic loads are represented through electrical equivalents, enabling a computationally efficient yet physically interpretable simulation environment. The control system, from ship speed regulation to motor-drive control, is modeled as a hierarchical set of circuit-level submodels that retain domain-specific dynamics and their interdependencies. Model validation is performed via two complementary approaches. First, a switching-based simulation model is developed to verify dynamic motor behavior under no-load conditions, demonstrating consistency in predicted q-axis current, motor speed, and electromagnetic torque. Second, experimental validation focuses on steady-state propulsion characteristics, including thrust, propeller torque, effective power, and self-propulsion point. All ECM parameters are derived from scaled experimental measurements, including towing tank resistance and propeller open-water tests. The proposed model offers structural scalability and extensibility, positioning it as a foundation for real-time simulation, system-level co-design, and digital twin development in next-generation electric and hybrid-electric marine vessels."

    "abstract": "To ensure the stable operation and passenger comfort of fuel cell vehicles, vehicle-level thermal management plays a vital role. Under high-temperature conditions, the control of air-conditioning compressor speed and chiller valve opening is particularly important, as these actuators directly affect both the cabin temperature for passenger comfort and the battery temperature for system safety and durability. Integrated thermal management systems can improve efficiency and thermal performance in such scenarios, yet the strong coupling among subsystems significantly increases the difficulty of accurate modeling and control design. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a control-oriented modeling framework based on a physics-informed neural network. First, conventional state-space models of the high-temperature thermal management system are obtained. Then, the Gated-Recurrent-Unit (GRU) based encoder-decoder neural network is trained in a physics-informed manner, allowing it to capture the underlying dynamics of the system. This hybrid approach improves modeling accuracy while preserving the interpretability. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed model achieves better input–output accuracy compared with both traditional neural networks and conventional state-space models. With a relatively small number of network parameters, the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of the step-by-step prediction for the cabin and the battery are only 0.030 K and 0.023 K respectively, and the maximum errors are 0.916 K and 0.629 K respectively. The developed model therefore establishes a solid foundation for advanced thermal management strategies, such as neural network-based model predictive control, in the future development of fuel cell vehicles."

This paper provides a critique of existing UAV threat landscape, and discusses a number of vulnerabilities at the physical, software and communications levels. To provide some context, we explore key systems (ground control and communications station, on-board flight systems, UAV-based communications networks) and make systemic comments regarding vulnerabilities at each layer to jamming, spoofing, false data injection, and unauthorized access. In addition, we investigate protective mechanisms (cryptography, AI based mechanisms, resilient architectures, etc.), and active avenues of research that must be addressed if secure deployments are to occur.

The variable gain stage utilizes a Gilbert-cell topology, chosen for its structural robustness against phase errors during gain control. The buffer stage is implemented using a common-source amplifier with neutralization capacitors, which ensures adequate gain and output power. The VGA is integrated into a common node of the four-element beamforming IC to provide additional gain control range and to correct offset gain errors between ICs in a multichip phased array module.

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a physics-informed reinforcement learning framework that integrates Euler-Lagrange dynamics constraints into robotic manipulation control. To address the challenge of maintaining physical consistency in contact-rich environments, the approach introduces three core innovations: a composite loss function that blends Proximal Policy Optimization objectives with torque-based regularization, a neural architecture featuring shared feature extractors with Exponential Linear Unit activations, and the use of genetic algorithms for hyperparameter tuning under physical stability constraints. The framework is implemented on a simulated robotic manipulator using NVIDIA Isaac Lab and demonstrates significantly improved convergence speed, higher task rewards, and enhanced dynamic consistency. The method also ensures accurate motion execution and stable contact behavior during complex manipulation tasks. Experimental evaluations highlight strong sim-to-real transfer capabilities, showcasing the potential of incorporating physics-based constraints to improve learning performance and reliability in robotic reinforcement learning."

    "abstract": "The littoral zone presents several operational challenges for most unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) due to strong breaking waves, obstacles in the surf zone, and close proximity to land. A novel amphibious vehicle, the cycloidal propeller unmanned underwater vehicle (Cyclo-UUV), was designed and developed to help overcome these challenges. The vehicle features two parallel tracks for ground locomotion and four retractable cycloidal propellers (cyclo-propellers) for better agility, disturbance rejection, and controllability underwater than vehicles that utilize conventional screw propellers. Due to the uniqueness of the design, little is known about its natural dynamics. As such, this article presents an experimentally derived linear state-space dynamics model of the Cyclo-UUV in forward level motion. Manual inputs were provided to perturb the vehicle from steady-state conditions to excite the system modes. System identification programs for aircraft were used to extract the bare airframe dynamics of the Cyclo-UUV using least squares parameter estimation between the inputs and outputs. The longitudinal and lateral dynamics were found to be coupled and featured two oscillatory modes, one stable and one unstable. These results further our understanding of cyclo-propeller UUV dynamics, and can help with the development of robust model-based controllers for autonomous undersea operations."

We benchmark five leading models-GPT4o, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Qwen 2.5-VL (72B), LLaVA 13B, and Llama 3.2 Vision (90B)-on the VQA-RAD dataset under a rigorous zero-shot protocol with standardized prompts and comprehensive precision-recall-F1 evaluation. Our empirical analysis reveals that Gemini 2.5 Pro achieves superior balanced performance (F1 <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$=0.77$</tex>, Accuracy <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$=0.76$</tex>, Recall <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$=0.81$</tex>), while Qwen 2.5-VL attains the highest precision (0.87) at the cost of reduced recall, exhibiting conservative prediction characteristics. These outcomes demonstrate that general-purpose MLLMs can perform competitively with specialized medical models in tasks such as modality and organ recognition but still struggle with abnormality detection and complex clinical reasoning. The findings reinforce that MLLMs currently serve best as assistive decision-support tools rather than autonomous diagnostic agents and highlight the potential of retrieval-augmented and context-aware strategies for improving clinical reliability and interpretability."

    "abstract": "To achieve the desired 5G goals, a network must be efficient and fair simultaneously, allowing high data rates for regular users while also equally serving low-power users. Static schedulers, as the name implies, don't change their scheduling policy regardless of the number of users, giving rise to the need for dynamic schedulers that can shift this paradigm by sensing the number of network users and other parameters and changing the scheduling policy accordingly, raising network efficiency and fairness. Thus, this work presents an optimization technique that uses the Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm and, later, trains a feedforward Neural Network (NN) to mimic the DE's decisionmaking to act as a dynamic Generalized Proportional Fair (GPF), adapting its two internal parameters assuring a threshold fairness while seeking a throughput maximization in a simulated 5 G Heterogeneous Network (HetNet). Results show that the method achieves a minimal 0.7 Jain's fairness index for most numbers of users, from 40 to 200 users, while having a better average throughput when compared to a related scheduler. It was also noted that using the created dynamic NN scheduler added only 0.03% to 0.57% in simulation runtime compared to GPF."

A detailed comparison between conventional NAND gates and MFSS-enhanced designs is carried out for 180nm, 90nm, and 45nm CMOS processes.

    "abstract": "This article proposes a novel graphical technique for identifying several sets of switching angle solutions with the same fundamental to mitigate different harmonics in a cascaded H-bridge (CHB) multilevel inverter with ultra-low switching frequency at fixed dc input. This technique is then applied on a three-phase seven-level CHB inverter for mitigating 50 lower-order harmonics with the limitation of three switching angles each quarter cycle. This ensures that the switching frequency is the same as the fundamental frequency. Using this technique, it is demonstrated that in more than 45% region of the available range of modulation indices, with just fundamental switching frequency, a seven-level inverter can mitigate all harmonics from its output line voltage up to the 50th order within the 5% range according to the IEEE 519-2022 standard. Apart from this, more than 20% region also provides a total harmonic distortion below the 8% value. The results obtained from the proposed graphical analysis are verified in simulation using MATLAB/Simulink software as well as hardware using an FPGA-based experimental prototype developed in the laboratory. Typical results are provided with three, four, and five switching angles in seven-level, nine-level, and three-level multilevel inverters respectively to validate the findings."

In this study, we explore how regular interactions with a social robot, conducted in a structured yet familiar environment within university halls and departments, can provide effective support for practising ER via cognitive reappraisal. Twenty-one students participated in a five-session study at a university hall or department in the U.K., where the robot (QTrobot, LuxAI), powered by a large language model (GPT 3.5) facilitated structured conversations, encouraging the students to reinterpret emotionally charged situations that they shared with the robot. Quantitative and qualitative results indicate significant improvements in ER, with participants reporting better understanding and control of their emotions, significant changes in constructive ER tendencies and positive effects on mood and sentiment after each session. The findings also demonstrate that repeated interactions with the robot encouraged greater emotional expression, including longer speech disclosures, increased use of affective language, and heightened facial arousal. Notably, expression peaked during key reappraisal moments, particularly when participants were prompted to reinterpret negative experiences. The qualitative feedback further highlighted how the robot fostered introspection and provided a supportive space for discussing emotions, enabling participants to confront long-avoided emotional challenges. These findings demonstrate the potential of robots to effectively assist in ER in familiar environments, offering both emotional support and cognitive guidance"

    "abstract": "Physical adversarial attacks have received increasing attention for their potential to deceive deep neural network–based perception systems. Among these, adversarial patches (printed perturbations) placed on clothing or objects have gained increasing attention, as they can modify person-detection models output while remaining visually inconspicuous. However, most existing methods target single models and often fail to maintain effectiveness across different detectors or physical transformations commonly encountered in surveillance settings. In our research, we introduced a universal adversarial Top-K Patch (TK-Patch), optimized to deceive multiple person detectors YOLOv3, YOLOv5, and YOLOv7 using a unified model-agnostic framework. Instead of relying on internal model access, TK-Patch leverages common objectness outputs and a Top-K loss strategy to guide optimization. The patch is trained using the labels from PASCAL-VOC and INRIA datasets and then made robust for handling varying lighting conditions, viewing distances and camera angles. To test the patches physically by printing it on a matte photo paper and to mimic real world deployment. The experiments shows a attack success of 85-90% across all the tested models, highlighting the success of our TK-patch and the feasibility of constructing a transferable physical adversarial patch attacks against the modern detectors."

Currently, diagnosis is primarily based on glycemic biomarkers such as plasma glucose, insulin, and the HOMA-IR index, which reflect metabolic alterations in advanced stages. This study aims to assess the capability of classifying individuals with T2D using lipid profiles and machine learning, while primarily excluding glucose-associated biomarkers. Anthropometric measurements are incorporated into the lipid profile to explore their potential contribution to diagnosis. Various classification algorithms were trained and validated, including Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and XGBoost. Exploratory statistical analyses and feature selection techniques were performed, as well as the evaluation and calculation of derived atherogenic indices such as TG/HDL and AIP. The results showed that the SVM model achieved the best overall performance, with an accuracy of 85.2%, an F1-score of 0.853, a precision of 85.1%, and an AUC value of 0.916. The RF and XGBoost models achieved sensitivities above 88%, with AUC values of 0.934 and 0.930, respectively, indicating their ability to identify patients with T2D accurately. These findings demonstrate that lipid profiles, in combination with non-glycemic features, can serve as an accessible and low-cost alternative to support the automated diagnosis of T2D, particularly in resource-constrained settings."

    "abstract": "The penetration of inverter-based renewable energy resources (IBRs), like solar and wind, into the power grid is rapidly increasing. The inverters that are used for connecting the IBRs to the power grid can be broadly classified as grid following (GFL) and grid forming (GFM) inverters. However, most of the existing inverters in the renewable energy plants are of GFL type. GFL inverters use phase-locked loops (PLLs) to synchronize to the power grid, whereas GFM inverters don’t need a PLL to stay synchronized to the grid. In the existing literature, it has been shown that the GFL inverters face stability issues in the weak grid, as the PLLs can go out of synchronization with the grid. In this paper, the authors provide power hardware-based experimental results on the stability improvement of a GFL inverter in a weak grid. The power hardware results show that the addition of a GFM inverter in parallel with the GFL inverter which is not stable in a weak grid, stabilizes the GFL after the addition. PSCAD simulation results also support the experimental observations."

    "abstract": "Image segmentation is a basic method that includes partitioning an image into meaningful components. Content-based image retrieval, robotics, medical imaging, and self-driving cars are just a few of the fields in which they find use. Over the past several years, numerous segmentation methods have been developed, each with its own set of benefits, drawbacks, and uses. Deep learning and traditional methods are two different types of image segmentation. Region-based techniques, thresholding, edge detection, and clustering fall under the traditional method. Deep learning has revolutionized the field with convolutional neural networks. Multilevel thresholding is among the strongest image segmentation techniques for grayscale and color images with complicated intensity distributions. By selecting many optimal threshold values, multilevel thresholding segments an image into several regions. To find optimal threshold values, optimization algorithms have been used. Otsu and Kapur methods are familiar methods for multilevel thresholding segments. The Kapur algorithm maximizes the entropy of each segmented area thus creating a more homogeneous distribution of pixel values in each category. The given paper gives an in-depth assessment and comparison of the various approaches to segmentation through the integration of optimization approaches into multilevel thresholding systems. We use related quantitative measures, such as PSNR, VOI, FSIM, SSIM and entropy, to compare the performance of multilevel thresholding by Kapurs criterion with other optimization methods including Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) Moth Flame Optimization (MFO) Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) Jaya Algorithm (JA) Artificial Bee Colony Optimization (ABC) and other optimization methods and discuss results. The study reveals the improvement of the quality of segmentation and efficiency of computations using optimization techniques."

To further improve network reliability, a supervised deep learning (SDL) framework is introduced to predict user distances and transmission power, thereby guaranteeing OP constraints and fulfilling the stringent requirements of ultra-reliable low-latency communications (uRLLCs). Analytical and simulation results show a strong consistency, demonstrating that the proposed SDL scheme achieves substantial reductions in computational complexity and execution time compared with conventional approaches."

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the cost-optimal design of a hybrid video distribution system that includes broadcast and unicast delivery networks. Broadcast costs are modeled based on the total bandwidth of all broadcasted channels, while unicast costs are based on the total edge traffic generated by users accessing unicast-delivered content. Using these models, we derive an expression for the system's overall operating cost and formulate an optimization problem to minimize it. Subsequently, we derive an analytical solution that reveals the lowest achievable cost, enables comparisons between hybrid and purely broadcast or unicast architectures, and explains the effects of key system parameters on the attainable operating cost. To validate our approach, we perform a numerical study using real-world TV channel audience statistics and realistic cost metrics for both delivery modes. The results confirm our theoretical findings."

    "abstract": "The increasing penetration of renewable energy, while essential for decarbonization, can intensify thermal-unit cycling and ramping, aggravate network congestion, and increase emissions during non-steady-state operating periods (i.e., start-ups, shutdowns, and fast ramping). Research indicates that carbon emissions during such hours could increase to 2–6 times those of steady-state operation hours. However, conventional studies often ignore the impact of intertemporal constraints on carbon measurements, leading to significant underestimation of carbon emission. To address this gap, this paper extends the locational marginal carbon emission (LMCE) framework by incorporating non-steady-state hours emissions through a convex-hull-based variant of LMCE (i.e., LMCE2) model. This approach clarifies the endogenous link between nodal prices and carbon intensity and ensures theoretical consistency between electricity pricing and carbon emission calculation. The LMCE2 can be efficiently computed using the Dantzig–Wolfe decomposition. We further derive LACE2 that mitigates carbon over-allocation. Our case studies demonstrate that rapid emission assessment during non-steady-state operation hours using LMCE2/LACE2, enables more trustworthy carbon accounting. Compared with traditional LMCE/LACE, the use of LMCE2/LACE2 reduces carbon measurement error by 83.5%–90.1%. The proposed framework offers practical tools for carbon management in electricity markets with high renewable shares."

    "abstract": "This paper focuses on SRAM-based Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) systems in space applications. These systems are vulnerable to Single Event Upsets (SEUs) which can lead to catastrophic failures. Fault tolerance is often used to mitigate these effects; however, this may require redundant components. If these components require relatively high FPGA resources, replicating them may not be feasible. Therefore, this paper proposes a fault-tolerant architecture based on the reconfigurable duplication one in the literature, which only requires one extra copy of the module. Using the multi-die technology, where the effect of SEUs is different on each die, a modified reconfigurable duplication architecture is proposed, requiring less area resources than the conventional one. Using Continuous Time Markov Chains (CTMCs), it is proven that, according to the system parameters, the proposed architecture may have a higher reliability than the conventional one. Furthermore, it is shown that the failure rate of one of the two redundant modules does not affect architecture reliability. The coverage of the error detection mechanism is also investigated, and it is shown that a small change in its value may have a significant effect on reliability."

Existing state-of-the-art TTA methods often rely on backward updates involving gradient computation, which incur additional training time and computational costs. Moreover, sample noise and the reality of micro-batch inference, where only a few images are available at a time, limit the model's ability to capture distributions. To overcome these obstacles, we propose a new backwardfree approach named Dynamic Entropy Guided Adaptation (DEGA). Our method combines two modules: the Distribution Adaptation Module prior Entropy (DAM-E), which updates batch normalization statistics using the mean entropy of initial predictions, and the Semantic Adaptation Module prior Entropy (SAM-E), which utilizes an entropy-based mask to select confident pixels for proto-type construction, guiding inference. We evaluate DEGA by adapting models pre-trained on GTA and SYNTHIA across five target domains, achieving strong performance without retraining or access to the source data.

    "abstract": "Digital simulation methods are transforming engineering education, offering accessible alternatives to practices traditionally dependent on physical resources. In the field of strength of materials, tensile testing—defined as a standardized method used to assess the response of materials under uniaxial tensile load—is essential for characterizing the mechanical behavior of metals, but its implementation in academic settings faces challenges such as excessive costs, equipment limitations, and irreversible sample destruction. Recent studies suggest that agent-based simulation models can mitigate these obstacles, although questions remain regarding their pedagogical effectiveness, technological evolution, and methodological rigor. Through a literature review, it is demonstrated that simulation models significantly improve the conceptual understanding of tensile testing by 35% compared to traditional methods, while reducing dependence on physical laboratories without compromising accuracy. These findings redefine the potential of simulations in engineering education, not only as logistical solutions but also as pedagogical tools that democratize access to experiential learning. The review proposes a framework for future research, highlighting the need to standardize quantitative assessments and evaluate socioaffective dimensions to integrate these types of simulations into academic curricula where infrastructure limit practical experiences."

    "abstract": "The extensive integration of inverter-based resources (IBRs) into the power grid challenges the traditional power sys-tem relaying philosophies. Grid-Forming Converters (GFMs), by emulating the dynamic characteristics of synchronous generators (SGs) and providing grid-support functionalities, have emerged as a promising solution for grid integration. GFMs are equipped with advanced control schemes that include current limiters that may impact how GFMs respond during grid disturbances. The study focuses on the impact of GFM current limiters on the impedance trajectory during power swing. Simulation tests conducted in PSCAD using the modified IEEE 9 bus system reveal that different current limiter methods have distinct impact on the impedance trajectory. Consequently, power swing detection may be affected depending on the type of current limiter used in the GFM control and whether the limiters are activated during a disturbance. These insights would be fruitful for future research in developing source-agnostic power-swing blocking or protection strategies."

This paper examines the mathematical basis, physical interpretation, and cost implications of infeasibility, drawing insights from India’s national SCED pilot. The Big M method, commonly used to maintain model feasibility through penalized constraint relaxation, is analyzed along with its impact on system marginal price (SMP), potential distortions, and calibration practices. Alternative approaches such as graded penalties and dual variable analysis are discussed as more robust methods to identify and manage constraint violations. Case studies demonstrate that infeasibilities often signal deeper structural gaps, limited ramping flexibility, congestion, or data errors. Pilot results show that even modest violations can escalate system costs and distort market signals. The paper recommends best practices in model design, penalty setting, and regulatory alignment to improve SCED outcomes, emphasizing its dual role as both an operational tool and investment diagnostic."

However, accuracy of conventional satellite-derived bathymetry is reduced at depth over 15 m with optical signal attenuation and training data insufficiency. To address this gap, here, we present an approach that synergizes ICESat-2 ATL24 photon-counting lidar data with Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery. A generative adversarial network (GAN) is implemented to offset dataset deficiency at deeper depths and a stratified convolutional neural network (CNN) is adapted to distinct optical-depth regimes. Bathymetry derived at Jiuzhang Atoll is in good agreement with the in-situ multibeam measurements with a mean absolute error of 0.75 m and a root-mean-square-error of 10% of the present maximum depth of 19 m, validating the effectiveness of GAN-driven sample synthesis to make up measurement inadequacy, and the enhancement of model generalizability across a wide depth range by stratified CNN. This approach could be applied to bathymetry mapping of coral reefs worldwide at depths of 15-30 m where biodiversity generally increases to the most with multi-source satellite observations."

This work investigates how humidity impacts the electromagnetic properties of microstrip antennas with textile substrate. Aiming at its use as a humidity sensor in hospital environments, polyester fabric was chosen as the substrate, which is one of the most widely used in the area. The analysis is based on the variation of the electrical permittivity of the textile material at different humidity levels. Using the HFSS software, an antenna with the same textile substrate was simulated, but with electrical permittivity and loss tangent values changed according to three stages of the fabric: dry, intermediate and completely wet. The results showed that increasing humidity increases the electrical permittivity of the substrate, resulting in a reduction in the resonance frequency (from 3.5 GHz to 1.6 GHz) and antenna gain (from 7.4 dB to -25 dB). This confirms the potential of microstrip antennas with textile substrate as humidity sensors for applications in the medical field, with the possibility of integration into wearable systems. Furthermore, it highlights the importance of complementary studies on the dielectric behavior of textile materials and the optimization of antenna geometry for different applications."

To address this challenge, this article proposes a comprehensive mathematical formulation for the O2O-SMD problem. This formulation integrates complex operational requirements, such as dish variety, pricing, nutritional balance, and profitability, into a unified optimization problem with well-defined objective and constraints. To efficiently solve the O2O-SMD problem, we propose a tensor-based ant colony optimization (TACO) algorithm. Distinct from traditional ant colony optimization (ACO) variants, the core of TACO lies in reformulating the fundamental ACO operations into a tensor computational structure, enabling parallel optimization over O2O-SMD tasks at the algorithmic level. Furthermore, a dedicated local search strategy is integrated to refine solutions and accelerate convergence of the algorithm. The performance of TACO is evaluated on real-world restaurant data and benchmark instances. The experimental results show that TACO significantly outperforms a wide range of comparison algorithms in terms of solution quality, scalability, and computational efficiency, confirming its effectiveness and practical value for real-world O2O-SMD problems."

    "abstract": "Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly deployed in applications ranging from surveillance to logistics, but their integration into cyber-physical systems exposes them to diverse cyber and physical intrusions. Traditional intrusion detection systems (IDS) often fail to capture both spatial and temporal dependencies in UAV telemetry, and they struggle with class imbalance and deployment constraints. To address these challenges, we propose a hybrid IDS based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) networks. The CNN layers extract low-level spatial representations from UAV communication data, while BiLSTM layers model long-range temporal dependencies. To mitigate class imbalance, Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) and a class-weighted cross-entropy loss were employed. Experimental evaluation on a multi-class UAV intrusion dataset demonstrates that the proposed model achieves a test accuracy of 94.09% and a macro-F1 score of 0.94, outperforming prior IDS architectures on minority attack classes. Furthermore, the model shows potential for edge deployment with low latency and a compact memory footprint, making it suitable for FPGA/SoC implementations. Future work will extend this framework to federated and swarm-based UAV intrusion detection systems, ensuring robust and scalable protection in dynamic UAV networks."

Our methodology leverages a multi-channel Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture to extract robust and highly discriminative features from distinct spectral bands, including Blue, Green, Red, and Near-Infrared. We then employ a weighted-sum score-level fusion technique to integrate the individual matching scores from each channel, capitalizing on the complementary strengths of both surface and subsurface palm characteristics. The proposed system is rigorously evaluated using the publicly available PolyU Contact-based and Multispectral Palm-print Databases. Our experimental results demonstrate a significant leap in performance, achieving a state-of-the-art Equal Error Rate (EER) of 0.01% on the contact-based dataset and an exceptional 0.005% on the multispectral dataset, which surpasses both conventional and prior deep learning-based methods."

    "abstract": "This study investigates the effects of a 7-day Panchakarma therapy on cardiorespiratory coordination by applying Cross Recurrence Quantification Analysis (CRQA), a non-linear dynamical systems method. The objective was to quantitatively assess therapy-induced changes in the complex, high-dimensional dynamics of the cardiorespiratory system using a nonlinear computational framework. An observational study was conducted with 30 patients diagnosed with ischemic heart disease and hypertension. Electrocardiogram (ECG) and respiratory signals were acquired before (day 1) and after the therapy (day 7). After a rigorous preprocessing pipeline, state-space reconstruction was performed using time-delay embedding, with parameters optimized via Average Mutual Information and False Nearest Neighbors algorithms. Cross-recurrence plots were generated from the synchronized signals, and 6 CRQA metrics were computed to quantify the system’s dynamical properties. Statistical significance was assessed using Wilcoxon signed-rank tests on $\\mathbf{1, 8 0 0}$ paired observations. CRQA revealed a significant restructuring of cardiorespiratory dynamics post-therapy. Key findings include a significant decrease in Recurrence Period Density Entropy (RPDE) ($\\mathbf{p}\\lt0.001$), indicating a reduction in complexity and an increase in regularity. Concurrently, significant increases in the longest diagonal (Lmax, $\\mathrm{p}\\lt0.001$) and vertical (Vmax, $\\mathrm{p}\\lt0.001$) line lengths were observed, signaling enhanced stability and longer periods of sustained coordination. The application of CRQA successfully decoded the subtle, positive impact of Panchakarma therapy on autonomic regulation. This work establishes a novel computational framework at the intersection of CRQA and integrative medicine, demonstrating how advanced nonlinear methods can objectively quantify the efficacy of complex therapeutic interventions, paving the way for data-driven personalized healthcare."

The influence of factors, including ambient temperature, insulated wire length, fixation method, and self-heating power, on the temperature measurement deviation was studied. The results indicate that within general engineering conditions, ambient temperature is the primary factor affecting the measurement deviation. Compared to the method of direct fixation using silicone rubber, covering the installation area with aluminum-coated film can reduce the temperature measurement deviation by approximately 10 %. Furthermore, an optimized method employing a high-thermal-conductivity holder can reduce the deviation caused by ambient temperature differences by nearly two orders of magnitude."

    "abstract": "Traditional ecological models often rely on a simplified set of deterministic or stochastic rules to govern individual agent behavior. This study investigates how the introduction of a more sophisticated, adaptive decision-making process, facilitated by a Large Language Model (LLM), impacts the dynamics of a predator-prey system within a heterogeneous niche patchy environment. Utilizing an agent-based modeling framework, we compare a baseline scenario (with fixed agent behaviors) against an experimental scenario where individuals' choices are guided by an LLM. Our findings reveal a profound shift in ecological outcomes. In the baseline model, the system exhibits rapid prey population growth, leading to resource over-exploitation and a subsequent population crash, ultimately resulting in prey dominance. In contrast, the LLM-driven system demonstrates a stable, co-existing population dynamic characterized by sustained oscillatory cycles. The analysis of mortality factors highlights this fundamental change: baseline individuals primarily succumbed to starvation, whereas in the LLM-driven system, predation became the dominant cause of prey mortality. Furthermore, the LLM's adaptive decision-making, which supports resource and predation feedback loops, prevented the over-exploitation of the heterogeneous environment, thereby promoting long-term ecological sustainability. These results suggest that LLM-based decision heuristics can introduce a novel, stabilizing regulatory mechanism into complex ecological systems."

    "abstract": "The growing complexity of Internet of Things (IoT) networks has generated massive multivariate time-series data at the edge, challenging traditional forecasting and anomaly-detection models due to limited computation, memory, and energy on edge devices. Quantum machine learning (QML) provides a promising solution through expressive, parameter-efficient models that align with these constraints. This study proposes two distinct quantum-classical approaches for edge-based IoT analytics. The first combines a Quantum Neural Network (QNN) with a Quantum Autoencoder (QAE) to deliver lightweight forecasting and anomaly detection. The second employs Quantum Long Short-Term Memory (QLSTM) networks, exploring multiple variants and introducing optimization strategies to enable efficient deployment on a Raspberry Pi 5 using PennyLane simulators. Both approaches are evaluated on two real-world IoT datasets Bker (weather parameters) and ETTm1 (transformer temperature) and with a unified preprocessing pipeline incorporating normalization and PCA-based dimensionality reduction. Results show that QLSTM variants achieve superior forecasting accuracy, while QNN+QAE ensures robust anomaly detection with minimal resource overhead. A lightweight QLSTM variant strikes the best balance between accuracy and inference latency, enabling real-time edge deployment. To our knowledge, this is among the first practical demonstrations of QML-based forecasting and anomaly detection directly on edge hardware, highlighting a feasible pathway toward quantum-enhanced IoT intelligence."

    "abstract": "Large-scale optimization involves numerous decision variables, creating significant computational challenges as the problem's complexity grows with increasing dimensions. Traditional approaches often struggle to handle vast search spaces efficiently, necessitating advanced techniques. Autoencoders, a key tool in dimensionality reduction, encode high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional latent space, capturing essential features while discarding noise and redundancy. This study investigates the integration of autoencoder-assisted mechanisms within evolutionary multi-objective optimization algorithms across four standard benchmark problems (ZDT1–ZDT3, ZDT6). By varying the proportion of original to learned solutions for 12 trials each, we evaluate the impact on convergence and diversity using Hypervolume (HV), Inverted Generational Distance (IGD), Generational Distance (GD) and Spread (delta) metrics. Results show that hybrid configurations with low high original population (90% original or 10% autoencoder) consistently outperform other settings, demonstrating a balanced trade-off between exploration and exploitation. While autoencoder guidance improves search efficiency in continuous and discontinuous Pareto fronts, it shows limited effectiveness in deceptive landscapes. The findings emphasize the need for adaptive hybridization strategies tailored to problem complexity."

Unlike the co-planar underactuated and thrust-tilting fully-actuated UAVs, the Bicopter position dynamics involve lateral force coupling with the attitude dynamics, and the global asymptotic stability (GAS) of the trajectories cannot be proved directly with the state-of-the-art geometric PD controllers on Special Euclidean group <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">SE</i>(3). This paper demonstrates that the Bicopter position trajectories using the geometric controller are ultimately bounded with a certain bound and exhibit a large domain of attraction through the Lyapunov technique. Moreover, when the bound is sufficiently small, the system exhibits almost GAS. The analysis further reveals that ultimate bounded stability is preserved even under external disturbances, yet with an increased bound. The position tracking performance and the robustness of the controller against large initial errors and mild wind disturbances are verified using MATLAB simulations. Further, the performance of the proposed controller is compared with the traditional PD controller, and it is found that the proposed controller requires less control effort to achieve the desired trajectories. A realistic software-in-the-loop (SITL) framework is also developed using the PX4 flight stack and Gazebo, based on an accurate Bicopter model, which is useful for controller analysis and parameter tuning. Finally, a lightweight Bicopter UAV prototype is developed in our laboratory, and the proposed controller is validated through outdoor position stabilization and trajectory tracking experiments. The results demonstrate that the Bicopter with the proposed controller is well-suited for outdoor applications, even under small external disturbances."

    "abstract": "Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is a rapidly evolving and highly promising technology for wireless networks, enabling the concurrent execution of communication and sensing functions within constrained spectrum resources. This paper examines a secure ISAC system assisted by an uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV), in which the extended Kalman filter is incorporated for accurate estimation and prediction of eavesdropper states. Radar signals are transmitted to track and jam potential eavesdroppers while communication services are simultaneously provided to ground users. Under practical constraints—including maximum UAV velocity, transmit power, and propulsion energy consumption—the achievable uplink rate is maximized through joint optimization of the transmit beamforming and UAV trajectory. To address the computationally complex and inherently non-convex optimization problem, an efficient iterative algorithm combining block coordinate descent with successive convex approximation is designed, yielding a high-quality suboptimal solution. Finally, comprehensive simulations are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme against benchmark methods and to elucidate the inherent trade-off between communication and sensing performance."

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present a comparative performance analysis of the POKÉ-based key exchange and SIDH variants. SIDH gained attention for its small key size and efficient performance, and has been selected as an alternate candidate in NIST PQC Round 4. However, following the key recovery attack by Castryck and Decru in 2022, SIDH was shown to be vulnerable to polynomial-time attacks on classical computers, undermining its security and removing it from consideration. Given that SIDH was regarded as the leading isogeny-based algorithm, several countermeasures, such as MSIDH, MD-SIDH, and bin/terSIDH have been proposed. However, these approaches still face performance limitations. Meanwhile, POKÉ, proposed by Basso and Maino at Eurocrypt 2025, is an isogeny-based public key encryption scheme that combines a SIDH-like protocol with higher-dimensional isogenies and has drawn attention for its efficient performance. In this work, we adapt POKÉ into a key exchange algorithm and benchmark it against M-SIDH, terSIDH, and CSIDH. Targeting NIST security level 1, POKÉ-based KEM is approximately 21.21 times faster than terSIDH and 64.97 times faster than CSIDH, showing that the POKÉ-based KEM is currently the most promising isogeny-based key exchange candidate."

For DC pumps, the interface with the PV panels is achieved using a DC-DC converter to ensure controlled DC output. In particular, this paper takes the full bridge (FB) inverter as the case of study. However, many researchers have observed that most of the PV-powered water pump system failures are related to inverters. Therefore, an appropriate fault detection and isolation (FDI) mechanism is required. This paper extends the work of a Hybrid Bond Graph (HBG)-based diagnostic for Direct Current drive of a water solar pumping by combining it with the powerful pattern recognition of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to improve the overall fault isolation performance."

    "abstract": "This paper considers an active reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) aided device-based uplink integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system. In this context, base station (BS) receives pilot and communication signals transmitted concurrently from mobile users to provision sensing and communication services. For the considered setup, we investigate beamforming design by jointly optimizing RIS configuration, mobile users’ transmit power and linear combiner at the BS to minimize Cramér-Rao bound (CRB) of angle-of-arrival (AoA) estimation for the sensing users while ensuring spectral efficiency of communication users. The considered device-based sensing paradigm raises unique challenge since communication signals contribute to noise covariance in AoA measurements, which leads to a highly complicated CRB expression. To resolve this challenge, we transfer the problem into a quartic form, equivalently represent covariance matrix inverse into an equation condition, decouple the intractable covariance equality constraint by introducing splitting variables followed by penalty dual-decomposition (PDD) methodology, which develops an iterative process updating all variable blocks alternatively. Extensive numerical results verify the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm and demonstrate the significant advantage of device-based sensing scheme over the device-free counterpart when the sensing targets can get connected in the ISAC network."

However, analyzing vast amounts of unstructured text, such as emails, poses significant difficulties, especially when dealing with the nuanced and often imbalanced representation of different values. This research proposes a sophisticated deep learning platform designed for the value-based analysis of business correspondence. Within our research, we used recurrent neural networks to classify a large dataset of emails into a number of categories. What is novel about our approach is the fact that we tackle the class imbalance problem in our data, meaning that we pay special attention to the values that are observed less frequently. This means our model becomes significantly better at identifying those less frequently observed, highly valuable values. Our completed system is a valuable tool in decoding behavior and ethics at a given organization."

    "url": "https://doi.org/10.1109/taslpro.2026.3661413",
    "source": "IEEE",
    "abstract": "Detecting overlapping speech is essential for improving the performance of speech processing systems such as speaker identification, diarization, and automatic speech recognition. However, existing methods often fail in noisy and reverberant environments, limiting their real-world applicability. To address this challenge, we propose CAT-Net, a novel lightweight architecture for robust frame-level Overlapping Speech Detection (OSD). CAT-Net combines multiscale channel-wise attention, which dynamically weights frequency bins based on their importance using parallel temporal convolutions. The weighted features are fed into a Self-Attention Temporal Convolutional Network (SATCN), which models short- and long-term temporal dependencies via dilated convolutions. To overcome the limitation of uniform weighting across the receptive field, a self-attention mechanism is applied after each dilated layer to adaptively re-weight temporal features based on contextual importance. A final classification module labels each frame as overlapping or single-speaker speech. As part of this work, we construct two comprehensive single-channel OSD datasets: one derived from the GRID corpus for neutral speech, and another from the RAVDESS corpus for emotional speech. For each dataset, we generate multiple versions simulating clean, noisy, reverberant, and combined noise-reverberation conditions across a wide range of Signal-to- Noise Ratio (SNR) levels and noise types. This enables rigorous evaluation of OSD models under realistic acoustic environments. Experimental results demonstrate that CAT-Net outperforms state-of-the-art methods across all conditions while using significantly fewer parameters, underscoring its effectiveness, efficiency, and suitability for deployment in practical speech processing systems. In addition, CAT-Net is evaluated on the real-world AMI Meeting Corpus, demonstrating strong generalization to realistic multi-speaker conversational conditions. Furthermore, integrating CAT-Net into a standard speaker diarization system results in consistent improvements across both clean and noisy conditions."

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the challenge of multimodal recommendation in consumer-facing e-commerce platforms, where users interact with item information across multiple modalities—such as images, textual descriptions, and specifications. Effectively modeling these items and user preferences requires robust techniques for extracting meaningful multimodal features. To address this, we propose RFM (Refined Feature for E-commerce Multimodal Recommendation), a framework that improves user and item modeling through attention-based cross-layer knowledge distillation. RFM enables a student network to selectively learn from semantically aligned teacher layers, capturing features most relevant to user preferences while avoiding noisy or mismatched signals. These refined features are then used as item embeddings in a dual-graph learning structure, which includes both an item-item similarity graph and a user-item interaction graph. This design enhances the expressive power of item representations while preserving collaborative signals. RFM is particularly applicable to consumer-facing e-commerce platforms like Amazon, where users interact with multimodal content to evaluate a wide range of consumer electronics products. Extensive experiments on five real-world Amazon datasets demonstrate that RFM consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving an average improvement of 5.8% in Recall@20. These results highlight the practical effectiveness of RFM for enhancing recommendation quality in online retail environments."

    "abstract": "This work introduces an innovative application of established machine learning methods to calculate transformer no-load losses. An accurate estimation of losses is crucial to cost-effective and reliable transformer design. Existing methods often lack precision due to hard-to-predict additional losses or are computationally expensive due to complex finite element models. The proposed method enables fast and accurate prediction of transformer no-load losses using Gaussian process regression, selected for its suitability for the dataset and problem. Building on previous work, an improved surrogate model is developed with enhanced outlier filtration and optimized input selection. The approach is further extended to predict a range of losses, accounting for manufacturing deviations. Its performance is validated through a learning curve. Key findings indicate that outlier removal significantly improves accuracy and the optimal model depends on nine key variables from an extended input set. Modeling ranges of losses is feasible with a sufficiently large dataset, which further enhances accuracy, as confirmed by the learning curve. Overall, the method shows a strong potential for accurate no-load loss estimation and to support more efficient and cost-effective transformer design."

    "abstract": "The issue of hallucinations is a prevalent concern in existing Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). Previous efforts have primarily focused on investigating object hallucinations, which can be easily alleviated by introducing object detectors. However, these efforts neglect hallucinations in inter-object relationships, essential for visual comprehension. In this work, we introduce R-Bench, a novel benchmark specifically designed to evaluate hallucinations in visual relationships. R-Bench includes both image-level questions to assess the existence of relationships and instance-level questions that probe deeper into local visual comprehension. Our analysis reveals that relationship hallucinations arise from three types of co-occurrences: relationship-relationship, subject-relationship, and relationship-object, exacerbated by the long-tail distribution in visual datasets. Moreover, LVLMs often ignore visual content, over-relying on common sense from language models, particularly in spatial reasoning tasks. We further demonstrate that region-level image-text alignment helps mitigate relationship hallucinations and propose a new baseline, Region-Aware Alignment Mitigation (RA<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>M), that enhances model attention to relevant regions, improving alignment between generated text and images."

Movable signals with FIS always outperform RIS, achieving at least a fourfold gain. When transmitter and receiver polarizations differ, beyond-diagonal FIS further enhances performance."

Two linear arrays were designed, simulated, fabricated, and experimentally tested using FR4 as the dielectric substrate. The first array was configured with equal feed lengths to generate a centered main lobe, serving as a reference. The second array introduced a progressive 30 degrees phase shift between adjacent antenna elements by varying the feed line lengths, effectively steering the main beam away from the central axis. All antennas were optimized using CST Studio Suite software to ensure good impedance matching, low S11 parameter value, and stable radiation performance. The prototypes were fabricated through chemical etching and measured using a vector network analyzer and a spectrum analyzer setup. Experimental results confirmed the simulated behavior: the displaced-beam array achieved a main lobe at approximately 15 degrees, with increased gain and a broader beamwidth compared to the centered array. The results validate the proposed approach for implementing directional beam control using passive feed network design, demonstrating its potential for applications in smart antennas, wireless communications, and beam-switching systems."

    "abstract": "Despite advances in high-level tool chains, rapid prototyping of FPGA-based accelerators poses significant challenges. First, creating the basic interface infrastructure for the Unit Under Test evaluation, such as PCIe interfaces and DRAM controllers, is a time-consuming process. Second, with each iteration of UUT debugging, the static design requires complete synthesis from scratch. Third, frameworks with a high level of abstraction do not provide direct access to the UUT signals for debugging. In this paper, we introduce an open-source solution called CITRAP, a lightweight and reusable template that supports native debugging tools. It simplifies the process of creating infrastructure through the use of template scripts and standard IP-cores. The hardware design consists of two parts: a static infrastructure partition and a user logic partition. The static partition provides the infrastructure with interfaces, is synthesized only once, and stays untouched in the FPGA throughout debugging iterations. The user logic partition hosts the UUT, supports IP-cores for debugging and can be resynthesized and reconfigured independently by using Xilinx's Dynamic Function Exchange technology. Unlike more complex frameworks such as XRT, TAPASCO and OpenCPI, our approach does not introduce new abstraction overhead, allows for faster design cycles while providing full access to debug signals."

By adjusting the electromagnetic force of proportional electromagnet, the flow and pressure of shift hydraulic oil can be accurately controlled, and the smoothness and stability of shift can be realized. Taking the proportional electromagnet of power shift transmission of cotton picker as the research object, the static and transient analysis of the proportional electromagnet is carried out by Ansys Maxwell software, and a new method for measurement proportional electromagnet characteristics of power shift transmission of cotton picker is proposed through the built proportional electromagnet test platform, which verifies the correctness of the simulation model.

Multi-island genetic algorithm is used to optimize the parameters of proportional electromagnet. The results show that the proportional electromagnet test platform and the proportional electromagnet characteristic measurement method can meet the requirements of proportional electromagnet characteristic measurement of cotton picker power shift transmission, and the average electromagnetic force of the optimized proportional electromagnet is increased by 2.54%, the variance of electromagnetic force is reduced from 2.31 to 0.38, the variance of electromagnetic force is significantly reduced, the dispersion degree is reduced, the horizontal characteristics of displacement-force curve of proportional electromagnet are obviously improved, and the average Joule loss is reduced by 8.65%, which is of great significance to realize the accurate shift control and smooth operation of power shift system of cotton picker."

In this context, this work presents a review of these technologies, focusing on control strategies for GFM and BESS, with an emphasis on active power injection schemes and primary frequency regulation. Proposed approaches in the literature are reviewed to address operational challenges, such as the dynamic coordination between both technologies and harmonic suppression in weak grids. Furthermore, relevant technological gaps are discussed in areas such as standardization, fault resilience, and cybersecurity, among others, identifying key opportunities for future research.

In Malaysia's push toward Industry 4.0 and its upcoming transition to Industry 5.0, digital twinenhanced communication architectures play a critical role in ensuring real-time data synchronization, predictive analytics, and intelligent automation. This paper presents a comprehensive investigation into the design, implementation, and optimization of digital twin-augmented communication infrastructures tailored to Malaysia's smart manufacturing context. Leveraging edge computing, industrial IoT, 5G, and semantic interoperability standards, we propose a multilayered communication framework that addresses latency, data reliability, and system scalability challenges. Our research combines simulation modeling, industrial testbeds, and stakeholder interviews across key industrial corridors in Selangor and Penang. Findings indicate that digital twinenabled communication systems improve real-time process visibility by 58%, reduce downtime by 35%, and enhance predictive maintenance accuracy by 62% compared to conventional setups. Through architectural modeling, latency analysis, and digital twin synchronization protocols, the study demonstrates the viability of the proposed framework in small-to-medium enterprises (SMEs) and multinational manufacturing plants alike. The results underscore the necessity of standardized digital twin interfaces (e.g., OPC UA, MQTT, and ISO 23247), edge-driven latency mitigation strategies, and cloud-twin data fusion mechanisms to ensure full-loop control and scalability. This work contributes a technically validated, policy-aligned, and future-proof architecture that supports Malaysia's Smart Manufacturing Blueprint (2021-2030) and aligns with the MyDigital roadmap."

    "abstract": "Driven by the global push for net-zero emissions, inverter-based renewable energy sources (RESs) are rapidly replacing traditional synchronous generators. As a consequence of the above mentioned transition, the system exhibits a natural tendency to lose inertia and show weaker performances in resisting large disturbances. The reduced inertia intensifies the risk of high rates of change of frequency, angular instability, and frequency oscillations. Inertia support mechanisms for RESs can enhance the stability of low-inertia power systems. This paper presents a comparative analysis of virtual and physical inertia-based approaches for RESs, focusing on rotor angle stability. The system behavior is examined for three different configurations of RESs integration. In the first configuration, RESs are integrated normally without any inertial support. Second, the virtual inertia functionality is embedded in the RES control mechanism. Finally, the physical inertia of the system is restored with the help of synchronous condensers. The study is conducted on the IEEE 68-bus benchmark system using both modal analysis and non-linear dynamic simulations to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of virtual and physical inertia support mechanisms."

    "abstract": "The integration of renewable energy sources with energy storage systems is becoming essential for achieving sustainable and reliable power management. An intelligent photovoltaic (PV) battery hybrid energy management system are to be developed using a ZETA DC-DC converter to ensure efficient power regulation and seamless energy exchange under variable operating conditions. A Hybrid Grey Wolf-Fuzzy Logic Control (HGWFLC) scheme is being implemented to enhance Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) performance by combining the global optimization capability of the Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) with the adaptive reasoning of Fuzzy Logic Control (FLC). The ZETA converter is operating in Continuous Conduction Mode (CCM), providing bidirectional voltage regulation with continuous input current and minimal output voltage ripple. A detailed MATLAB/Simulink model is being developed to analyze the interaction between a 600 Wh PV array, a 2.3 kWh, 60 V lithium-ion battery, and a resistive load. Simulation results are demonstrating that the HGW-FLC based MPPT achieves high accuracy, faster transient response, and improved stability compared to conventional Perturb & Observe (P&O) and standalone FLC methods. The proposed configuration enhances energy utilization efficiency, conversion performance, and operational reliability, making it suitable for hybrid renewable energy and smart grid applications."

Experiments on publicly available bearing datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves a diagnostic accuracy of 97.40 %, showing significant advantages over baseline models in terms of stability and accuracy.

    "abstract": "Epoxy resin is a key insulating material for gasinsulated transmission lines (GIL), but it suffers from surface charge accumulation and electric field distortion. To address these issues, this study modifies the epoxy resin surface using an argon dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) assisted with hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS). The study investigates the effects of different modification conditions on the surface flashover characteristics of epoxy resin. Several analytical and testing methods were employed to evaluate the epoxy resin before and after modification. These methods include scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), surface flashover tests, and the isothermal surface potential decay (ISPD) measurements. The evaluation focused on changes in five key aspects: surface morphology, chemical composition, surface conductivity, surface potential decay, and pollution flashover. The results indicate that plasma treatment enhances surface roughness through etching, leading to a significant increase in shallow trap density, surface conductivity, and the charge dissipation rate. Moreover, the pollution flashover voltage of modified samples was significantly higher compared to untreated samples. This work demonstrates that plasma-assisted vapor deposition effectively optimizes the distribution of surface traps, enhances surface conductivity in epoxy resin, accelerates charge dissipation, alleviates electric field distortion. All of these contribute to improving the surface flashover stability of epoxy resin under non-uniform electric fields. Moreover, this modification method is cost-effective and environmentally friendly, exhibiting promising application prospects in the field of high-voltage insulation."

Using real-time in-orbit computed orbital data or temporal information as input triggers, the satellite autonomously calculates the operational status of its payloads within defined thresholds. This calculation incorporates parameters such as satellite time, orbital data, and activation statuses of various payloads. Based on this, the satellite independently executes activation commands and software configuration for individual payload units, achieving autonomous in-orbit payload management. Validation demonstrates that this method significantly reduces satellite ground operation and control costs while substantially enhancing the satellite's autonomous management and operational capabilities. Furthermore, for energy-constrained spacecraft, this approach can drastically minimize energy expenditure by aligning operations with mission usage plans."

Building upon this principle, this research proposes LitePnP, a lightweight Plug-and-Play model specifically designed for resource-constrained IoT devices, which typically lack comprehensive operating systems and are limited in memory capacity, processing power, and storage capabilities. The model focuses on three primary components: (1) a sensor identification mechanism based on active and passive scanning through RS485/Modbus RTU protocols; (2) lightweight JSON-based drivers that enable sensor operation abstraction while reducing memory overhead; and (3) a minimalist PnP process that faciliates seamless driver installation and service deployment. The significant contribution of this research lies not only in proposing the lightweight PnP model but also in comparing it with typical PnP models such as MicroPnP, IEEE 1451, and TEDS. The comparison demonstrates that while current models provide comprehensive functionality or high standardization, they often require specialized hardware or substantial resources. In contrast, LitePnP model offers minimalism and ease of integration, making it particularly suitable for low-cost IoT devices and opening up a viable approach for large-scale applications in smart agriculture, environmental monitoring, and industrial automation."

A transmission line is applied at the drain of the transistor with RLC parallel feedback, which enhances gain flatness and stability. The LNA has been fabricated by 150-nm GaN-on-SiC high electron mobility transistors (HEMT) technology. The tape-out measurement reveals that the proposed LNA achieves a flat gain of 21.4-22.8 dB with a gain flatness of 1.4 dB. The measured noise figure (NF) is 1.33–1.97 dB with an average in-band NF of 1.69 dB.

Radiometric infrared thermography was used to capture the thermal evolution of steel specimens subjected to a controlled Joule heating process. Each thermal image was flattened and processed via Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to extract low-dimensional thermal features. These features were used to train machine learning regressors, specifically Random Forest and XGBoost, to predict oxiderelated dimensional changes. The methodology was validated using micrometer-based thickness measurements synchronized with the thermal data. Results demonstrated strong predictive performance with mean absolute errors below 0.007 mm. This approach enables real-time tracking of thermally induced surface evolution without invasive sensors, opening possibilities for smart manufacturing applications."

    "abstract": "Recent research trends in sentiment analysis are increasingly focused on understanding and extracting emotions from social media comments from content on various platforms. This study aims to identify emotional cues in language to understand public sentiment and social dynamics better. Word-level sentiment analysis, in particular, plays a crucial role in interpreting human emotions, providing essential insights for anticipating and responding to societal issues. Despite growing research interest in sentiment analysis, there is a noticeable lack of research on emotion-labeled corpora in Malay. To date, no comprehensive studies or publicly available datasets have been published to develop a Malay emotional corpus, which remains underdeveloped. To address this gap, the present study aims to develop MySentiMentH, a lexicon of affective norms for Malay sentiment words within the context of mental health, enabling more targeted analysis of emotional language, especially as it appears in responses to major societal events. The primary objective of this research is to review existing techniques and methodologies for developing emotional corpora and to adapt these approaches to the creation of MySentiMentH. The methodology includes detailed discussions on data collection, the design of the MySentiMentH lexicon, and the materials and procedures used in its development. The findings demonstrate the feasibility of constructing a Malay sentiment lexicon with emotional labels. MySentiMentH is shown to be a valuable resource for future research and applications, as it provides a foundation for the continued development of a comprehensive Malay emotional corpus. This corpus can serve as an effective sentiment-monitoring tool for better understanding human emotions from words used on social media."

This paper presents a comprehensive empirical evaluation of statistical and deep learning approaches applied to a $\\mathbf{1 4}$-month residential consumption dataset from northeastern Mexico. We systematically compare ARIMA and ARIMAX models using global and rolling window strategies against four deep learning architectures: LSTM, BiLSTM, GRU, and CNN-LSTM. Experimental results demonstrate fundamental performance differences between method categories. Statistical approaches demonstrate inadequate performance due to the highly volatile characteristics of residential energy consumption. Deep learning architectures successfully model nonlinear consumption dynamics, with GRU achieving root mean square error of 99.3 W, representing 25% error reduction compared to best statistical methods. Rolling window retraining strategies counterintuitively degrade statistical performance despite increasing computational costs. The moderate absolute performance across all methods reflects fundamental predictability constraints imposed by residential consumption volatility at high temporal resolution, with implications for realistic performance expectations in operational deployments."

The approach leverages cosine similarity to generate semantically consistent adversarial samples, enriching training data with more challenging premise-hypothesis-reason pairs. We evaluate the methodology on the ANLI dataset across multiple training regimes (R1, R2, R3, R1+R2, and Full ANLI). Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach substantially improves robustness and reasoning capability. Qwen3 4 B achieves up to 87.2 % accuracy and 87.05 % Macro F1, nearly 8 % higher than its baseline training results, while consistently outperforming LLaMA 3.2 3B under all settings. Hybrid strategies that combine adversarial augmentation with mixed training also show strong gains, reaching 85.4 % accuracy and 85.27 % Macro F1.

Among these, Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) is probably the most useful sensor due to its high accuracy and role in supporting various autonomous driving tasks. However, despite significant advances in autonomous driving technology, multiple reports of attacks targeting the sensors of these vehicles have been documented. In particular, LiDAR point insertion attacks have drawn increasing attention from the research community, as they can cause vehicles to brake abruptly or even result in fatal collisions. Although several countermeasures have been proposed, many fail to provide comprehensive protection, often exhibiting vulnerabilities that hinder their effectiveness in real-world scenarios. This work presents a watermarking scheme to address LiDAR point insertion attacks. Our approach segments the LiDAR point cloud into voxels and embeds a watermark message in those enclosing points. The robustness of the proposed method is evaluated against such attacks using points collected from real-world LiDAR readings."

This paper examines the impact of leakage impedance variations on the design, weight, and cost of a 2500 kVA oil-immersed transformer. Leakage impedance affects voltage regulation, short-circuit currents, and load sharing, influencing key design parameters such as winding configurations, winding dimensions, and magnetic core dimensions. This study compares the effects of leakage impedance values at 6%, 7%, and 8% on transformer weight and cost. As leakage impedance increases, the need for larger winding spacing and expanded magnetic core size results in greater material consumption, leading to higher transformer weight and production expenses. Experimental results reveal a progressive increase in transformer weight corresponding to each increment in leakage impedance, which in turn drives a notable rise in manufacturing cost due to increased copper and other material usage. The findings provide a clear correlation between leakage impedance, physical transformer characteristics, and economic impact, offering valuable insights for optimizing transformer design to balance electrical performance with material costs and weight constraints."

    "abstract": "Reliable fault diagnosis of brushless DC (BLDC) motors is critical for ensuring the safety, efficiency, and uptime of modern industrial systems. Yet, the lack of publicly available, high-resolution datasets for BLDC diagnostics has hindered the development and benchmarking of data-driven algorithms. To address this gap, we introduce DUDU-BLDC, the first fully documented repository of synchronous current and non-contact speed recordings from Fein EC48 BLDC motors under healthy, mechanically imbalanced, electrically degraded, and combined-fault conditions. Collected at 50 kHz and packaged according to the TIER 4.0 protocol, the dataset comprises five CSV files with 28 statistical and spectral features per 0.8 s experiment. We demonstrate its utility via a Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier achieving up to 85.8 % mean accuracy on speed features, illustrating how DUDU-BLDC can accelerate research in BLDC fault detection and predictive maintenance. The complete dataset, metadata, and code are openly available on Zenodo under a CC BY 4.0 license."

    "abstract": "Although domain adaptation methods are commonly used in mechanical fault diagnosis to mitigate the domain shift problem, they typically rely on target domain data being available during training. To address this issue, this paper proposes a cross-source domain contrastive learning-guided invariant adversarial network (CSDCL-IAN). The model first employs a residual attention network to construct a feature extractor, aiming to enhance discriminative fault information. Subsequently, a cross-source domain contrastive learning mechanism is designed, which extracts common features across multi-source domains by making intra-class features closer and inter-class features more distinct. Finally, unseen-condition data are input into the trained CSDCL-IAN to realize cross-domain fault diagnosis. In transfer diagnosis experiments on a planetary transmission system test rig, CSDCL-IAN yields an average diagnostic accuracy of 98.15% on across six transfer tasks, which significantly verifies its superior domain generalization ability and cross-domain diagnostic performance."

    "abstract": "Hearing assistance is to improve sound intelligibility, and takes on many forms, from the traditional earborn hearing aids to cellphone apps for connected earphones. These systems are useful for those with hearing impairment or for those struggling with background noise, such as when the cocktail effect is compromised by the spoken language not being sufficiently familiar. While in-line time-signal processing can help, the best way forward is to use multiple microphones to harness the power of array signal processing. Arrays allow the simultaneous enhancement of the wanted sound and suppression of interfering sounds, as long as the interferers are in different locations from the wanted sound. This paper demonstrates how the performance of the main beamforming algorithms can be explored very conveniently using MATLAB. The algorithms are deployed and evaluated here using a simple representative scenario - the geometric arrangement of wanted and interfering signals and the array elements. Here we use a linear array and a circular array, each of ten elements, that can be mounted on the head; a single wanted signal source, and just a couple of interfering sources. When the number of array elements is greater than the number of sources, there are enough signalprocessing degrees of freedom to strongly improve the wanted signal-to-interference ratio."

    "abstract": "Proximity-based identification faces a fundamental challenge where existing solutions either sacrifice cryptographic authentication for scalability or require dedicated infrastructure. Traditional Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) implementations demand connection establishment, limiting concurrent device support on typical smartphone hardware. This paper presents Encrypted Proximity Recognition (EPR) framework, a connectionless BLE protocol that achieves cryptographic device authentication with concurrent scalability and zero-infrastructure deployment. EPR employs one-way cryptographic key mixing where each device broadcasts values derived from a pre-distributed secret key combined with session-specific one-time parameters through multi-stage cryptographic operations, enabling a verifier device to identify present devices by matching received broadcasts against pre-computed values. The framework supports flexible deployment configurations including deterministic mixing for offline operation, server-assisted mixing to prevent client-side function extraction, and TRNG-based parameterization for enhanced security. Extensions with biometric verification enable multi-factor authentication combining proximity, device possession, and user presence. Real-world validation through classroom attendance deployment demonstrates practical feasibility."

We formulated a pipeline that utilizes a large-language model to facilitate interview-style intake assessment and answered two research questions: a) how effective is the baseline (Gemini 1.5 Pro) model in diagnosing psychological health disorders? b) what strategies could be employed to improve its diagnostics accuracies? By fine-tuning Gemini 1.5 pro, results show that we can improve diagnostic accuracies of the baseline model from 38% to 70% for the case studies evaluated."

This work presents a lightweight fall-detection system based on the YOLOv5 object detector and deployed on an NVIDIA Jetson Nano to recognize three postures: standing, sitting, and falling. When a fall is confirmed, the embedded system generates an alert that can be transmitted to a caregiver. On a separate test set, the detector achieves a mean Average Precision of 95.8 percent at an Intersection-over-Union threshold of 0.5. Real-time measurements on the Jetson Nano show an effective processing speed of around seven frames per second for the baseline configuration and up to twelve frames per second when using NVIDIA’s TensorRT optimization. The software pipeline is configured for compatibility with PyTorch, CUDA, and TensorRT, and is adapted to the constraints of embedded deployment. Current limitations relate to lighting variations, camera viewpoint, and scene complexity. Planned developments will focus on improving robustness, reducing latency, and integrating the system on an elderly-care robot for on-board perception and timely alerts."

However, the signals generated by projectile band bayonet-chamber action exhibit strong impact characteristics and sample imbalance, and current conventional detection methods fail to meet the requirements for effective recognition of band bayonet-chamber localization. To address this issue, this paper proposes a Residual Attention Nested U-Net (ResAttU-Net++) model: while retaining the skip connection design of U-Net++, a “residual-attention module” is constructed to enhance the feature extraction effect of transient impact signals during band bayonet-chamber action. Additionally, a class-weighted Lová sz-Softmax loss function is specifically designed to effectively balance sample weights. The proposed method is evaluated through experiments on both laboratory test benches and range test benches. Combining three evaluation criteria, the model's cross-condition performance and localization accuracy are verified, thereby providing an effective solution for band bayonet-chamber action localization in sample imbalance scenarios."

The framework intro-duces a novel Overlap-Points Metric (OPM) that quantifies Time-Current Characteristic (TCC) curve intersections into measurable indicators, replacing traditional visual assessment with objective, data-driven evaluation. The proposed hybrid architecture integrates deterministic Auto-Fix algorithms with reinforcement learning (RL), combining rule-based precision with adaptive intelligence to achieve dynamic and self-optimizing coordination across diverse network conditions. Three case studies were conducted to assess the framework's robustness and scalability under varying network complexities. In sim-ple configurations, APFCR achieved complete elimination of curve overlaps, demonstrating 100 % coordination performance. In moderately constrained networks, it sustained 83 % performance with a 28 % decrease in intersection density, whereas in highly constrained systems, it maintained 70 % performance and achieved a 61 % reduction in overlap occurrences. Collectively, these findings confirm APFCR's adaptive capability and effectiveness in minimizing coordination conflicts as system complexity increases. Furthermore, a techno-economic analysis confirms a distinct cost advantage, with the framework reaching break-even after 10–15 projects compared to conventional consulting studies. Collectively, APFCR establishes a scalable, sustainable, and intelligent decision-support framework that advances digital transformation and automation in industrial power protection systems."

In this paper, the frequency changes of resistivity and relative dielectric constant in the range of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$100 \\text{Hz} \\sim 10 \\text{MHz}$</tex> of soil with an initial moisture content of 12% were measured at different temperatures. The results showed that the decrease of soil temperature led to a significant increase in resistivity and a decrease in relative dielectric constant. Under negative temperature conditions, water freezes into ice, and the dielectric constant is much smaller than that of liquid water, which makes the difference between frozen soil and room temperature soil significant. With the increase of frequency, the soil dielectric constant tends to be stable, and the polarization effect weakens at high frequency. The results reveal the frequency-dependent characteristics of the electrical parameters of permafrost, which provides an experimental basis for further research on the broadband response of permafrost grounding devices."

We propose a subjectwise validated framework that couples rigorous preprocessing with explainable machine learning. Signals are denoised using FastICA with ICLabel to remove non-neural components, normalized, and partitioned into delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma bands. From each band, we extract complementary descriptors spanning statistical measures, entropy indices, and fractal dimensions, and train an XGBoost classifier on the resulting feature vectors. Model interpretability is achieved with SHAP using TreeExplainer, which quantifies the contribution of each descriptor to individual predictions and to the global decision rule. The fused feature set yields balanced, state-of-theart performance, achieving 97.71 % accuracy, 98.13% sensitivity, and 97.29 % specificity for the two-class control versus PD task, and 97.82% accuracy, 97.96 % sensitivity, and 98.87 % specificity for the three-class control, ON, and OFF task. SHAP attributions indicate that band-limited statistics and entropy measures drive the control versus PD contrast, whereas multiscale complexity, as captured by fractal descriptors, is most discriminative for medication state. These findings demonstrate that accurate and transparent EEG-based support for PD diagnosis is feasible within a single, cohesive pipeline."

However, self-guided VFTs often leave learners with unresolved questions due to the absence of real-time instructional support. While chatbots based on large language models such as ChatGPT might be powerful learning tools, they are prone to inaccuracies due to their reliance on generalized knowledge bases. Thus, this pilot study introduces a retrieval augmented generation (RAG) chatbot specifically designed to generate accurate, contextually relevant responses from a curated set of technical documents related to an VFT environment based on 360° technology. Learners (N=1 0) were exposed to the 3 6 0° VFT environment of a biogas plant, where the chatbot provided real-time assistance. A mixed-methods evaluation was employed to assess the chatbot's impact on learning, including both qualitative user feedback, collected in semi-structured interviews, and quantitative measures. The quantitative measures comprised – based on standardized questionnaires – motivation, emotion, cognitive load, and usability, while learning gains were collected based on a pre-posttest design. The findings demonstrate that the RAG-enabled chatbot supports the accuracy of information retrieval, thereby not overstraining the cognitive load on learners. Participants reported a better understanding of domain-specific information, underlining the potential of RAG-based chatbots in virtual environments."

Real-time processing and management of this amount of data is rather challenging, especially when high throughput, low latency and scalability are in consideration. In this paper, we study the use of a novel hybrid edge-cloud computing (HECC) architecture that supports high-throughput and low-latency in smart cities for real-time data processing.

    "abstract": "Owing to the advantages in high breakdown voltage and low switching loss, the silicon carbide (SiC) device is promising to integrate with the press-pack (PP) packaging for high-voltage and high-power applications. However, the higher Young's modulus and heat flux of SiC dies, compared to silicon counterparts, pose significant challenges for conventional PP packaging. Rigid PP packaging suffers from uneven contact pressure, while the flexible PP packaging offers only single-sided cooling. To tackle these issues, a soft-connected PP packaging enabled by liquid metal, and a matched structure is proposed to replace the spring structure, thus realizing pressureless interconnection and efficient double-sided cooling. Finite element analysis and experimental assessment for the soft-connected packaging of the PP SiC module and its two counterparts with conventional interconnections are conducted. Experimental results indicate that the contact pressure on the SiC die with the soft interconnection is decoupled from the external clamping force and reduced by 99% compared to both conventional packaging baselines, thus making the module highly suitable for easy series connection. Compared to the conventional rigid and flexible PP SiC modules, the optimal junction-to-fluid thermal resistance of the soft-connected PP SiC module is reduced by 83% and 55%, respectively. The reliability of the power module and the stability of the liquid metal have been preliminarily verified through thermal shock testing. The proposed soft-connected packaging thus facilitates the deployment of SiC technology in advanced PP power modules."

A total of 40 participants were recruited, including 20 younger adults (aged 22–27) and 20 older adults (aged 52–58), who completed three types of tasks—target localization, status confirmation, and functional operation—across four typical electric vehicle (EV) charging application layouts (L1–L4). Eye-tracking techniques were employed to capture average fixation duration, saccade count, fixation-to-saccade ratio, and gaze heatmaps, while task completion time, accuracy, and subjective preferences were analyzed in parallel. The results show that L1 (Bottom Navigation with Top Functional Area) yielded the best performance in both task efficiency and visual processing, with minimal performance differences across age groups. In contrast, L3 (Bottom Navigation with Two-Level Hierarchical Structure) significantly impaired interaction efficiency and increased cognitive load, particularly for older adults. Eye-tracking metrics aligned closely with behavioral data and user preferences, underscoring the critical role of layout structure in shaping attentional allocation and interaction pathways. These findings highlight the importance of adopting intuitive and flat layout designs to enhance universality and usability in cross-age mobile application interfaces."

In this study, we explore how regular interactions with a social robot, conducted in a structured yet familiar environment within university halls and departments, can provide effective support for practising ER via cognitive reappraisal. Twenty-one students participated in a five-session study at a university hall or department in the U.K., where the robot (QTrobot, LuxAI), powered by a large language model (GPT 3.5) facilitated structured conversations, encouraging the students to reinterpret emotionally charged situations that they shared with the robot. Quantitative and qualitative results indicate significant improvements in ER, with participants reporting better understanding and control of their emotions, significant changes in constructive ER tendencies and positive effects on mood and sentiment after each session. The findings also demonstrate that repeated interactions with the robot encouraged greater emotional expression, including longer speech disclosures, increased use of affective language, and heightened facial arousal. Notably, expression peaked during key reappraisal moments, particularly when participants were prompted to reinterpret negative experiences. The qualitative feedback further highlighted how the robot fostered introspection and provided a supportive space for discussing emotions, enabling participants to confront long-avoided emotional challenges. These findings demonstrate the potential of robots to effectively assist in ER in familiar environments, offering both emotional support and cognitive guidance"

    "abstract": "With the advancement of 6G and IoT, semantic communication has evolved from ”bit-focused” transmission to ”meaning-centered” delivery, yet faces challenges including limited device resources and privacy risks in multimodal data processing. While semantic knowledge bases enable structured domain guidance for feature extraction, edge computing reduces bandwidth usage through local processing, and federated learning (FL) preserves privacy by aggregating model updates instead of raw data. However, standalone edge computing lacks complex reasoning capability, and FL incurs high communication costs. This paper proposes an LLM-powered resource allocation framework for knowledge base-assisted federated-split learning. First, we design a knowledge-aware federated-split architecture that integrates semantic knowledge bases into model splitting and aggregation. Second, we develop a system model formalizing computation latency, communication rates, and end-to-end latency. Third, we formulate resource allocation as a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP) and adopt a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) framework with a frozen LLM to generate knowledge-aware rewards for policy learning. Experiments on the FLASH dataset demonstrate that our framework outperforms baselines by reducing training latency, accelerating convergence, and improving semantic reconstruction accuracy, effectively addressing resource allocation challenges in privacy-preserving semantic communication."

To overcome the inherent sensitivity limitations of standard processes, key structural innovations are introduced. These include the use of a low-doped N-type diffusion layer and P-type implantation to reduce carrier concentration and effective thickness, respectively, alongside a cross-like device structure (<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">L/W</i> = 0.8) that mitigates the short-circuit effect and optimizes the trade-off between current-related (<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">S<sub>I</sub></i>) and voltage-related sensitivity (<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">S<sub>V</sub></i>).

Furthermore, a theoretical analysis of the mechanical stress-induced offset in cross-like Hall devices is presented. Based on this analysis, a method of reorienting the device's cross-finger layout direction from [010] to [110] is proposed to suppress this offset. Measurement results confirm a drastic reduction in the residual offset from 17.7 μV to 5.4 μV under a bias current of 100 μA. This work provides a competitive solution for developing low-cost, high-performance current and magnetic sensors."

    "abstract": "The majority of computer vision algorithms fail to find higher-order (abstract) patterns in an image so they are not robust against adversarial attacks. Deep learning considers each input pixel in a homogeneous manner such that different parts of a locality-sensitive hashing table are often not connected, meaning higher-order patterns are not discovered. Hence, these systems are sensitive to noisy, irrelevant, and redundant data, leading to wrong predictions with high confidence. Adversarial attacks exploit this vulnerability by generating deceptive inputs that mislead AI systems. In contrast, human vision is rarely susceptible to adversarial attacks. Vertebrate brains afford heterogeneous knowledge representation through lateralization, enabling modular learning at different levels of abstraction. This work aims to verify the effectiveness, scalability, and robustness of a lateralized approach to real-world problems that contain noisy, irrelevant, and redundant data. Two well-known and widely used adversarial attacks, the Fast Gradient Sign Method and the Iterative Adversarial Technique, are applied to generate corrupted test images. The experimental results on multi-class (200 classes) image classification tasks demonstrate that the proposed system effectively captures hierarchical knowledge representations, enhancing its robustness. Crucially, the lateralized system outperformed four state-of-the-art deep learning-based systems for the classification of normal and adversarial images by 19.05% − 41.02% and 1.36% − 49.22%, respectively."

    "abstract": "Perceiving and understanding complex 3D environments are paramount for ensuring the safety and efficiency of intelligent transportation systems. 3D occupancy perception provides a comprehensive representation of surroundings by encoding geometric volumes alongside semantic labels. However, existing approaches often face significant challenges in preserving fine-grained geometric details due to the inherent constraints of camera-based image features. Simultaneously, 3D perception sensors such as LiDAR are limited by the sparsity of the resulting point clouds (voxels). To address these limitations, this paper introduces M2DG-TPV, an innovative model that employs a cross-attention-based module to integrate image and voxel features. It lifts the 2D image feature to a simplified 3D representation through an efficient matrix-based view transformation and enhances the voxel feature in occluded regions via a masked 2D Gaussian recovery method. Experimental evaluations on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that M2DG-TPV achieves an absolute improvement of 2.0 mIoU over state-of-the-art methods and surpasses existing approaches in 9 out of 16 semantic classes, while utilizing fewer model parameters and preserving finer geometric structures. Additional evaluation on the SemanticKITTI dataset further demonstrates the cross-dataset generalization."

Since LCDRs rely on digital communication channels, which, in turn, are vulnerable to cyberattacks, and thus, can be maloperated, leading to a cascaded failure. This paper proposes a novel image-based dynamic watermarking technique to distinguish between actual faults and false data injection attacks (FDIAs) in LCDR. It dynamically embeds the watermark into the remote-end as well as the local-end current measurement signal. After the extraction of the watermarks from the local and remote end signals, the extracted signals are compared to the original embedded watermark using the Damerau-Levenshtein (DL) distance. The final relay logic is developed based on the DL distance. The working of the proposed scheme is tested on PSCAD using the IEEE 14-bus system model."

    "abstract": "Due to the concerns for reduction of system losses, providing back-up power during loss of the grid, mitigation of energy security risks and conspicuous perturbation of power outages triggered by severe environmental constraints; the modernized distribution grids elicited grid resiliency and reliability enhancement through pragmatic enforcement of the Microgrid (MG) concept with distributed generation. With the proliferating power ultimatum, several intricate factors prone to MG operation modes, bidirectional power flow complexities, management and control of power transfer, varying fault current contribution, and high impedance faults (HIF) customized the network configuration and imperiled the protection system operation and system stability. The propitious utility framework persuaded the prerequisites to embrace the integration of state-of-the-art affiliated Distributed Energy Resources (DERs), which requires assimilated and coordinated studies to emphasize the outcomes of an efficient, reliable, and fast protection scheme for both the grid-connected and islanded modes of operation. Operating modes of distributed generation (DG) will affect the magnitude and direction of fault currents resulting in failure of protection coordination between directional overcurrent relays (DOCRs). In this paper, the negative-sequence based adaptive directional overcurrent relay (NSADOCR) stratagem is proposed. Protection coordination is accomplished by a new adaptive approach, which alters time dial setting (TDS) of negative-sequence overcurrent relay based on the ratio of the normal mode to operating mode of plug setting multiplier function. Furthermore, the direction of fault is attained using phase change in between the pre-fault and superimposed negative-sequence current components. Performance of the NSADOCR is evaluated on the dSPACE controller board, which is interfaced with Real- Time Digital Simulator (RTDSTM) to perform the hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) tests. Extensive simulation studies and hardware results on DG systems exemplify and indicate that the new adaptive technique results in effective protection coordination over the conventional approach, considering various distribution network (DN) modes of operation."

    "abstract": "The Portable Isotopic Neutron Spectroscopy (PINS) system, employs neutron-induced gamma-ray spectroscopy and provides a nondestructive method for high explosives detection. In standard operation it uses Californium-252 as a neutron source. Operating PINS with a deuterium-tritium (DT) neutron generator has some advantages over Cf-252, including lifetime and ability to produce high-energy inelastic scattering gamma rays. However, current systems using DT neutron generators suffer from a high environmental background and reduced ability to induce neutron capture, reducing spectral quality and limiting nitrogen sensitivity. This study presents the development of an energy-tuning assembly (ETA) designed to optimize the DT neutron energy spectrum to increase nitrogen reaction rates in a target, thereby improving high explosive detection capabilities. A metaheuristic optimization framework, MultiGNOWEE, coupled with MCNP, was employed to generate two ETA configurations: a single-objective ETA, which maximizes nitrogen capture reactions, and a multi-objective ETA, which balances neutron capture and inelastic scattering. Simulations demonstrated the optimized configurations achieved up to a 10-fold improvement in nitrogen capture rates compared to the bare configuration. Experimental validation was conducted using a DT neutron generator and a high-purity germanium (HPGe) detector. Two prototype ETAs were constructed and assessed on a melamine simulant. Measurements demonstrated improved nitrogen detection for both prototype ETA configurations when compared to the standard system."

On the IT side, workload latency tolerance can be exploited through workload execution optimization to reduce costs. On the auxiliary equipment (non-IT) side, uninterruptible power supply (UPS) systems are typically overprovisioned for peak demand and consequently remain underutilized during normal operation. To leverage flexibility from both sides, this paper proposes a two-stage bidding strategy for data centers in joint energy and reserve markets. To capture uncertainties in renewable energy output and workload arrivals in bidding and scheduling, we formulate a two-stage stochastic mixed-integer programming model and solve it via the sample average approximation method. This approach is designed to unlock the operational flexibility of UPS and further balance data center operation reliability with economic efficiency. Numerical experiments verify the proposed method's effectiveness in improving UPS availability and significantly saving energy costs."

Traditional flows rely on manual Tcl scripts, which require repeated customization per block and per technology node. These methods are not scalable, often consume $2-3$ hours of manual effort, and increase susceptibility to human error. This paper presents a Python-driven automation framework for PSDL (Power supply definition Language) based power grid generation. The framework eliminates manual Tcl coding by accepting design specifications such as stripe width, step size, metal layers, offsets, and power domains as input in a structured CSV/XLS file. A Python parser processes this file, dynamically generating PSDL code that defines both pattern specifications and region constraints. The validated script is then executed in Innovus to route the power mesh across multi-layer stacks (M1-M8). Compared with conventional flows, the proposed automation achieved up to a 90% reduction in setup time, cutting power grid creation from 120-180 minutes to under 10 minutes. Additionally, it improved verification reliability by 35%, reduced debugging iterations, and enabled seamless multi-domain support. This structured and reusable approach significantly enhances accuracy, productivity, and scalability in advanced SoC power planning."

In this work, we propose a compact deep learning framework that unites YOLOv8n for drone detection with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network for trajectory forecasting. The detector identifies drones accurately in each frame, and the LSTM predicts their upcoming positions by learning motion patterns from recent observations. This combination enables early response to aerial intrusions rather than the usual frame-by-frame tracking approach. Our experiments on a drone-specific dataset indicate that the model reaches a mean average precision close to 0.89 and processes around nine frames per second on a standard CPU setup. These outcomes suggest that the system can provide reliable detection and trajectory prediction even on limited hardware, making it practical for field applications like airspace security and surveillance. The lightweight design ensures operational feasibility on low-power platforms, enabling realtime performance without reliance on high-end computing resources"

This work presents an optical sensing system for the opening of the disconnector, which employs an electronic circuit for signal processing. For the transmission and reception of the laser, a plastic optical fiber sensor was used, connected to a housing where a biconvex lens is coupled. The results demonstrate that the proposed system is efficient in detecting different angular positions of the switch, being able to identify opening angles with contact resistances on the order of micro Ohm. Thus, continuous monitoring of the switch contributes to reducing losses and minimizing maintenance costs."

The model was tested with more than 42,000 patient records across three benchmark datasets in dermatology, cardiology, and neurology. The analysis demonstrated that the system outperformed current methods with an overall 96.8 % diagnostic accuracy, 95.7 % precision, 96.2 % recall, <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$F 1$</tex>-score of 96.0 %, and 18 % reduced computational load compared to baseline deep learning models. Model convergence time also decreased, by <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{2 1} \\boldsymbol{\\%}$</tex>. Other than deep learning systems, there was robust statistical evidence to suggest the model is transferrable to other systems. The robust, flexible, and computationally efficient framework of the model provides cross-domain clinical decision support that is highly interpretable. The integrated metaheuristic-deep learning approach has proven potential for other domains."

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a CNN-RNN hybrid architecture of edge-optimized system to detect and track real-time objects in self-driving cars. The architecture combines convolutional neural networks with spatial feature detectors and recurrent layers with a temporal sequence detector, which allows it to detect effectively in dynamic settings. KITTI and nuScenes are preprocessed to guarantee that the input is of high quality, and edge deployment is more efficient in the context of limited hardware. The experimental findings show that the suggested model has 96.8% accuracy, has a shorter inference time of 95 ms, and ID switches are 20 percent lower than the current models. Comparison of performance between vehicles and vulnerable road users indicates that there are consistent increases in performance at increased levels of the IOU, which justifies its versatility in the handling of different traffic conditions. Also, model compression algorithm plays a very important role in minimizing deployment overheads, which makes computing edge viable. It is a hybrid solution, which is scalable and practical in terms of intelligent transportation systems, enhancing safety and efficiency in autonomous driving."

    "abstract": "As the cost of battery storage systems (BSS) continues to drop, their efficient utilization in housing and transportation can reduce their operating costs through cooperative sharing among them. Therefore, this paper proposes a cost allocation mechanism to equitably allocate costs among households based on their peak demand by fairly distributing the surplus/deficit of their share in shared BSS at the average/blended price. It presents a method for allocating shares of shared BSS to the households based on their historical peak demand. It is proven that the proposed cost allocation mechanism is subadditive, balanced, and lies in the core of coalition game theory. It also proposes a framework for determining the optimal capacity of a shared BSS based on its amortized investment for a coalition of households and their demand across peak and off-peak periods. Additionally, the amortized investment for which no profit or loss occurs is demonstrated. Overall, the results demonstrate that each household receives a positive and visible profit, transforming economic and social norms that encourage the usage of shared BSS."

This work examines that bottleneck through a comparative analysis of on-chip versus off-chip FPGA acceleration for embedded neural networks. We evaluate four configurations: baseline inference on both a silicon-based STM32F091RC microcontroller and a MicroBlaze softcore processor, alongside their accelerated variants. Using a Morse code decoding neural network, results demonstrate that on-chip softcore-accelerator integration achieves a <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$420 \\times$</tex> speedup over its baseline and outperforms the externally accelerated microcontroller by 9362.61 %.

    "abstract": "Anomaly detection plays a key role in the reliable and efficient operation of the satellite. However, most current algorithms tend to focus more on modeling the data in the time domain or frequency domain for anomaly detection. With the increasing complexity of satellite missions and the extension of satellite lifespans, telemetry data exhibit more intricate timefrequency characteristics. Existing anomaly detection models tend to be insufficient in capturing the correlations between temporal and frequency features, which constrains their overall representation capability and may lead to false alarms or missed detections. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an anomaly detection approach that integrates contrastive learning with time-frequency augmentation into a data-driven reconstruction framework. First, the encoder is pre-trained through time-frequency contrastive learning, where temporal and frequency views of the telemetry sequences are exploited to obtain discriminative feature representations. Then, a decoder is appended to the pre-trained encoder, and the entire autoencoder is retrained by minimizing the reconstruction loss to enhance its representation and reconstruction capability. Finally, anomaly detection is performed by computing the reconstruction error of test samples, where deviations beyond a predefined threshold are identified as anomalies. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed anomaly detection method achieves superior detection performance on the real satellite telemetry data set."

    "abstract": "Renewable-based distributed generation (DG) systems have helped ease the growing power demand on the utility grid. However, the proliferation of consumer-side electronic devices, which are increasingly designed for compactness and efficiency, has introduced a large number of nonlinear loads. The presence of such nonlinear loads significantly deteriorates grid power quality through current harmonics, voltage distortions, and non-unity power factor, which cannot be effectively mitigated by simple renewable energy integration. This paper proposes a One-Step Prediction–based Direct Power Control (OSP-DPC) strategy for a photovoltaic (PV) system–integrated Voltage Source Converter (VSC), while enabling simultaneous renewable energy integration and active power filtering. The method maintains constant switching frequency and mitigates drawbacks of variable switching frequency schemes such as EMI/EMC issues and higher switching losses. A perturb-and-observe (P&O)–based MPPT and instantaneous pq-theory–based power extraction is employed to enhance system dynamic performance. Finally, the simulation results presents the effectiveness of the proposed strategy under various irradiance conditions."

In this case, a novel non-periodic intermittent control framework is introduced to facilitate the intricate nature of the complex network to achieve the containment objective. First, an intermittent communication network is built by introducing a novel intermittent interval condition combining average dwell-time and extreme value theories into the directed graph. Second, a distributed non-periodic intermittent containment control strategy is designed, utilizing an internal system and a modified containment control approach. Subsequently, a distributed prescribed performance hybrid controller is developed to achieve output containment tracking. Additionally, sufficient conditions for the exponential stability are obtained based on the non-periodic intermittent and prescribed performance control methods. This criterion adopts the characterization of the average time interval. The effectiveness of the designed hybrid control strategy is verified by the simulation example, showcasing its advantage to solve the challenges in intermittent communication and prescribed performance."

    "abstract": "Cableway transport is a critical step in the post-harvest handling of bananas, and its effectiveness fundamentally relies on the reliable clamping of the banana pseudo-stem. Traditional rope-tying methods suffer from issues such as insecure clamping, susceptibility of banana bunches to falling, fruit damage due to impact, and low automation levels. To address these problems, this paper presents the design and development of an automatic clamping device for banana pseudo-stems used in cableway transport of banana bunches. The device employs an internal ring gear-pinion-clamping rack transmission mechanism, driven by a single electric actuator, to achieve synchronous radial movement of four clamping racks. The device parameters were determined through transmission system design and theoretical strength checks, while 3D modeling and static finite element simulations were completed using SolidWorks software. The results show that the working stress of the key load-bearing component (the clamping rack) under the rated load is 41.5 MPa, resulting in a safety factor of 4.94. Furthermore, under the ultimate load, the structure deforms only elastically, indicating a sufficient strength margin. Furthermore, the maximum strain of the banana pseudo-stem under the rated clamping force is 0.243, effectively avoiding crushing damage. The findings demonstrate that this clamping device achieves secure, stable, and non-damaging clamping of banana pseudo-stems, providing an effective technical solution to the problems of bunch drop and damage during cableway transport."

To address time-critical DC network faults, this research presents a novel scheme for the protection of low-voltage DC microgrid (LVDCM). Fault diagnosis and classification are achieved by observing the difference of variance in current signals from both ends of the cable. Subsequently, to locate the fault, the cable inductance up to the point of fault occurrence and the total cable inductance are computed using the recursive least square error technique. The presented strategy confirms the fault as an internal fault if the computed fault location is less than 1 p.u. The genuineness of the presented approach is examined through its implementation on multiple fault scenarios under different microgrid operating modes and topologies in a mesh-connected LVDCM using PSCAD/EMTDC. Comparative analysis of the developed scheme with the other existing algorithms clearly highlights the superior performance in terms of better selectivity, rapid fault diagnosis, and consistent performance amid noise."

    "abstract": "In this study, we present a novel approach for detecting faults in static systems with uncertain, interval-type data. Unlike traditional methods that treat measurements as exact values, our approach accounts for inherent uncertainties by modeling system variables as intervals. We develop an intervalvalued Principal Component Analysis (PCA) model using the method of Surya et al., which captures the dominant modes of variation while quantifying the uncertainty in both eigenvalues and eigenvectors. To evaluate fault detection, we introduce global interval-based detection indicators that robustly identify deviations caused by faults, even under significant uncertainty. Through a simulated example of a seven-variable system, we demonstrate that our method not only detects faults effectively but also distinguishes between different fault magnitudes and locations. The results show that certain indicators outperform others in clarity and sensitivity, providing practical guidance for real-time monitoring. Overall, this work offers a reliable framework for fault detection in uncertain systems, combining rigorous interval analysis with intuitive, interpretable indicators, and sets the stage for future applications in industrial and safetycritical environments."

    "abstract": "Heterogeneous Networks (HetNets) that combine a 3.5 GHz macro-cellular layer with a 28 GHz millimeter-wave (mmWave) small cell layer are a foundational architecture for 5G. While the mmWave layer offers vast bandwidth compatible with massive MIMO, its challenging propagation characteristics in urban environments necessitate detailed system-level analysis. This paper presents a dynamic simulation of a 5G HetNet, geographically anchored to the urban area of Tripoli, Libya. Using a framework based on 3GPP TR 38.901 channel models, the simulation identifies a critical performance bottleneck: “cell dominance,” where the superior propagation of the macro layer leads to congestion, leaving the high-capacity mmWave layer severely underutilized. To solve this, we investigate an aggressive Cell Selection Offsetting (CSO) strategy. Our findings demonstrate that 25 dB CSO effectively offloads users to the mmWave layer, resulting in a 19.9% increase in average user throughput with only a minor 0.89 dB decrease in average Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR). This study validates CSO as a critical optimization technique for 5G deployments in Tripoli."

This paper presents a framework for reduced-order modelling that uses Fourier-Bessel modal analysis and single-frequency excitation to make tissue characterisation easier. The surface of the breast is modelled as a circular elastic membrane, and the vibration data that were recorded are examined to obtain Fourier-Bessel coefficients that characterise mechanical actions. The corresponding mode shapes are rebuilt to show the patterns of deformation associated with inclusions of tumors. Tests carried out on ten breast phantoms with different depths and sizes of inclusions show notable differences in the spatial mode and coefficient values distributions between healthy and tumorous cases. The proposed approach effectively reduces computational complexity while preserving diagnostic sensitivity. Across ten phantom trials, the method achieved 87% sensitivity, 82% specificity, and 85% overall accuracy, confirming reliable detection of stiffness anomalies using only the dominant Fourier–Bessel coefficients. These results confirm that the method enables reliable tumor localization and provides a promising foundation for scalable, real-time, and low-cost breast cancer screening systems."

Results show that prompted (i.e. focus groups) and organic sources (i.e. online reviews) can yield different insights in terms of coverage, granularity, timespan and so forth. Neither one nor the other emerges as a superior data source in this study, as they appear complementary. As online reviews are often written after a delightful or unpleasant experience, their detailed and timely insights may position them as a viable choice for incremental innovation. While focus groups may be the ideal environment for participants to imagine and explore radical innovations, many of the recommendations, as well as concerns, were at least implied in a handful of online reviews. Considering the abundance of online reviews and advances in NLP, even a negligible share may be sufficient to derive insights for radical innovation."

    "abstract": "Central lumbar spinal stenosis, a prevalent degenerative spinal disorder, severely impacts the quality of life for those affected. Axial and sagittal MRI images offer diverse information on tissue structure and lesions, which is crucial for accurate diagnosis. However, MRI-based diagnostic approaches still have poor lesion localization, insufficient cross-view alignment, underutilization of multi-view MRI information, and limited generalization across patient variability. To address these problems, we proposed an Encompassing Lumbar Central Spinal Stenosis Grading Model via Multi-view MRI Image Fusion called ELSG-MF. ELSG-MF consists of three stages: the first stage utilizes the extraction of robust pseudo-labels through a contrast-driven consistency reinforcement technique to guide Med-SAM in localizing and segmenting spinal tissue components. The Sagittal-Axial Pairing (SAP) Algorithm was developed by stage2 to integrate the spatial anatomical relationship between the vertebral body and the intervertebral disc, facilitating the correlation pairing between sagittal and axial images. Stage3 subsequently innovated the multi-view Adaptive Fusion (M²AF) module, which enables adaptive dynamic fusion of anatomical features across views. M²AF enhances the extraction of contextual complementary information, and significantly improves the model’s capacity to detect subtle variations in the degree of narrowness. A series of studies show that our model achieves an overall accuracy of 0.8631, AUC of 0.96, and F1-score of 0.8614. These results indicate that our model substantially outperforms mainstream approaches, attaining superior segmentation and grading accuracy, exhibiting robust generalization and clinical application potential."

    "abstract": "This article presents an ultralow-power (ULP), battery-free intelligent silicon platform for distributed, multimodal sensing with adaptive, event-driven computing in edge devices. The proposed silicon platform incorporates hardware–software co-design in the implementation. At the algorithm level, a lightweight forward-forward (Lite-FF) algorithm is proposed to enable: 1) distributed model training with low-bitwidth operation and a small memory footprint and 2) event-driven feature transmission. At the circuit level, the digital compute-in-memory (CIM) architecture is employed to accelerate multiply-and-accumulate (MAC) operations with two key features for computation energy efficiency improvement: 1)a sparsity-adaptive input scheduler (SAIS) to skip redundant activation bit-level computations and 2) a sign-magnitude bit-significance accumulator (SM-BSA) to reduce bitline toggling by leveraging weight sparsity in sign-magnitude format. Fabricated in 65-nm CMOS, the silicon platform consumes 94.8 and 340.4nW in inference and training mode, respectively. Evaluated on a condition-based monitoring (CbM) task, the proposed framework can achieve a classification accuracy of 90.6% with dual-modal sensing while demonstrating the ability of on-chip training. The proposed compute engine can achieve a peak energy efficiency of 10.7 fJ/MAC at a 0.4-V supply voltage, outperforming the state-of-the-art nanowatt-class neural network (NN) accelerators by <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$1.76\\times $</tex-math> </inline-formula>."

    "abstract": "Existing solutions for bearing fault diagnosis often exhibit a considerable decline in performance when faced with multiple unknown working conditions, a critical out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization challenge. To address this, this paper introduces an improved DIVERSIFY framework with two key enhancements. Firstly, to overcome the critical issue of baseline DIVERSIFY requiring manual tuning for the number of latent domains, we propose a novel identification algorithm underpinned by a unique Kullback-Leibler (KL)-Log metric. This metric’s innovation lies in its ability to transform the continuous KL-divergence value into a discrete, integer-based format, which enables a direct and rule-based determination of the number of domains from the data distribution itself. Secondly, to adapt the DIVERSIFY structure for complex multi-sensor scenarios, a multi-sensor convolution fusion block (MCFB) is designed with a parallel multi-kernel architecture. By simultaneously employing convolutional kernels of varying sizes, the MCFB explicitly captures and fuses both intricate short-term local features and essential long-range temporal dependencies from multi-sensor signals. Comprehensive validation on a series of OOD generalization tasks demonstrates the method’s superiority. The proposed framework achieves average diagnostic accuracies of 97.41%, 95.20%, and 88.63% in challenging scenarios with one, two, and three unknown working conditions, respectively, significantly outperforming the baseline and other state-of-the-art approaches."

    "abstract": "C++ is a foundational programming language in university curricula, including in Vietnam, but its abstract concepts and syntax complexity present significant learning challenges, often causing student disengagement, particularly for beginners. To address these issues, this paper introduces a game-based learning (GBL) approach using a structured educational game to improve student engagement and competence in fundamental C++. The game features three progressive levels—from logic puzzles, to interactive code manipulation, and finally writing full code—to gradually build problem-solving and coding skills. Designed for first-year students, this approach focuses on foundational skills, excluding advanced topics like OOP. The method was evaluated with 166 first-year students in a C++ programming course through classroom experiments, learning achievement tests, and learner satisfaction assessments. The results showed that students using the game achieved a significantly higher average performance (mean score of 88.35) compared to peers in traditional settings (mean score of 75.66), and 95.0% expressed high satisfaction with learning C++ through the game. The findings also indicated that learning through games encouraged active participation and improved students' ability to understand programming concepts. This research highlights the efficacy of GBL in software engineering education and offers a practical framework for improving C++ instruction in Vietnamese higher education contexts. Future work may explore expanding the game to include advanced topics and other programming languages."

    "abstract": "This study introduces a symbolic, multi-layered approach that bridges semantic reasoning with dynamic digital environments. Existing solutions for managing structured cultural data often rely on rigid database schemas or brittle machine learning pipelines that struggle with semantic drift, context adaptation, and domain-specific fidelity. These traditional models lack mechanisms to maintain consistent, explainable knowledge evolution, and often fail to integrate heterogeneous inputs such as ontologies, visitor interactions, and metadata constraints. In response, we propose an integrated system architecture that comprises a symbolic repository layer, a formal reasoning engine, a temporal interaction graph, and a consistency controller—jointly orchestrated through a semantic framework named CuratoSynth. This orchestration enables adaptive knowledge alignment by encoding interpretive intentions and synthesizing them with evolving user behavior patterns. Our model ensures contextual integrity through logic-based rule enforcement and supports intelligent curatorial decision-making via automated inference and constraint propagation. Experimental simulations confirm the method’s robustness in sustaining ontological compliance and semantic continuity over time, significantly outperforming baseline approaches in both interpretive accuracy and system transparency. This work offers a scalable, explainable, and domain-grounded framework for the intelligent digital orchestration of cultural knowledge systems."

    "abstract": "The three-dimensional ocean temperature field plays a critical role in studies of global climate change, carbon cycling, and ocean dynamics. Subsurface temperature reconstruction, particularly within the thermocline, remains insufficient due to limitations in observational coverage and modeling frameworks. To address this challenge, we propose CSSP-ConvLSTM (CNN–Swin Transformer Spatial Parallel ConvLSTM), a subsurface temperature reconstruction model that integrates multi-source sea surface remote-sensing data. The model employs a spatial dual-branch structure and a temporal enhancement mechanism to achieve multi-scale characterization of local details, global dependencies, and nonlinear evolution. When applied to the northwestern Pacific (30–1000 m), reconstruction accuracy is significantly improved compared with single-branch or single-model baselines, with an average R² of 0.9811 and RMSE of 0.4557 °C reconstruction errors are markedly reduced within the thermocline (100–600 m) and deep layers (800–1000 m). Independent evaluations using ARMOR3D and EN4 datasets are conducted, confirming strong temporal generalization, stability, and physical consistency. Interpretability analysis based on SHAP indicates that shallow temperatures are primarily influenced by SST and SSH, whereas subsurface and deep layers are more affected by SSS and SSH. These results demonstrate that CSSP-ConvLSTM provides an effective approach for reconstructing high-resolution three-dimensional (3D) ocean temperature fields, and facilitates improved understanding of thermocline dynamics and their potential climatic implications."

However, the HTS armature windings produce AC loss when carrying AC currents under AC magnetic fields in superconducting electrical machines. It affects the efficiency of the superconducting electrical machines. In this paper, a full-scale HTS REBCO armature winding is wound based on our 10kW superconducting synchronous electrical machine design, and the corresponding finite element model is also built based on <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">T</i>-<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">A</i> formulation. Under different amplitudes and frequencies of the AC currents, the AC transport loss of the HTS REBCO winding is analyzed by simulation and experiment. The results show that the simulation and the experiment have good consistency. Meanwhile, the AC magnetization loss of the HTS REBCO winding is analyzed by simulation under different amplitudes of the AC magnetic fields. We find that the magnetization loss is much higher than the AC transport loss of the HTS REBCO windings. Finally, under different amplitudes of the AC currents and AC magnetic fields, the total AC loss of the HTS REBCO winding is also analyzed. This work is the first step towards R&D of high power density superconducting electrical machines for future electric aircraft."

A transformer-based segmentation model using Swin-Unet was proposed, and the effects of image preprocessing strategies and loss functions were investigated. A retrospective dataset of 255 patients was analyzed, with manual annotations serving as the ground truth. Preprocessing strategies including N4 bias correction, WhiteStrip and Z-score normalization, and resampling/cropping were evaluated. Several loss functions, including combo loss, Dice loss, and focal loss, were systematically compared. Swin-Unet was benchmarked against a classical U-Net baseline. Segmentation results revealed that Swin-Unet with resampling, cropping, and White-Strip normalization achieved the highest Dice similarity coefficients (DSCs) of 0.825 for PA, 0.565 for PG, and 0.716 for ICA. Swin-Unet demonstrated markedly improved segmentation performance, especially for PG, compared to U-Net (mean DSC = 0.613). These findings suggest that transformer-based architecture models, combined with appropriate preprocessing and loss optimization, can provide a promising framework for accurate and reliable segmentation of pituitary-related structures."

DELF employs a 3D CNN (CT), a convolutional Autoencoder (PET), and a Vision Transformer-based network (MRI) in an attention-mediated probabilistic ensemble. An uncertainty-aware meta-learner adaptively redistributes modality weights to improve robustness in the presence of noise or data scarcity. Experiments on LIDC-IDRI, PET/CT, and BraTS datasets show that DELF achieves AUC is 0.974 and F1-score is 0.950, outperforming the state-of-the-art fusion and stacking ensemble by up to $2.6 \\%$. Cross-modal attention maps, when visualised, show interpretable tumour localisation consistent with radiologist annotations. Near-real-time inference (Approx. 0.4 s per scan) and uncertainty-quantified predictions were obtained with the proposed framework, providing a reliable, clinically configurable solution for multimodal lung cancer screening."

    "abstract": "Feature selection is a critical component of machine learning, especially effective for analyzing high-dimensional biological data with complex, non-linear relationships. A key challenge in cancer genomics is prioritizing mutations, i.e., classifying pathogenic drivers from non-drivers mutations. Existing numerous pathogenic and conservational scoring algorithms (PCSAs) often shows significantly discordant predictions. Therefore, choosing the right set of PCSAs depending on their performance in distinguishing driver mutations is thus of critical importance and essentially a feature selection problem. In this study, we utilize a dataset of missense mutations from $\\mathbf{1, 0 0 9}$ breast cancer patients. We annotated these mutations with 41 PCSAs which act as features. To estimates the feature importance, we employed Random Forest classifiers coupled with three different Feature Ranking Methods (FRM) - Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), and Mean Decrease in Impurity (MDI) and evaluated the performance of each FRM in ranking these PCSAs. While classifiers built using top-ranked PCSAs resulting from all three FRMs performed well, the RFEbased model slightly performed better than others. DEOGEN2 consistently ranked as the top PCSA, along with MVP, MPC, and integrated_fitCons frequently appearing in the top ranks. These findings not only assess the utility of the studied FRMs but yield a robust set of PCSAs that are highly effective in separating pathogenic drivers from non-driver mutations in breast cancer."

    "abstract": "Vision Transformers have been tremendously successful in computer vision tasks. However, their large computational, memory, and energy demands are a challenge for edge inference on FPGAs - a field that has seen a recent surge in demand. We recognize the benefits of recent works on logic and Look Up Table (LUT) based networks, such as LogicNets, NeuraL Ut,Dwn, among others, in offering models that simultaneously reduce both the memory and compute footprints. However, these models natively do not perform well on common vision tasks, such as CIFAR-10/100. In this work, we propose LL-ViT, a novel edge optimized vision transformer design that integrates layers of LUT neurons within the transformer architecture. Based on our characterization that reveals that a majority of model weights and computations are from the channel mixer (MLP layer), we design an alternate LUT-based channel mixer, and simultaneously develop an FPGA-based accelerator for LL-ViT. Contrary to some attempts to replace each multiplication with a table lookup, our architecture utilizes a neural learning approach which natively learns the LUT functions. This approach allows for reduced model sizes, and a computational and energy-efficient inference solution for vision transformer models. Evaluating on edge-suitable workloads, we achieve accuracies of 95.5% on CIFAR-10, 78.8% on CIFAR-100, and 60.9% on Tiny-ImageNet datasets, comparable to the baseline transformer. LL- ViT eliminates over 60% of the model weights and 50 % of the multiplications in the model, and achieves 1.9× energy efficiency and 1.3 × lower latency over an integer quantized <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$V$</tex>iT accelerator, while also offering superior throughput against prior works at a 10.9W power budget."

We enhance Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) with a Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) to better capture and reproduce the sophisticated patterns, color variations, and detailed motifs characteristic of traditional batik designs. The study systematically evaluates three different configurations of CBAM implementation: within residual blocks (Batik GAN CA-R), combined with down-sampling and residual blocks (Batik GAN CA-RD), and integrated into up-sampling and residual blocks (Batik GAN CA-RU). Our innovative approach yielded impressive results in generating authentic-looking batik patterns, with metrics showing high-quality image generation: a Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) score of 13.863, demonstrating strong similarity to real batik patterns, a Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of 24.859, indicating excellent image quality, and a Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) of 0.901, confirming high structural fidelity. These strong performance indicators demonstrate the model's effectiveness in preserving and reproducing the sophisticated details of traditional batik patterns, contributing significantly to both digital art advancement and cultural preservation efforts. The proposed method shows promise for applications in digital textile design, cultural heritage documentation, and automated batik pattern generation."

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a robust control framework for a grid-connected hybrid energy system integrating photovoltaic (PV) panels and proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC). A fuzzy logic-based maximum power point tracking (MPPT) algorithm is implemented for the PV subsystem, while a proportional-integral (PI) controller regulates methane flow in the fuel cell reformer. The grid-side converter is managed by a Nonlinear Output Feedback Fuzzy Converter Control (NOFCC) based on a Takagi-Sugeno (TS) fuzzy model, ensuring DClink voltage stability and fault ride-through (FRT) capability. System stability is guaranteed via Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) conditions. MATLAB/Simulink simulations under grid faults and load variations demonstrate improved voltage stability, reduced overshoot, and enhanced power quality compared to conventional control methods."

    "abstract": "This work proposes a convolutional neural network (CNN) implemented in PyTorch for precise angle of arrival (AoA) estimation using uniform linear arrays (ULA). The architecture processes raw complex-valued antenna array data directly, streamlining the signal processing chain and enabling seamless integration into intelligent beamforming systems for high-frequency and millimeter-wave communications. The model was trained over 118 epochs with early stopping, monitoring training and validation losses to ensure convergence and prevent overfitting. Evaluated on separate training, validation, and test datasets, the estimator demonstrated strong generalization, achieving a mean absolute error (MAE) of approximately 0.60° and a mean squared error (MSE) near 1.01 deg<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">I. 2</sup> on the test set. These metrics reflect an average angular deviation below one degree, indicating high precision competitive for antenna signal processing applications.Representative test examples exhibited pointwise absolute errors under 0.5°, confirming the model’s fine angular resolution. A slight underestimation bias was observed but remained within acceptable limits without significant error spikes, even at the edges of the angular range. A case inference at 25° showed a predicted angle of 25.53°, with an absolute error of 0.53°, demonstrating practical prediction accuracy. Corresponding beamformer phase weights derived from the CNN output validate its applicability for real-time beamforming.Overall, the combination of low error metrics, stable training convergence, and consistent predictions confirms the CNN’s effectiveness for direct AoA regression from raw antenna data, making it suitable for deployment in real-time high-frequency communication and sensing systems where precise directional information is critical."

    "abstract": "Innovative energy management technologies have facilitated the operation of integrated energy systems (IESs), which interconnect different energy carriers essentially electricity, heat, and gas. The evolution of energy hubs (EHs) presents an opportunity for enhanced efficiency, reliability, and adaptability in meeting energy supply and demand. Incorporating EHs within the power system profoundly affects the operations of both transmission and distribution networks. Consequently, bilateral TSO-DSO coordination is necessary to increase effectiveness. Furthermore, by integrating power generation, storage facilities, and flexible loads, EHs have the potential to gain economic advantages by actively engaging in energy market activities. Therefore, this paper introduces a stochastic model for the economic energy management of distribution and transmission networks, incorporating renewable EHs based on TSO-DSO coordination. In the proposed model, the total operation costs of the networks and EHs are minimized, considering optimal power flow constraints of the networks and the operational framework of EHs situated within the distribution network. In addition to the considerable uncertainties linked to loads, renewable energies, and electric vehicles (EVs), the model addresses an integrated demand response program (IDRP). Accordingly, numerical results demonstrate that the proposed scheme is capable of improving the operation and economic status of the proposed structure by utilizing renewable resources as well as storage and flexible loads in the EHs."

    "abstract": "Water management in agriculture based on specific crop types is essential for optimizing yield, conserving water, and sustaining soil health. Different crops have varying water requirements, depending on their growth stages, root depth, and specific climatic conditions. For a large-scale cultivation system, a manual pumping system is inefficient with respect to water resource management and increases human dependency. To address the aforementioned issues, this paper proposes a microcontroller-based fully automated irrigation system to maintain the growth of crops and ensure plants are watered only when needed. This proposed system introduces a soil moisture sensors for continuous monitoring of soil conditions in and when the moisture level falls below a predefined threshold and as per the climate features extracted from weather API, the proposed learning framework with the help of ESP32 microcontroller activates a relay-controlled water pump to irrigate the soil till the moisture reaches an optimal level and accordingly the pump is automatically turned off to prevent overwatering. Smart farming systems are increasingly targeted by different types of cyber threats: False data injection attacks, reply attacks, Denial of service attacks, etc. To provide trust, reliability, and integrity, the proposed autonomous system also integrated Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)-256 encryption to provide end-to-end security. Experimental results reveal that the proposed system ensures trust, prevents manipulation, and protects both infrastructure and decision-making processes in automated or intelligent agriculture systems."

    "abstract": "The stringent reliability and latency requirements of industrial networks are challenged by harsh propagation environments. To design effective communication systems, a thorough understanding of the underlying channel characteristics is essential. Deploying multiple, spatially distributed Access Points (APs) is a promising strategy to overcome these challenges by creating resilient communication links through macro-diversity. This paper presents an experimental characterization of a multi-AP radio channel in a representative industrial laboratory environment, focusing on the 6 GHz band (upper FR1), enabling the investigation of frequency-dependent propagation mechanisms beyond traditional sub-6 GHz cellular bands. We analyze key statistical properties, including inter-link correlation, coherence distance, and coherence bandwidth, to assess the potential for both macro- and micro-diversity. The results demonstrate that the channels from distributed APs are largely uncorrelated, highlighting a significant opportunity for macro-diversity. Conversely, the measured coherence distances far exceed typical device dimensions, suggesting limited returns from single-device spatial diversity. An evaluation of selection combining, equal-gain combining, and maximal-ratio combining techniques confirms that distributed APs can provide substantial diversity gains, ranging from 2.6 dB to 23.1 dB. These findings validate the deployment of coordinated, distributed AP architectures as a crucial strategy for achieving robust, low-latency connectivity in future industrial settings."

The sensor has two layers: a stationary bottom layer, which consists of a half-mode SIW structure that incorporates three slots, and a rotatable top layer. The first resonance (<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">f<sub>1</sub></i>) appears at 2.4 GHz and remains stable to serve as a reference point, while the second resonance (<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">f<sub>2</sub></i>) shifts from 3.42 to 4.24 GHz as the top layer rotates from 0° to 90°, with a sensitivity of 9.1 MHz/°.

This compensation principle is demonstrated by temperature analysis. The measured results indicate that the frequency difference remains constant over a wide temperature range from −60°C to 60°C, as temperature affects both frequencies in a similar manner. This confirms that the use of the frequency difference effectively suppresses common-mode frequency drifts, rendering Δ<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">f</i> insensitive to these effects and allowing for reliable detection.

    "abstract": "Accurate calibration of magnetic gradient tensor (MGT) sensor arrays requires correcting both the magnitude and directional responses of individual triaxial magnetometers. Conventional scalar-based calibration methods focus solely on fitting the magnitude of the magnetic field vector, lacking control over directional accuracy and thereby compromising the reliability of MGT construction under field conditions. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a directionally regularized two-stage calibration framework specifically for cross-shaped MGT fluxgate sensor arrays. A physically interpretable twelve-parameter error model is formulated to decouple sensor-internal distortions from array-level orientation misalignments. Crucially, a directional regularization term is incorporated into the calibration objective function to enforce vector alignment across the array. Furthermore, a high-precision triaxial fluxgate sensor is employed as an internal reference, enabling fully self-contained calibration without external field generators or scalar magnetometers. For accurate estimation of the calibration parameters, a two-stage optimization strategy based on Differential Evolution (DE) is developed, in which all parameters are coarsely estimated via magnitude consistency in the first stage, followed by refined alignment of array orientations via directional regularization in the second stage. Field experiments conducted over six independent trials validate the effectiveness and reproducibility of the proposed framework, yielding an overall mean magnitude RMSE of approximately 5.92 nT and a mean angular deviation of 0.07°. These results confirm that the proposed framework enables accurate and robust compensation of MGT sensor arrays in practical environments."

This study evaluates the influence of these maneuvers on a T-type intersection under four configurations: T-type intersection without traffic lights, without and with an exclusive U-lane, with traffic lights, without and with exclusive U-lane. The research was carried out at the intersection of Av. José Antonio Lavalle with Alameda San Marcos, an area with a high influx of vehicles and pedestrians. Using simulations in VISSIM 9.0 and conflict analysis in SSAM, vehicular conflicts were quantified and evaluated using safety metrics such as Time to Collision (TTC). The results show that the intersection without a traffic light and without an exclusive U-lane has 145 conflicts, the intersection with an exclusive U-lane and without a traffic light reduces that figure to 93, the traffic light configuration without an exclusive U-lane reduces conflicts to 117, and the configuration with a traffic light and exclusive lane for U-turns further reduces conflicts to 79. These figures represent reductions of 35.9 %, 19.3 and 45.5 %, respectively, compared to the configuration without an exclusive U-lane and without traffic lights -initial situation-. Likewise, severe conflicts with TTC=0 maintain a proportion according to the total conflicts of the intersection for each configuration. The study concludes that the proper management of U-turns, combining traffic light control and exclusive U-lanes can significantly reduce vehicular conflicts."

    "abstract": "Making personalized recommendation for cold-start users, who only have a few interaction histories, is a challenging problem in recommendation systems. Recent works leverage hypernetworks to directly map interaction histories to user-specific parameters, which are then used to modulate predictor by certain modulation structure. These works obtain the state-of-the-art performance. However, there lacks a general approach to design the modulation structure. Instead of using a fixed modulation function and deciding modulation position by expertise, we propose to determine proper modulation structure, including function and position, via neural architecture search. We propose two approaches. We first design a symbolic search space which covers broad models and theoretically prove that this search space can be transformed to a much smaller space, enabling an efficient and robust one-shot search algorithm, called ColdNAS. Since recommendation systems are a special case of bipartite matching problems, the proposed methods can be generalized to a wide range of cold-start tasks, such as disease-gene association prediction for emerging diseases. However, diverse scenarios introduce new challenges in both the flexibility of the search algorithm and the search space. To address these limitations, we further propose ColdNAS<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$_+$</tex-math></inline-formula>, where we employ neural networks to model modulation functions to extend search space and design a two-stage decoupled stochastic search algorithm to enable non-differentiable targets in continuous spaces. Extensive experimental results on benchmark datasets show that modulation structures obtained by ColdNAS and ColdNAS<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$_+$</tex-math></inline-formula> consistently outperform hand-designed cold-start techniques for recommending items for new users and predicting associated genes for new disease. We observe that different modulation functions lead to the best performance on different datasets or under different metrics, which validates the necessity of designing the modulation structure in a data-driven way."

In this work, is proposed a photonic lens based on a structure composed of a quasi-periodic distribution of air holes embedded in a metamaterial substrate with a refractive index of 3.6. The photonic lens is designed by replicating a quasi-periodic unit cell six times around his center, using photonic bandgaps, generated by the quasi-periodicity, to control the propagation of light. The optical input signal is focusing perpendicularly along the longitudinal direction of the air holes, which block certain light frequencies and allow others to pass through specific regions, enabling effects such as beam bending control and focusing. This allows light confinement within nanometric waveguides, with the focal length being adjusted through structural control. The study employs the Finite Element Method (FEM) to simulate the energy confinement between the quasi-periodic region and the guiding structure, operating at a wavelength of 1550 nm."

To efficiently manage distributed storage, we integrate large language models (LLMs) for real-time and intelligent caching decisions. The proposed approach leverages LLMs’ ability to process heterogeneous information, including user profiles, historical data, content characteristics, and dynamic system states.Through a designed prompting framework encoding task objectives and caching constraints, the LLMs formulate caching as a decision-making task, and our hierarchical deterministic caching mapping strategy enables adaptive requests prediction and precise content placement across three tiers without frequent retraining.Simulation results demonstrate the advantages of our proposed caching scheme."

    "abstract": "India's electricity market, centered around the volatile Day-Ahead Market, presents significant financial risk to participants. The recent introduction of electricity futures offers a potential hedging solution, but adoption is hindered by a nascent market structure and a critical lack of liquidity beyond the front-month contract. This study provides a quantitative, simulation-based evaluation of the efficacy of these new instruments. A synthetic historical futures price series is constructed for a forty-month period based on an analysis of observed market premiums in both contango and backwardation states. The performance of three distinct hedging archetypes, Conservative, Moderate, and Aggressive, is then back-tested against historical spot price data. A bootstrap statistical test is employed to validate the robustness of the findings. The results demonstrate that dynamic hedging strategies yield statistically significant mean monthly savings of approximately one to one-point-five percent. The Moderate, volatility-triggered strategy is identified as optimal from a risk-adjusted perspective, delivering both cost savings and the highest degree of cost stability. This paper provides the first empirical evidence to motivate broader participation from stakeholders, arguing that active, data-driven hedging is a viable strategy to mitigate risk and can help overcome the initial liquidity barriers in the Indian electricity derivatives market."

Unlike traditional static line ratings which are conservative and based on fixed assumptions, DLR provides more accurate and flexible assessments by incorporating real time environmental factors to compute the line ratings dynamically which enables to optimize power flows without compromising on system safety. This paper explores various methods for calculating Dynamic Line Ratings (DLR) which includes curve fitting, empirical methods and data driven approaches. The discussion highlights the advantages of DLR in optimizing the utilization of existing transmission infrastructure, reducing congestion and improving grid reliability. Additionally, we discuss the limit exchange portal TROLIE which enables the exchange of limits among various entities and enable broader operational aspects and reliability."

    "abstract": "India rapid transition toward renewable energy, especially wind power, necessitates addressing environmental challenges that affect performance. With an installed wind capacity of 50 GW as of March 2025 and a target of 100 GW by 2030, the country's wind energy sector must operate efficiently under extreme climatic conditions, particularly high ambient temperatures. This paper analyses the impact of high temperatures on wind turbine generator (WTG) performance across major wind-rich states. Empirical data from ISTS-connected WTGs reveal significant thermal derating behaviour beginning as low as 38°C, leading to reduced output even under rated wind speed conditions. The study highlights the importance of aligning turbine design with Indian environmental standards, such as those by the Central Electricity Authority and IEC 61400-1. Findings underscore the need to factor temperature-induced derating into generation forecasts, resource adequacy studies, and long-term planning to ensure grid reliability and renewable integration. Recommendations are provided to enhance WTG design verification, improve thermal tolerance, and align operational strategies with evolving climatic conditions. It is hypothesized that WTGs operating in high-temperature regions exhibit measurable power derating above 38°C, and that current IEC-based designs may require adaptation for Indian climatic conditions."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel successive approximation (SA) algorithm designed for electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. Instead of digitizing each sample independently, the proposed method encodes the difference between consecutive samples, effectively leveraging the low activity nature of ECG signals. Unlike the conventional successive approximation register (SAR) ADCs, which require a fixed N comparisons for an N-bit conversion, the proposed approach dynamically adjusts the number of comparisons per sample, typically ranging from 2 to N. The algorithm was implemented in MATLAB and tested on ECG signals, demonstrating significant efficiency gains. Results show that the proposed method reduces the number of comparisons by $73.29 \\%$ compared to the conventional SAR ADC method and by 13.81 % compared to the LSB-first algorithm, a popular scheme from the literature. Additionally, DAC update operations are minimized by the same percentages, leading to substantial power savings in both DAC and digital logic components of the SAR ADC design. These improvements make the method particularly wellsuited for low-power biomedical applications, especially batteryoperated ECG monitoring devices."

    "abstract": "FMCW mmWave radar has shown promise in vital signs measurement in stationary scenarios. However, its precision for heart rate detection significantly degrades in moving scenarios due to overwhelming action noise. To address this issue, we introduce SkeletonHR, a novel approach for robust human heart rate detection in complex movement scenarios using a commodity mmWave radar. SkeletonHR first leverages an advanced network for human joint points reconstruction and four additional joint points were interpolated to fully extract the phase signals from the upper body. For the purpose of isolating the complete heartbeat signal from the complex composite signal, we propose a HeartWave-VMD algorithm that extracts the heartbeat signal by rigorously evaluating its physiological validity and quality of the heartbeat signal. Furthermore, an adaptive joint-point prioritization strategy is explored to select the most reliable signal across multiple chest joints to enhance the accuracy and robustness of heart rate detection. Ablation experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. Experimental results show that SkeletonHR can accurately separate heartbeat in the presence of micro and large random body movements. The 80th percentile of the absolute heart rate error per minute is less than 4.51 BPM in the case of micro movement and 10.35 BPM in the case of large movement."

The objective of the HIL testing is to evaluate the performance of the BESS controller when the BESS is utilized as a power conditioning system to provide active and reactive power to the network. A test case containing AC network, BESS, inverter and interfacing transformer is developed in RSCAD. The replica controller which is the device under test (DUT) is interfaced with the RTDS through input/output cards. The RSCAD model sends the status of the system such as the DC link signals (voltage and current), the inverter output parameters and the Point of Interconnection (POI) voltage and current signals to the external replica controller using the Gigabit-Transceiver Analogue Output (GTAO) cards. After receiving these signals, the replica controller generates gating signals for the IGBTs of the inverter through the Gigabit-Transceiver Digital Input (GTDI) cards. Different types of grid conditions and BESS operating modes such as active power control/reactive power control, charge/discharge and, low voltage ride through (LVRT) tests are performed to validate the BESS controller capability and results are provided. The developed test system will help utilities test the BESS controller prior to installation and commissioning."

This is a plan for an intrusion detection system using techniques like self-replication and pattern matching. The system notifies other nodes to be on the lookout for potentially damaging event sequences by identifying potentially dangerous symptoms in the surrounding environment. The suggested model, Imperative Node Evaluator with Self Replication Code and Auto Triggering Mode (INE-SRC-ATM), is made to automatically trigger nodes to secure the network and lessen false alarms, as well as to automatically repair the network in the event of an intrusion. When there is a difference in characteristics that raise the bar for network security, the suggested model reacts instantly. Both the accuracy of self-replication triggering and the degrees of intrusion detection demonstrate good performance of this model in intrusion detection."

Among the well-established TL matching circuit design methods are the binomial type, which offers a flat transmission response, and the Chebyshev type, which allows inband ripple to be used as a design parameter. These circuits are frequently implemented using two or more sections. However, determining the required parameters typically involves solving complex polynomial expressions or referring to precomputed table data under representative conditions. In this paper, we propose a simple and intuitive graphical design method for two-section TL matching circuits using the Smith chart. The differences between the Binomial and Chebyshev methods are clearly visualized on the Smith chart, highlighting how the ripple specification defined in the Chebyshev approach leads to differences in the resulting designs, thereby simplifying the design process."

Optical flow estimation generates skeleton data from OpenPose-detected body points as the second stage of the process. The process generates hybrid features through SIFT and Local Binary pattern technique combination. Features undergo concatenation followed by Grey wolf optimization enhancement after the feature extraction process. The DNN classifier operates to recognize activities that stem from the obtained data. The assessment of this method took place through the use of the public Volleyball dataset. This dataset contains 500 video sequences shot under different lighting and occlusion conditions. The detection system of our proposed method showed better performance than various baseline methods which made the system more reliable in difficult situations. The research shows how the combined feature fusion system with optimization methods from SIFT and LBP operates at 25ms frame rate (40ms processing time) for real-time system and extends its scalability to multi-computer systems.

Recent studies have explored the use of the discretized Degn-Harrison model as a two-dimensional (2D) CM for image encryption; however, its practical applicability is limited by a narrow chaotic region containing periodic windows. In this paper, a novel modification of the classical Degn-Harrison map is proposed to overcome this limitation. The proposed approach embeds a one-dimensional chaotic map into the Degn-Harrison system and employs a modulo operation, resulting in a significantly enhanced dynamical structure.

    "abstract": "This study innovatively integrated a heterogeneous parallel mechanism with a passive pneumatic control system featuring reciprocating drive characteristics, and proposed a three-degree-of-freedom passive foot-ankle mechanism suitable for quadruped robots. Based on the new structure, the kinematic model of the ankle and mathematic model of the elastic element, comprising mechanical and pneumatic model, were established by using appropriate theory. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed structure in actual limb motion was validated using a single-leg experimental platform. The results indicate that the novel structure not only enables reverse regulation of limb movement through changes in footplate posture, but also significantly optimizes the driving torque characteristics of leg joints."

    "abstract": "In electricity distribution, disturbances frequently occur, including both symmetrical and asymmetrical faults. Case in year 2023, PLN UP3 Bulungan as one of the state company responsible for electricity generation and distribution in Indonesia, recorded 104 occurred medium-voltage disturbances, 85% of which were caused by phase-to-ground short circuits. Such faults may result in phase angle imbalances and induce fault currents in the grounding conductors of the medium-voltage network. To detect these faults, Ground Fault Detectors (GFDs) have been deployed across all distribution substations. The GFD detects fault currents caused by phase-to-ground faults using a current transformer (CT). The CT then transmits signals to the control circuit, triggering a fault indication. This study analyzes the GFD current setting calculation on the distribution system at PLN UP3 Bulungan, which has a length of 11.4 km. The results show that the single-phase short-circuit current at 1% distance from the source is 953.53 A, while at 100% distance from the source, it is 805.85 A. Therefore, the recommended GFD current setting Distribution system is 80 A. This result is expected to improve fault detection accuracy and distribution system reliability at specifically at PLN UP3 Bulungan."

    "abstract": "Obtaining broadband measurements of dielectric properties is a challenge, particularly at high frequencies. An established approach is to use an open coaxial probe resting on a sample of the material under test (MUT) that has a known thickness. We describe the application of this technique using Speag’s DAK-TL2 system to characterize several 3D-printed plastics. 3D-printed materials have very little published data about their electrical properties, and plastics are very convenient for making microwave components from coil formers to antennas. Low-loss materials are of particular interest, exacerbating the measurement challenge. Ideally, the MUT samples are homogenous, have uniform thickness, and the surfaces are very smooth [1]. None of these properties can be attained with most plastics, particularly with 3D-printed plastics, with the most challenging property being surface smoothness. For low-loss materials, the loss tangents are close to or less than the measurement uncertainty of the system. Much of this uncertainty is due to the losses in the probe and the detail of the interface between the probe and the MUT. The procedure, measurements, and repeatability behaviour of the complex dielectric constants of a variety of 3D-printed plastics are presented for frequencies up to 20 GHz."

While centralized machine learning offers high detection accuracy, it suffers from privacy risks, high latency, and limited scalability. This paper proposes a Federated Learning (FL)-based cybersecurity framework designed for hybrid anomaly detection in smart grid infrastructures. The approach enables edge devices to locally train time-series models without raw data exchange, thereby preserving privacy and minimizing communication overhead. The framework addresses key challenges including non-IID data distributions and edge node dropout. Experimental results on an extended IEEE 33-bus system with integrated PV/wind resources and cyber-physical fault injection modules confirm near-centralized accuracy (~94.8%), 20% latency reduction, and a significant reduction of raw data exposure risks. Additionally, the system achieves 75% bandwidth savings and improved energy efficiency, while scalability, real-time feasibility, and adversarial robustness are explicitly considered. This work advances the deployment of privacy-preserving, edge-intelligent AI for secure, resilient urban infrastructure."

This work presents a Support Vector Regression (SVR)-based approach for estimating the Angle of Arrival (AoA) in 5G M2M environments, aiming to enhance spatial awareness, dynamic beamforming, and interference suppression in dense deployments. The proposed model is validated using synthetic array data and benchmarked against traditional regression techniques. Results show that the SVR method significantly reduces angular estimation errors under low-noise conditions, particularly for a half-wavelength interelement spacing, while highlighting that grating lobes degrade accuracy at angles above 30°, which can be alleviated by reducing the spacing between antenna elements. Moreover, its relevance is underscored through recent clinical use cases of 5G-powered medical platforms—such as capsule endoscopy and telesurgery—where accurate beam control and signal direction estimation are critical. These findings position SVR-based AoA estimation as a key enabler for next-generation M2M medical systems operating in latency-sensitive and spatially constrained environments."

The study focuses on channel measurements and performance analysis under different antenna configurations using a laboratory setup. Measurements were carried out to assess the achievable throughput by varying the reference signal received power (RSRP) at the User Equipment (UE). We assumed large-scale path loss models under Line-of-Sight (LOS) and Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) scenarios to estimate the maximum distance coverage range for FR3 frequency bands. Furthermore, we analysed the impact of different antenna configuration, Single-input Single-output (SISO) and Multiple-input Multiple-output (MIMO), on achievable throughput and distance coverage range. Results indicate significant degradation in throughput as frequency and number of antenna increase, especially in NLOS scenarios. The study offers critical insights into FR3 practical coverage limits, which are essential for guiding 6G deployment strategies in urban scenarios."

    "abstract": "Understanding the use of buildings (i.e., building functions) is crucial for effective urban management and policy making. Recently, many deep learning-based models have been developed to identify building functions. However, their high performance depends on a large labeled dataset, which is a significant challenge for cities with limited labeled data. To close this gap, we propose a similar-place knowledge-retrieval-based framework for building function identification that enables a trained model to be directly applied/transferred to other cities without additional training needed. Our approach combines remote sensing imagery, POI data, and building footprints to capture the macro and micro built environment. Specifically, this framework includes two different modules: 1) a geo-aware transformer-based model to capture fine-grained spatial interactions between buildings; 2) a hierarchical node clustering algorithm with a similar-place knowledge-retrieval layer for portraying the coarse-grained features. This combination clusters all neighbors of a target building into a ’place’ and then conducts a coarse-grained knowledge transfer based on the similarity match. The evaluation conducted across nine cities demonstrates that the proposed model outperforms all state-of-the-art baselines, achieving an average improvement of 21.98% in cross-city predictions, as measured by Cohen’s kappa coefficient. More importantly, the ablation study shows that integrating our knowledge-retrieval layer into other deep-learning baselines significantly improves their cross-city prediction performance. Additionally, the transferability performance analysis indicates that greater similarity between the sample distributions in the source and target cities contributes to the proposed model’s higher transferability. In summary, the proposed knowledge-retrieval layer is an effective and reliable component for enhancing cross-city prediction and has strong potentials for application in cities without labeled data to support city management and sustainable urban planning."

    "abstract": "Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) pose severe challenges to Next-Generation Communication Networks (NGCNs) due to their stealthiness and NGCNs’ dynamic topology, while conventional GNN-based intrusion detection systems suffer from static aggregation and poor adaptability to unseen nodes. To address these issues, this paper proposes DAA-FPN-SAGE, a lightweight graph-based detection framework integrating Dynamic Adaptive Aggregation (DAA) and Multi-Scale Feature Pyramid Network (MSFPM). Leveraging GraphSAGE’s inductive learning capability, the framework effectively models unseen nodes or subgraphs and adapts to NGCN’s dynamic changes (e.g., elastic network slicing, online AI model updates)—a key advantage for handling NGCN’s real-time topological variations. The DAA module employs multi-hop attention to dynamically assign weights to neighbors at different hop distances, enhancing capture of hierarchical dependencies in multi-stage APT attack chains. The MSFPM module fuses local-global structural information via a gated feature selection mechanism, resolving dimensional inconsistency and enriching attack behavior representation. Extensive experiments on StreamSpot, Unicorn, and DARPA TC#3 datasets demonstrate superior performance, meeting detection requirements of large-scale NGCNs."

    "abstract": "Multi-modal Video Question Answering (MVQA) is a complex and emerging task at the intersection of computer vision and natural language processing, which requires models to comprehend and reason over multiple synchronized information streams including video, audio, and textual transcripts to correctly answer natural language questions. Despite recent progress, many existing approaches rely on late-stage fusion mechanisms or learn shallow co-occurrence patterns between modalities and questions. These limitations hinder their ability to capture nuanced, fine-grained semantic interactions, especially in challenging benchmarks such as Social-IQ, which focus on social reasoning and subtle contextual understanding. In this work, we propose Tripartite and Bipartite Graph Attention (TBGA), a novel graph-based architecture specifically designed to address the semantic alignment challenges inherent in MVQA. TVGA employs a dual-graph strategy: a tripartite graph is used to explicitly model inter-modal relationships among video, audio, and transcript representations, while bipartite graphs are constructed between question tokens and each modality to enable question-aware semantic encoding. This design facilitates structured reasoning across heterogeneous modalities and ensures that information is integrated in a semantically coherent and interpretable manner. We validate the effectiveness of our approach through experiments on Social-IQ dataset, a benchmark designed to test high-level social and emotional reasoning in videos. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming prior methods. These results demonstrate the potential of structured graph-based reasoning in advancing multi-modal understanding and highlight the benefits of explicit cross-modal alignment in complex video reasoning tasks."

ABHCC also offered low computational cost and enabled high-speed current regulation through FPGA implementation. However, it was observed that switching delays in power electronic devices caused the actual switching frequency to fall below the target. To address this issue, this study propose a novel control method that integrates ABHCC with state prediction control (SPC), explicitly accounting for switching delays. The proposed approach preserves the low online computational cost characteristic of ABHCC, thereby retaining its suitability for high-speed current control. Simulation and experimental results confirm that the proposed method effectively compensates for switching delay and brings the inverter’s switching frequency closer to the desired value."

    "abstract": "Atmospheric correction is a prerequisite for deriving accurate ocean color products from satellite observations. However, current atmospheric correction algorithms directly mask clouds and around area to avoid the influence of cloud adjacency effects (CAEs), which degrade the quality of satellite observations, limiting the spatial-temporal continuity of water quality monitoring. In this study, we introduce the CAEs-effected Atmospheric correction for Polar-orbit satellites (CAP) algorithm, demonstrated using MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer-Aqua (MODISA) as an example. CAP is a physically constrained data-driven approach designed to enhance atmospheric correction performance in the presence of CAEs. The algorithm integrates the physical foundation of the standard atmospheric correction scheme implemented in SeaDAS with the cloud-adjacency correction information extracted from GOCI data. The GOCI-based CAE features are transferred to MODISA spectral bands and jointly used for model training. Validation using independent testing datasets shows that CAP achieves band-averaged correlation coefficients (R) of 0.97 with minimal bias and significantly reduces relative percentage differences near cloud edges. CAP improves signal-to-noise ratios by up to 53.7%, particularly in the red bands, and increases the number of valid observations by ~40%. Global-scale composites confirm that CAP can generate Rrs fields consistent with the results of the standard atmospheric correction in SeaDAS without applying straylight masks, thereby recovering valuable observations previously discarded. By mitigating CAE-induced biases while maintaining accuracy in cloud-free conditions, CAP enhances the reliability of bio-optical retrievals and expands observational coverage for ocean color applications. The methodology of integrating geostationary and polar-orbit sensor data provides a transferable framework for future satellite missions and can be extended to other challenging atmospheric correction scenarios."

    "abstract": "Instantaneous frequency estimation is significant in signal processing for non-stationary multi-component signals in dense time-frequency environments. Researchers studied different algorithms for instantaneous frequency to suppress frequency switching errors. However, many classical algorithms are susceptible to errors in the time-frequency distribution (TFD) and noise at instantaneous frequencies, which often degrades their performance for multi-component frequency estimation. We propose a hybrid genetic algorithm-optimized adaptive directional time-frequency distribution (HGA-ADTFD) to improve the efficiency of multi-signal processing in TFD. The proposed HGA-ADTFD algorithm optimizes TFD using genetic parameter optimization. Crucially, the algorithm implements a joint calibration strategy that fuses local linear segments from the Hough transform with continuous paths from the Viterbi algorithm to determine the final instantaneous frequency. The proposed HGA-ADTFD algorithm achieves a minimum root mean square error for the final instantaneous frequency value, which is reduced to 0.5 MHz (the sampling frequency is 100 MHz)."

    "abstract": "Recent studies in collaborative edge computing fail to take advantage of shareable structures in multi-task learning (MTL) models and the potential of MTL models sharing at the edge. This leads to resource under-utilization at the edge. Thus, this paper focuses on shareable-structure-aware model deployment and task scheduling in collaborative multi-task inference, so as to fully utilize the low-latency potential of edge computing. Specifically, we formally define the problem with an objective to maximize edge throughput under multiple constraints (e.g., resource constraint, model integrity, etc.), and prove that it is NP-hard. To solve the problem, we first propose an approximation algorithm based on randomized rounding to generate sub-optimal solutions. We then present an adjustment strategy that generates a feasible solution when the approximation algorithm violates any of the given constraints. To evaluate the proposed algorithms, we conduct comprehensive simulations based on state-of-the-art MTL models, Google cluster-usage trace, and four kinds of computing units. Extensive experiments show that the proposed approximation algorithm coupled with the adjustment strategy, outperforms state-of-the-art methods for all cases, in terms of edge throughput."

    "abstract": "Current mobile robot navigation validation faces challenges with limited real-world testing and safety concerns. Digital twin technology offers a cost-effective and safe solution to accelerate algorithm validation and optimization. However, existing digital twin approaches often neglect the dynamic characteristics of mobile robots, resulting in significant discrepancies between the virtual model and the physical counterpart. To address this gap, this paper proposes a dynamics-integrated digital twin modeling method based on a two-wheel differential-drive mobile robot platform. Firstly, a complete dynamic model accounting for dynamic uncertainties is established. On one hand, a data-driven methodology is employed for offline identification of dynamic parameters, enabling high-fidelity modeling. On the other hand, for real-time model calibration, an adaptive theory-based online parameter identification method is designed. Coupled with establishing a real-time heterogeneous data communication link, this completes the construction of a comprehensive digital twin system. Experimental results demonstrate a high consistency between the model-predicted displacement and the actual motion state. Comparisons based on error metrics among three schemes—offline identification, online identification, and uncertainty consideration-validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in enhancing model fidelity. This research provides both theoretical support and practical insights for achieving highfidelity digital twin modeling of mobile robots."

Their predictions are then integrated through an optimized late-fusion strategy, producing a unified and robust representation.

CHCRL first quantifies scenario difficulty via a fuzzy complexity model and uses a Fuzzy Inference System for target pose estimation in unstructured areas. Second, it employs a Constrained Markov Decision Process with a hybrid action space (discrete intentions, continuous parameters) for smooth path generation. Crucially, a complexity-driven adaptive constraint mechanism dynamically adjusts safety thresholds based on the environmental score. Experimental results in parallel and perpendicular scenarios demonstrate that CHCRL significantly outperforms baselines (PPO, SAC), exhibiting superior robustness, safety, and efficiency, especially in complex parking tasks."

This study offers a comparative assessment of ML classifiers to identify illegal activity in cryptocurrency transactions based on the Elliptic Bitcoin Transaction dataset. A two-stage feature selection approach including variance threshold method and random forest based feature ranking method was utilized to extract most informative features. Six ML classifiers, namely Random Forest (RF), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Classifier (SVC), Gradient Boosting (GB), and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), were chosen and compared on a stratified train-test split based on accuracy, precision, recall, f1 score, confusion matrix, and ROCU-AUC score. The performance results illustrate how RF, GB, and the rest of the methods consistently produced the best 98% accuracy rate with almost flawless classification scores of (0.997, 0.994, and 0.982, respectively). However, the KNN achieved an AUC value of 0.963, and the margin-based SVC achieved an AUC value of 0.981.

To ensure the gathering of consistent and high-quality image datasets, the authors developed an image acquisition setup that included a C920 Logitech camera and LED light strips.

A full Newton-Raphson power-flow model implemented in MATPOWER is employed to accurately access voltage and system losses under various distributed energy resources (DER) configurations. The performance of two metaheuristic algorithms; the Manta Ray Foraging Optimization Algorithm (MRFOA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is compared for minimizing a weighted sum of active power loss, voltage deviation, and unmet peak load across four scenarios: baseline (no DER), PV-only, PV+EVCS, and PV+BESS+EVCS. Simulation results validate that MRFOA consistently achieves faster convergence than PSO and always satisfies operational constraints. In the PV-only scenario, MRFOA improves the minimum bus voltage from 0.913 p.u. (baseline) to 0.953p.u. and reduces active losses by 40 %. With the inclusion of EVCS and BESS, MRFOA further reduces losses to under 1 kW and maintains all voltages within ±3% of nominal, as confirmed by detailed quantitative metrics. These results demonstrate the effectiveness and practical applicability of MRFOA for multi-objective DER planning in smart distribution networks."

A half-wave dipole antenna operating at 26 GHz is designed and integrated into various array configurations: URAs <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$(0.5\\lambda,\\ 5\\lambda)$</tex> and GAM arrays <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$(1.45\\lambda,\\ 2.91\\lambda)$</tex>. Simulations are performed to evaluate key performance metrics, including peak gain, half-power beamwidth (HPBW), and sidelobe level (SLL). Results show that while URAs with large spacing suffer from severe grating lobes (e.g., SLL of -0.29 dB for <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$5\\lambda$</tex> spacing), while the aperiodic structure of GAM arrays effectively suppresses them. The GAM <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$1.45\\lambda$</tex> array with <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$1.45\\lambda$</tex> spacing achieves a high peak gain of 22.16 dBi, a narrow HPBW of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$2.5^{\\circ}$</tex>, and an improved SLL of -16.71 dB. Beamforming analysis for this GAM array demonstrates robust steering capabilities for moderate angles (e.g., 20.50 dBi at 30°), with a typical gradual gain degradation at wider angles (e.g., 8.91 dBi at <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$75^{\\circ}$</tex>).

    "abstract": "Supercapacitor-assisted loss management (SCALoM) concept has laid the theoretical foundation for developing high-efficiency power converters for renewable energy systems, using supercapacitors (SC) as lossless voltage droppers and energy buffers. The analytical study in this paper demonstrates how SCALoM is applied to reduce losses in renewable energy inverters. It is shown that the losses in input DC loop can be reduced by utilizing an even number of small inverters to deliver the overall load in combination with identical supercapacitor modules, instead of a stand-alone large inverter. Loss reduction occurs in the static transistor losses, copper losses, and DC bus capacitor series resistance, while adding DC-UPS capability to the inverter system. The proof of concept four-SCA-inverter system is composed of a four identical inverter combination coupled with four 250F supercapacitor modules, extends the input range of the inverter system by a factor of two. This reduces the voltage stress on the inverter components and the input loop rms current by a factor of two. The experimental four-SCA-inverter system, built with unmodified commercial inverters and 250F SC modules (switched at frequencies below frequency of 0.02Hz), indicates efficiency improvements upto 2.5% compared to parallel inverter arrangements. The central SPWM driven, optimized four-SCA-inverter arrangement indicates significant efficiency gains, at higher load levels compared to a single central inverter arrangement. As per the experimental observations the SCA-inverter design approach eliminates the load balancing and synchronisation issues associated with multi-inverter systems."

    "abstract": "The multi-phase converter has been widely used for fuel cell (FC) applications. However, despite the continuous operation of the converter, the switch fault would deteriorate the control performance of the closed-loop controller, and cause increased input current ripple. To this end, in this paper, a robust fault-tolerant control based on the framework of active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) is proposed for a four-phase interleaved converter. In particular, the system control gain is updated based on the duty cycles, so that the control performance under switch fault can be maintained. On the other hand, the method of phase shift reconfiguration is proposed to suppress the input current ripple of multi-phase converters under switch fault, in which the optimal phase shift is calculated by optimizing the object function derived from the input current ripple model. The experimental results are provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method."

    "abstract": "Controlling system frequency is critical for operational reliability and stability of power systems. Automatic generation control (AGC) plays a key role in controlling the deviation in frequency and tie-line power flow within the defined limits as they may lead to operational interference or infrastructure damage. AGC relies on communication networks for the transmission of system measurements and control signals. Unfortunately, this dependence creates vulnerabilities to cyber-physical false data injection (FDI) attacks which are difficult to identify and pose a threat to the stability of the system. In multi-area power systems, the frequency control is complemented by the minimization of tie-line power flows. The prevalence of smart grid technologies incorporating digital communication infrastructure poses an increased risk for cyber-attacks aimed at AGC. This work introduces a method to detect FDI attacks targeting to AGC in a two-area power network. It works by first calculating a clean area control error (ACE) under normal conditions and then comparing that baseline with an ACE recalculated from attack-driven data. In this study, various types of attacks such as step, ramp, random, scaling, and sinusoidal, are injected into frequency and tie-line power information. A threshold limit is set based on the statistical relation between the mean and standard deviation of change in ACE value. The attack is detected when the change in ACE value exceeds the threshold value. The proposed method is applied and validated on the data obtained from the simulation of Indian Eastern Regional Grid model, developed in PSCAD."

Existing models often struggle with high computational costs and massive number of parameters, hindering deployment on resource-limited devices. To address these issues, we propose an efficient object detection network based on feature weaving and redundancy suppression called EWS-YOLO, featuring two components: (1) The Weave-Gated Parallel (WGP) module employs grouped convolution with interlaced cascading and gating mechanisms to achieve implicit multi-scale feature extraction and adaptive fusion, significantly enhancing multi-scale target detection capability. (2) The Redundancy-Suppressed Feature Pyramid Network (RFS-FPN) integrates an Progressive Shuffle Upsampling mechanism coupled with Dynamic Feature Fusion, enabling intelligent fusion of low-level spatial details and high-level semantic features while effectively suppressing redundant information through adaptive channel-wise feature recalibration. Experimental results on VisDrone, DIOR and UAVDT datasets demonstrate EWS-YOLO's superior performance, achieving 42.4%, 95.2%, 98.7% mAP@.50 respectively while reducing parameters by 41% compared to YOLOv8s, making it particularly suitable for resource-constrained applications."

    "abstract": "Vulnerable road users (VRUs) such as pedestrians and cyclists frequently engage in distracted behaviors (e.g., phone or headphone use) that elevate crash risk. General-purpose vision–language models (VLMs) struggle to capture these subtle, small, and context-dependent cues, and most camera pipelines still rely on frame-based analyses that ignore temporal context. We present IntersectionPAR, a lightweight vision–language framework that couples an Interactive Attribute Encoder with region-level captioning to recover safety-relevant semantic attributes (gender, phone/headphone use, mobility mode and aids) together with kinematic cues in a bird’s-eye view. We further introduce a temporal risk module that computes a continuous Situational Awareness Score (from phone, pose, and gaze proxies) and a Dynamic Risk Score that fuses awareness with spatial context (safe vs. unsafe zones), aligning system output with the specific moments practitioners need to act. Our dataset contains 12,273 annotated images drawn from~200 intersection-crossing scenarios under varied lighting and weather. Under a standardized zero-shot protocol against a broad suite of modern VLMs, IntersectionPAR attains keyword-based accuracy of 0.6123 with balanced precision/recall (0.7936/0.7864) and an F1-score of 0.7719 while requiring only ~9 GB of VRAM(>40 GB for several baselines). Qualitative analyses show strong behavior on safety-critical cues (e.g., cane and mobility-aid detection) and illustrate how the temporal risk module elevates risk precisely when low-awareness VRUs enter the roadway. Statistical analyses of 200 crossing events further reveal behavioral impacts of phone use (e.g., longer waiting time and increased path deviation). By pairing accurate, attribute-aware perception with low computational cost and an actionable temporal risk signal, IntersectionPAR supports real-time intersection safety monitoring and proactive interventions to mitigate VRU risk."

Furthermore, we derive five design principles for age-specific gamification and identify three technical patterns for implementation in multimedia learning environments. The results indicate that gamification is not universally effective, but rather requires a differentiated design to support engagement and inclusivity across the lifespan."

    "abstract": "Harmonic drives are a key component in many high-end systems and a potential weak point affecting operational stability. Thus, studying fault diagnosis methods for harmonic drives is of significant importance. In recent studies, the use of multi-sensor data for joint diagnosis has gained increasing attention, though most existing models still rely heavily on fault data. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a diagnostic model named Hierarchical Synergistic Fusion Network (HSFNet), which achieves accurate identification of harmonic drive faults under small-sample conditions. First, the model maps multi-sensor data into the time-frequency domain and dynamically recalibrates input weights to emphasize different sensor signals. Then, a multi-source features fusion module is designed to capture fault characteristics from receptive fields of different scales, enhancing interactions and fusion of both same-scale and cross-scale features to strengthen the model's representational capacity. Finally, a classification projection head compresses features and outputs diagnostic results. Validation and comparative analysis on the collected dataset demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method."

Conventional centrality measures use global structures, which are more computationally expensive, or local structures, which are less accurate. For link prediction, recent developments have suggested ensemble learning techniques, mixed and global isolating centralities, and more. Three essential elements are integrated in the Hybrid Centrality Temporal Dynamics (HCTD) framework. Initially, it presents a Hybrid Centrality Score (HCS) that blends Global Isolating Centrality (ISCD2) and Mixed Centrality (MC). Second, it uses modeling of temporal dynamics to monitor the evolution of influence over time. Third, it uses link prediction based on machine learning to foresee upcoming significant interactions. A variety of datasets, such as social media, transportation, and biological networks, are used to validate the framework. Experiments with SIR simulations and ensemble prediction models demonstrate that HCTD consistently outperforms existing methods in identifying both current and emerging influential nodes."

TFSM extracts transient features such as signal energy, peak, and harmonic content, while the DTC enables fast and interpretable classification.

In the first phase, raw data is collected through web scraping and processed into a curated golden data set by removing noise, duplicates, and inconsistencies. In the second phase, we develop a semantic search engine powered by natural language processing techniques to provide context-aware retrieval of relevant answers rather than simple keyword matches. To ensure scalability, portability, and ease of deployment, the third phase involves containerizing the application with Docker and deploying it to Google Cloud Run, enabling serverless and costefficient execution.

These issues need to be mitigated for stable power output, which can be done by employing PV power smoothing techniques. Use of Energy Storage Systems (ESSs) in this application is one of the ways of mitigating the intermittency issue. This study aims to analyze and compare the performance of Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) and Flywheel Energy Storage System (FESS) for PV power smoothing. Mathematical models of PV, BESS and FESS were developed in MATLAB and evaluated using 300 seconds of varying irradiance data. A power management strategy was formulated to regulate power flow between the PV and ESSs. Three test cases with different capacities of FESS and BESS separately were simulated to examine the impact of ESS sizing. Results show a significant reduction in PV power fluctuations after using ESSs. However, FESS shows better performance in smoothing the PV power of up to 91% due to its rapid response towards power fluctuations for a short period of time."

    "abstract": "Phasor Measurement Unit (PMU) forms the major building block for the enhanced situational awareness in the Wide Area Monitoring System (WAMS). However, due to higher reporting rates of PMU (50-60 frames per second), the requirements of bandwidth as well as storage are increasing rapidly. To alleviate this issue, this paper proposes a two-stage scheme for efficient compression of such a vast amount of PMU data. Stage-1 applies Ramanujan's Sum-based Fault Window Detection (RSFD) algorithm on the multi-PMU data to extract the disturbance window from PMU data buffer. Stage-2 implements Ramanujan's Sum-based transforms on simplified windows to exploit temporal redundancies. Moreover, the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) scheme is employed to exploit the spatial redundancies resulting in the efficient compression of the data. The proposed scheme is validated on the benchmark IEEE 14-bus system by utilizing the Real-Time Digital Simulator (RTDS) that mimics the real-world performance of the simulated system. The results validate that the proposed method outperforms the traditional Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) based method."

Objective: Study on health seeking behavior of tuberculosis in rural and urban area of Jonai, Dhemaji, Assam. Methods: It followed a descriptive, nonexperimental research design with a quantitative measure to investigate health seeking behaviour of tuberculosis among rural and urban population of Dhemaji district, Assam. Conclusion: In this study, a logistic regression model was developed to predict tuberculosis (TB) based on three key risk factors related to health-seeking behavior. The model classifies on individuals into healthy or patient groups, with sensitivity of 40% and specificity of 79%. These results suggest that the model is effective at identifying TB cases, although there is potential for improvement in sensitivity. Thus, the logistic regression model is a valuable tool for early detection and can be instrumental in guiding TB prevention efforts in these communities."

Subsequently, this paper designs a prediction framework based on multiple prediction algorithms, which can realize the optimal matching of prediction methods, key parameters and prediction data. Through experimental validation on the MBA dataset of a western university, this framework significantly outperforms other methods in terms of accuracy, recall, precision, and F1 scores, which are improved by 9.68%, 76.99%, 26.05%, and 73.81%, respectively.

The PV system supplies a fraction of the load demand, while the rest is drawn from the medium-voltage AC (MVAC) grid. Grid-forming strategies—droop control and Virtual Synchronous Machine (VSM)—are implemented in the rectifier and inverter to enhance system flexibility. The SST is evaluated under MVAC voltage sags, PV generation loss, and abrupt load changes to compare the control responses. The simulation results show that both methods maintain system stability. VSM offers smoother dynamic behavior during voltage sags, while droop control supports modular operation by allowing independent stage control. In contrast, VSM requires synchronization between stages, which may reduce modular flexibility."

    "abstract": "Monitoring motorcycle traffic at urban intersections presents a significant challenge in intelligent transportation systems, especially in Vietnam, where motorcycles account for a large proportion of vehicle flow. This study evaluates the performance of various combinations of object detection and tracking models under real Vietnamese context. Specifically, we compare two detection models RT-DETR-L and YOLOv11-L paired with three popular tracking algorithms: ByteTrack, BoT-SORT, and DeepSORT. The dataset is created using traffic videos recorded at an actual Vietnamese intersection with heavy traffic during both daytime and nighttime conditions. For evaluation purposes, we generate two high-quality ground truth files using CVAT software, combining automated tools with manual annotation. Numerical results show that the RT-DETRL combined with ByteTrack achieved the highest identity preservation performance, with an IDF1 score of 83.2 % during the daytime and 69.5 % at nighttime. Meanwhile, the RT-DETR-L with BoT-SORT demonstrated greater stability in localization, achieving a MOTA score of 65.1 % during the daytime and 62.1 % at nighttime. DeepSORT exhibited the lowest performance under both lighting conditions. Combinations using YOLOv11-L generally performed worse than those using RT-DETRL. Further analysis revealed that ByteTrack is more effective in handling object occlusion, while BoT-SORT is better suited for scenarios involving directional changes. These findings provide critical empirical insights for selecting optimal configurations in traffic surveillance applications in Vietnam."

This work examines whether information from LSI images can be utilized to differentiate the impact of treatments on biofilms of Candida tropicalis, a species that is part of the normal human microbiota but can also act as an opportunistic pathogen, commonly found in hospital patients and medical instruments. To achieve this, a Time History representation was processed, and features were extracted from the Gray Level Run Length Matrix. Finally, samples were clustered using K-means, demonstrating that it is possible to differentiate the effects of various treatment doses based on the dynamic description provided by LSI."

So, low-latency Internet is available to the maximum number of users as fast as possible. This paper explores finding the best locations to setup Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) servers, with the goal of improving internet speed and reducing response time for users across the country. Four clustering models-Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM), DBSCAN, Spectral Clustering, and a graph-based approach were applied to identify spatial patterns in infrastructure distribution. GMM revealed a well-balanced structure in ten clusters, the largest containing more than 17,000 sites. DBSCAN exposed a single dominant cluster of 95,404 sites, along with small dense pockets and noise points, indicating urban concentration and rural sparsity. Spectral clustering produced nuanced segmentation, capturing metropolitan and regional variations, with top clusters ranging from 19,985 to a few dozen sites. Cluster centroids were used to propose optimal edge server locations, balancing latency reduction with infrastructural feasibility. The results demonstrate strong clustering in both metropolitan areas and regional areas, reflecting diverse demands and deployment needs of the network. The findings provide a strategic framework for cost-effective MEC rollouts, enhancing service accessibility and responsiveness in dynamic telecom ecosystems."

However, intermittent jamming poses a persistent threat to reliable communications. Recent advances in deep reinforcement learning (DRL) have demonstrated promise in spectrum access by capturing temporal dependencies in partially observable environments. Yet, most existing approaches treat jamming as either static or memoryless, overlooking its temporal correlation. In this paper, we extend prior work on Double Deep Q-Networks (DDQN) with history stacking-based vehicular spectrum access by introducing a group-aware Markovian reward adjustment framework. Vehicles are partitioned into groups targeted by jammers with correlated activity patterns, modeled as two-state Markov chains. Transition probabilities are estimated online and incorporated into both the state representation and reward design, enabling proactive avoidance of high-risk channels and unnecessary handoffs. Simulation results show that the proposed approach accelerates convergence, increases deadline satisfaction, and improves data completion rates compared to standard DQN and ALOHA baselines."

This work responds to the pressing need to modulate this multifaceted pathophysiology by developing a ten-state nonlinear mathematical model of the SARS-CoV-2 activated KKS. We proposed an intelligent control with an artificial neural network (ANN) and a double-integral sliding mode controller (DISMC). The two control schemes reveal an inherent trade-off. Although the ANN controller is adaptive, model-free, and smooth, it can be sensitive to changes in model parameters. In contrast, the DISMC ensures robustness, accuracy, and stability but generates control signals with undesired oscillatory behavior. The simulation results reveal that pathological entities including the BK-B2 receptor complex, the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6), and the therapeutic drug Icatibant show restorative trends.

    "abstract": "Continuing to expand the importance of solar energy within the scope of global renewable energy, there is a surge of interest in the global marketplace to capitalise on the development of clean energy and the need to mitigate reliance on fossil fuels. Considering the unpredictability of environmental and load factors and the resultant impact on photovoltaic system effectiveness, estimating the efficiency of output power is a challenging task. This complexity necessitates both urgency and accuracy in the execution of the tactics required for the implementation of the algorithms for maximised power point tracking needed for optimal energy harvesting. Due to the nonlinear dynamics inherent in photovoltaic systems, more sophisticated control techniques that are nonlinear in nature and favors artificial intelligence are considered more preferable as opposed to traditional methods like Perturb and Observe (P&O). This work proposes a dynamic MPPT framework through the establishment of a Nonlinear Auto-Regressive (NARX) neural network, which utilises time series prediction capabilities of the neural network to extrapolate the behaviour of the PV system with respect to changing irradiance and temperature conditions. In order to enhance stability and resilience, a NARX-based predictor is integrated with a Robust Super-Twisting Sliding Mode Controller (RSTSMC), which in particular is designed to suppress nonlinearities and enhance robustness against environmental uncertainties. The suggested hybrid design is verified with HIL testing and then compared with standard MPP tracking strategies. The proposed model highlights that the NARX-RSTSMC approach is able to outperform others in the most important metrics in real-time PV optimisation during dynamic operating conditions in regards to accuracy, speed of convergence, and overall reliability."

Extensive experiments on two industrial fault diagnosis datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, which consistently achieves superior performance compared to representative zero-shot fault diagnosis methods, general ZSL baselines, and several supervised classifiers. A case study on real industrial data from the Cranfield Multiphase Flow Facility also confirms the method’s effectiveness in practical applications."

    "abstract": "The increasing penetration of renewable energy into distribution networks necessitates high-resolution, real-time monitoring of system states. However, the low sampling frequency of conventional smart meters and the heavy computational workload of centralized estimation frameworks hinder the deployment of high-frequency state estimation. This paper proposes an edge-enabled framework that leverages micro-phasor measurement unit (micro-PMU) data to achieve high-resolution state estimation in distribution networks. The framework adopts a zonal architecture in which each edge node locally processes micro-PMU and smart meter data, reducing the computational workload of the control center and ensuring real-time performance. In each zone, an edge node detects and localizes abrupt changes in power consumption and performs iterative estimation with optimal initialization when an abrupt change is detected, whereas it executes a non-iterative linearized tracking method during steady periods to minimize computational workload. Validation on large-scale unbalanced three-phase distribution systems demonstrates that the proposed framework achieves high estimation accuracy and significantly reduces computation time compared with conventional decentralized state estimation methods."

The field is beginning to explore how AI-driven personalized tutoring, on-demand adaptive learning, and innovative assessment strategies can reshape traditional pedagogical models, though broad adaptation and seamless integration remain ongoing challenges. However, this integration brings challenges such as ensuring academic integrity, preventing over-reliance on AI for solution generation, and balancing personalized assistance with deep, hands-on learning experiences. This paper presents a framework for incorporating AI, online platforms, project-based methods, and new assessment strategies to improve engineering education. It addresses academic integrity challenges, promotes deeper engagement through real-world competitions, and aligns projects with industry objectives via guest lectures and research-driven collaborative work. Creative case studies on real-world Health Monitoring and collaborative Smart Assistant projects equip students with practical skillsets that illustrate the effectiveness of this framework, while a SWOT analysis (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats) supports student research to be more practical and creative. Finally, the successful student competitions such as ‘Pandora’s Box’, won the first prize at the Acres Design Competition, demonstrate how these pedagogical methods can lead to award-winning and real-world relevant results that eventually equip them with practical problemsolving skills."

    "abstract": "The presence of unmodeled errors such as multipath and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) significantly degrades the positioning performance of global navigation satellite systems (GNSS), especially in harsh environments. We propose a novel stochastic model that considers multipath effects based on carrier-to-noise-density ratio (C/N0). This model utilizes C/N0 observations and their nominal function to construct a five-segment variance shrinking factor to enable a more accurate characterization of observation precision and yields reliable posterior residuals. Subsequently, the Institute of Geodesy and Geophysics 3 (IGG3) scheme based on posterior residuals is applied for quality control to enhance the performance of the results. Three sets of real-time kinematic (RTK) positioning experiments were conducted in harsh environments such as urban canyons and shaded areas to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. For single-epoch static RTK positioning, the proposed method improves the horizontal accuracy of the Trimble Alloy from decimeter to centimeter level and the u-blox F9P from approximately 1.5 m to 1.0 m, with improvements of 2-13% in the ambiguity success rate compared to traditional equal-weight, C/N0, and elevation models. In kinematic positioning, the proposed method significantly improves positioning accuracy by more than 20% and increases the ambiguity success rate. The Trimble Alloy achieves decimeter-level horizontal positioning accuracy in deep urban canyons, while the u-blox F9P achieves an accuracy of around 1 m."

Nevertheless, QKD systems have several practical limitations in terms of hardware design and implementation, making them vulnerable to malicious attacks. Specifically, we adopt a detection scheme using a single-photon avalanche diode and due to the avalanche effect, a secondary photon is emitted, called backflash, which can be captured by an eavesdropper. To mitigate this security loophole and enhance the secrecy performance, we consider a selection mechanism which schedules a single user for secret key exchange purposes. In particular, we propose an intelligent two-stage selection scheme in a multiuser free-space optical QKD deployment. We derive closed-form expressions for the secrecy success probability by considering a generalized pointing error model. Our results confirm that the proposed scheme yields significant secrecy gains over conventional methods."

However, seamlessly integrating these services into a unified “storage–search–computation” workflow remains challenging due to heterogeneous security mechanisms. For instance, searchable encryption, while effective for secure search, does not natively support computation over ciphertext. To address this gap, we propose ISSCC, an integrated service framework that seamlessly bridges storage, search, and computation in secure cloud environments. ISSCC employs searchable encryption to ensure secure data storage and search. To support post-search computation on retrieved results, ISSCC utilizes trusted execution environments instead of purely cryptographic approaches. We implement ISSCC on a real TEE-enabled cloud platform and conduct a comprehensive performance evaluation and security analysis. Experimental results demonstrate that ISSCC is both feasible and practical, delivering effective end-to-end services across the full “storage–search–computation” pipeline in secure cloud computing."

    "abstract": "Hybrid energy systems that integrate solar panels, batteries, and diesel generators offer a practical and efficient method for supplying electricity to remote locations. Numerous isolated areas in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia are disconnected from the central electricity grid and rely on mobile diesel generators for power delivery. This study addresses the critical challenge of providing a reliable, cost-effective, and sustainable energy supply by investigating the development of a hybrid system for Jannah Island, located in the Eastern Province of the Kingdom. The island's current power infrastructure, which relies solely on diesel generators, has proven to be an economically and environmentally unsustainable model. The Saudi Electricity Company (SEC) incurs an annual loss of approximately SAR 150,000, which is the difference between the annual cost of SAR 186,889 and the revenue of SAR 36,000 from customer bills. This deficit is projected to accumulate to SAR 3.75 million over a 25-year period if the existing system remains in use. To address this challenge, a techno-economic optimization model was developed using HOMER Pro simulation software to determine the optimal capacity and operational strategy for a hybrid system. The proposed architecture consists of a 200-kW peak solar PV array, a 1 MWh battery storage system, and the existing diesel generators as a backup. This approach is designed to enhance power reliability and economic viability by reducing dependence on a single fossil fuel source. The simulation results provide a comprehensive validation of the hybrid system's performance. The financial analysis projects a substantial reduction in operational expenses, with fuel consumption and transportation costs decreasing by 65% compared to the diesel-only system. The Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) for the hybrid system is estimated at $0.15/kWh, a dramatic improvement over the $0.32/kWh of the conventional diesel solution. Furthermore, the system enhances energy supply reliability by 98% and contributes to a 75% reduction in carbon emissions, directly aligning with Saudi Arabia's environmental sustainability goals. The anticipated financial savings over 25 years are SAR 1.55 million based on 2024 fuel prices, and this figure could increase to over SAR 6.18 million if fuel prices rise by 500%. These findings demonstrate that the hybrid system is a practical and effective strategy for meeting the energy needs of isolated communities. Especially since diesel fuel prices have increased by 44% since the beginning of 2025."

    "abstract": "To address the technical challenges in online surface defects detection of hot continuous casting slab (HCCS), this paper presents the design, development, and validation of a novel vision-based instrumentation system based on Multi-View Multispectral Photometric Stereo (MVMSPS). The system integrates four cameras with specific spectral illuminators to intrinsically eliminate spectral crosstalk at inspection speeds up to 0.5 m/s. The core innovations are twofold: 1) A Generalized Homography Transformation (GHT) method is proposed for precise multi-view image matching, reducing geometric alignment errors by over 87.8% compared to conventional methods. 2) The optimal illumination zenith angle under the Lambertian model is theoretically deduced to guide the lighting design and maximize the signal-to-noise ratio. Enabled by these innovations, the MVMSPS algorithm effectively fuses multi-view and multispectral data to effectively estimate the surface normal and capture the high-frequency information of surface depth variations. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed MVMSPS system can accurately, reliably, and efficiently detect surface defects (e.g., scars, cracks, and indentations) on HCCS in high-temperature and dynamic environments, with a complete processing time of under 3.6s per image set, satisfying the real-time requirements for online inspection and offering a promising instrument solution for intelligent production and quality control in the steel industry. Additionally, this paper explores potential future research directions, including combining fast two-dimensional detection with three-dimensional photometric stereo and integrating multimodal information, to further enhance detection performance."

This is because such models have a history of failure in such cases because it consumes a lot of annotated data to operate. The paper presents a describeable transfer learning system adapted in rare genetic illnesses and led to a sound generalization in the underrepresented groups as a result of label-sharing with gigantic-populated genomic examinations. The plan incorporates model interpretability methods to improve clinical assurances in instances of medical conditions with resource constraints whereby there is deficiency of computational resources and expertise. Using experimental data it was shown that using pre-trained genomic embeddings, classification errors are made to be smaller by 21.4 without damaging the interpretability of resultant feature attributions on SHAP feature attribution. The system also had the potential to increase the efficiency of the diagnostic system by 32 percent in a simulated environment with low resources, which meant that the system could be successfully transported to rural and underserved clinical environments. This publication presents an open pipeline at scales that allows the strategies to the precision medicine of the rare diseases with a trade-off between the performance and ethical responsibility. Such findings confirm the need to integrate the data-efficient AI techniques and explainability to assist clinicians in high-stakes low-data setting."

The growing legislative pressure now limits their use during deployment, as RGB frames reveal sensitive personal information (SPI). Recent work often designs and trains new anonymization models, at a high computational cost. We ask instead whether adaptive filtering is sufficient. We introduce an adaptive obfuscation pipeline that converts RGB datasets into privacy-aware counterparts without training new networks. For each image, we detect the largest face, estimate a re-identification risk from its relative area, and raise blur or pixelation until an InsightFace recognizer fails to match the original embedding; that intensity is then applied to the whole image. Applied to MS-COCO, the pipeline generates two new sets, COCO-BLUR and COCO-PIX. On COCO-BLUR, three off-the-shelf HPE models retain more than 87% of their baseline AP. We release our code at this link (GitHub repository) offering a sustainable way to anonymize RGB data."

The first, offline stage uses a Phase Adaptive Expectation Maximization (PAEM) algorithm, which identifies degradation phases to achieve robust parameter initialization for a library of candidate models. The second, online stage employs an Entropy-Driven Particle Filter (EDPF) to adaptively fuse these models in real-time, tracking time-varying dynamics without reusing historical data. Validation on the XJTU-SY bearing dataset demonstrates that the framework significantly improves prediction accuracy and stability over traditional methods, providing a computationally efficient and robust solution for online RUL prediction."

    "abstract": "Deepfakes and other AI-based manipulated and synthesized videos pose a rising threat, yet training robust detectors under federated settings is challenging, where data is siloed and communication is limited. Existing compression strategies for Federated Learning (FL) can reduce detection accuracy for forensics, and standard federated averaging (FedAvg) may weaken client-specific adaptations that are important in practice. To this end, we propose Threshold-Aware Federated Deepfake Detection (TFD), a framework that combines communication-efficient structured sparsification with client-side optimization. Each client augments a shared video backbone with learnable per-filter thresholds that gate computations and induce structured sparsity. During training, clients update local weights and thresholds but transmit only compact threshold vectors. The server aggregates these vectors to establish a common sparsity pattern, while dense model parameters and data remain local. This efficient threshold-sharing scheme dramatically reduces communication overhead by several orders of magnitude while enabling each client to maintain a model tailored to its local data. We evaluate TFD on deepfake video benchmarks (FaceForensics++ and Celeb-DF), reporting detection metrics (accuracy, AUROC/AUPRC) and efficiency indicators (per-round payload size and costs). The results indicate that TFD can significantly reduce costs and latency while maintaining competitive detection performance relative to state-of-the-art approaches."

In this study, we explore how regular interactions with a social robot, conducted in a structured yet familiar environment within university halls and departments, can provide effective support for practising ER via cognitive reappraisal. Twenty-one students participated in a five-session study at a university hall or department in the U.K., where the robot (QTrobot, LuxAI), powered by a large language model (GPT 3.5) facilitated structured conversations, encouraging the students to reinterpret emotionally charged situations that they shared with the robot. Quantitative and qualitative results indicate significant improvements in ER, with participants reporting better understanding and control of their emotions, significant changes in constructive ER tendencies and positive effects on mood and sentiment after each session. The findings also demonstrate that repeated interactions with the robot encouraged greater emotional expression, including longer speech disclosures, increased use of affective language, and heightened facial arousal. Notably, expression peaked during key reappraisal moments, particularly when participants were prompted to reinterpret negative experiences. The qualitative feedback further highlighted how the robot fostered introspection and provided a supportive space for discussing emotions, enabling participants to confront long-avoided emotional challenges. These findings demonstrate the potential of robots to effectively assist in ER in familiar environments, offering both emotional support and cognitive guidance"

    "abstract": "Given the immutability of biometric data, it is imperative to develop a biometric template protection method that guarantees the complete non-disclosure of any original biometric information while ensuring high recognition performance. Two mainstream approaches in biometric template protection—cancelable biometrics and biometric cryptosystems—have been widely adopted; however, the protected templates produced by these methods still contain some of the original biometric data, which can lead to privacy leakage. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework named BioDeepHash that integrates deep hashing with cryptographic hash functions. In our approach, a deep hashing model generates consistent templates for similar biometric data from the same user, thereby eliminating intra-class variations. An application-specific XOR string is then used to achieve revocability, and finally these consistent templates are processed by cryptographic hash functions to produce protected templates that meet strict security standards. Our experimental results show that, compared with existing methods, BioDeepHash increases the average Genuine Acceptance Rate by 10.12% on the iris dataset and by 3.12% on the facial dataset, while achieving an extremely low False Acceptance Rate—0% for the iris dataset and only 0.0002% for the facial dataset."

Compared to a conventional boost converter (CBC), the proposed design utilizes series-parallel flying-capacitor (SPFC) stages and a negative-coupled inductor to reduce the inductor current ripple by over 60% and 15% for VCRs ranges of 7×–20× and 20×–30×, respectively. Furthermore, the JK-Controller and current-driven technique dynamically adjust the converter operation based on the stimulus strength setting, leading to a significant reduction in the voltage·ampere (V·A) metric and achieving a stimulation efficiency of 87.3%."

    "abstract": "With the rapid proliferation of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) devices, massive Delay Sensitive and Computation Intensive (DSCI) tasks are generated. Traditional Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) systems face limitations like inter-cell interference at cell edges, degrading Quality of Service (QoS). To address this, Cooperative Access Edge Networks (CAEN) enable dynamic Access Point (AP) clusters for enhanced transmission reliability in IIoT. However, challenges arise from multi-user interference, bandwidth contention, dynamic environments, and heterogeneous resources, complicating joint resource orchestration. This paper proposes EdgeDiffuse, a diffusion-enhanced distributed resource orchestration algorithm, which optimizes task offloading selection, transmission power control, and computational resource allocation to minimize long term task completion time while promoting system load balancing. EdgeDiffuse enables adaptive and hierarchical coordination between user agents and edge servers. It integrates diffusion models under a Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL) framework for improved policy exploration in high dimensional offloading decision spaces, and further uses convex optimization for server side resource allocation. Experimental results demonstrate that EdgeDiffuse achieves 28.17% reduction in task completion time, 7.40% improvement in task transmission rates, and 15.71% enhancement in load balancing compared to advanced baselines, showcasing superior performance in multi-user and resource constrained scenarios."

To meet the ever-increasing demands for global coverage, ultra-reliable connectivity, and low-latency services, cooperation among multiple satellites is a key enabler for overcoming the limitations of single-satellite service systems. With its growing importance, both applications and opportunities are simultaneously manifesting. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of research on multi-satellite cooperative communications. In particular, we first introduce architectures for multi-satellite cooperative networks, including intralayer, inter-layer, and cross-layer architectures. Subsequently, we comprehensively analyze and discuss their operating modes, including cooperative relaying, coordinated joint transmission, cooperative reception, beamforming, and cooperative interference management. Additionally, optical inter-satellite links are being considered for cooperative communications to enhance satellite interoperability. We then introduce the challenges and corresponding solutions for implementing multi-satellite cooperative communications. Furthermore, we explore enabling technologies for multi-satellite networks, including multi-connectivity, cooperative satellite beam-hopping, multi-satellite beamforming, traffic offloading, and management of satellite topology and constellation graphs. To further enhance the evaluation of the multi-satellite network, we discuss performance metrics, analysis tools, optimization methods, and validation. Finally, we outline several compelling research directions for future multi-satellite cooperative communication networks."

EL is a daunting task due to the constantly changing content, the mixed-language source of real-world news streams, and the contextual ambiguity of realworld news streams. This paper proposes a novel end-to-end DL framework, SA-ESF (Symmetrical Attention-based Entity Linking using Structural Features), designed specifically to address these complexities. The model exploits symmetrical BiLSTM networks with two attention mechanisms to learn bidirectional semantic relevance between mentions and candidate entities. In addition, it has dense structural features (such as entity descriptions and contextual embeddings) and uses prior link probabilities estimated on Wikipedia to improve disambiguation accuracy. SA-ESF is trained with contrastive learning and positive and hard negative samples, which makes it robust to cross-source and cross-language evaluation. For benchmark datasets, experiments demonstrate that SA-ESF outperforms the state-of-the-art models with the average F1score of 89.7, accuracy of 91.2%, and precision of 90.3%. The results indicate the superior performance, strength and scale of the model in resolving complicated entity disambiguation problems in dynamic, multilingual and heterogeneous news settings."

    "abstract": "Reflective photoplethysmography (PPG) signals are widely applied on many wearable devices to detect physiological signs, such as heart rate, blood pressure and peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2). Current research shows that the contact force between sensors and skin can effectively influence PPG signals. This work mainly focuses on identifying the major aspects affected by contact forces. Based on an opensource database, WF-PPG, the signal qualities under different contact force were compared to evaluate the influence on highfrequency noise, baseline wandering, and motion artifacts. Additionally, the datasets were used to train a linear regression model and a support vector regression (SVR) model for SpO2 prediction. The results of signal quality analysis show that as contact force increases the reflective PPG will have increased high-frequency noise and be more affected by motion artifacts. Moreover, the parameters of trained linear model indicate that the optimal gain and offset will change with variations in contact force. When contact force is include, the SVR model outperforms the model without contact force. In conclusion, the contact force can affect the waveform of reflective PPG and further influence the measurement of SpO2. Thus, detecting contact force simultaneously can actually improve the accuracy of SpO2 measurement."

    "abstract": "Flexible AC Transmission Systems (FACTS) have become indispensable tools for enhancing power grid reliability, stability, and efficiency in the modern power grid. Static Var Compensators (SVCs), one of the most useful classes of FACTS devices, play a critical role in compensating reactive power that can adjust voltage levels dynamically. However, this performance is highly related to the SVC’s firing angle unit, which determines the amount of reactive power injection/absorption. Any suboptimal firing angle can lead to grid instability, like voltage collapse and excessive current fluctuations. This paper presents a Simulink model with a hybrid Machine Learning approach combining CatBoost and LightGBM with lagged features to improve firing angle prediction across various scenarios. Despite the usage of single methods, this hybrid one benefits from the strength of previous models that, in the end, demonstrates better performance, faster coverage, and enhanced real-time adaptability among traditional models."

By adopting an LCC-S compensation topology and circular magnetic coupling mechanism, the synergistic optimization of electromagnetic stability and power transfer efficiency in seawater environments is achieved. The system significantly suppresses high-frequency losses through high-frequency inversion technology and film-insulated Litz wire construction. Parametric simulation optimization determines the optimal matching relationship for coil parameters. A coupling mechanism achieving a coupling coefficient of 0.61 at a 60 mm transmission distance is developed. Experimental results demonstrate that the system achieves stable 10 kW power output in air medium with a peak efficiency of 96.4%. In saline environments, the efficiency reaches 93.9%. During load transients, the output voltage fluctuation remains below 2.3%, validating constant-voltage output characteristics and load fluctuation adaptability.

    "abstract": "In recent years, lossy compression of hyperspectral images (HSIs) for spaceborne applications has garnered significant attention. The limited storage capacity and constrained transmission bandwidth of spaceborne equipment make it challenging to simultaneously balance the compression rate of transmitted data and the quality of locally reconstructed images. To address this challenge, we propose BTC-Net V2—an advanced iteration of BTC-Net—that substantially enhances the performance of its predecessor. Specifically, in the encoder stage, we adopt a large-kernel convolution to replace the three-layer convolutional network used in the previous version, enabling a more lightweight encoder design that aligns with the resource constraints of spaceborne HSI compression. Moreover, in the decoder stage, we replace the “feature enhancement followed by upsampling” paradigm of the previous version with a spatial-priority hierarchical architecture that prioritizes spatial dimension upsampling. This design ensures the subsequent feature enhancement backbone operates on a larger spatial scale—directly mitigating the loss of spatial correlations in BTC-Net and ultimately yielding higher reconstruction quality. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed BTC-Net V2 outperforms BTC-Net by 3.35 dB in PSNR—achieving 40.78 dB versus BTC-Net’s 37.43 dB—while operating at an even lower bit rate (0.054 bpppb compared to BTC-Net’s 0.060 bpppb).

    "abstract": "Vibration signals of rolling bearings exhibit the characteristics of a mixture of transient impacts and nonstationarity. Although traditional continuous wavelet transform is able to provide time-frequency localization analysis, it has insufficient time-frequency focus on transient impacts, which easily leads to aliasing of non-stationary signal components and makes it difficult to accurately extract fault features. To address this issue, this paper proposes a fault diagnosis method that integrates adaptive wavelet transform and improved MobileNetV3. To resolve the problem of insufficient frequency coverage caused by the fixed scale of traditional CWT, an adaptive wavelet scale optimization strategy is adopted to dynamically calculate the optimal scale range of the Morlet wavelet, thereby achieving accurate coverage of the characteristic frequencies of bearings. Meanwhile, through harmonic enhancement and multimodal feature fusion, the fault features are improved. Aiming at the problems of high computational cost and significant time consumption in the training of traditional convolutional neural networks, an improved MobileNetV3 model is constructed: SE attention modules are embedded in specific layers to enhance the ability of fault feature extraction; stochastic depth technology is introduced to improve the model's generalization performance; and Bayesian search is combined to optimize hyperparameters. Experimental results based on the dataset show that this method is capable to effectively process complex vibration signals, and realize model lightweighting while ensuring diagnostic accuracy, providing a new solution for the effective and efficient diagnosis for rolling bearings in engineering application scenarios."

By exploiting the Lyapunov optimization techniques, we decompose the overall problem into large-, medium-, and small-timescale problems, and their individual solution approaches are provided. To further improve the latency and reliability, an end-to-end latency measure is proposed along with the use of extreme value theory to derive an enhancement approach.

A novel adaptive virtual admittance based current harmonic suppression method is proposed to improve the grid current quality across a wide load range. The input impedance model, accounting for the EMI filter and digital control delay, is established to reveal impedance variation patterns. The virtual admittance vector is decoupled in the polar coordinate system and optimized under different load conditions. Furthermore, a load-power-adaptive virtual admittance mechanism based on the piecewise cubic Hermite interpolation method is presented to suppress specific grid current harmonics. To ensure the robustness of the proposed method, the sensitivity of the virtual admittance and the influence of the system delay are analyzed.

However, current radar-based segmentation models are trained offline on static datasets and suffer from catastrophic forgetting when encountering unseen object classes in dynamic real-world environments. To address this limitation, we introduce a class-incremental continual learning framework specifically designed for automotive radar point cloud semantic segmentation. Our approach employs a model-agnostic student-teacher architecture, where a frozen model from a previous task provides supervisory signals to the current model via knowledge distillation. This is combined with a focal loss to handle the inherent class imbalance of radar data. Our framework is comprehensively evaluated on the RadarScenes dataset across several state-of-the-art segmentation architectures, including both point-based and transformer-based models, to demonstrate its general applicability. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed strategy effectively mitigates catastrophic forgetting. This work establishes a benchmark for continual learning on radar point clouds, paving the way for more adaptive and long-term autonomous perception systems."

The trust-aware gating results further improved the reliability, raising the accuracy and F1 to over 81% with a coverage of 67.74%, with a high threshold exceeding 98% accuracy for selective predictions. The above results demonstrate that the combination of multi-methods with the Uncertainty gating decision mechanism provides a reliable and practical forecasting tool for the volatile cryptocurrency market."

    "abstract": "As communication bridges gaps between individuals, sign language emerges as a crucial medium for the deaf community, fostering social inclusivity and accessibility. To address the need for effective sign language recognition, this study utilized a custom dataset of 40 selected Filipino Sign Language phrases collected from 25 signers and employed four neural network models: Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The dataset underwent preprocessing phases, including the extraction of frame sequences and hand key points, which were then used to train and evaluate the models. Results indicated that the GRU model outperformed other architectures, achieving 99.98% accuracy in classifying FSL phrases. The study also developed a hardware prototype integrating the optimal model, demonstrating its potential for real-world applications. Overall, the findings suggest that deep learning techniques, particularly GRU-based models, can effectively capture the temporal dynamics of sign language, paving the way for more inclusive communication technologies."

    "abstract": "Ensuring smart contract security remains a major challenge in the blockchain ecosystem, and automated fuzzing is vital for detecting vulnerabilities. Traditional fuzzing methods often lack sufficient code coverage and resource efficiency, especially in complex contracts. In this work, we introduce TaK-Fuzz, a transaction-aware fuzzing framework that leverages RetrievalAugmented Generation and expert knowledge extracted from audit reports to guide intelligent creation of testcases. TaK-Fuzz has a vector database of vulnerability patterns from audited contracts and, for each fuzzing target, retrieves relevant entries based on semantic similarity. These insights are then used as context for a large language model, which applies Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to generate focused and effective test cases for smart contract fuzzing. Experimental evaluation shows that TaK-Fuzz consistently outperforms the baseline MuFuzz across code coverage, vulnerability detection, and efficiency. For instance, on the Soli-Audit dataset, TaK-Fuzz achieves nearly complete branch coverage (99.43 %) while requiring only a fraction of the testcases compared to MuFuzz. Overall, it not only improves recall in detecting critical vulnerabilities but also reduces resource consumption by orders of magnitude. These results confirm that by combining knowledge retrieval with reasoning-driven test generation, TaK-Fuzz maximizes vulnerability discovery while maintaining high efficiency, establishing itself as a robust solution for smart contract fuzzing."

A working prototype has built and deployed on the simulated environment - Ganache, enabling automated fine deduction and immutable record keeping. Experimental evaluation shows that the average transaction latency is 134.48 ms and transaction throughput is 7.43 transactions/sec(approx.), and handles over 500 records per hour under simulation. Although the current version is founded on pre-processed inputs, the architecture is designed to support real-time detection and automated pipelines in upcoming versions.

    "abstract": "As wind and solar grow on the grid, operators need short-term forecasts that remain dependable precisely when weather turns extreme. However, the coupling between meteorology and demand/renewable output is highly nonlinear and nonstationary, which limits the accuracy of standard statistical and machine-learning baselines. We introduce a hybrid deep learning framework that pairs an attention-guided convolutional network used to extract spatial signals from meteorological and renewable features with a bidirectional LSTM that models temporal dependencies in load and generation. The model produces probabilistic outputs, yielding point forecasts together with calibrated prediction intervals so that uncertainty can be factored into operations. We evaluated the approach on hourly ERCOT demand, NREL wind integration data, and NOAA weather records, and stress-tested it on periods flagged as extreme using a robust outlier detector. Across multiple horizons, the proposed method reduces the error by approximately 15–20% relative to the ARIMA, SVR, and vanilla LSTM baselines, while maintaining strong interval coverage. In volatile conditions, the attention layer consistently elevates the meteorological drivers most responsible for forecast shifts, and the uncertainty head indicates the confidence to place in each estimate, both of which are directly useful for reserve sizing and dispatch decisions. Overall, combining attention-based spatial weighting with bidirectional sequence modeling yields a practical and resilient forecaster for short-term renewable and load predictions under extreme weather conditions."

To provide a more dependable solution, this study employs convolutional neural networks (CNNs) particularly transfer learning models for categorizing coconuts into three groups: mature, pre-mature, and young. A collection of 3,000 coconut images was collected and augmented, with an equal number at each of the three stages of ripeness and then enhanced to increase variation. Before training, the images were preprocessed by resizing and normalizing before applying three pre-trained models (EfficientNet, MobileNetV2, and VGG16). The assessment involved measurements such as accuracy, rate of errors, sensitivity, specificity, false positive rate, precision, and F1-score. Results showed that the VGG16 model achieved the highest accuracy of 96.17 %, followed by EfficientNet at 80.17 %, and MobileNetV2 at 65.33 %. This demonstrates how CNNs are more reliable than traditional methods for categorizing coconut ripeness. The device was made by incorporating the high-performing VGG16 model into the Jetson Nano microprocessor. This offers a feasible and scalable answer for enhancing farming practices and production methods within the coconut industry. This development could greatly enhance efficiency and standards in coconut farming, which would help farmers and the overall agricultural industry, ultimately promoting economic growth and sustainability."

First, the proposed model is applied to a slotless topology. To do so, two magnetomotive forces (MMF) that constitute the machine’s dual excitation are presented: The first considers a PMs excitation component, while the second takes into account the current excitation field component. The slotting effect is then taken into consideration by incorporating a stator permeance function. The air gap flux density distribution of the slotted HEPMM is therefore estimated and compared to a predicted 2D finite element analysis (FEA) results. The investigation shows that the proposed formulation has good accuracy. Finally, the FEA model is used to forecast the no-load characteristics of the proposed concept, including back EMFs and phase flux linkages."

Even though a large number of bioinformatic algorithms exist that computationally estimate mutational pathogenicity, they showed significant inconsistency in their predictions. Only a few of these tools demonstrate better accuracy in separating drivers from nondriver mutations in cancer. The objective of this study is to rank cancer driver gene mutations based on their in-silico predictive pathogenicity by employing a deep learning method. We developed DeeprankCDM, a deep learning method to identify consensus ranking by aggregating different ranks. Our model is implemented based on pairwise learn-to-rank, an approach designed to determine preferences between items and aggregate multiple individual ranks into a single, consensus ranking. The method shows good consistency during training, with an accuracy of 0.7802, ranging tightly between 0.7791 and 0.7804. Notably, along with well-known gene PTEN, missense mutations in the well-established and frequently mutated gene TP53 emerged as top-rankers in the final aggregated list, indicating the good and reliable performance of our developed method."

The objective of this study is to evaluate machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) approaches for BTbased question classification using 2,532 questions from multiple datasets and compare it with prompt based approaches. Crossdataset evaluation reveal a significant decline in performance in ML and DL approaches, highlighting the limitations of supervised learning techniques. Further analysis of out-of-vocabulary (OOV) terms uncovers gaps in the coverage of BT action verbs, which hinders accurate classification. These findings demonstrate that ML and DL approaches fail to reliably classify questions, revealing substantial limitations in identifying learning intent and information need, that significantly hinders the ability to deliver personalized content. To mitigate these issues, promptbased generative classification approaches using instructiontuned Large Language Model (LLM) is tested.

Both controllers are implemented on a boost DC-DC converter connected to a PV array. Their performance is assessed under both constant and variable irradiance conditions through MATLAB/Simulink simulations. The results demonstrate that SMC1 achieves faster dynamics, with a rise time of 44.55 ms and a response time of 64 ms, making it suitable for applications requiring rapid convergence. However, it suffers from chattering, which may accelerate component degradation and increase switching losses. In contrast, SMC2 achieves smoother regulation with reduced oscillations and a lower ITAE value (7.456 vs. 13.58), improving long-term stability and robustness under irradiance variations. Both controllers reach identical steady-state MPPT efficiency of $96.95 \\%$, but their suitability depends on system constraints: SMC1 for cost-effective embedded systems, and SMC2 for grid-connected or highly dynamic environments."

The study focuses on three model-based approaches: 1) linear quadratic regulator (LQR), 2) linear model predictive control (MPC), and 3) constraint tightening MPC (CTMPC). The study, conducted entirely in simulation using a nonlinear model of the robot, consists of two parts, namely 1) trajectory simulations for two known initial conditions, and 2) the estimation of the region of attraction (RoA) using a Monte Carlo-based approach. In simulation, all designed controllers perform comparably on a set of nonzero initial conditions and the estimated RoA is identical. Overall, the CTMPC achieved smaller deviations in position and a slightly faster settling time compared to the other controllers, at the cost of a marginally higher mean-squared error of the pitch angle. These results indicate that while all controllers regulate the system, CTMPC offers slightly improved transient performance."

This enhancement amplifies discriminative capability for pathology-specific morphological characteristics while minimizing extraneous environmental interference, demonstrating elevated precision and sensitivity particularly for incipient symptomatic manifestations. Experimental validation against conventional methodologies and unmodified YOLOv8 reveals marked improvements in accuracy, resilience, and operational efficiency under authentic field deployment scenarios. The proposed architecture maintains minimal computational overhead, rendering it appropriate for resourceconstrained agricultural implementations and enabling proactive intervention strategies with reduced dependence on agrochemical applications."

    "abstract": "The “nine-dash line” image represents an illegal maritime claim that frequently appears in digital content, posing significant risks of distorting Vietnam's territorial sovereignty. Manual moderation cannot keep pace with the rapidly growing volume of data, especially as such infringing images are often small, thin, and subtly embedded. In this study, we employ an enhanced Faster R-CNN model, incorporating knowledge distillation (KD) from the vision-language model DINOv2 to detect “nine-dash line” imagery. A KD loss function is utilized to align embeddings between predicted and ground-truth regions, thereby improving the detection of small and occluded objects. The model is trained on a specialized dataset of 836 images and achieves a mean Average Precision (mAP) of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{5 8. 4 \\%}$</tex>, representing an improvement of 6.2 % over the baseline Faster R-CNN with a ResNet-50 backbone. In addition, the employed approach achieves an Average Recall (AR) of 66.2 %, compared to 58.8 % for the baseline model. This system demonstrates strong potential for integration into automated digital content moderation workflows, supporting the protection of national sovereignty in cyberspace."

This approach enhances minority class representation while maintaining biological integrity, addressing class imbalance effectively. The system achieved a balanced accuracy of 89.06% and an F1-score of 86.68%, outperforming existing models in the literature.

    "abstract": "To mitigate bus voltage violations in active distribution networks, this article proposes a local coordinated voltage regulation (VR) algorithm involving distributed photovoltaic (PV) and battery energy storage system (BESS). First, a sequential coordination mechanism of reactive power compensation (RPC) of PV followed by active power compensation (APC) of BESS is designed. Then, the available maximum RPC capacity and the required minimum APC capacity are computed in turn based on the exact VR requirement of a selected crucial bus. Afterward, a capacity-based proportional RPC-APC control is adopted to keep each PV or BESS in a consistent controllable state, thereby preventing repeated parameter updates and extensive iterations. The algorithm only requires control of local PV and BESS on the buses experiencing voltage issues, which leads to a fairer sharing of the VR burden. Finally, the effectiveness is validated through the case study in a real grid scenario."

    "abstract": "Wireless sensing systems have significant applications in environmental monitoring and medical diagnostics. Although exceptional point (EP) in non-Hermitian parity-time (PT) symmetric system can significantly enhance perturbation sensitivity, making them highly promising for ultrasensitive wireless sensing, their practical implementation is hindered by the stringent requirement for precise gain-loss matching between the reader and the sensor. Furthermore, the resolution of such systems deteriorates markedly under asymmetric perturbations. Here, we develop a PT-symmetric wireless sensing system with gain–loss detuning that maintains high-resolution frequency shifts despite slight gain-loss mismatches between components. Through theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that this system achieves sensitivity comparable to that of PT-symmetric systems while overcoming their inherent limitations. Experimental validation through pressure sensing demonstrates that the detuned PT-symmetric system achieves high-resolution detection under tiny capacitive pressure perturbations while attaining a sensitivity of 1.85 MHz/N. Our work indicates potential implications for practical applications of ultra-sensitive sensors."

    "abstract": "Electrical Resistance Tomography (ERT) is widely used for multiphase flow monitoring due to its non-invasiveness and high temporal resolution. However, the fringe effect induces artifacts in the reconstructed images from conductivity perturbations beyond the measurement plane, compromising tomographic imaging accuracy. Existing mitigation strategies, such as sensor structural optimization or multi-plane auxiliary imaging, face limitations like extended sensing ranges or the requirement for prior object knowledge. In this paper, a boundary measurement correction method based on reconstruction discrepancies in dual-plane ERT is proposed to suppress the fringe effect-induced artifacts. The distinct sensitivity responses of dual planes to identical spatial perturbations can be manifested as discrepancies in dual-plane reconstructed images. Based on these discrepancies, it is able to extract the measurement components corresponding to the perturbations within the measurement plane. Independent reconstruction of these components eliminates the artifacts induced by the perturbations outside the measurement plane. The results demonstrate substantial improvement in reconstruction quality after correction, significantly outperforming the grounded-guard single-plane tomography and dual-plane 3D tomography. The correction method also shows robust suppression capability for perturbations at arbitrary off-plane locations and superiority in handling severe fringe effect induced by axially longer perturbations."

Conventional clinical tools—mood charts, rating scales and episodic interviews—capture only the visible tip of a much deeper neuro developmental iceberg. Recent strides in artificial intelligence (AI) and high throughput computing raise the prospect of monitoring that iceberg in real time by fusing multi scale neuro data (MRI, diffusion MRI, EEG), behavioural exhaust (keyboard metadata, actigraphy, speech prosody) and longitudinal developmental markers. This paper delivers a 360 degree review of state of the art pipelines, then proposes Brain DEV BD, an end to end, student friendly blueprint that (i) aligns data acquisition with critical neuro developmental windows, (ii) deploys explainable transformer ensembles for multimodal fusion, and (iii) outputs a dual report which comprise developmental risk trajectory and 30 day episode onset probability. A prospective validation plan on 200 Malaysian and international youths (14–24 years) is laid out, together with ethical guard rails around privacy, bias and participatory design. By zooming out from static diagnosis to dynamic brain growth, Brain DEV BD seeks to convert BD care from reactive firefighting to proactive, just in time intervention."

Experts criticize Facebook for lying about how they use the data they gather from consumers, the spread of misinformation on their platform, ignoring harmful groups that utilize the website such as terrorist groups, and allowing minors to post sensitive information. Studies have shown that, while Facebook can have a positive effect on the world wide web, the ethical issues caused by it can outweigh the good. Care should be taken by anyone who wishes to use Facebook, especially younger users. Facebook doesn’t always have the user’s best interests in mind. Instead, it skirts the line of what could be considered ethical and has repeatedly shown it cares more about profit than its users. While an earlier paper dealt with Facebook’s issues relating to Child Education and Employment, this paper provides a critical look at misinformation issues that plague Facebook."

Aware of the essential role these skills play in learning and overall development, the project sought to provide an effective tool that not only entertains but also educates and supports the enhancement of cognitive areas. To achieve this goal, a review of scientific literature related to child cognitive development and educational technologies was conducted. Key cognitive development theories and teaching methods were then identified and selected as the foundation for the game's design framework. These guided the selection of activities, strategies, and challenges to be incorporated into the game, ensuring alignment with the individual needs of the children. The game's design is based on a usability and accessibility approach tailored to children's cognitive and attention capacities. Through a set of engaging activities and challenges, and by leveraging the benefits of gamification, the game aims to maintain a high level of user engagement. To assess the effectiveness of the prototype, pilot tests were conducted with children, evaluating their attention and problem-solving skills. Preliminary results showed that the prototype was effective in improving children's concentration and problem-solving abilities, indicating its potential as a meaningful educational tool to address the causes of attention deficit. Ultimately, this project not only facilitated the development of innovative learning tools for schools but also had a significant impact on the cognitive and attentional development of the children who used them.

Despite significant progress, research has predominantly focused on English, limiting applicability to the 850+ million speakers of Portuguese and Spanish worldwide. We present the first comprehensive study of monolingual and multilingual Visual Dialog models for Portuguese and Spanish, introducing novel insights into cross-lingual visual grounding mechanisms. Through extensive experiments on newly translated VisDial datasets, we compare language-specific encoders (BERTimbau for Portuguese, BETO for Spanish) against multilingual BERT, achieving competitive performance with monolingual models while revealing distinct cross-modal attention patterns. Our mechanistic interpretability analysis demonstrates that despite different tokenization strategies and pretraining objectives, both approaches converge to similar attention distributions in deeper layers, with divergence decreasing from 0.000832 (Layer 0) to 0.000490 (Layer 11). We find that monolingual models exhibit holistic attention strategies while multilingual models show more selective, fine-grained visual grounding. These findings have important implications for developing inclusive vision-language technologies and understanding cross-lingual transfer in multimodal contexts."

Non-invasive blood pressure (NIBP) monitoring, compared with invasive methods, enables home-based and long-term use, supporting early detection and continuous care. Despite significant progress, challenges remain, including accuracy issues, insufficient validation in real-world settings, limited application-specific sensor designs, and inadequate calibration standards and validation platforms. These gaps call for a systematic review to clarify the unmet needs and future research directions. This article reviews current advances in four key areas: (1) novel NIBP estimation principles designed to minimize user intervention; (2) flexible and wearable electronics that improve accuracy and comfort; (3) integration with theranostic applications and broader healthcare scenarios enabled by NIBP technologies; (4) calibration and validation strategies that enhance reliability and accuracy. With the rapid growth of home healthcare and AI-enabled wearable systems, addressing these challenges is essential to advance personalized, precise and stable cardiovascular medicine."

    "abstract": "Drag reduction is of significant interest in the design of marine vehicles. Viscoelastic boundary materials and compliant surfaces, such as those found in dolphin skin, have the potential to reduce frictional drag by delaying the transition from laminar to turbulent flow and minimizing turbulence. To investigate the effect of boundary modulation on turbulence, we developed and tested a novel device that generates wave-like deformations on a flow boundary. This device, enabled by a 5×5 voice coil motor array, was embedded in the wall of a flow channel and overlaid with a flexible membrane in direct contact with the water. The boundary displacement was quantified using a computer vision approach. The deformable membrane system was tested across a range of flow tank speeds and boundary actuation patterns, and the impact on near-boundary velocity was assessed. The resulting data indicate that boundary actuation alters the boundary layer velocity and turbulent stresses both under the region of actuation and in its wake. The effect was most pronounced in regions with boundary layer coherent structures, and certain actuation parameters were consistent with a reduction in frictional drag. A numerical model of the flow tank showed a 10% reduction in average shear stress over the actuated boundary and one actuation wave period, supporting the laboratory experiments and corroborating the findings. This work supports efforts to develop dolphin-inspired methods to reduce near-boundary turbulence and drag, which, if successfully applied in a natural environment, can lead to more energy-efficient platforms and underwater vehicles."

    "abstract": "Prompt learning has emerged as an efficient tuning paradigm for fine-tuning powerful pre-trained models on downstream tasks in specific domains. Existing efforts mainly focus on dataset-level implicit embeddings by introducing extra learnable parameters instead of fully fine-tuning large-scale visual models. However, we find that these static post-training prompts are not flexible enough to adapt various input instances within the same dataset, which might lead to the loss of the model's generalization capability. To leverage the meaningful contextual information of each input instance, in this paper, we propose a straightforward yet effective method, termed CoMoDP, to enhance visual prompt learning with <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Co</i>ntext-<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Mo</i>dulated <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">D</i>iffusion <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">P</i>rompts.

Moreover, to reduce the overfitting of prompts, we also introduce momentum alignment, a self-regulating strategy that restricts the optimization region of prompts in both feature and logit spaces. Extensive experiments on various standard and few-shot datasets demonstrate that our method brings substantial improvements and yields strong domain generalization performance, compared to the state-of-the-art methods. We also demonstrate both zero-shot and out-of-distribution performance to establish the utility of our dual-visual prompting scheme CoMoDP and the efficiency of each component, without involving excessive parameters."

    "abstract": "In-Vitro Fertilization (IVF) has revolutionized reproductive medicine. However, due to a variety of clinical, demographic and embryological factors, the prediction of outcomes after the use of IVF remains difficult. Conventional models typically rely on only a limited set of clinical inputs, such as maternal age, hormone levels, or embryo grading, without considering a broader range of data or imaging insights. To address these limitations, we propose a novel multi-modal deep learning framework for the improved prediction of IVF outcome in a transparent manner. The proposed framework uses a combination of structured data (including clinical, demographic and procedural information) with unstructured image data of embryos. The key elements of this framework include: (i) structured health records representing hormone profiles, treatment history, lifestyle and ethnicity. (ii) static and time-lapse embryo imaging enhanced by segmentation using U-Net and features extracted using ResNet-50 [12] and (iii) deep learning models. We have developed a hybrid architecture by combining LNGLMD-Net for modeling clinical data, CSPCSGAN for generating high-resolution synthetic images to balance the dataset and ensemble fusion methods such as Generalized Joint Optimization (GJO), OEOP and Condorcet’s Jury Theorem for outcome prediction. Models trained on the datasets produced higher accuracy, sensitivity, F1-score and AUC-ROC values, than customary machine learning approaches. SHAP analysis identified the most important features in the embryo development prediction models, which included the hormone Anti-Mullerian Hormone test, embryo fragmentation rates and the day of embryo transfer. Our model exhibits good generalizability and is practically useable despite being ill-posed due to high computation load and limited quality embryo data. As such, this work provides the AI-augmented reproductive health domain with a clinically interpretable data-driven decision support system for improved IVF protocols and personalized treatment pathways, which are highly sought after by clinicians. Future work includes using video data of embryo development using CNN-LSTM models, producing more realistic GAN-generated images and implementing privacy-preserving federated learning models across multiple fertility clinics."

    "abstract": "Undoubtedly, mobile applications are essential in daily life, simplifying various tasks and saving time. However, they collect and transmit vast amounts of users' personal data to remote servers for providing their services. Despite the sensitivity of these operations, mobile environments commonly rely on the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) for the transmission of personal data, which does not protect against advanced threats that run on mobile devices and are capable of intercepting and exfiltrating personal data in use by authorized mobile applications. HTTP over secure Transport layer protocols, commonly known as HTTP Secure (HTTPS), is also ineffective against these threats as it only protects personal data in transit. In this paper, we present PrivProt, a lightweight protocol designed to preserve the privacy of personal data in use by mobile applications through the establishment of a secure end-to-end session with a remote server at the Application layer and the inclusion of privacy claims within an OAuth 2.0 token. Our results demonstrate that PrivProt outperforms HTTP in transmitting identical payloads while introducing missing privacy safeguards for mobile environments."

    "abstract": "Needle puncture serves as the foundation for a broad range of minimally invasive surgical diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. Flexible needles have the potential to overcome the limitations of traditional rigid needles, particularly their inability to bypass obstacles and correct needle tip deviations, making them a promising alternative. However, when the needle hub rotates during insertion, torsional interactions between the needle shaft and surrounding tissue result in a discrepancy between the rotation angles of the needle hub and the needle tip. This discrepancy can lead to needle tip misalignment, thereby affecting patient prognosis and compromising diagnostic reliability. Furthermore, accurately measuring the orientation of the needle tip remains a challenge. To address these issues, we propose a method for estimating and compensating for orientation discrepancies, which improves puncture accuracy, enhances patient prognosis, and boosts diagnostic reliability. Specifically, based on puncture images, we introduce a projection-based approach to estimate the actual rotation angle of the needle tip, and construct a dataset containing the corresponding rotation angles of the needle hub and tip. We then utilize a neural network to estimate the true orientation of the needle tip from a specific needle hub rotation angle. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively estimate and compensate for the discrepancy between the orientations of the needle tip and hub, reducing the average rotation error from 9.6° to 0.6°. Additionally, puncture experiments conducted using paths planned via the particle swarm optimization algorithm verify that the method improves puncture precision, decreasing the error from 2.42±0.65 mm to 0.96±0.65 mm. These results indicate that the method is feasible and effective for enhancing patient prognosis and diagnostic reliability."

    "abstract": "Acute ischemic stroke is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide, and accurate lesion segmentation is important for diagnosis and treatment planning. Current deep learning approaches for stroke-lesion segmentation often fail to use the inherent bilateral symmetry of the human brain and are thus missing a valuable anatomical prior that clinicians routinely use for lesion detection. This paper introduces SE-Net, a novel symmetry-enhanced neural network that systematically incorporates brain-symmetry priors at multiple levels within a deep learning framework. Our approach extends the 3D U-Net architecture with four specialized components: a symmetry-aware encoder with dual-stream processing, a symmetry difference module for highlighting pathological asymmetries, a perfusion-diffusion mismatch attention mechanism, and enhanced skip connections that preserve symmetry information throughout the network. Comprehensive evaluation using the Ischemic Stroke Lesion Segmentation (ISLES) 2022 dataset demonstrates exceptional performance with a Dice similarity coefficient of 96.72%, which represents an improvement of 13–39 percentage points over state-of-the-art methods. The Hausdorff distance was 14.21 mm, which indicates improved boundary precision by 35–66% improvement compared to previous approaches. Statistical analysis confirmed that highly significant performance gains were achieved (p < 0.001, Cohen’s d > 1.7). Qualitative analysis was performed using representative segmentation results, small lesion detection examples, and symmetry difference visualizations, and the results validated the clinical applicability of our approach. Cross-dataset evaluation demonstrates robust generalization with 86-89% zero-shot performance across different imaging protocols. Clinical validation through expert evaluation confirmed the method’s potential for practical translation with an inference time of 3.4 seconds, which is suitable for acute stroke protocols. SE-Net addresses critical challenges in stroke diagnosis while establishing a framework for incorporating domain-specific anatomical knowledge into deep learning architectures for medical imaging applications."

In order to effectively distinguish between different types of defects and stress concentrations, a method for identifying defects and stress concentrations in oil and gas pipelines based on metal magnetic memory is proposed. Firstly, numerical simulations of defects and stress concentrations are conducted using the principle of metal magnetic memory detection. Then, an experimental plan is designed and an experimental platform is constructed based on the results of the numerical simulations. Magnetic memory signals from 224 sets of defects and 256 sets of stress concentrations were collected, and analysis found that the magnetic memory signals for defects and stress concentrations are similar and susceptible to environmental interference. Traditional methods of feature extraction are difficult and challenging to achieve high-precision discrimination. To address the issue of difficulty in feature extraction, a deep learning approach is adopted, proposing a hybrid model that integrates the multi-universe optimization algorithm, convolutional neural network, and bidirectional long short-term memory network. The experimental dataset is then validated. The results show that the recognition accuracy of this method can reach 94.8%, proving its effectiveness and high recognition rate in identifying defects and stress concentrations in oil and gas pipelines, and providing new ideas for intelligent recognition of pipeline defects."

The proposed TO-STSMC introduces a third-order dynamic structure with correction terms to ensure finite-time convergence, strong disturbance rejection, and smooth control effort. The simulation results under the step load torque profiles demonstrated that the proposed method achieves faster settling, reduced overshoot, and accurate speed tracking compared to existing approaches. Furthermore, current responses confirmed reduced chattering, while bounded control signals indicated improved efficiency.

It occupied 1mm<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> and dissipated 15.6mW at a supply voltage of 1.8V. The operating frequency ranges from 4.96GHz to 6.16GHz with a channel spacing of 10MHz. The calibration process needs to go through two phase-locked states whose duration is less than 7.2μs."

In this study, we propose a robust approach for elevating the fish detection accuracy of lightweight detectors, abbreviated as VcO-Net. Our network achieves the desired performance by closely incorporating the visibility enhancement technique and object detection model. The VcO-Net involves two components: a feature upgrade subnetwork and a small detection subnetwork. The feature upgrade subnetwork is developed based on the GAN architecture for effective learning of fish features. Extensive results on published datasets demonstrate that our VcO-Net surpasses current small object detection models."

Single phase shift modulation is commonly used to control DAB which conventionally realizes continuous conduction switching mode operation. Alternatively, this paper highlights the other DAB switching modes, namely discontinuous conduction mode and critical mode, for its operation with SCs. These unconventional switching modes can be beneficial in terms of maximizing the power utilization of SCs given their high-power density characteristic and thereby enhance the performance cost ratio of SC energy storage in many applications. A theoretical derivation is presented together with simulation validation."

This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of order picker path optimization using Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) heuristics in modern warehouse environments. We develop and evaluate multiple heuristic algorithms including nearest neighbor, 2-opt, 3-opt, and hybrid genetic algorithms for optimizing picker routes in various warehouse configurations. Our approach incorporates real-world constraints such as item weight, congestion factors, and pick frequency distributions. Experimental results from simulations on warehouse layouts ranging from 5,000 to 50,000 square meters demonstrate that the proposed hybrid genetic algorithm with 2-opt local search refinement achieves an average path reduction of 23.7% compared to traditional S-shape routing, with computational times suitable for real-time implementation. The framework has been validated using data from multiple distribution centers, showing consistent improvements in picker productivity and overall warehouse throughput."

    "abstract": "Due to the complexity and variability of the operating environment, robust and interpretable fault diagnosis is essential to ensure the safe operation of the wind turbine gearbox. In recent years, causal learning has offered promising application prospects for uncovering the internal causal relationships of equipment and the interpretability of intelligent diagnostic models. However, the existing methods still have limitations, including difficulty in coping with the distribution offset caused by environmental changes and insufficient interpretability, which result in unreliable diagnoses. Aiming to address the above problems, an interpretable fault diagnosis method based on a causal-aware neural network (CANN) is proposed, which improves the diagnostic accuracy and interpretability of the model in complex environments. Firstly, a new structural causal model is proposed to analyze the causal relationship between fault-related variables. Then, a causal decoupling enhancement module is proposed to separate the effective causal part from the complex graph data. Finally, a robustness enhancement strategy based on causal intervention is proposed to extract stable and invariant features, which can effectively mitigate the influence of spurious correlations and distribution deviations. The experimental results show that the CANN model not only shows robust results in complex industrial environment diagnosis tasks, but also provides an interpretable explanation for model decision-making."

This paper proposes a RIS-BD assisted multi-user symbiotic radio system based on parasitic mode, where primary users (PUs) and secondary users (SUs) achieve symmetric resource sharing through limited competition for transmission resources. To achieve the pareto optimum balancing system-wide transmission performance with user fairness, we address the optimization of the weighted sum-rate (WSR) under the condition of multiple constraints, including heterogeneous user transmission demands and the base station's maximum transmission power. To tackle this complex problem with coupled variables, we decompose it into three subproblems and design an alternating optimization-based algorithm to jointly optimize time slot access, user association, and active-passive beamforming. Simulation results demonstrate that, compared to conventional commensal mode, parasitic mode achieves more orderly resource sharing, supports high-quality transmission for differentiated users, and delivers significantly improved overall transmission performance."

The original layout was reconfigured to replace the physical ground connection with a virtual grounding technique based on a distributed resonator, thereby eliminating the need for metallic vias. The structure employs multi-section coupled lines and phase-compensation stubs, and it was simulated using Ansys HFSS. Simulation results demonstrate effective operation within the 2 - 4 ~ G H z range, maintaining a phase shift of 9 0° ± 5° and isolation better than −15 dB. Removing the physical via required extensive geometric optimization, including adjustments to critical elements and dimensions. Comparative analysis between the physical and virtual grounding models showed similar electromagnetic behavior with minor differences attributed to limitations of the preliminary virtual ground model, especially at lower frequencies. This study highlights the potential of virtual grounding to simplify manufacturing processes and enable the development of costeffective RF devices without significant performance degradation."

Based on official data from the Superintendency of Companies, Securities, and Insurance, the study applies a descriptive and quantitative methodology supported by statistical and visualization tools. The analysis explores the annual growth rate of BIC companies, their geographic distribution, and their economic activities, considering a total of 1,697 registered firms. Results reveal a rapid initial adoption in 2021, followed by a phase of progressive stabilization, with a strong concentration in the Sierra region, especially in Pichincha, and predominance in professional services, commerce, and construction. A comparative perspective with Colombia highlights similarities in the adoption patterns and underscores the importance of regulatory incentives to sustain long-term growth. The findings show that the BIC model represents a promising mechanism for promoting corporate responsibility and sustainability in Ecuador. However, its consolidation requires stronger policy frameworks, measurable impact indicators, and broader sectoral and territorial integration to ensure equitable and sustainable development."

    "abstract": "The integration of a not negligible amount of Renewable Energy Power Plants (RE Plants) is a challenge for any power system, including the one of the KSA. Following the actual tendency towards higher penetration of the renewable energy generation can lead to higher fluctuations in the Renewable Energy System (RES) outputs, that need to be addressed to guarantee efficient grid operation. A VRES (variable renewable energy sources) is a non-dispatchable RES. Due to its fluctuating nature, a VRES cannot behave as a controllable RES such as hydro Energy. Storage is considered as one of the key enablers of the ongoing transition towards more efficient and sustainable energy systems. It depends on the capacity to redirect all or part of the energy flows to a suitable storage system, so that this stored energy can later be released when there is an excess of demand with respect to the generation available at that moment. This Paper analyzes the potential application of TES (Thermal Energy storage), in combination with Combined Power and Heat plants (CHP) and the market conditions where replacing Gas fired Boilers with TES for the generation of Industrial Grade Steam within the CHP is a feasible alternative."

With the rise of social media, it has become essential to analyze the emotions expressed in these texts and their dialects to understand from which region the users originate and their emotional responses. The Arabic language has faced challenges due to its complexity and the numerous dialects it encompasses, including the Saudi dialect. The data were collected from several sources, and some were manually classified. Moreover, data consists of 3,504 posts (55.7%) that were collected, in addition to 2,783 posts (44.3%) that are available on GitHub. Recently, with the rise of deep learning algorithms, Transformer-based pre-trained models have emerged. This research builds a system using two such models to detect emotion and classify dialects in Saudi texts. MarBERT was used to detect emotions, and SaudiBERT was used to detect dialects, with accuracies of 0.85 and 0.84, respectively. The two models were compared to other pre-trained models (AraBERTv0.2-Twitter, AraRoBERTa-SA, ArabicBert). The SaudiBERT model outperformed in dialect classification, and the MarBERT outperformed in emotion detection."

A decision-level fusion strategy based on DS evidence theory is proposed to effectively resolve the conflicts among individual channel outputs, enhancing diagnostic accuracy and robustness. Experimental validation on a wind turbine drivetrain dataset demonstrates that the proposed method achieves 99.52% accuracy under varying working conditions and significantly outperforms single-sensor-based models and two other fusion strategies, especially in noisy environments.

The synchronous reference frame phase locked loop (SRF PLL) is currently a crucial component of grid-connected power electronic converters (PECs) and is at the heart of synchronization functioning. A loop filter (LF) relied on proportional integral (PI), which is typically included in PLL, is essential for guaranteeing exact frequency and phase angle alignment between PEC and grid. This work suggests a unique PI tuning method relied on the pattern Search (PS) algorithm that fine-tunes the symmetrical optimum (SO)-tuned PI values for the SRF PLL grid synchronization scheme to improve performance. The suggested approach is evaluated in the presence of difficult grid anomalies including abrupt frequency jumps and step amplitude variability. When the proposed SO-PS tuned LF strategy for SRF PLL is contrasted to the current classical SO tuning approach, the MATLAB simulation results show increased dynamic performance and accuracy."
