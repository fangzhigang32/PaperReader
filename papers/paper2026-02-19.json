    "abstract": "Research on backdoor attacks against multimodal contrastive learning models faces two key challenges: stealthiness and persistence. Existing methods often fail under strong detection or continuous fine-tuning, largely due to (1) cross-modal inconsistency that exposes trigger patterns and (2) gradient dilution at low poisoning rates that accelerates backdoor forgetting. These coupled causes remain insufficiently modeled and addressed. We propose BadCLIP++, a unified framework that tackles both challenges. For stealthiness, we introduce a semantic-fusion QR micro-trigger that embeds imperceptible patterns near task-relevant regions, preserving clean-data statistics while producing compact trigger distributions. We further apply target-aligned subset selection to strengthen signals at low injection rates. For persistence, we stabilize trigger embeddings via radius shrinkage and centroid alignment, and stabilize model parameters through curvature control and elastic weight consolidation, maintaining solutions within a low-curvature wide basin resistant to fine-tuning. We also provide the first theoretical analysis showing that, within a trust region, gradients from clean fine-tuning and backdoor objectives are co-directional, yielding a non-increasing upper bound on attack success degradation. Experiments demonstrate that with only 0.3% poisoning, BadCLIP++ achieves 99.99% attack success rate (ASR) in digital settings, surpassing baselines by 11.4 points. Across nineteen defenses, ASR remains above 99.90% with less than 0.8% drop in clean accuracy. The method further attains 65.03% success in physical attacks and shows robustness against watermark removal defenses."

    "abstract": "Many computational methods in ab initio quantum chemistry are formulated in terms of high-order tensor contractions, whose cost determines the size of system that can be studied. We introduce stochastic tensor contraction to perform such operations with greatly reduced cost, and present its application to the gold-standard quantum chemistry method, coupled cluster theory with up to perturbative triples. For total energy errors more stringent than chemical accuracy, we reduce the computational scaling to that of mean-field theory, while starting to approach the mean-field absolute cost, thereby challenging the existing cost-to-accuracy landscape. Benchmarks against state-of-the-art local correlation approximations further show that we achieve an order-of-magnitude improvement in both total computation time and error, with significantly reduced sensitivity to system dimensionality and electron delocalization. We conclude that stochastic tensor contraction is a powerful computational primitive to accelerate a wide range of quantum chemistry."

These solutions do not share a common implementation and are difficult to implement and compare. In this work, we introduce Combine, a criterion- based pruning solution and demonstrate that it is fast and effective framework for iterative pruning, demonstrate that criterion have differing effects on different models, create a standard language for comparing criterion functions, and propose a few novel criterion functions.

    "abstract": "In Video on Demand (VoD) scenarios, traditional codecs are the industry standard due to their high decoding efficiency. However, they suffer from severe quality degradation under low bandwidth conditions. While emerging generative neural codecs offer significantly higher perceptual quality, their reliance on heavy frame-by-frame generation makes real-time playback on mobile devices impractical. We ask: is it possible to combine the blazing-fast speed of traditional standards with the superior visual fidelity of neural approaches? We present HybridPrompt, the first generative-based video system capable of achieving real-time 1080p decoding at over 150 FPS on a commercial smartphone. Specifically, we employ a hybrid architecture that encodes Keyframes using a generative model while relying on traditional codecs for the remaining frames. A major challenge is that the two paradigms have conflicting objectives: the \"hallucinated\" details from generative models often misalign with the rigid prediction mechanisms of traditional codecs, causing bitrate inefficiency. To address this, we demonstrate that the traditional decoding process is differentiable, enabling an end-to-end optimization loop. This allows us to use subsequent frames as additional supervision, forcing the generative model to synthesize keyframes that are not only perceptually high-fidelity but also mathematically optimal references for the traditional codec. By integrating a two-stage generation strategy, our system outperforms pure neural baselines by orders of magnitude in speed while achieving an average LPIPS gain of 8% over traditional codecs at 200kbps."

    "abstract": "3D reconstruction serves as the foundational layer for numerous robotic perception tasks, including 6D object pose estimation and grasp pose generation. Modern 3D reconstruction methods for objects can produce visually and geometrically impressive meshes from multi-view images, yet standard geometric evaluations do not reflect how reconstruction quality influences downstream tasks such as robotic manipulation performance. This paper addresses this gap by introducing a large-scale, physics-based benchmark that evaluates 6D pose estimators and 3D mesh models based on their functional efficacy in grasping. We analyze the impact of model fidelity by generating grasps on various reconstructed 3D meshes and executing them on the ground-truth model, simulating how grasp poses generated with an imperfect model affect interaction with the real object. This assesses the combined impact of pose error, grasp robustness, and geometric inaccuracies from 3D reconstruction. Our results show that reconstruction artifacts significantly decrease the number of grasp pose candidates but have a negligible effect on grasping performance given an accurately estimated pose. Our results also reveal that the relationship between grasp success and pose error is dominated by spatial error, and even a simple translation error provides insight into the success of the grasping pose of symmetric objects. This work provides insight into how perception systems relate to object manipulation using robots."

Recent studies demonstrate that carefully designed multi-agent workflows and communication graphs can significantly improve code generation performance by leveraging collaborative reasoning. However, existing methods neither adapt topology density to task difficulty nor iteratively refine the topology within an instance using execution feedback, which leads to redundant communication and performance bottlenecks. To address these issues, we propose AgentConductor: a reinforcement learning-optimized MAS with an LLM-based orchestrator agent as its core, which enables end-to-end feedback-driven dynamic generation of interaction topologies. For each query, AgentConductor infers agent roles and task difficulty, then constructs a task-adapted, density-aware layered directed acyclic graph (DAG) topology, underpinned by two key innovations. First, we design a novel topological density function that captures communication-aware mathematical characterizations of multi-agent interactions. Second, we adopt difficulty interval partitioning to avoid excessive pruning for precise topological density upper bound measurement per difficulty level and finer-grained control. Empirically, across three competition-level and two foundational code datasets, AgentConductor achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, outperforming the strongest baseline by up to 14.6% in pass@1 accuracy, 13% in density reduction, and 68% in token cost reduction."

Federated learning (FL) further facilitates this process by enabling collaborative fine-tuning across distributed clients without sharing private data. However, the use of two separate low-rank matrices in LoRA for federated fine-tuning introduces two types of challenges. The first challenge arises from the error induced by separately aggregating those two low-rank matrices. The second challenge occurs even when the product of two low-rank matrices is aggregated. The server needs to recover factors via matrix decomposition, which is non-unique and can introduce decomposition drift. To tackle the aforementioned challenges, we propose FLoRG, a federated fine-tuning framework which employs a single low-rank matrix for fine-tuning and aggregates its Gram matrix (i.e., the matrix of inner products of its column vectors), eliminating the aggregation error while also reducing the communication overhead. FLoRG minimizes the decomposition drift by introducing a Procrustes alignment approach which aligns the decomposed matrix between consecutive fine-tuning rounds for consistent updates. We theoretically analyze the convergence of FLoRG and prove that adopting the Procrustes alignment results in a tighter convergence bound. Experimental results across multiple LLM fine-tuning benchmarks demonstrate that FLoRG outperforms five state-of-the-art baseline schemes in the downstream task accuracy and can reduce the communication overhead by up to 2041$\\times$."

No prior work has explored methods to help reviewers efficiently identify code that will be removed.In this paper, we propose a prediction model that identifies functions likely to be deleted during PR review.

    "abstract": "The growing concern over training data privacy has elevated the \"Right to be Forgotten\" into a critical requirement, thereby raising the demand for effective Machine Unlearning. However, existing unlearning approaches commonly suffer from a fundamental trade-off: aggressively erasing the influence of target data often degrades model utility on retained data, while conservative strategies leave residual target information intact. In this work, the intrinsic representation properties learned during model pretraining are analyzed. It is demonstrated that semantic class concepts are entangled at the feature-pattern level, sharing associated features while preserving concept-specific discriminative components. This entanglement fundamentally limits the effectiveness of existing unlearning paradigms. Motivated by this insight, we propose Machine-Guided Unlearning (MeGU), a novel framework that guides unlearning through concept-aware re-alignment. Specifically, Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are leveraged to explicitly determine re-alignment directions for target samples by assigning semantically meaningful perturbing labels. To improve efficiency, inter-class conceptual similarities estimated by the MLLM are encoded into a lightweight transition matrix. Furthermore, MeGU introduces a positive-negative feature noise pair to explicitly disentangle target concept influence. During finetuning, the negative noise suppresses target-specific feature patterns, while the positive noise reinforces remaining associated features and aligns them with perturbing concepts. This coordinated design enables selective disruption of target-specific representations while preserving shared semantic structures. As a result, MeGU enables controlled and selective forgetting, effectively mitigating both under-unlearning and over-unlearning."

We find streaming is enhanced when $C_s>1$, suppressed for $0\\leq C_s\\leq1$, and reversed when $C_s<0$. We explain the regimes in terms of the interplay between the Reynolds and viscoelastic stresses that collectively drive fluid motion. Remarkably, we discover the role of viscoelastic shear waves in acoustic streaming transition characterized by the ratio of acoustic attenuation length and shear wavelength. We gain deeper insight into the streaming transition by examining energy dynamics in terms of the loss and storage moduli. Our study may find applications in acousto-microfluidics systems for particle handling and fluid pumping/mixing."

    "abstract": "Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has made significant progress in recent years, but most algorithms still rely on a discrete-time Markov Decision Process (MDP) with fixed decision intervals. This formulation is often ill-suited for complex multi-agent dynamics, particularly in high-frequency or irregular time-interval settings, leading to degraded performance and motivating the development of continuous-time MARL (CT-MARL). Existing CT-MARL methods are mainly built on Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations. However, they rarely account for safety constraints such as collision penalties, since these introduce discontinuities that make HJB-based learning difficult. To address this challenge, we propose a continuous-time constrained MDP (CT-CMDP) formulation and a novel MARL framework that transforms discrete MDPs into CT-CMDPs via an epigraph-based reformulation. We then solve this by proposing a novel physics-informed neural network (PINN)-based actor-critic method that enables stable and efficient optimization in continuous time. We evaluate our approach on continuous-time safe multi-particle environments (MPE) and safe multi-agent MuJoCo benchmarks. Results demonstrate smoother value approximations, more stable training, and improved performance over safe MARL baselines, validating the effectiveness and robustness of our method."

Experiments on a 130M parameter transformer demonstrate that PBS achieves 6-13\\% faster convergence measured by evaluation loss across training checkpoints, with the predictor's correlation improving from 0.14 to 0.44 over 10,000 training steps.

Across Transformers, CNNs, and MLPs, learned sign matrices resist low-rank approximation and are spectrally indistinguishable from an i.i.d. Rademacher baseline. Despite this apparent randomness, most weights retain their initialization signs; flips primarily occur via rare near-zero boundary crossings, suggesting that sign-pattern randomness is largely inherited from initialization. We formalize this behavior with sign lock-in theory, a stopping-time analysis of sign flips under SGD noise. Under bounded updates and a rare re-entry condition into a small neighborhood around zero, the number of effective sign flips exhibits a geometric tail. Building on this mechanism, we introduce a gap-based initialization and a lightweight outward-drift regularizer, reducing the effective flip rate to approximately $10^{-3}$ with only about a one-point increase in perplexity."

Leveraging this framework, we introduce Amber-Image, a series of streamlined T2I models. We first derive Amber-Image-10B using a timestep-sensitive depth pruning strategy, where retained layers are reinitialized via local weight averaging and optimized through layer-wise distillation and full-parameter fine-tuning. Building on this, we develop Amber-Image-6B by introducing a hybrid-stream architecture that converts deep-layer dual streams into a single stream initialized from the image branch, further refined via progressive distillation and lightweight fine-tuning. Our approach reduces parameters by 70% and eliminates the need for large-scale data engineering. Notably, the entire compression and training pipeline-from the 10B to the 6B variant-requires fewer than 2,000 GPU hours, demonstrating exceptional cost-efficiency compared to training from scratch.

    "abstract": "Population-adjusted indirect comparisons (PAICs) are widely used to synthesize evidence when randomized controlled trials enroll different patient populations and head-to-head comparisons are unavailable. Although PAICs adjust for observed population differences across trials, adjustment alone does not ensure transportability of estimated effects to decision-relevant populations for health technology assessment (HTA). We examine and formalize transportability in PAICs from an estimand-based perspective. We distinguish conditional and marginal treatment effect estimands and show how transportability depends on effect modification, collapsibility, and alignment between the scale of effect modification and the effect measure. Using illustrative examples, we demonstrate that even when effect modifiers are shared across treatments, marginal effects are generally population-dependent for commonly used non-collapsible measures, including hazard ratios and odds ratios. Conversely, collapsible and conditional effects defined on the linear predictor scale exhibit more favorable transportability properties. We further show that pairwise PAIC approaches typically identify effects defined in the comparator population and that applying these estimates to other populations entails an additional, often implicit, transport step requiring further assumptions. This has direct implications for HTA, where PAIC-derived effects are routinely applied within cost-effectiveness and decision models defined for different target populations. Our results clarify when applying PAIC-derived treatment effects to desired target populations is justified, when doing so requires additional assumptions, and when results should instead be interpreted as population-specific rather than decision-relevant, supporting more transparent and principled use of indirect evidence in HTA and related decision-making contexts."

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) has equipped LLM agents with a strong ability to solve complex tasks. However, existing RL methods normally use a \\emph{single} policy network, causing \\emph{simplicity bias} where simple tasks occupy most parameters and dominate gradient updates, leaving insufficient capacity for complex tasks. A plausible remedy could be employing the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture in the policy network, as MoE allows different parameters (experts) to specialize in different tasks, preventing simple tasks from dominating all parameters. However, a key limitation of traditional MoE is its token-level routing, where the router assigns each token to specialized experts, which fragments phase-consistent patterns into scattered expert assignments and thus undermines expert specialization. In this paper, we propose \\textbf{Phase-Aware Mixture of Experts (PA-MoE)}. It first features a lightweight \\emph{phase router} that learns latent phase boundaries directly from the RL objective without pre-defining phase categories. Then, the phase router allocates temporally consistent assignments to the same expert, allowing experts to preserve phase-specific expertise. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed PA-MoE."

While current exercise recommendation frameworks have made significant strides, they frequently encounter obstacles regarding the long-tailed distribution of student engagement and the failure to adapt to idiosyncratic learning trajectories. We present LiveGraph, a novel active-structure neural re-ranking framework designed to overcome these limitations. Our approach utilizes a graph-based representation enhancement strategy to bridge the information gap between active and inactive students while integrating a dynamic re-ranking mechanism to foster content diversity. By prioritizing the structural relationships within learning histories, the proposed model effectively balances recommendation precision with pedagogical variety. Comprehensive experimental evaluations conducted on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that LiveGraph surpasses contemporary baselines in both predictive accuracy and the breadth of exercise diversity."

Recent advances in AI have the potential to transform such pipelines in a way that domain experts can focus on interpreting and understanding findings, rather than debugging rigid pipelines or manually annotating data. As part of an active collaboration between data science/AI researchers and behavioral neuroscientists, we showcase an example AI-enhanced pipeline, specifically designed to transform and accelerate the way that the domain experts in the team are able to gain insights out of experimental data. The application at hand is in the domain of behavioral neuroscience, studying fear generalization in mice, an important problem whose progress can advance our understanding of clinically significant and often debilitating conditions such as PTSD (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder). We identify the emerging paradigm of \"In-Context Learning\" (ICL) as a suitable interface for domain experts to automate parts of their pipeline without the need for or familiarity with AI model training and fine-tuning, and showcase its remarkable efficacy in data preparation and pattern interpretation. Also, we introduce novel AI-enhancements to tensor decomposition model, which allows for more seamless pattern discovery from the heterogeneous data in our application. We thoroughly evaluate our proposed pipeline experimentally, showcasing its superior performance compared to what is standard practice in the domain, as well as against reasonable ML baselines that do not fall under the ICL paradigm, to ensure that we are not compromising performance in our quest for a seamless and easy-to-use interface for domain experts. Finally, we demonstrate effective discovery, with results validated by the domain experts in the team."

    "abstract": "Existing studies on generalized pinching-antenna systems are predominantly link-level, which optimize system parameters for a given user set with objectives defined by per-user performance metrics. Such designs do not capture network-level requirements, e.g., region-wide coverage and location fairness, and may require frequent re-optimization as users move or enter/leave, incurring control overhead and sensitivity to localization errors. Motivated by this gap, this two-part paper aims to develop an environment-aware network-level design framework for generalized pinching-antenna systems. Part I focuses on the traffic-aware case, where user presence is modeled statistically by a spatial traffic map and performance is optimized and evaluated in a traffic-aware sense; Part II addresses the geometry-aware case in obstacle-rich environments. In Part~I, we introduce traffic-weighted average SNR metrics and formulate two traffic-aware deployment problems: (i) maximizing the traffic-weighted network average SNR, and (ii) a fairness-oriented traffic-restricted max--min average-SNR design over traffic-dominant grids. To solve these nonconvex problems with low complexity, we reveal and exploit their separable structures. For the network-average objective, we establish unimodality properties of the hotspot-induced components and develop a candidate-based global maximization method that only needs to evaluate the objective at a small set of candidate antenna positions. For the traffic-restricted max--min objective, we develop a block coordinate decent framework where each coordinate update reduces to a globally solvable one-dimensional subproblem via an epigraph reformulation and bisection. Simulations show that traffic-aware pinching-antenna positioning consistently outperforms representative fixed and heuristic traffic-aware deployments in the considered setups."

    "abstract": "Conversational agents powered by large language models (LLMs) with tool integration achieve strong performance on fixed task-oriented dialogue datasets but remain vulnerable to unanticipated, user-induced errors. Rather than focusing on error prevention, this work focuses on error recovery, which necessitates the accurate diagnosis of erroneous dialogue contexts and execution of proper recovery plans. Under realistic constraints precluding model fine-tuning or prompt modification due to significant cost and time requirements, we explore whether agents can recover from contextually flawed interactions and how their behavior can be adapted without altering model parameters and prompts. To this end, we propose Reasoning Inception (ReIn), a test-time intervention method that plants an initial reasoning into the agent's decision-making process. Specifically, an external inception module identifies predefined errors within the dialogue context and generates recovery plans, which are subsequently integrated into the agent's internal reasoning process to guide corrective actions, without modifying its parameters or system prompts. We evaluate ReIn by systematically simulating conversational failure scenarios that directly hinder successful completion of user goals: user's ambiguous and unsupported requests. Across diverse combinations of agent models and inception modules, ReIn substantially improves task success and generalizes to unseen error types. Moreover, it consistently outperforms explicit prompt-modification approaches, underscoring its utility as an efficient, on-the-fly method. In-depth analysis of its operational mechanism, particularly in relation to instruction hierarchy, indicates that jointly defining recovery tools with ReIn can serve as a safe and effective strategy for improving the resilience of conversational agents without modifying the backbone models or system prompts."

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the joint optimization of trajectory, user scheduling, and time-slot duration in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted wireless communication systems under minimum expected spectral efficiency (SE) constraints. Unlike most existing studies that approximate the expected SE by substituting the random channel gain with its mean value, thereby evaluating the SE at the average channel realization and overestimating the true expected SE due to Jensen's inequality, we approximate the expected SE by numerically integrating the SE over the channel distributions. Specifically, instead of relying on average-channel-based approximations, we develop a conservative yet tractable quadrature-based approximation by discretizing the associated cumulative distribution functions. The resulting finite-sum representation explicitly accounts for the probabilistic LoS structure and channel fading effects, while remaining tractable for optimization. Leveraging this lower bound, we formulate a mission completion time minimization problem subject to minimum expected-SE requirements for all ground nodes. The resulting problem is a mixed-integer nonconvex optimization, which is tackled via a penalty-based block coordinate descent framework. The proposed algorithm alternately optimizes the scheduling decisions and the UAV trajectory along with adaptive time-slot durations, and maintains feasibility with respect to the original expected-SE constraints by leveraging successive convex approximation and quadratic transform techniques. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method strictly satisfies the minimum expected-SE constraints and achieves a significantly shorter mission completion time than conventional average-channel-based approaches, which are shown to yield infeasible or overly conservative solutions."

    "source": "arXiv",
    "abstract": "In his late piece 'La nouvelle cuisine' (Bell 1990), John Bell describes the steps from an intuitive, informal principle of locality to a mathematical rule called Factorizability. This rule stipulates that when possible past causes are held fixed, the joint probabilities of outcomes of spacelike separated measurements, conditional on measurement settings, be the product of the local conditional probabilities individually. Bell shows that Factorizability conflicts with predictions of QM, predictions since confirmed in many experiments. However, Bell warns his readers that the steps leading to Factorizability should 'be viewed with the utmost suspicion'. He says that 'it is precisely in cleaning up intuitive ideas for mathematics that one is likely to throw the baby out with the bathwater' (1990, 239). Bell's suspicions were well-founded, for he himself misses an important baby. Here we retrieve and identify it: it is selection bias. We explain how failure of Factorizability may be regarded as a selection artefact, requiring no violation of locality in the intuitive, conceptual sense with which Bell begins his analysis. The argument begins with a central principle of causal discovery, Reichenbach's Principle of Common Cause (PCC). It is well known that correlations due to selection bias are not subject to PCC. Several writers have proposed that EPR-Bell correlations are also an exception to PCC, but it has not been noticed that they fall under this well-known exclusion. The point is relevant not only to the status of Bell nonlocality, but also for statistics and causal modeling. For these fields, the news is that selection effects play a ubiquitous role in quantum phenomena, in a form akin to collider bias."

    "abstract": "Object-oriented programs tend to be written using many common coding idioms, such as those captured by design patterns. While design patterns are useful, implementing them is often tedious and repetitive, requiring boilerplate code that distracts the programmer from more essential details. In this paper, we introduce Mason, a tool that synthesizes object-oriented programs from partial program pieces, and we apply it to automatically insert design patterns into programs. At the core of Mason is a novel technique we call type- and name-guided synthesis, in which an enumerative solver traverses a partial program to generate typing constraints; discharges constraints via program transformations guided by the names of constrained types and members; and backtracks when a constraint is violated or a candidate program fails unit tests. We also introduce two extensions to Mason: a non-local backtracking heuristic that uses execution traces, and a language of patterns that impose syntactic restrictions on missing names. We evaluate Mason on a suite of benchmarks to which Mason must add various well-known design patterns implemented as a library of program pieces. We find that Mason performs well when very few candidate programs satisfy its typing constraints and that our extensions can improve Mason's performance significantly when this is not the case. We believe that Mason takes an important step forward in synthesizing multi-class object-oriented programs using design patterns."

We present UniLeak, a mechanistic-interpretability framework that identifies universal activation directions: latent directions in a model's residual stream whose linear addition at inference time consistently increases the likelihood of generating PII across prompts. These model-specific directions generalize across contexts and amplify PII generation probability, with minimal impact on generation quality. UniLeak recovers such directions without access to training data or groundtruth PII, relying only on self-generated text. Across multiple models and datasets, steering along these universal directions substantially increases PII leakage compared to existing prompt-based extraction methods. Our results offer a new perspective on PII leakage: the superposition of a latent signal in the model's representations, enabling both risk amplification and mitigation."

In practice, multimodal data is often incomplete because modalities may be missing, collected asynchronously, or available only for a subset of examples. In this work, we propose PRIMO, a supervised latent-variable imputation model that quantifies the predictive impact of any missing modality within the multimodal learning setting. PRIMO enables the use of all available training examples, whether modalities are complete or partial. Specifically, it models the missing modality through a latent variable that captures its relationship with the observed modality in the context of prediction. During inference, we draw many samples from the learned distribution over the missing modality to both obtain the marginal predictive distribution (for the purpose of prediction) and analyze the impact of the missing modalities on the prediction for each instance. We evaluate PRIMO on a synthetic XOR dataset, Audio-Vision MNIST, and MIMIC-III for mortality and ICD-9 prediction. Across all datasets, PRIMO obtains performance comparable to unimodal baselines when a modality is fully missing and to multimodal baselines when all modalities are available. PRIMO quantifies the predictive impact of a modality at the instance level using a variance-based metric computed from predictions across latent completions. We visually demonstrate how varying completions of the missing modality result in a set of plausible labels."

We contrast low $Re$ undulatory propulsion ($\\text{Un} > 1$), exemplified by freshwater snails, with high $Re$ flapping propulsion ($\\text{Un} < 1$), seen in bats and bees. For snails, we derive lubrication models showing that pumping and swimming speeds scale with $(a/h_0)^2$, a result validated by robotic experiments which also reveal the detrimental effects of surface deformation (high Capillary/Bond ratio). Conversely, for high $Re$ fliers, we examine the ground effect's role in lift enhancement. Biological data from bats (\\textit{R. ferrumequinum}) reveal a 2.5-fold increase in lift coefficient during surface-skimming drinking flights, attributed to aerodynamic squeezing effects. Finally, we analyze honeybee fanning, demonstrating how a \"jet-vortex\" mechanism utilizes ground effect to transport pheromones efficiently against diffusion. These findings provide a unified framework for understanding fluid-structure interactions near boundaries in biological systems."

We find the field's evolution depends critically on the product of its amplitude and squared wavenumber, revealing a massless regime at large values and an ultra-massive regime with dominant nonlinear Fourier mode mixing near unity. By comparing the resulting dispersion map to the massive Klein-Gordon equation, we introduce a spectral mass. We demonstrate that a specific input amplitude value induces a spectral mass of unity, effectively characterizing the massive-like behavior arising from the initial wave configuration."

In this study, we conducted a causal mediation analysis to decompose the total effect of daily temperature on respiratory ED visits in Los Angeles from 2005 to 2016. We focused on ambient ozone as a mediator because its precursors and formation are directly driven by sunlight and temperature. We estimated natural direct, indirect, and total effects on the relative risk scale across deciles of temperature exposure compared to the median. We utilized Bayesian additive regression trees (BART) to flexibly characterize the nonlinear relationship between temperature and ozone and quantified uncertainty via posterior prediction and the Bayesian bootstrap. Our results showed that ozone partially mediated the association between high temperatures and respiratory ED visits, particularly at moderately high temperatures. We also validated our modeling approach through simulation studies. This study extends the existing literature by considering acute respiratory morbidity and employing a flexible modeling approach, offering new insights into the mechanisms underlying temperature-related health risks."

When only parts of a document are sensitive, providers who want to avoid leaking protected information typically must manually redact documents before sharing them, which is costly, coarse-grained, and hard to maintain as policies or partners change. We present DAVE, a usage policy-enforcing LLM spokesperson that answers questions over private documents on behalf of a data provider. Instead of releasing documents, the provider exposes a natural language interface whose responses are constrained by machine-readable usage policies. We formalize policy-violating information disclosure in this setting, drawing on usage control and information flow security, and introduce virtual redaction: suppressing sensitive information at query time without modifying source documents. We describe an architecture for integrating such a spokesperson with Eclipse Dataspace Components and ODRL-style policies, and outline an initial provider-side integration prototype in which QA requests are routed through a spokesperson service instead of triggering raw document transfer. Our contribution is primarily architectural: we do not yet implement or empirically evaluate the full enforcement pipeline. We therefore outline an evaluation methodology to assess security, utility, and performance trade-offs under benign and adversarial querying as a basis for future empirical work on systematically governed LLM access to multi-party data spaces."

We have considered two functional forms of f(R,L_m) and one functional form of f(R,L_m,T) gravity. Considering the matter Lagrangian L_m=p, we calculate modified TOV equations for each of the forms. By employing the fully degenerate electron gas equation of state in the modified TOV equations, we derive the mass-radius relation for each functional form of both f(R,L_m) and f(R,L_m,T) gravity. Our models imply modifications in the Chandrasekhar mass limit that deviate significantly from the GR and the Newtonian cases. In the f(R,L_m, T)$ gravity, the new mass limit of the white dwarf can reach upto 1.537\\,\\mathrm{M}_\\odot while in f(R,L_m) with the quadratic extension can goes upto 1.52\\,\\mathrm{M}_\\odot and with exponential extension upto 2.08\\,\\mathrm{M}_\\odot. Further, we analyze the static stability criterion, the gravitational redshift, and the adiabatic indices. For the power-law form of f(R,L_m) and the non-linear form of f(R,L_m,T) gravity, significant variations are observed at higher densities (ρ_c > 10^{10}\\, \\mathrm{g/cm^3}), while substantial changes are noted at much lower central densities in the case of exponential form of f(R,L_m) gravity. We also calculate compactness and gravitational redshift, which are much lower than those of neutron stars and black holes. Stability is also confirmed by adiabatic indices, which show that all models yield Γ> 4/3 throughout the interiors of WDs. Overall, our models provide a viable framework for the existence of super-Chandrasekhar mass limit, extending beyond the classical predictions in the Newtonian and/or GR cases."

    "abstract": "Breastfeeding efficiency relies on coordinated tongue motion, sustained tissue contact and maintenance of an effective intraoral seal. Current assessments of seal formation mainly use local kinematic descriptors or pressure recordings, which do not capture the global structural continuity of the sealing region. We introduce a systolic geometry based approach in which each sagittal ultrasound frame is modeled as a two dimensional deformable domain bounded by tongue, palate and nipple contours. Global seal continuity is formalized through the shortest closed curve that cannot be contracted to a point because of the overall geometry of the domain. The nipple defines a central region that must be circumferentially enclosed by a contact band to maintain suction. Within this band, closed curves encircling the nipple exactly once can be identified; the shortest of these curves defines a normalized systolic index representing the tightest admissible sealing loop. Simulations of symmetric thinning, localized discontinuities and cyclic perturbations reveal feasibility boundaries separating seal preserving from seal breaking configurations. Notably, admissible encircling curves may transiently disappear even when overall geometric motion remains smooth. By capturing global circumferential continuity that cannot be inferred from local metrics alone, our approach generates testable hypotheses linking the existence and temporal stability of admissible encircling curves to milk transfer efficiency and vacuum stability. Applied to segmented ultrasound data and integrated with pressure measurements, our systolic approach could provide a quantitative framework for objective assessment of seal integrity and longitudinal monitoring of latch stability."

While natural language search has seen dramatic progress in recent years largely driven by embedding-based models and large-scale pretraining, the field still faces significant challenges. Specifically, queries that involve complex relationships, object compositions, or precise constraints such as identities, counts and proportions often remain unresolved or unreliable within current frameworks. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that integrates formal verification into deep learning-based image retrieval through a synergistic combination of graph-based verification methods and neural code generation. Our approach aims to support open-vocabulary natural language queries while producing results that are both trustworthy and verifiable. By grounding retrieval results in a system of formal reasoning, we move beyond the ambiguity and approximation that often characterize vector representations. Instead of accepting uncertainty as a given, our framework explicitly verifies each atomic truth in the user query against the retrieved content. This allows us to not only return matching results, but also to identify and mark which specific constraints are satisfied and which remain unmet, thereby offering a more transparent and accountable retrieval process while boosting the results of the most popular embedding-based approaches."

The key feature of the proposed method is a bound on the uncertainty propagation along the prediction horizon which exploits a set-theoretic over-approximation of each term of the uncertain system impulse response. Such an approximation is based on matrix zonotopes and leverages the interval matrix structure of the uncertainty model. Its main advantage is that all the relevant bounds are computed offline, thus making the online computational load independent of the number of uncertain parameters. A variable-horizon MPC formulation is adopted to guarantee recursive feasibility and to ensure robust asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed approach is able to match the feasibility regions of the most effective state-of-the-art methods, while significantly reducing the computational burden, thereby enabling the treatment of nontrivial dimensional systems with multiple uncertain parameters."

    "abstract": "We cast episodic Markov decision process (MDP) planning as Bayesian inference over _policies_. A policy is treated as the latent variable and is assigned an unnormalized probability of optimality that is monotone in its expected return, yielding a posterior distribution whose modes coincide with return-maximizing solutions while posterior dispersion represents uncertainty over optimal behavior. To approximate this posterior in discrete domains, we adapt variational sequential Monte Carlo (VSMC) to inference over deterministic policies under stochastic dynamics, introducing a sweep that enforces policy consistency across revisited states and couples transition randomness across particles to avoid confounding from simulator noise. Acting is performed by posterior predictive sampling, which induces a stochastic control policy through a Thompson-sampling interpretation rather than entropy regularization. Across grid worlds, Blackjack, Triangle Tireworld, and Academic Advising, we analyze the structure of inferred policy distributions and compare the resulting behavior to discrete Soft Actor-Critic, highlighting qualitative and statistical differences that arise from policy-level uncertainty."

Specifically, we consider functionals featuring bulk terms depending on the symmetrized gradient of the displacement and terms comparable to the surface area of the material voids inside the material. Under suitable growth conditions for the bulk and surface densities we prove that, as the microscale $\\varepsilon$ tends to zero, the $Γ$-limit admits an integral representation that contains an additional surface term expressed by jump discontinuities of the displacement outside of the void region. This term is related to the phenomenon of collapsing of voids in the effective limit. Under a continuity assumption of the surface density at the $\\varepsilon$-scale, we show that the limiting density related to jumps is twice the energy density for voids."

Here, we present the first 10m-resolution tree crop map for South America, generated using a multi-modal, spatio-temporal deep learning model trained on Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellite imagery time series. The map identifies approximately 11 million hectares of tree crops, 23% of which is linked to 2000-2020 forest cover loss. Critically, our analysis reveals that existing regulatory maps supporting the EUDR often classify established agriculture, particularly smallholder agroforestry, as \"forest\". This discrepancy risks false deforestation alerts and unfair penalties for small-scale farmers. Our work mitigates this risk by providing a high-resolution baseline, supporting conservation policies that are effective, inclusive, and equitable."

This provides a geometric means for obtaining associative algebras -- conjecturally all -- which are derived equivalent to skew-gentle algebras. We include a new perspective on the partially wrapped Fukaya category of an orbifold disk which serves as a local model for the Fukaya categories of general orbifold surfaces. This perspective yields an equivalence between the perfect derived category of a quiver of type $\\mathrm D_{n+1}$ and the perfect derived category of a graded quiver of type $\\widetilde{\\mathrm A}_{n-1}$, the latter being equipped with quadratic zero relations and a nontrivial A$_\\infty$ structure.

We first simplify Mamba-2 down to its most fundamental and important components, evaluating which specific choices make it most accurate. From this simplified Mamba variant (Mamba-2S), we improve the A-mask and increase the order of the hidden state, resulting in a method, which we call 2Mamba, that is nearly as accurate as softmax attention, yet much more memory efficient for long context lengths.

    "abstract": "In a decentralized balancing model, Balance Responsible Parties (BRPs) are encouraged by the Transmission System Operator (TSO) to deviate from their schedule to help the system restore balance, also referred to as implicit balancing. This could reduce balancing costs for the grid operator and lower the entry barrier for flexible assets compared to explicit balancing services. However, these implicit reactions may overshoot when their total capacity is high, potentially requiring more explicit activations. This study analyses the effect of increased participation in the decentralized balancing model in Belgium. To this end, we develop a market simulator that produces price signals on minute-level and simulate the implicit reactions for battery assets with different risk profiles. Besides the current price formula, we also study two potential candidates for the near-term presented by the TSO. A simulation study is conducted using Belgian market data for the year 2023. The findings indicate that, while having a significant positive effect on the balancing costs at first, the risk of overshoots can outweigh the potential benefits when the total capacity of the implicit reactions becomes too large. Furthermore, even when the balancing costs start to increase for the TSO, BRPs were still found to benefit from implicit balancing."

The central problem is how to determine whether two embeddings of a closed arc are equivalent under ambient isotopy. Given the striking ability of neural networks to solve complex classification tasks, it is therefore natural to ask if the knot classification problem can be tackled using Machine Learning (ML). In this paper, we investigate generic shortcut methods employed by ML to solve the knot classification challenge and specifically discover hidden non-topological features in training data generated through Molecular Dynamics simulations of polygonal knots that are used by ML to arrive to positive classifications results. We then provide a rigorous foundation for future attempts to tackle the knot classification challenge using ML by developing a publicly-available (i) dataset, that aims to remove the potential of non-topological feature classification and (ii) code, that can generate knot embeddings that faithfully explore chosen geometric state space with fixed knot topology. We expect that our work will accelerate the development of ML models that can solve complex geometric knot classification challenges."

The artificial Kondo lattice enables the exploration of exotic states of matter near a continuously tunable Kondo breakdown. Here we report the emergence of a symmetry-broken Chern insulator at a moiré hole filling factor 4/3 in angle-aligned MoTe2/WSe2 moiré bilayers, which realize a chiral Kondo lattice. The symmetry-broken Chern insulator, which exhibits integer quantized Hall conductance at a fractional moiré filling, breaks the translational symmetry of the lattice spontaneously; it also appears only near a magnetic field-induced Kondo breakdown in the mixed-valence regime of the material. We further demonstrate that the magnetic field required to induce the Kondo breakdown and to stabilize the symmetry-broken Chern insulator is twist angle dependent. The results present new opportunities for exploring the subtle interplay between topology and Kondo interactions in moiré semiconductors."

In this paper we develop the theory of symmetric extensions including different types of iterations, quotients, equivalents, and the structural results that can be described in this language. In particular, we give a modern exposition to some of the important theorems of Grigorieff [3], study Kinna--Wagner Principles in symmetric extensions, and show that it is provable from $\\mathsf{ZF}$ that every set lies in a symmetric extension of $\\operatorname{HOD}$."

While teleportation from CV to DV can be achieved with near-unit success probability, the reverse process is usually limited to a maximum success probability of $1/2$. We demonstrate that, by employing cross-Kerr nonlinearity together with passive linear optical components such as polarizing beam splitters, beam splitters, and phase shifters, almost perfect teleportation from DV to CV encodings can also be achieved."

    "abstract": "Modern neural translation models based on the Transformer architecture are known for their high performance, particularly when trained on high-resource datasets. A standard next-token prediction training strategy, while widely adopted in practice, may lead to overlooked artifacts such as representation collapse. Previous works have shown that this problem is especially pronounced in the representation of the deeper Transformer layers, where it often fails to efficiently utilize the geometric space. Representation collapse is even more evident in end-to-end training of continuous-output neural machine translation, where the trivial solution would be to set all vectors to the same value. In this work, we analyze the dynamics of representation collapse at different levels of discrete and continuous NMT transformers throughout training. We incorporate an existing regularization method based on angular dispersion and demonstrate empirically that it not only mitigates collapse but also improves translation quality. Furthermore, we show that quantized models exhibit similar collapse behavior and that the benefits of regularization are preserved even after quantization."

When rescaling the thin domain, isotropic interaction ranges naturally become anisotropic, leading to the development of a theory for anisotropic nonlocal gradients with direction-dependent interaction ranges. Unlike existing nonlocal derivatives with finite horizon, which are defined via interaction kernels supported on balls of positive radius, our formulation is based on ellipsoidal interaction regions whose principal radii may vanish independently. This yields a unified framework that interpolates between fully nonlocal, partially nonlocal, and purely local models. Employing these tools, we present a $Γ$-convergence analysis for the nonlocal thin-film energies. The limit functional retains the structural form of the classical membrane energy, and the classical local model is recovered precisely when all interaction radii vanish."

The discovery magnitude of the 16 WFST-PS early-phase SNe is at least 3 mag fainter than their peak brightness.

The results indicate that current theoretical models require further refinement to fully capture the early photometric evolution of SNe Ia.

To enable scalable evaluation, recent work increasingly relies on third-party annotations of static dialogue logs by crowd workers or large language models. However, the reliability of this practice remains largely unexamined. In this paper, we present a large-scale empirical study investigating the reliability and structure of user-centric CRS evaluation on static dialogue transcripts. We collected 1,053 annotations from 124 crowd workers on 200 ReDial dialogues using the 18-dimensional CRS-Que framework. Using random-effects reliability models and correlation analysis, we quantify the stability of individual dimensions and their interdependencies. Our results show that utilitarian and outcome-oriented dimensions such as accuracy, usefulness, and satisfaction achieve moderate reliability under aggregation, whereas socially grounded constructs such as humanness and rapport are substantially less reliable. Furthermore, many dimensions collapse into a single global quality signal, revealing a strong halo effect in third-party judgments. These findings challenge the validity of single-annotator and LLM-based evaluation protocols and motivate the need for multi-rater aggregation and dimension reduction in offline CRS evaluation."

Yet these instruments presume honest responding; in evaluative contexts, LLMs can instead gravitate toward socially preferred answers-a form of socially desirable responding (SDR)-biasing questionnaire-derived scores and downstream conclusions. We propose a psychometric framework to quantify and mitigate SDR in questionnaire-based evaluation of LLMs. To quantify SDR, the same inventory is administered under HONEST versus FAKE-GOOD instructions, and SDR is computed as a direction-corrected standardized effect size from item response theory (IRT)-estimated latent scores. This enables comparisons across constructs and response formats, as well as against human instructed-faking benchmarks. For mitigation, we construct a graded forced-choice (GFC) Big Five inventory by selecting 30 cross-domain pairs from an item pool via constrained optimization to match desirability. Across nine instruction-tuned LLMs evaluated on synthetic personas with known target profiles, Likert-style questionnaires show consistently large SDR, whereas desirability-matched GFC substantially attenuates SDR while largely preserving the recovery of the intended persona profiles. These results highlight a model-dependent SDR-recovery trade-off and motivate SDR-aware reporting practices for questionnaire-based benchmarking and auditing of LLMs."

Based on the tagged-pilot model, a low-complexity per-segment maximum-likelihood (ML) detector is developed for the case in which the pilot length is no smaller than the number of segments. For the case in which the pilot length is smaller than the number of segments, sparsity in the failure-indicator vector is exploited and a compressive sensing-based detector is adopted. Numerical results show that the per-segment detector approaches joint ML performance, while the compressive sensing-based detector achieves reliable detection with a short pilot and can outperform baselines that require much longer pilots."

    "abstract": "Spectrum is an important numerical invariant of an isolated hypersurface singularity, connecting its topological and analytic structures. The well-known Hertling conjecture tells the relation of range and variance of exponents i.e. elements of spectrum. For trimodal singularities, we compute their spectra and verify Hertling conjecture for them. Jung, Kim, Saito and Yoon recently defined Tjurina spectrum, stemming from Hodge ideals. This set of numerical invariants is a subset of spectrum in Steenbrink's sense. We give an estimation of exponents not in Tjurina spectrum and propose a similar Generalized Hertling Conjecture for Tjurina Spectrum. Moreover, we prove the conjecture for singularities of modality $\\leq 3$."

    "abstract": "Predicting human decision-making in high-stakes environments remains a central challenge for artificial intelligence. While large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong general reasoning, they often struggle to generate consistent, individual-specific behavior, particularly when accurate prediction depends on complex interactions between psychological traits and situational constraints. Prompting-based approaches can be brittle in this setting, exhibiting identity drift and limited ability to leverage increasingly detailed persona descriptions. To address these limitations, we introduce the Large Behavioral Model (LBM), a behavioral foundation model fine-tuned to predict individual strategic choices with high fidelity. LBM shifts from transient persona prompting to behavioral embedding by conditioning on a structured, high-dimensional trait profile derived from a comprehensive psychometric battery. Trained on a proprietary dataset linking stable dispositions, motivational states, and situational constraints to observed choices, LBM learns to map rich psychological profiles to discrete actions across diverse strategic dilemmas. In a held-out scenario evaluation, LBM fine-tuning improves behavioral prediction relative to the unadapted Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct backbone and performs comparably to frontier baselines when conditioned on Big Five traits. Moreover, we find that while prompting-based baselines exhibit a complexity ceiling, LBM continues to benefit from increasingly dense trait profiles, with performance improving as additional trait dimensions are provided. Together, these results establish LBM as a scalable approach for high-fidelity behavioral simulation, enabling applications in strategic foresight, negotiation analysis, cognitive security, and decision support."

We propose a framework for constructing symbolic causal world models entirely online by integrating continuous model learning and repair into the agent's decision loop, by leveraging the power of Meta-Interpretive Learning and predicate invention to find semantically meaningful and reusable abstractions, allowing an agent to construct a hierarchy of disentangled, high-quality concepts from its observations. We demonstrate that our lifted inference approach scales to domains with complex relational dynamics, where propositional methods suffer from combinatorial explosion, while achieving sample-efficiency orders of magnitude higher than the established PPO neural-network-based baseline."

Two CLS ensembles, X252 and X253, with pion mass $M_π\\approx 280$ MeV, are used, and an operator set comprised of two- and three-hadron and tetraquark operators is employed to extract finite-volume energies. Additional inputs are required for the three-body finite-volume analysis, in the form of amplitudes for the $I=1$ $DD$ and $I=1/2$ $Dπ$ two-body subsystems.

    "abstract": "Since its introduction in the early 90s, the web has become the largest application platform available globally. HyperText Markup Language (HTML) has been an essential part of the web since the beginning, as it allows defining webpages in a tree-like manner, including semantics and content. Although the web was never meant to be an application platform, it evolved as such, especially since the early 2000s, as web application frameworks became available. While the emergence of frameworks made it easier than ever to develop complex applications, it also put HTML on the back burner. As web standards caught up, especially with milestones such as HTML5, the gap between the web platform and frameworks was reduced. HTML First development emphasizes this shift and puts focus on literally using HTML first when possible, while encouraging minimalism familiar from the early days of the web. It seems HTML-oriented web development can provide clear benefits to developers, especially when it is combined with comple- mentary approaches, such as embracing hypermedia and moving a large part of application logic to the server side. In the context of the htmx project, it was observed that moving towards HTML can reduce the size of a codebase greatly while leading to maintenance and development benefits due to the increased conceptual simplicity. Holotype-based comparisons for content-oriented websites show performance benefits, and the same observation was confirmed by a small case study where the Yle website was converted to follow HTML First principles. In short, the HTML First approach seems to have clear advantages for web developers, while there are open questions related to the magnitude of the benefits and the alignment with the recent trend of AI-driven web development."

As a result, its interaction with a matter particle, such as the nucleon or a heavy-light meson, such as the $D$ meson, is completely determined by chiral dynamics and much stronger than its pion cousin. The strong attractive interaction has brought us many surprises and is manifested in the peculiar nature of many particles, such as the mysterious $Λ(1405)$ and $D_{s0}^*(2317)$. These two particles can be understood as $\\bar{K}N$ and $DK$ hadronic molecules, respectively. They also imply the existence of three-body hadronic molecules that await future discovery.

Our work is inspired by Talagrand's convolution conjecture in the discrete cube setting, as well as by subsequent developments on the classical Ornstein--Uhlenbeck semigroup. The estimates we provide exhibit a clear dependence on the potential and the Lévy measure defining the kinetic term operator, and they yield a description of the semigroups' action on $L^1$ in terms of Orlicz spaces. Our framework is quite general, encompassing fractional and relativistic Laplacians as kinetic operators. The results are illustrated by numerous examples demonstrating that the $L^1$-regularizing effects become stronger as $t \\uparrow \\infty$."

Using a Wilsonian renormalization group approach controlled by a large-$N$ expansion with $N$ as the number of Weyl fermion flavors and a gauge-consistent regularization fixed by the Ward-Takahashi identity, we uncover for $n\\ge 2$ an extended interaction-dominated scaling regime with intrinsically anisotropic dynamic Coulomb screening, a finite fermionic anomalous dimension, and a power-law suppression of the quasiparticle residue, yielding an \\emph{anisotropic} marginal non-Fermi liquid at intermediate energies. Ultimately, the effective fine structure constant flows to zero, albeit only logarithmically slowly, so the marginal Fermi liquid phenomenology emerges as a broad crossover, controlled by a slowly running coupling. By contrast, for $n=1$ the system retains an isotropic marginal Weyl-liquid character. These predictions can be tested via scaling in thermodynamics (specific heat and compressibility), direction-dependent optical conductivity, and by anisotropic broadening of the single-particle spectral function in angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy."

Extending such capabilities to the remote sensing domain remains challenging, as models must reason over spatial scale, geographic structures, and multispectral indices while maintaining coherent multi-step logic. To bridge this gap, OpenEarthAgent introduces a unified framework for developing tool-augmented geospatial agents trained on satellite imagery, natural-language queries, and detailed reasoning traces. The training pipeline relies on supervised fine-tuning over structured reasoning trajectories, aligning the model with verified multistep tool interactions across diverse analytical contexts. The accompanying corpus comprises 14,538 training and 1,169 evaluation instances, with more than 100K reasoning steps in the training split and over 7K reasoning steps in the evaluation split. It spans urban, environmental, disaster, and infrastructure domains, and incorporates GIS-based operations alongside index analyses such as NDVI, NBR, and NDBI. Grounded in explicit reasoning traces, the learned agent demonstrates structured reasoning, stable spatial understanding, and interpretable behaviour through tool-driven geospatial interactions across diverse conditions. We report consistent improvements over a strong baseline and competitive performance relative to recent open and closed-source models."

    "abstract": "Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) promise to ground language instructions in robot control, yet in practice often fail to faithfully follow language. When presented with instructions that lack strong scene-specific supervision, VLAs suffer from counterfactual failures: they act based on vision shortcuts induced by dataset biases, repeatedly executing well-learned behaviors and selecting objects frequently seen during training regardless of language intent. To systematically study it, we introduce LIBERO-CF, the first counterfactual benchmark for VLAs that evaluates language following capability by assigning alternative instructions under visually plausible LIBERO layouts. Our evaluation reveals that counterfactual failures are prevalent yet underexplored across state-of-the-art VLAs. We propose Counterfactual Action Guidance (CAG), a simple yet effective dual-branch inference scheme that explicitly regularizes language conditioning in VLAs. CAG combines a standard VLA policy with a language-unconditioned Vision-Action (VA) module, enabling counterfactual comparison during action selection. This design reduces reliance on visual shortcuts, improves robustness on under-observed tasks, and requires neither additional demonstrations nor modifications to existing architectures or pretrained models. Extensive experiments demonstrate its plug-and-play integration across diverse VLAs and consistent improvements. For example, on LIBERO-CF, CAG improves $π_{0.5}$ by 9.7% in language following accuracy and 3.6% in task success on under-observed tasks using a training-free strategy, with further gains of 15.5% and 8.5%, respectively, when paired with a VA model. In real-world evaluations, CAG reduces counterfactual failures of 9.4% and improves task success by 17.2% on average."

In short, we learn language-conditional unigram distributions over a shared tokenizer vocabulary but treat segmentation as a language-specific phenomenon. Our formulation is data- and compute-efficient, supports incremental addition of new languages without retraining existing models, and can naturally be integrated into existing language model tokenization pipelines. Empirical evaluations against widely used baselines, including fastText, GlotLID, and CLD3, show that UniLID achieves competitive performance on standard benchmarks, substantially improves sample efficiency in low-resource settings - surpassing 70% accuracy with as few as five labeled samples per language - and delivers large gains on fine-grained dialect identification."

Large scale e-commerce search demands embeddings that generalize to long tail, noisy queries while adhering to scalable supervision compatible with product and policy constraints. A practical challenge is that relevance is often graded: users accept substitutes or complements beyond exact matches, and production systems benefit from clear separation of similarity scores across these relevance strata for stable hybrid blending and thresholding. To obtain scalable policy consistent supervision, we fine-tune a lightweight LLM on human annotations under a three-level relevance guideline and further reduce residual noise via engagement driven auditing. In Stage 1, we train a multilingual Siamese two-tower retriever with a label aware supervised contrastive objective that shapes a robust global semantic space. In Stage 2, we mine hard samples via ANN and re-annotate them with the policy aligned LLM, and introduce a multi-class extension of circle loss that explicitly sharpens similarity boundaries between relevance levels, to further refine and enrich the embedding space. Robustness is additionally improved through additive spelling augmentation and synthetic query generation. Extensive offline evaluations and production A/B tests show that our framework improves retrieval relevance and delivers statistically significant gains in engagement and business impact."

We first show that if no line contains more than three points, then for all sufficiently large $n$ there are at least $n^{2}/24 - O(1)$ monochromatic lines.

We also settle the smallest nontrivial case of a conjecture of Milićević (2018) by showing that if we have $5$ blue points with no three collinear and $5$ red points, if the blue points lie on a conic and every line through two blue points contains a red point, then all $10$ points lie on a cubic curve. Further, we analyze the random setting and show that, for any non-collinear set of $n\\ge 10$ points independently colored red or blue, the expected number of monochromatic lines is minimized by the \\emph{near-pencil} configuration.

To validate the electronic coupling between adsorbed hydrogen and the metal surface, we compute the projected density of states, electronic tunnelling lifetimes, and vibrational lifetimes from the constructed Newns-Anderson Hamiltonians and find good agreement with reference calculations.

Insofar as scaling has been a critical driver of performance of foundation models in other modalities such as language and vision, much recent work on time series foundation modeling has focused on scaling. This has resulted in time series foundation models with hundreds of millions of parameters that are, while performant, inefficient and expensive to use in practice. This paper describes a simple recipe for learning efficient foundation models for zero-shot time series forecasting that are orders of magnitude smaller. We show that large-scale transformers are not necessary: small hybrid models that interleave long convolution and linear RNN layers (in particular DeltaNet layers) can match the performance of larger transformer-based models while being more than a hundred times smaller. We also describe several data augmentation and inference strategies that further improve performance. This recipe results in Reverso, a family of efficient time series foundation models for zero-shot forecasting that significantly push the performance-efficiency Pareto frontier."

In the far-field (Fraunhofer) regime, optical propagation reduces to a Fourier transform, such that each hologram pixel contributes to the entire reconstructed intensity distribution. When restricted to phase-only modulation, intensity must be shaped through global phase interference effects, making the inverse mapping from target intensity to phase highly non-linear and sensitive to local minima. We present a proof-of-concept physics-in-the-loop approach in which a transformer maps a target intensity image to a phase-only SLM field and is trained end-to-end through exact FFT-based propagation embedded directly within optimization. We further observe that patch tokenization strongly shapes the optimization geometry: coarse tokenization acts as an implicit spectral regularizer that stabilizes training and suppresses checkerboard-like attractors, while finer tokenization increases spatial degrees of freedom but benefits from curriculum or hierarchical refinement. Despite training on limited primitives and restricted digit subsets, the learned generator exhibits out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization to unseen digits and hand-drawn target patterns. These results suggest that transformer architectures, whose self-attention enables global token interactions, are a natural fit for far-field holography and provide a viable foundation for scalable physics-grounded hologram generation."

    "abstract": "While emerging Persian NLP benchmarks have expanded into pragmatics and politeness, they rarely distinguish between memorized cultural facts and the ability to reason about implicit social norms. We introduce DivanBench, a diagnostic benchmark focused on superstitions and customs, arbitrary, context-dependent rules that resist simple logical deduction. Through 315 questions across three task types (factual retrieval, paired scenario verification, and situational reasoning), we evaluate seven Persian LLMs and reveal three critical failures: most models exhibit severe acquiescence bias, correctly identifying appropriate behaviors but failing to reject clear violations; continuous Persian pretraining amplifies this bias rather than improving reasoning, often degrading the model's ability to discern contradictions; and all models show a 21\\% performance gap between retrieving factual knowledge and applying it in scenarios. These findings demonstrate that cultural competence requires more than scaling monolingual data, as current models learn to mimic cultural patterns without internalizing the underlying schemas."

    "abstract": "Emerging IoT applications are transitioning from battery-powered to grid-powered nodes. DRP, a contention-based data dissemination protocol, was developed for these applications. Traditional contention-based protocols resolve collisions through control packet exchanges, significantly reducing goodput. DRP mitigates this issue by employing a distributed delay timer mechanism that assigns transmission-start delays based on the average link quality between a sender and its children, prioritizing highly connected nodes for early transmission. However, our in-field experiments reveal that DRP is unable to accommodate real-world link quality fluctuations, leading to overlapping transmissions from multiple senders. This overlap triggers CSMA's random back-off delays, ultimately degrading the goodput performance. To address these shortcomings, we first conduct a theoretical analysis that characterizes the design requirements induced by real-world link quality fluctuations and DRP's passive acknowledgments. Guided by this analysis, we design EDRP, which integrates two novel components: (i) Link-Quality Aware CSMA (LQ-CSMA) and (ii) a Machine Learning-based Block Size Selection (ML-BSS) algorithm for rateless codes. LQ-CSMA dynamically restricts the back-off delay range based on real-time link quality estimates, ensuring that nodes with stronger connectivity experience shorter delays. ML-BSS algorithm predicts future link quality conditions and optimally adjusts the block size for rateless coding, reducing overhead and enhancing goodput. In-field evaluations of EDRP demonstrate an average goodput improvement of 39.43\\% than the competing protocols."

    "abstract": "While ground-state preparation is expected to be a primary application of quantum computers, it is also an essential subroutine for many fault-tolerant algorithms. In early fault-tolerant regimes, logical measurements remain costly, motivating adaptive, shot-frugal state-preparation strategies that efficiently utilize each measurement. We introduce the Shadow Enhanced Greedy Quantum Eigensolver (SEGQE) as a greedy, shadow-assisted framework for measurement-efficient ground-state preparation. SEGQE uses classical shadows to evaluate, in parallel and entirely in classical post-processing, the energy reduction induced by large collections of local candidate gates, greedily selecting at each step the gate with the largest estimated energy decrease. We derive rigorous worst-case per-iteration sample-complexity bounds for SEGQE, exhibiting logarithmic dependence on the number of candidate gates. Numerical benchmarks on finite transverse-field Ising models and ensembles of random local Hamiltonians demonstrate convergence in a number of iterations that scales approximately linearly with system size, while maintaining high-fidelity ground-state approximations and competitive energy estimates. Together, our empirical scaling laws and rigorous per-iteration guarantees establish SEGQE as a measurement-efficient state-preparation primitive well suited to early fault-tolerant quantum computing architectures."

Whilst POSIX distributed file systems and NVMe SSDs are currently a common HPC storage configuration providing I/O to applications, new storage solutions have proliferated or gained traction over the last decade with potential to address performance limitations POSIX file systems manifest at scale for certain I/O workloads. This work has primarily aimed to assess the suitability and performance of two object storage systems -namely DAOS and Ceph- for the ECMWF's operational NWP as well as for HPC and AI applications in general. New software-level adapters have been developed which enable the ECMWF's NWP to leverage these systems, and extensive I/O benchmarking has been conducted on a few computer systems, comparing the performance delivered by the evaluated object stores to that of equivalent Lustre file system deployments on the same hardware. Challenges of porting to object storage and its benefits with respect to the traditional POSIX I/O approach have been discussed and, where possible, domain-agnostic performance analysis has been conducted, leading to insight also of relevance to I/O practitioners and the broader HPC community. DAOS and Ceph have both demonstrated excellent performance, but DAOS stood out relative to Ceph and Lustre, providing superior scalability and flexibility for applications to perform I/O at scale as desired. This sets a promising outlook for DAOS and object storage, which might see greater adoption at HPC centres in the years to come, although not necessarily implying a shift away from POSIX-like I/O."

Yet, sparse and biased geospatial ground truth limits the applicability of existing learning-based methods, such as reinforcement learning. To address this, we propose a unified geospatial discovery framework that integrates active learning, online meta-learning, and concept-guided reasoning. Our approach introduces two key innovations built on a shared notion of *concept relevance*, which captures how domain-specific factors influence target presence: a *concept-weighted uncertainty sampling strategy*, where uncertainty is modulated by learned relevance based on readily-available domain-specific concepts (e.g., land cover, source proximity); and a *relevance-aware meta-batch formation strategy* that promotes semantic diversity during online-meta updates, improving generalization in dynamic environments. Our experiments include testing on a real-world dataset of cancer-causing PFAS (Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) contamination, showcasing our method's reliability at uncovering targets with limited data and a varying environment."

In this work, we introduce MolHIT, a powerful molecular graph generation framework that overcomes long-standing performance limitations in existing methods. MolHIT is based on the Hierarchical Discrete Diffusion Model, which generalizes discrete diffusion to additional categories that encode chemical priors, and decoupled atom encoding that splits the atom types according to their chemical roles. Overall, MolHIT achieves new state-of-the-art performance on the MOSES dataset with near-perfect validity for the first time in graph diffusion, surpassing strong 1D baselines across multiple metrics. We further demonstrate strong performance in downstream tasks, including multi-property guided generation and scaffold extension."

This work presents a framework that integrates Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based dynamics models with structure-exploiting Model Predictive Control to enable real-time control of high-dimensional systems. By representing the system as a graph with localized interactions, the GNN preserves sparsity, while a tailored condensing algorithm eliminates state variables from the control problem, ensuring efficient computation. The complexity of our condensing algorithm scales linearly with the number of system nodes, and leverages Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) parallelization to achieve real-time performance. The proposed approach is validated in simulation and experimentally on a physical soft robotic trunk. Results show that our method scales to systems with up to 1,000 nodes at 100 Hz in closed-loop, and demonstrates real-time reference tracking on hardware with sub-centimeter accuracy, outperforming baselines by 63.6%. Finally, we show the capability of our method to achieve effective full-body obstacle avoidance."

Empirically, on a synthetic Moons dataset and on the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset, we measure pairwise energy gaps via Dynamic String Sampling (DSS) and find that wider networks exhibit smaller gaps; in particular, a permutation test on the maximum gap yields $p_{perm}=0$, indicating a clear reduction in the barrier height."

    "abstract": "The simple harmonic oscillator has a well-known normalizable, positive energy, bound state spectrum. We show that degenerate with each such positive energy eigenvalue there is a non-normalizable positive energy eigenstate whose eigenfunction is orthogonal to that of the standard energy eigenfunction. This class of states is not built on the vacuum that $a$ annihilates, but is instead built on the vacuum that $a^{\\dagger} a$ annihilates. These non-normalizable but nonetheless stationary energy eigenstates are accompanied by yet another set of non-normalizable states, states whose wave functions however are not stationary but instead grow linearly in time. With these states not being energy eigenstates, the eigenbasis of the Hamiltonian is incomplete; with the full Hilbert space containing states that are not energy eigenstates. Thus each energy eigenvalue of the harmonic oscillator is an exceptional point at which the Hamiltonian becomes of non-diagonalizable, and thus manifestly non-Hermitian, Jordan-block form. Such non-Hermitian structures occur for Hamiltonians that have an antilinear $PT$ symmetry. As is characteristic of such systems, one can construct a probability conserving inner product that despite the linear in time growth is nonetheless time independent, and not only that, it leads to states with zero norm. In addition, as is again characteristic of $PT$ symmetry, these non-normalizable states can be made normalizable by a continuation into a so-called Stokes wedge domain in the complex plane. In this domain one has a completely consistent quantum theory, one that lives alongside the standard normalizable energy eigenspectrum sector. This thus not quite so simple harmonic oscillator provides an explicit realization of our general contention that antilinearity is more basic to quantum theory than Hermiticity."

In the ultralight regime, the enormous occupation number of the dark matter field motivates a classical description in terms of a coherently oscillating background, leading to distinctive, time-dependent signatures in laboratory observables. We discuss the effective field theory framework governing ALP interactions with Standard Model fields, and show how different operators give rise to qualitatively different experimental signals. The lecture notes cover both conversion-based searches enabled by the axion-photon coupling, such as haloscopes and helioscopes, and precision experiments sensitive to oscillations of fundamental constants and material properties. These include atomic and nuclear clocks, optical cavities, laser and unequal time-delay interferometers, and mechanical or solid state resonators. Emphasis is placed on the physical origin of the sensitivity of each platform, the role of coherence, bandwidth, and noise, and the complementarity between different technologies across a wide range of ALP masses. Together, these approaches provide broad and overlapping coverage of ultralight dark matter parameter space and define a rapidly evolving experimental programme with strong discovery potential."

The full RMM encodes detailed pairwise correlations among jets, b-jets, leptons, photons, and missing transverse energy but contains more than a thousand values per event, making it computationally heavy for large-scale training and incompatible with current low-qubit quantum devices. The proposed RMM-C46 input space for ML preserves the physical block structure of the RMM through aggregated invariant mass, rapidity difference, and transverse energy components, reducing the size of the original RMM by over an order of magnitude while maintaining interpretability. Applied to simulated proton-proton collisions at centre-of-mass energy of 13.6 TeV, these representations match or exceed the discriminative performance of the full RMM in both supervised and unsupervised ML tasks. Their compactness, stability, and physics transparency also make them naturally compatible with near-term quantum machine learning architectures. RMM-C46 provides a scalable, efficient, and quantum-ready alternative to the full RMM for next-generation collider physics analyses."

However, current methods suffer from two key limitations: \\textit{(i)} the lack of a unified theoretical framework for guiding the design of steering directions, and \\textit{(ii)} an over-reliance on \\textit{one-step steering} that fail to capture complex patterns of activation distributions. In this work, we propose a unified ordinary differential equations (ODEs)-based \\textit{theoretical} framework for activation steering in LLM alignment. We show that conventional activation addition can be interpreted as a first-order approximation to the solution of an ODE. Based on this ODE perspective, identifying a steering direction becomes equivalent to designing a \\textit{barrier function} from control theory. Derived from this framework, we introduce ODESteer, a kind of ODE-based steering guided by barrier functions, which shows \\textit{empirical} advancement in LLM alignment. ODESteer identifies steering directions by defining the barrier function as the log-density ratio between positive and negative activations, and employs it to construct an ODE for \\textit{multi-step and adaptive} steering. Compared to state-of-the-art activation steering methods, ODESteer achieves consistent empirical improvements on diverse LLM alignment benchmarks, a notable $5.7\\%$ improvement over TruthfulQA, $2.5\\%$ over UltraFeedback, and $2.4\\%$ over RealToxicityPrompts.

The effects of this cyclic flow pattern on the spatial distribution of molecules in the brain are modeled in this paper. The effects of oscillatory flow on the dispersion or volumetric transmission of a molecule that is advected by this flow is modeled by a mechanism hitherto neglected in the literature. An oscillatory random walk model is used to estimate the spread or effective diffusivity due to the oscillatory advection. Then, respiration effects are also estimated and the additional dispersion of molecules due to this are calculated in our model. Our model indicates that the observed oscillatory flow in the interstitial spaces due to cardiac as well as respiratory pulsatility can induce an effective diffusivity when the spread of the molecule is observed over times long compared with a cycle of the oscillation. This would help explain the high-volume transmission within the interstitium or brain parenchyma found in MRI measurements of a marker infused into the cerebrospinal fluid in human subjects that is well above what would be expected. Interstitial spaces should be viewed as a region of dynamic oscillatory flow driven by cardiac and respiratory cycles. This oscillatory flow could result in a significant dispersion of molecules and explain the higher-than-expected effective diffusion suggested in human studies. It may be possible to augment or slow this flow and concomitant spread by applying external forces."

To bridge these gaps, we propose Mass-Adaptive Soft Policy Optimization (MASPO), a unified framework designed to harmonize these three dimensions. MASPO integrates a differentiable soft Gaussian gating to maximize gradient utility, a mass-adaptive limiter to balance exploration across the probability spectrum, and an asymmetric risk controller to align update magnitudes with signal confidence. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that MASPO serves as a robust, all-in-one RLVR solution, significantly outperforming strong baselines.

To estimate safety risk at training time, we explore two distinct approaches: a judge-based Safety Critic that assigns high-level harm scores to training batches, and an activation-based risk predictor built with a lightweight classifier trained on intermediate model activations to estimate harmful intent. Each approach provides a risk signal that is used to constrain updates deemed higher risk to remain close to a safe reference policy, while lower-risk updates proceed with standard training. We empirically verify that harmful intent signals are predictable from pre-generation activations and that judge scores provide effective high-recall safety guidance. Across multiple model families and attack scenarios, adaptive regularization with either risk estimation approach consistently lowers attack success rate compared to standard fine-tuning, preserves downstream performance, and adds no inference-time cost. This work demonstrates a principled mechanism for maintaining safety without sacrificing utility."

    "abstract": "Efficient estimation of causal and structural parameters can be automated using the Riesz representation theorem and debiased machine learning (DML). We present genriesz, an open-source Python package that implements automatic DML and generalized Riesz regression, a unified framework for estimating Riesz representers by minimizing empirical Bregman divergences. This framework includes covariate balancing, nearest-neighbor matching, calibrated estimation, and density ratio estimation as special cases. A key design principle of the package is automatic regressor balancing (ARB): given a Bregman generator $g$ and a representer model class, genriesz} automatically constructs a compatible link function so that the generalized Riesz regression estimator satisfies balancing (moment-matching) optimality conditions in a user-chosen basis. The package provides a modulr interface for specifying (i) the target linear functional via a black-box evaluation oracle, (ii) the representer model via basis functions (polynomial, RKHS approximations, random forest leaf encodings, neural embeddings, and a nearest-neighbor catchment basis), and (iii) the Bregman generator, with optional user-supplied derivatives. It returns regression adjustment (RA), Riesz weighting (RW), augmented Riesz weighting (ARW), and TMLE-style estimators with cross-fitting, confidence intervals, and $p$-values. We highlight representative workflows for estimation problems such as the average treatment effect (ATE), ATE on treated (ATT), and average marginal effect estimation.

A key feature of polyatomic molecules is the presence of parity-doublet states. These structures, which generically arise from the rotational and vibrational degrees of freedom afforded by polyatomic molecules, are a powerful feature to pursue these diverse quantum science applications. Linear triatomic molecules contain $\\ell$-type parity doublet states, which are predicted to exhibit robust coherence properties. We optically trap CaOH molecules, prepare them in $\\ell$-type parity-doublet states, and realize a bare qubit coherence time of $T_2^* = 0.8(2)$ s. We suppress differential Stark shifts by employing molecular spectroscopy to cancel ambient electric fields, and characterize parity-dependent trap shifts, which are found to limit the coherence time. The parity-doublet coherence times achieved in this work are a defining milestone for the use of polyatomic molecules in quantum science."

    "abstract": "Despite significant progress in post-hoc explanation methods for neural networks, many remain heuristic and lack provable guarantees. A key approach for obtaining explanations with provable guarantees is by identifying a cardinally-minimal subset of input features which by itself is provably sufficient to determine the prediction. However, for standard neural networks, this task is often computationally infeasible, as it demands a worst-case exponential number of verification queries in the number of input features, each of which is NP-hard. In this work, we show that for Neural Additive Models (NAMs), a recent and more interpretable neural network family, we can efficiently generate explanations with such guarantees. We present a new model-specific algorithm for NAMs that generates provably cardinally-minimal explanations using only a logarithmic number of verification queries in the number of input features, after a parallelized preprocessing step with logarithmic runtime in the required precision is applied to each small univariate NAM component. Our algorithm not only makes the task of obtaining cardinally-minimal explanations feasible, but even outperforms existing algorithms designed to find the relaxed variant of subset-minimal explanations - which may be larger and less informative but easier to compute - despite our algorithm solving a much more difficult task. Our experiments demonstrate that, compared to previous algorithms, our approach provides provably smaller explanations than existing works and substantially reduces the computation time. Moreover, we show that our generated provable explanations offer benefits that are unattainable by standard sampling-based techniques typically used to interpret NAMs."

Integrating environmental semantic awareness enables estimation of potential risks posed by suddenly moving obstacles. In this paper, we propose RA- Nav, a risk-aware navigation framework based on semantic segmentation. A lightweight multi-scale semantic segmentation network identifies obstacle categories in real time. These obstacles are further classified into three types: stationary, temporarily static, and dynamic. For each type, corresponding risk estimation functions are designed to enable real-time risk prediction, based on which a complete local risk map is constructed. Based on this map, the risk-informed path search algorithm is designed to guarantee planning that balances path efficiency and safety. Trajectory optimization is then applied to generate trajectories that are safe, smooth, and dynamically feasible. Comparative simulations demonstrate that RA-Nav achieves higher success rates than baselines in sudden obstacle state transition scenarios. Its effectiveness is further validated in simulations using real- world data."

Motivated by this behavior, we propose a source-compensated, history-dependent helicity density that satisfies an exact local balance identity by construction, enabling Saffman-type two-point correlation integrals which, under standard flux-decorrelation assumptions, can exhibit intermediate-scale plateaus that are roughly time-independent. In our simulations we demonstrate such plateaus to remain approximately invariant even as the usual Saffman helicity integral plateau value $I_H$ evolves during the early kinetic stage. Under approximate single-scale self-similarity, the plateau behavior of the magnetic integral is consistent with the 2D decay constraint $BL \\sim \\text{const}$. For initially net-helical configurations, we observe rapid development of mixed-signed magnetic helicity patches and a decrease of the global fractional helicity, such that the decay over the kinetic interval is again most consistent with the cancellation-dominated scaling constraint."

In this paper, we advance clinical section segmentation through three key contributions. First, we curate a new de-identified, section-labeled obstetrics notes dataset, to supplement the medical domains covered in public corpora such as MIMIC-III, on which most existing segmentation approaches are trained. Second, we systematically evaluate transformer-based supervised models for section segmentation on a curated subset of MIMIC-III (in-domain), and on the new obstetrics dataset (out-of-domain). Third, we conduct the first head-to-head comparison of supervised models for medical section segmentation with zero-shot large language models. Our results show that while supervised models perform strongly in-domain, their performance drops substantially out-of-domain. In contrast, zero-shot models demonstrate robust out-of-domain adaptability once hallucinated section headers are corrected. These findings underscore the importance of developing domain-specific clinical resources and highlight zero-shot segmentation as a promising direction for applying healthcare NLP beyond well-studied corpora, as long as hallucinations are appropriately managed."

Furthermore, the SI schemes so designed do not require the severe time-step restrictions typically encountered when using explicit methods for stability, i.e., $Δt = \\mathcal{O}(Δx^k)$ for the $k$-th order PDEs with $k\\ge 2$. For space discrertization, this strategy is combined with finite difference schemes. We provide example of methods up to order $p = 4$, and we illustrate the effectiveness of the schemes with appllications to dissipative, dispersive, and biharmonic-type equations. Numerical experiments show that the proposed schemes are stable and achieve the expected orders of accuracy."

    "abstract": "Many unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can remain aerodynamically flyable after sustaining structural or control surface damage, yet insufficient robustness in conventional autopilots often leads to mission failure. This paper proposes a robust adaptive sliding mode controller (RASMC) for fixed-wing UAVs subject to aerodynamic coefficient perturbations and partial loss of control surface effectiveness. A damage-aware flight dynamics model is developed to systematically analyze the impact of such impairments on the closed-loop behavior. The RASMC is designed to ensure reliable tracking and stabilization, while a gain adaptation law maintains low control effort under nominal conditions and increases the gains as needed in the presence of aerodynamic damage. Lyapunov-based stability guarantees are derived, and assumptions on admissible uncertainty bounds are formulated to characterize the limits within which closed-loop stability and performance can be ensured. The proposed controller is implemented within an existing UAV autopilot framework, where outer-loop guidance and speed control modules provide reference commands to the RASMC for attitude stabilization. Simulations demonstrate that, despite significant aerodynamic damage and control surface degradation, all closed-loop states remain stable with bounded tracking errors."

    "abstract": "Detecting brief changes in time-series data remains a major challenge in fields where short-lived states carry meaning. In single-molecule localisation microscopy, this problem is particularly acute as fluorescent molecules used to tag protein oligomers display heterogenous photophysical behaviour that can complicate photobleach step analysis; a key step in resolving nanoscale protein organisation. Existing methods often require extensive filtering or prior calibration, and can fail to accurately account for blinking or reversible dark states that may contaminate downstream analysis. In this paper, an extension to RJMCMC is proposed for change point detection with heterogeneous temporal dynamics. This approach is applied to the problem of estimating per-frame active fluorophore counts from one-dimensional integrated intensity traces derived from Fluorescence Localisation Imaging with Photobleaching (FLImP), where compound change point pair moves are introduced to better account for short-lived events known as blinking and dark states. The approach is validated using simulated and experimental data, demonstrating improved accuracy and robustness when compared with current photobleach step analysis methods and with the existing analysis approach for FLImP data. This Compound RJMCMC (CRJMCMC) algorithm performs reliably across a wide range of fluorophore counts and signal-to-noise conditions, with signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) down to 0.001 and counts as high as seventeen fluorophores, while also effectively estimating low counts observed when studying EGFR oligomerisation. Beyond single molecule imaging, this work has applications for a variety of time series change point detection problems with heterogeneous state persistence. For example, electrocorticography brain-state segmentation, fault detection in industrial process monitoring and realised volatility in financial time series."

    "abstract": "Lower limb amputation affects millions worldwide, leading to impaired mobility, reduced walking speed, and limited participation in daily and social activities. Powered prosthetic knees can partially restore mobility by actively assisting knee joint torque, improving gait symmetry, sit-to-stand transitions, and walking speed. However, added mass from powered components may diminish these benefits, negatively affecting gait mechanics and increasing metabolic cost. Consequently, optimizing mass distribution, rather than simply minimizing total mass, may provide a more effective and practical solution. In this exploratory study, we evaluated the feasibility of above-knee powertrain placement for a powered prosthetic knee in a small cohort. Compared to below-knee placement, the above-knee configuration demonstrated improved walking speed (+9.2% for one participant) and cadence (+3.6%), with mixed effects on gait symmetry. Kinematic measures indicated similar knee range of motion and peak velocity across configurations. Additional testing on ramps and stairs confirmed the robustness of the control strategy across multiple locomotion tasks. These preliminary findings suggest that above-knee placement is functionally feasible and that careful mass distribution can preserve the benefits of powered assistance while mitigating adverse effects of added weight. Further studies are needed to confirm these trends and guide design and clinical recommendations."

Such an analysis is elementary at $N\\leq 3$ and numerical at $N\\geq 5$, so we pick up $N=4$.

The analyzed system is half-metallic with a ferrimagnetic order, presenting a zero net total magnetic moment per unit cell. We combine density functional theory calculations with a Hubbard model Hamiltonian to compute the magnetic interactions, the bands, the intrinsic Anomalous Hall effect, and the collective spin excitations. We obtain very large intermolecular exchange couplings, in the range of 50 meV, which ensures room temperature stability. When the magnetization is off-plane, intrinsic spin orbit coupling in graphene opens up a topological gap that, despite being very small, leads to a quantized Hall conductance in the tens of mK range. Above 1 Kelvin, the system will behave like a half-metal with fully compensated magnetic moments, thereby combining two characteristics that make it ideal for spintronics applications."

They are known to severely degrade performance, and the convergence rate under delayed feedback is still unclear, even for bilinear games. This paper derives the rate of linear convergence of Weighted Optimistic Gradient Descent-Ascent (WOGDA), which predicts future rewards with extra optimism, in unconstrained bilinear games. To analyze the algorithm, we interpret it as an approximation of the Extra Proximal Point (EPP), which is updated based on farther future rewards than the classical Proximal Point (PP). Our theorems show that standard optimism (predicting the next-step reward) achieves linear convergence to the equilibrium at a rate $\\exp(-Θ(t/m^{5}))$ after $t$ iterations for delay $m$. Moreover, employing extra optimism (predicting farther future reward) tolerates a larger step size and significantly accelerates the rate to $\\exp(-Θ(t/(m^{2}\\log m)))$. Our experiments also show accelerated convergence driven by the extra optimism and are qualitatively consistent with our theorems. In summary, this paper validates that extra optimism is a promising countermeasure against performance degradation caused by feedback delays."

To address these limitations, this paper presents a cost-effective hardware solution for rainy conditions, designed to be compatible with multiple cameras simultaneously. Beyond its technical contribution, the proposed solution supports sustainability goals in transportation systems. By enabling compatibility with existing camera-based sensing platforms, the system extends the operational reliability of automated vehicles without requiring additional high-cost sensors or hardware replacements. This approach reduces resource consumption, supports modular upgrades, and promotes more cost-efficient deployment of automated vehicle technologies, particularly in challenging weather conditions where system failures would otherwise lead to inefficiencies and increased emissions.

In this window, skin modes and extended states are both stable at a fixed energy $E$, separated by a nonlinear basin separatrix in phase space rather than a spectral (mobility-edge) mechanism in a linear system. An averaged amplitude equation yields closed-form predictions for the limit-cycle branches and the SNLC threshold. Building on the basin geometry, we introduce a basin-fraction order parameter that exhibits a first-order-like jump at SNLC. Intriguing physical phenomena in the coexistence window are also revealed, such as separatrix-induced long-lived spatial transients and hysteresis. Overall, our findings highlight that, beyond linear spectral concepts, global attractor-basin geometry provides a powerful and complementary lens for understanding stationary states in nonlinear non-Hermitian systems."

    "abstract": "Preparing high-fidelity logical states is a central challenge in fault-tolerant quantum computing, yet existing approaches struggle to balance control complexity against resource overhead. Here, we present a complete framework for the fault-tolerant preparation of arbitrary logical states encoded in the four-legged cat code. This framework is engineered to suppress the dominant incoherent errors, including excitation decay and dephasing in both the bosonic mode and the ancilla via error detection. Numerical simulations with experimentally realistic parameters on a 3D superconducting cavity platform yield logical infidelities on the order of $10^{-4}$. A scaling analysis confirms that the logical error rate grows nearly quadratically with the physical error rate, confirming that all first-order errors are fully suppressed. Our protocol is compatible with current hardware and is scalable to multiple bosonic modes, providing a resource-efficient foundation for magic state preparation and higher-level concatenated quantum error correction."

We will introduce polycyclic hydrocarbons as the most commonly used emitter systems for the realization of an organic solid-state single-photon source. At cryogenic temperatures this special class of fluorescent molecules demonstrates remarkable optical properties such as negligible dephasing, indefinite photostability, and high photon rates, which make them attractive as fundamental building blocks in emerging quantum technologies. To better understand the general properties and limitations of these molecules, we discuss sample preparation, light collection strategies and relevant emitter parameters such as absorption and emission spectra, lifetime, and dephasing. We will also give an overview of light extraction strategies as a crucial part of a single-photon source. Finally, we conclude with a look into the future, displaying current challenges and possible solutions."

We perform these computation considering both a long-range and a short-range propagator, within the dimensional regularization framework. We find three fixed points in the short-range case and a line of fixed points, parameterized by the wheel interaction, in the long-range case. This line of fixed points is identical to the one found in the case of the $U(N)^3$-invariant model. Our result proves that the additional $O(N)^3$-invariant interactions do not modify the long-range fixed point structure of the model."

    "abstract": "Shifting the point dipole from the center of a Stockmayer particle is a simple geometric modification that has been explored previously, yet its implications for liquid structure, dielectric response, and phase behavior remain incompletely understood. Here, we combine molecular dynamics simulations with analytical theory to provide a unified physical interpretation of how dipole displacement reshapes microscopic correlations and propagates to macroscopic thermodynamic properties. We show that dipole shifting breaks the fore-aft symmetry of the local electrostatic field, producing only modest changes in radial packing but strong alterations in angular structure within the first solvation shell. Enhanced alignment near the dipole head is accompanied by frustrated orientational correlations near the tail, leading to broader angular distributions and a shift away from axial configurations at strong coupling. These structural asymmetries weaken cooperative ordering and result in a systematic reduction of the dielectric constant, despite locally stronger interactions. For large shifts, the dielectric response approaches the Debye limit, indicating effective suppression of dipole-dipole correlations. The same geometric frustration governs vapor-liquid equilibria: while increasing dipole strength raises the critical temperature, even modest shifts disrupt the highly polarized liquid states that emerge at strong coupling and can suppress ferroelectric-like ordering. Predictions from a reparameterized COFFEE theory capture these trends within its domain of validity, highlighting the direct connection between local orientational structure and macroscopic observables. Overall, this work demonstrates that dipole location, not only magnitude, provides a powerful control parameter in dipolar fluids and offers a clear framework for understanding geometric frustration in electrostatic liquids."

Through initializing the battery in either the symmetric or broken symmetry phases of the LMG model we analyze how the different spectral properties can affect the performance of both the charging and discharging of the battery. In particular, we show that by quenching the magnetic field strength from the symmetric phase to the broken phase, we can achieve a significant enhancement in stored energy, as well as stable and efficient ergotropy extraction. Similar observations can be made when introducing weak coupling between the battery with the bosonic bath, while the amount of stored work and ergotropy saturate at strong coupling. These findings emphasize the importance of the magnetic field dynamics and environmental coupling in optimizing charging performance, which could lead to practical applications in quantum energy storage."

We establish a tight non-asymptotic instance-dependent lower bound on the expected stopping time of any valid sequential test under the alternative. Our novel analysis improves the existing lower bounds, which are either asymptotic or provably sub-optimal in this setting. Our lower bound incorporates both the stationary distribution and the transition structure induced by the unknown Markov chain. We further propose an optimal test whose expected stopping time matches this lower bound asymptotically as $α\\to 0$. We illustrate the usefulness of our framework through applications to sequential detection of model misspecification in Markov Chain Monte Carlo and to testing structural properties, such as the linearity of transition dynamics, in Markov decision processes. Our findings yield a sharp and general characterization of optimal sequential testing procedures under Markovian dependence."

    "abstract": "Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) exhibit strong performance, yet often produce rationales that sound plausible but fail to reflect their true decision process, undermining reliability and trust. We introduce a formal framework for reasoning faithfulness, defined by two testable conditions: stance consistency (a coherent stance linking reasoning to answer) and causal influence (the stated reasoning causally drives the answer under output-level interventions), explicitly decoupled from accuracy. To operationalize this, we present RFEval, a benchmark of 7,186 instances across seven tasks that probes faithfulness via controlled, output-level counterfactual interventions. Evaluating twelve open-source LRMs, we find unfaithfulness in 49.7% of outputs, predominantly from stance inconsistency. Failures are concentrated in brittle, convergent domains such as math and code, and correlate more with post-training regimes than with scale: within-family ablations indicate that adding current RL-style objectives on top of supervised fine-tuning can reduce reasoning faithfulness, even when accuracy is maintained. Crucially, accuracy is neither a sufficient nor a reliable proxy for faithfulness: once controlling for model and task, the accuracy-faithfulness link is weak and statistically insignificant. Our work establishes a rigorous methodology for auditing LRM reliability and shows that trustworthy AI requires optimizing not only for correct outcomes but also for the structural integrity of the reasoning process.

By varying the interaction strength of three sets of models for the quark-antiquark interaction, the transition from the chiral symmetric to the chirally broken regime in the vacuum is studied. The simplest type of these models leads to degenerate meson spectra for a large domain of the strength parameter. The more sophisticated and thus more realistic models show significantly smaller parameter domains for which degenerate meson spectra are obtained. The underlying mechanism for obtaining and then lifting degeneracies is traced back to the location of the quark propagators' poles, in particular, whether they are beyond or within the domain of integration in the Bethe-Salpeter equation. In view of this mechanism the potential relation of the obtained degeneracies to the dynamical emergence of symmetries is discussed, adding thereby another point of view on the conjectured chiral spin symmetry of QCD in the temperature domain right above the crossover."

These misperceptions persist even after aggregation and challenge the idea of the \"wisdom of the crowd.\" We derive an estimator that predicts the size and direction of these biases from network features. We validate our findings using three large-scale opinion surveys. Our results show that network structure is a critical factor in collective perception, with major implications for reducing segregation, polarisation, and the marginalisation of minorities."

    "abstract": "Quantum optimization has gained increasing attention as advances in quantum hardware enable the exploration of problem instances approaching real-world scale. Among existing approaches, variational quantum algorithms and quantum annealing dominate current research; however, both typically rely on one-hot encodings that severely limit scalability. Pauli Correlation Encoding (PCE) was recently introduced as an alternative paradigm that reduces qubit requirements by embedding problem variables into Pauli correlations. Despite its promise, PCE has not yet been studied in the context of constrained optimization. In this work, we extend the PCE framework to constrained combinatorial optimization problems and evaluate its performance across multiple problem sizes. Our results show that the standard PCE formulation struggles to reliably enforce constraints, which motivates the introduction of the Iterative-$α$ PCE. This iterative strategy significantly improves solution quality, achieving consistent constraint satisfaction while yielding better cut sizes across a wide range of instances. These findings highlight both the limitations of current PCE formulations for constrained problems and the effectiveness of iterative strategies for advancing quantum optimization in the NISQ era."

    "abstract": "Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to identify novel categories in unlabeled data while leveraging a small labeled subset of known classes. Training a parametric classifier solely on image features often leads to overfitting to old classes, and recent multimodal approaches improve performance by incorporating textual information. However, they treat modalities independently and incur high computational cost. We propose SpectralGCD, an efficient and effective multimodal approach to GCD that uses CLIP cross-modal image-concept similarities as a unified cross-modal representation. Each image is expressed as a mixture over semantic concepts from a large task-agnostic dictionary, which anchors learning to explicit semantics and reduces reliance on spurious visual cues. To maintain the semantic quality of representations learned by an efficient student, we introduce Spectral Filtering which exploits a cross-modal covariance matrix over the softmaxed similarities measured by a strong teacher model to automatically retain only relevant concepts from the dictionary. Forward and reverse knowledge distillation from the same teacher ensures that the cross-modal representations of the student remain both semantically sufficient and well-aligned. Across six benchmarks, SpectralGCD delivers accuracy comparable to or significantly superior to state-of-the-art methods at a fraction of the computational cost.

While prior state-of-the-art transfer-based approaches like M-Attack perform well using local crop-level matching between source and target images, we find this induces high-variance, nearly orthogonal gradients across iterations, violating coherent local alignment and destabilizing optimization. We attribute this to (i) ViT translation sensitivity that yields spike-like gradients and (ii) structural asymmetry between source and target crops. We reformulate local matching as an asymmetric expectation over source transformations and target semantics, and build a gradient-denoising upgrade to M-Attack. On the source side, Multi-Crop Alignment (MCA) averages gradients from multiple independently sampled local views per iteration to reduce variance. On the target side, Auxiliary Target Alignment (ATA) replaces aggressive target augmentation with a small auxiliary set from a semantically correlated distribution, producing a smoother, lower-variance target manifold. We further reinterpret momentum as Patch Momentum, replaying historical crop gradients; combined with a refined patch-size ensemble (PE+), this strengthens transferable directions. Together these modules form M-Attack-V2, a simple, modular enhancement over M-Attack that substantially improves transfer-based black-box attacks on frontier LVLMs: boosting success rates on Claude-4.0 from 8% to 30%, Gemini-2.5-Pro from 83% to 97%, and GPT-5 from 98% to 100%, outperforming prior black-box LVLM attacks.

To address this challenge, we introduce FAMOSE (Feature AugMentation and Optimal Selection agEnt), a novel framework that leverages the ReAct paradigm to autonomously explore, generate, and refine features while integrating feature selection and evaluation tools within an agent architecture. To our knowledge, FAMOSE represents the first application of an agentic ReAct framework to automated feature engineering, especially for both regression and classification tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FAMOSE is at or near the state-of-the-art on classification tasks (especially tasks with more than 10K instances, where ROC-AUC increases 0.23% on average), and achieves the state-of-the-art for regression tasks by reducing RMSE by 2.0% on average, while remaining more robust to errors than other algorithms. We hypothesize that FAMOSE's strong performance is because ReAct allows the LLM context window to record (via iterative feature discovery and evaluation steps) what features did or did not work. This is similar to a few-shot prompt and guides the LLM to invent better, more innovative features. Our work offers evidence that AI agents are remarkably effective in solving problems that require highly inventive solutions, such as feature engineering."

We analyze 28 LLM-based penetration testing systems and evaluate five representative implementations across three benchmarks of increasing complexity. Our analysis reveals two distinct failure modes: Type A failures stem from capability gaps (missing tools, inadequate prompts) that engineering readily addresses, while Type B failures persist regardless of tooling due to planning and state management limitations. We show that Type B failures share a root cause that is largely invariant to the underlying LLM: agents lack real-time task difficulty estimation. As a result, agents misallocate effort, over-commit to low-value branches, and exhaust context before completing attack chains. Based on this insight, we present Excalibur, a penetration testing agent that couples strong tooling with difficulty-aware planning. A Tool and Skill Layer eliminates Type A failures through typed interfaces and retrieval-augmented knowledge. A Task Difficulty Assessment (TDA) mechanism addresses Type B failures by estimating tractability through four measurable dimensions (horizon estimation, evidence confidence, context load, and historical success) and uses these estimates to guide exploration-exploitation decisions within an Evidence-Guided Attack Tree Search (EGATS) framework. Excalibur achieves up to 91% task completion on CTF benchmarks with frontier models (39 to 49% relative improvement over baselines) and compromises 4 of 5 hosts on the GOAD Active Directory environment versus 2 by prior systems. These results show that difficulty-aware planning yields consistent end-to-end gains across models and addresses a limitation that model scaling alone does not eliminate."

    "abstract": "Big data scenarios, where massive, heterogeneous datasets are distributed across clients, demand scalable, privacy-preserving learning methods. Federated learning (FL) enables decentralized training of machine learning (ML) models across clients without data centralization. Decentralized training, however, introduces a computational burden on client devices. U-shaped federated split learning (UFSL) offloads a fraction of the client computation to the server while keeping both data and labels on the clients' side. However, the intermediate representations (i.e., smashed data) shared by clients with the server are prone to exposing clients' private data. To reduce exposure of client data through intermediate data representations, this work proposes k-anonymous differentially private UFSL (KD-UFSL), which leverages privacy-enhancing techniques such as microaggregation and differential privacy to minimize data leakage from the smashed data transferred to the server. We first demonstrate that an adversary can access private client data from intermediate representations via a data-reconstruction attack, and then present a privacy-enhancing solution, KD-UFSL, to mitigate this risk. Our experiments indicate that, alongside increasing the mean squared error between the actual and reconstructed images by up to 50% in some cases, KD-UFSL also decreases the structural similarity between them by up to 40% on four benchmarking datasets. More importantly, KD-UFSL improves privacy while preserving the utility of the global model. This highlights its suitability for large-scale big data applications where privacy and utility must be balanced."

Current proximity sensors provide only binary detection, triggering conservative power back-off that degrades link quality. If the device could measure its distance from the body, transmit power could be adjusted proportionally, improving throughput while maintaining compliance. This paper develops a device-centric integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) method for the device to measure this distance. The uplink communication waveform is exploited for sensing, and the natural motion of the user's hand creates a virtual aperture that provides the angular resolution necessary for localization. Virtual aperture processing requires precise knowledge of the device trajectory, which in this scenario is opportunistic and unknown. One can exploit onboard inertial sensors to estimate the device trajectory; however, the inertial sensors accuracy is not sufficient. To address this, we develop an autofocus algorithm based on extended Kalman filtering that jointly tracks the trajectory and compensates residual errors using phase observations from strong scatterers. The Bayesian Cramér-Rao bound for localization is derived under correlated inertial errors. Numerical results at 28GHz demonstrate centimeter-level accuracy with realistic sensor parameters."

    "abstract": "The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) necessitates efficient mechanisms to distinguish machine-generated content from human text. While statistical watermarking has emerged as a promising solution, existing methods suffer from two critical limitations: the lack of a principled approach for selecting sampling distributions and the reliance on fixed-horizon hypothesis testing, which precludes valid early stopping. In this paper, we bridge this gap by developing the first e-value-based watermarking framework, Anchored E-Watermarking, that unifies optimal sampling with anytime-valid inference. Unlike traditional approaches where optional stopping invalidates Type-I error guarantees, our framework enables valid, anytime-inference by constructing a test supermartingale for the detection process. By leveraging an anchor distribution to approximate the target model, we characterize the optimal e-value with respect to the worst-case log-growth rate and derive the optimal expected stopping time. Our theoretical claims are substantiated by simulations and evaluations on established benchmarks, showing that our framework can significantly enhance sample efficiency, reducing the average token budget required for detection by 13-15% relative to state-of-the-art baselines."

    "abstract": "Safety validation for Level 4 autonomous vehicles (AVs) is currently bottlenecked by the inability to scale the detection of rare, high-risk long-tail scenarios using traditional rule-based heuristics. We present Deep-Flow, an unsupervised framework for safety-critical anomaly detection that utilizes Optimal Transport Conditional Flow Matching (OT-CFM) to characterize the continuous probability density of expert human driving behavior. Unlike standard generative approaches that operate in unstable, high-dimensional coordinate spaces, Deep-Flow constrains the generative process to a low-rank spectral manifold via a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) bottleneck. This ensures kinematic smoothness by design and enables the computation of the exact Jacobian trace for numerically stable, deterministic log-likelihood estimation. To resolve multi-modal ambiguity at complex junctions, we utilize an Early Fusion Transformer encoder with lane-aware goal conditioning, featuring a direct skip-connection to the flow head to maintain intent-integrity throughout the network. We introduce a kinematic complexity weighting scheme that prioritizes high-energy maneuvers (quantified via path tortuosity and jerk) during the simulation-free training process. Evaluated on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD), our framework achieves an AUC-ROC of 0.766 against a heuristic golden set of safety-critical events. More significantly, our analysis reveals a fundamental distinction between kinematic danger and semantic non-compliance. Deep-Flow identifies a critical predictability gap by surfacing out-of-distribution behaviors, such as lane-boundary violations and non-normative junction maneuvers, that traditional safety filters overlook. This work provides a mathematically rigorous foundation for defining statistical safety gates, enabling objective, data-driven validation for the safe deployment of autonomous fleets."

    "abstract": "As models and data scale, independently trained networks often induce analogous notions of similarity. But, matching similarities is weaker than establishing an explicit correspondence between the representation spaces, especially for multimodal models, where consistency must hold not only within each modality, but also for the learned image-text coupling. We therefore ask: given two independently trained multimodal contrastive models (with encoders $(f, g)$ and $(\\widetilde{f},\\widetilde{g})$) -- trained on different distributions and with different architectures -- does a systematic geometric relationship exist between their embedding spaces? If so, what form does it take, and does it hold uniformly across modalities? In this work, we show that across model families such as CLIP, SigLIP, and FLAVA, this geometric relationship is well approximated by an orthogonal map (up to a global mean shift), i.e., there exists an orthogonal map $Q$ where $Q^\\top Q = I$ such that $\\widetilde{f}(x)\\approx Q f(x)$ for paired images $x$. Strikingly, the same $Q$ simultaneously aligns the text encoders i.e., $\\widetilde{g}(y)\\approx Q g(y)$ for texts $y$. Theoretically, we prove that if the multimodal kernel agrees across models on a small anchor set i.e. $\\langle f(x), g(y)\\rangle \\approx \\langle \\widetilde{f}(x), \\widetilde{g}(y)\\rangle$, then the two models must be related by a single orthogonal map $Q$ and the same $Q$ maps images and text across models. More broadly, this finding enables backward-compatible model upgrades, avoiding costly re-embedding, and has implications for the privacy of learned representations.

We compare quantum trajectories with full density-matrix simulations, analyzing the dynamics of averaged trajectory entanglement (TE) and operator entanglement (OE), in the respective state representation. Although not a genuine entanglement measure, both TE and OE are connected to the efficiency of matrix product state simulations and thus of fundamental interest. As in many quantum algorithms, at the end of the Grover circuit entanglement decreases as the system converges towards the target product state. While we find that this is well captured in the OE dynamics, quantum trajectories rarely follow paths of reducing entanglement. Optimized unraveling schemes can lower TE slightly, however we show that deep in the circuit OE is generally smaller than TE. This implies that matrix product density operator (MPDO) simulations of quantum circuits can in general be more efficient than quantum trajectories. In addition, we investigate the noise-rate scaling of success probabilities for both amplitude-damping and phase-flip noise in Grover's algorithm."

We aim to explore the recently detected, thioethanal (CH$_{3}$CHS) formation mechanisms from thioethanol (CH$_{3}$CH$_{2}$SH) as a precursor in addition to secondary sulfur products. The electronic structure methods and density functional theory for both gas-phase and ice-grain surface environments is employed. To mimic interstellar ice-mantles, we use medium (W6) and large amorphized (W22) water clusters as implemented in Binding Energy Evaluation protocol. A barrierless formation mechanism for CH$_{3}$CHS under low-temperature interstellar conditions is identified, in the gas phase. Surface environments modulate activation barriers in a site-specific manner, elucidated through both Langmuir-Hinshelwood and Eley-Rideal initiated surface reaction pathways. Compared to oxygen analogs, sulfur chemistry enables alternate pathways due to weaker S-H bonding, with a competing route forming ethane-1,1-di-thiol (CH$_{3}$CH(SH)SH), on the ice-grain surface, potentially reducing CH$_{3}$CHS yields. The first accurate binding energy for thioethanol on water ice is also reported, confirming its greater volatility than ethanol. The proposed mechanism offers a tentative hypothesis for the apparent mutual exclusive detections of the CH$_{3}$CH$_{2}$SH and CH$_{3}$CHS in TMC-1, Orion, and Sgr B2(N), that further requires validation through quantitative astrochemical modeling and also to distinguish this chemical differentiation from observational sensitivity limitations. These qualitative findings highlight the multifaceted chemical behavior of sulfur-bearing organics in the interstellar medium and support CH$_{3}$CH(SH)SH as promising astro-chemical targets."

Current CoT evaluation narrowly focuses on target task accuracy. However, this metric fails to assess the quality or utility of the reasoning process itself. To address this limitation, we introduce two novel measures: reusability and verifiability. We decouple CoT generation from execution using a Thinker-Executor framework. Reusability measures how easily an Executor can reuse the Thinker's CoT. Verifiability measures how frequently an Executor can match the Thinker's answer using the CoT. We evaluated four Thinker models against a committee of ten Executor models across five benchmarks. Our results reveal that reusability and verifiability do not correlate with standard accuracy, exposing a blind spot in current accuracy-based leaderboards for reasoning capability. Surprisingly, we find that CoTs from specialized reasoning models are not consistently more reusable or verifiable than those from general-purpose LLMs like Llama and Gemma."

While the classical parametric instability with standing waves still occurs over a certain parameter space, the measured wave dispersion relations indicate an increasing role in the raft's emerging elasticity at higher packing fractions, which induces a decrease in the effective surface tension and an increase in an out-of-plane bending modulus. At higher vibration frequencies and lower amplitudes, we also identified a regime without standing waves in which individual particles exhibit thermal-like motion and transition from diffusive to sub-diffusive transport as the packing fraction increases. Glassy behaviors such as spatial and temporal heterogeneity in particle dynamics occur as well, which is analogous to supercooled liquids. When the vibration amplitude is increased starting in this supercooled regime, a large cavity eventually forms inside the raft with its size and shape related to the vibration frequency and the injected vibration energy. The cavitation results in the coexistence of free surface water waves inside the cavity and thermal-like particle motion in the raft."

Therefore, general-domain LLMs may struggle to provide accurate and reliable outputs in this context, leading to increased hallucinations and reduced utility in telecom operations.To address these limitations, this work introduces KG-RAG-a novel framework that integrates knowledge graphs (KGs) with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to enhance LLMs for telecom-specific tasks. In particular, the KG provides a structured representation of domain knowledge derived from telecom standards and technical documents, while RAG enables dynamic retrieval of relevant facts to ground the model's outputs. Such a combination improves factual accuracy, reduces hallucination, and ensures compliance with telecom specifications.Experimental results across benchmark datasets demonstrate that KG-RAG outperforms both LLM-only and standard RAG baselines, e.g., KG-RAG achieves an average accuracy improvement of 14.3% over RAG and 21.6% over LLM-only models. These results highlight KG-RAG's effectiveness in producing accurate, reliable, and explainable outputs in complex telecom scenarios."

Efficiently identifying low-energy configurations within this space remains a central challenge for first-principles-based materials discovery, particularly when the available reference data are limited. Here, we introduce a data-efficient and physically interpretable machine-learning framework based on a fragmented, layer-resolved descriptor that explicitly decomposes nanoparticles into surface, intermediate, and core environments using a topology-driven definition. This representation preserves a compact and fixed feature dimensionality while retaining spatial resolution, enabling controlled emphasis on different regions of the nanoparticle through physically motivated weighting schemes. Coupled with gradient-boosted decision tree models and a ranking-based learning strategy, the proposed framework enables accurate identification of the most stable nanoparticle configurations using only a few hundred density functional theory reference calculations. Ranking performance metrics demonstrate near-saturation of correlation, high top-k recall, and rapidly vanishing regret at moderate training-set sizes, highlighting the strong data efficiency of the approach. Beyond predictive performance, layer-weighting and SHAP-based interpretability analyses reveal how surface segregation, coordination topology, and local chemical disorder contribute differently to stability across spatial regions of the nanoparticle. These insights provide a transparent physical interpretation of the learned models and establish a natural pathway toward active learning-driven exploration of complex nanoparticle configurational spaces."

Two heads (L0H1 and L0H5 in GPT-2 small) function as high-precision membership filters with false positive rates of 0-4\\% even at 180 unique context tokens -- well above the $d_\\text{head} = 64$ bit capacity of a classical Bloom filter. A third head (L1H11) shows the classic Bloom filter capacity curve: its false positive rate follows the theoretical formula $p \\approx (1 - e^{-kn/m})^k$ with $R^2 = 1.0$ and fitted capacity $m \\approx 5$ bits, saturating by $n \\approx 20$ unique tokens. A fourth head initially identified as a Bloom filter (L3H0) was reclassified as a general prefix-attention head after confound controls revealed its apparent capacity curve was a sequence-length artifact. Together, the three genuine membership-testing heads form a multi-resolution system concentrated in early layers (0-1), taxonomically distinct from induction and previous-token heads, with false positive rates that decay monotonically with embedding distance -- consistent with distance-sensitive Bloom filters. These heads generalize broadly: they respond to any repeated token type, not just repeated names, with 43\\% higher generalization than duplicate-token-only heads. Ablation reveals these heads contribute to both repeated and novel token processing, indicating that membership testing coexists with broader computational roles. The reclassification of L3H0 through confound controls strengthens rather than weakens the case: the surviving heads withstand the scrutiny that eliminated a false positive in our own analysis."

In many formal settings, such as circuit specifications, examinations, and hardware documentation, operators and components are explicitly redefined within narrow scope. Correct reasoning in these contexts requires models to temporarily suppress globally learned conventions in favor of prompt-local definitions. In this work, we study a systematic failure mode we term semantic override, in which an LLM reverts to its pretrained default interpretation of operators or gate behavior despite explicit redefinition in the prompt. We also identify a related class of errors, assumption injection, where models commit to unstated hardware semantics when critical details are underspecified, rather than requesting clarification. We introduce a compact micro-benchmark of 30 logic and digital-circuit reasoning tasks designed as verifier-style traps, spanning Boolean algebra, operator overloading, redefined gates, and circuit-level semantics. Evaluating three frontier LLMs, we observe persistent noncompliance with local specifications, confident but incompatible assumptions, and dropped constraints even in elementary settings. Our findings highlight a gap between surface-level correctness and specification-faithful reasoning, motivating evaluation protocols that explicitly test local unlearning and semantic compliance in formal domains."

    "abstract": "The synchronization of rhythms is ubiquitous in both natural and engineered systems, and the demand for data-driven analysis is growing. When rhythms arise from limit cycles, phase reduction theory shows that their dynamics are universally modeled as coupled phase oscillators under weak coupling. This simple representation enables direct inference of inter-rhythm coupling functions from measured time-series data. However, strongly rhythmic chaos can masquerade as noisy limit cycles. In such cases, standard estimators still return plausible coupling functions even though a phase-oscillator model lacks a priori justification. We therefore extend the phase description to the chaotic oscillators. Specifically, we derive a closed equation for the phase difference by defining the phase on a Poincaré section and averaging the phase dynamics over invariant measures of the induced return maps. Numerically, the derived theoretical functions are in close agreement with those inferred from time-series data. Consequently, our results justify the applicability of phase description to coupled chaotic oscillators and show that data-driven coupling functions retain clear dynamical meaning in the absence of limit cycles."

    "abstract": "The sudden appearance of a static obstacle on the road, i.e. the moose test, is a well-known emergency scenario in collision avoidance for automated driving. Model Predictive Control (MPC) has long been employed for planning and control of automated vehicles in the state of the art. However, real-time implementation of automated collision avoidance in emergency scenarios such as the moose test remains unaddressed due to the high computational demand of MPC for evasive action in such hazardous scenarios. This paper offers new insights into real-time collision avoidance via the experimental imple- mentation of MPC for motion planning after a sudden and unexpected appearance of a static obstacle. As the state-of-the-art nonlinear MPC shows limited capability to provide an acceptable solution in real-time, we propose a human-like feed-forward planner to assist when the MPC optimization problem is either infeasible or unable to find a suitable solution due to the poor quality of its initial guess. We introduce the concept of maximum steering maneuver to design the feed-forward planner and mimic a human-like reaction after detecting the static obstacle on the road. Real-life experiments are conducted across various speeds and level of emergency using FPEV2-Kanon electric vehicle. Moreover, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our planning strategy via comparison with the state-of- the-art MPC motion planner."

Separately, methods like PiSSA apply SVD to pre-trained weights but operate independently per layer. CRAFT bridges these two lines of work: it performs full Tucker decomposition via Higher-Order SVD (HOSVD) directly on pre-trained weights organized as cross-layer 3D tensors, freezes all resulting factors, and adapts the model through lightweight trainable transformations applied to each factor matrix. Experiments on the GLUE benchmark using RoBERTa-base and RoBERTa-large demonstrate that CRAFT achieves competitive performance with existing methods while requiring only 41K Tucker adaptation parameters--a count independent of model dimension and depth at fixed Tucker ranks."

    "abstract": "Aqueous radiation chemistry emerges through ultrafast proton transfer and ion-radical formation with unexplored energy-redistribution dynamics steering the subsequent reactions. We performed time-resolved disruptive probing on pure water dimer, (H$_2$O)$_2$, to disentangle the post-ionization reactions. Through kinetic-energy-resolved ion imaging, we unraveled the dynamics in the (H$_2$O)$_2^+$ ground state: at low-energy ($\\sim$0.05 eV) ultrafast proton transfer ($\\sim$19 fs) is followed by H$_3$O$^+$+OH fragmentation ($\\sim$360~fs). At higher energies, proton transfer becomes hindered ($\\sim$60 fs) while the subsequent fragmentation becomes faster ($\\sim$210 fs), evolving into coupled dynamics ($>0.15$ eV, $\\sim$100 fs). Moreover, we observed H$_2$O)$_2^+$ stabilization proceeding through a Zundel-like structure. This reveals how ion-radical formation in ionized hydrogen-bonded networks shapes reactivity in aqueous dynamics."

These can be regarded as generalized versions of the Zhong-Yang estimate and a generalized Shi-Yang's estimate for singular Riemannian foliations with basic mean curvature. We also provide a rigidity result corresponding to the generalized Zhong-Yang estimate, which is a generalized Hang-Wang rigidity for singular Riemannian foliations with basic mean curvature.

However, they are often developed from scratch despite functional overlaps, and abandoned after publication. This lack of interoperability and maintenance incurs unnecessary development effort, impedes tool comparison and benchmarking, complicates documentation, and diminishes the long-term sustainability of NLP4RE tools. To address these issues, we postulate a vision to transition from monolithic NLP4RE tools to an ecosystem of reusable, interoperable modules. We outline a research roadmap towards a software reference architecture (SRA) to realize this vision, elaborated following a standard methodological framework for SRA development. As an initial step, we conducted a stakeholder-driven focus group session to elicit generic system requirements for NLP4RE tools. This activity resulted in 36 key system requirements, further motivating the need for a dedicated SRA. Overall, the proposed vision, roadmap, and initial contribution pave the way towards improved development, reuse, and long-term maintenance of NLP4RE tools."

    "abstract": "We develop a method for training neural networks on Boolean data in which the values at all nodes are strictly $\\pm 1$, and the resulting models are typically equivalent to networks whose nonzero weights are also $\\pm 1$. The method replaces loss minimization with a nonconvex constraint formulation. Each node implements a Boolean threshold function (BTF), and training is expressed through a divide-and-concur decomposition into two complementary constraints: one enforces local BTF consistency between inputs, weights, and output; the other imposes architectural concurrence, equating neuron outputs with downstream inputs and enforcing weight equality across training-data instantiations of the network. The reflect-reflect-relax (RRR) projection algorithm is used to reconcile these constraints. Each BTF constraint includes a lower bound on the margin. When this bound is sufficiently large, the learned representations are provably sparse and equivalent to networks composed of simple logical gates with $\\pm 1$ weights. Across a range of tasks -- including multiplier-circuit discovery, binary autoencoding, logic-network inference, and cellular automata learning -- the method achieves exact solutions or strong generalization in regimes where standard gradient-based methods struggle. These results demonstrate that projection-based constraint satisfaction provides a viable and conceptually distinct foundation for learning in discrete neural systems, with implications for interpretability and efficient inference."

First, we propose PixTrace - a pixel coordinate tracking module that maintains explicit spatial mappings across editing transformations. Second, we introduce CopyNCE, a geometrically-guided contrastive loss that regularizes patch affinity using overlap ratios derived from PixTrace's verified mappings. Our method bridges pixel-level traceability with patch-level similarity learning, suppressing supervision noise in SSL training. Extensive experiments demonstrate not only state-of-the-art performance (88.7% uAP / 83.9% RP90 for matcher, 72.6% uAP / 68.4% RP90 for descriptor on DISC21 dataset) but also better interpretability over existing methods."

We evaluate models from three major families-Llama-3, Gemma-3, and Qwen3-across 20 clinical NLP tasks among Named Entity Recognition, Relation Extraction, Case Report Form Filling, Question Answering, and Argument Mining. We systematically compare a range of adaptation strategies, both at inference time (few-shot prompting, constraint decoding) and at training time (supervised fine-tuning, continual pretraining). Fine-tuning emerges as the most effective approach, while the combination of few-shot prompting and constraint decoding offers strong lower-resource alternatives. Our results show that small LLMs can match or even surpass larger baselines, with our best configuration based on Qwen3-1.7B achieving an average score +9.2 points higher than Qwen3-32B. We release a comprehensive collection of all the publicly available Italian medical datasets for NLP tasks, together with our top-performing models. Furthermore, we release an Italian dataset of 126M words from the Emergency Department of an Italian Hospital, and 175M words from various sources that we used for continual pre-training."

Our research addresses Cross-Lingual Sentiment Misalignment between Bengali and English by benchmarking four transformer architectures. We reveal severe safety and representational failures in current alignment paradigms. We demonstrate that compressed model (mDistilBERT) exhibits 28.7% \"Sentiment Inversion Rate,\" fundamentally misinterpreting positive user intent as negative (or vice versa). Furthermore, we identify systemic nuances affecting human-AI trust, including \"Asymmetric Empathy\" where some models systematically dampen and others amplify the affective weight of Bengali text relative to its English counterpart. Finally, we reveal a \"Modern Bias\" in the regional model (IndicBERT), which shows a 57% increase in alignment error when processing formal (Sadhu) Bengali. We argue that equitable human-AI co-evolution requires pluralistic, culturally grounded alignment that respects language and dialectal diversity over universal compression, which fails to preserve the emotional fidelity required for reciprocal human-AI trust. We recommend that alignment benchmarks incorporate \"Affective Stability\" metrics that explicitly penalize polarity inversions in low-resource and dialectal contexts."

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the motion of a single photon in a two-dimensional plane under closed and open boundary conditions. We employ two methods to construct the Hilbert space: Method A, based on the standard second-quantization formalism, and Method B, based on a non-standard approach. By eliminating redundant quantum states, we obtain a reduced Hilbert space with significantly lower dimensionality, thereby improving the efficiency of numerical simulations. In a closed system, the two methods are equivalent, and their unitary evolution results are identical. The probability distribution diffuses outward from the center and exhibits a significant rebound after reaching the boundary. In an open system, Method B, by incorporating more dissipation channels, provides a more accurate description of the photon escape process at the boundary. The probability curves obtained from the two methods completely overlap before reaching the boundary. After the boundary is reached, a slight difference appears, but this difference does not amplify with evolution and tends to converge in the later stage. Method B yields a slightly higher dissipative-state probability, indicating that the photon escapes faster. Visualization of the two-dimensional probability distribution shows that the three scenarios (closed system, open system with Method A, and open system with Method B) exhibit identical probability distributions before reaching the boundary. After the boundary is reached, the open systems exhibit significant probability loss, which increases rapidly with evolution. The probability distribution patterns of the two open systems are highly similar, exhibiting synchronized evolution."

Existing verification methods are often impractical: formal tools are too restrictive, while black-box statistical auditing is intractable for complex pipelines and fails to pinpoint the source of the bug. This paper introduces Re:cord-play, a gray-box auditing paradigm that inspects the internal state of DP algorithms. By running an instrumented algorithm on neighboring datasets with identical randomness, Re:cord-play directly checks for data-dependent control flow and provides concrete falsification of sensitivity violations by comparing declared sensitivity against the empirically measured distance between internal inputs. We generalize this to Re:cord-play-sample, a full statistical audit that isolates and tests each component, including untrusted ones. We show that our novel testing approach is both effective and necessary by auditing 12 open-source libraries, including SmartNoise SDK, Opacus, and Diffprivlib, and uncovering 13 privacy violations that impact their theoretical guarantees. We release our framework as an open-source Python package, thereby making it easy for DP developers to integrate effective, computationally inexpensive, and seamless privacy testing as part of their software development lifecycle."

Unlike zkVMs (zero-knowledge virtual machines), which emulate CPU instruction execution, Jolt Atlas adapts Jolt's lookup-centric approach and applies it directly to ONNX tensor operations. The ONNX computational model eliminates the need for CPU registers and simplifies memory consistency verification. In addition, ONNX is an open-source, portable format, which makes it easy to share and deploy models across different frameworks, hardware platforms, and runtime environments without requiring framework-specific conversions. Our lookup arguments, which use sumcheck protocol, are well-suited for non-linear functions -- key building blocks in modern ML. We apply optimisations such as neural teleportation to reduce the size of lookup tables while preserving model accuracy, as well as several tensor-level verification optimisations detailed in this paper. We demonstrate that Jolt Atlas can prove model inference in memory-constrained environments -- a prover property commonly referred to as \\textit{streaming}. Furthermore, we discuss how Jolt Atlas achieves zero-knowledge through the BlindFold technique, as introduced in Vega. In contrast to existing zkML frameworks, we show practical proving times for classification, embedding, automated reasoning, and small language models. Jolt Atlas enables cryptographic verification that can be run on-device, without specialised hardware. The resulting proofs are succinctly verifiable. This makes Jolt Atlas well-suited for privacy-centric and adversarial environments. In a companion work, we outline various use cases of Jolt Atlas, including how it serves as guardrails in agentic commerce and for trustless AI context (often referred to as \\textit{AI memory})."

We introduce AIDG (Adversarial Information Deduction Game), a game-theoretic framework that probes the asymmetry between information extraction (active deduction) and information containment (state maintenance) in dialogue. We propose two complementary tasks: AIDG-I, measuring pragmatic strategy in social deduction, and AIDG-II, measuring constraint satisfaction in a structured \"20 Questions\" setting. Across 439 games with six frontier LLMs, we observe a clear capability asymmetry: models perform substantially better at containment than deduction, with a 350 ELO advantage on defense;(Cohen's d = 5.47). We identify two bottlenecks driving this gap: (1) Information Dynamics, where confirmation strategies are 7.75x more effective than blind deduction (p < 0.00001), and (2) Constraint Adherence, where instruction-following degrades under conversational load, accounting for 41.3% of deductive failures. These findings suggest that while LLMs excel at local defensive coherence, they struggle with the global state tracking required for strategic inquiry."

We introduce a taxonomy for fine-grained uncertainty quantification in long-form LLM outputs that distinguishes methods by design choices at three stages: response decomposition, unit-level scoring, and response-level aggregation. We formalize several families of consistency-based black-box scorers, providing generalizations and extensions of existing methods. In our experiments across multiple LLMs and datasets, we find 1) claim-response entailment consistently performs better or on par with more complex claim-level scorers, 2) claim-level scoring generally yields better results than sentence-level scoring, and 3) uncertainty-aware decoding is highly effective for improving the factuality of long-form outputs. Our framework clarifies relationships between prior methods, enables apples-to-apples comparisons, and provides practical guidance for selecting components for fine-grained UQ."

Optical soft sensors are attractive for monolithic printing, but their performance is often degraded by uncontrolled light propagation (ambient coupling, leakage, scattering), while common miti- gation strategies typically require multimaterial interfaces. Here, we present an approach for 3D printed soft optical sensing (SOLen), in which a printed lens is placed in front of an emitter within a Y-shaped waveguide. The sensing mechanism relies on deformation-induced lens rotation and focal-spot translation, redistributing optical power between the two branches to generate a differential output that encodes both motion direction and amplitude. An acrylate polyurethane resin was modified with lauryl acrylate to improve compliance and optical transmittance, and single-layer optical characterization was used to derive wavelength-dependent refractive index and transmittance while minimizing DLP layer-related artifacts. The measured refractive index was used in simulations to design a lens profile for a target focal distance, which was then printed with sub-millimeter fidelity. Rotational tests demonstrated reproducible branch-selective signal switching over multiple cycles. These results establish a transferable material-to-optics workflow for soft optical sensors with lens with new functionalities for next-generation soft robots"

Using a diagrammatic formulation of Bogoliubov many-body perturbation theory, suitably augmented by self-consistency conditions, we obtain the Hartree shift and the pairing gap to third order. In the weak-coupling regime, our results are not only well-converged but also agree with the well-established Gor'kov-Melik-Barkhudarov corrections for the gap and the Galitskii result for the Hartree shift. Near the unitary regime, our results for the Nambu-Gor'kov self-energy are less converged, but there is still reasonable agreement with experiments as well as with quantum Monte-Carlo results. Perspectives for improvements and applications of this approach to neutron matter are discussed."

In the context of the so-called rigid filament models, where the axoneme is described by a single degree of freedom $X(t)$, we investigate the effect of direct coupling between the activity dynamics of adjacent motors, parametrized by $K \\ge 0$. A functional Fokker-Planck equation for $X$ and the state of the $N$ motors is obtained. In the limit of small coupling $K \\ll 1$, we derive a system of equations governing the dynamics of the Fourier modes of the active motor density, obtaining estimates for several observables and the fluctuations' quality factor $Q$. For larger $K$ we resort to numerical simulations. The effect of introducing the coupling $K>0$ is to increase characteristic times and the beating period. Moreover at large $K$s the limit cycle becomes bi-stable, with abrupt avalanches of the motor dynamics. Increasing $K$ is similar to what observed in the case $K=0$ when the confining elastic force is strongly reduced. The quality factor of fluctuations has a non-monotonic behavior: it first increases with $K$, then decreases. This is accompanied by the reduction and eventual disappearance of regions where the fraction of activated motor is nor $0$ neither $1$."

By guaranteeing minimal look-ahead size to each input token, the proposed model can consider future context in each token, which leads to stable PnP label prediction. Unlike previous streaming methods that depend on explicit word boundaries, the CTC decoder in CC-G2PnP effectively learns the alignment between graphemes and phonemes during training, making it applicable to unsegmented languages.

    "abstract": "We study an inverse design problem for the linear multiple fragmentation equation arising in particle dynamics. Our objective is to reconstruct an unknown initial size distribution that evolves, under a prescribed fragmentation law, into a desired size distribution at a specified final time. We first establish the existence of global mass-conserving solutions for a broad class of fragmentation kernels with unbounded rates, and subsequently prove the continuous dependence and uniqueness of these solutions under additional assumptions on the fragmentation kernels. We then formulate the inverse design problem as an optimal control problem constrained by the fragmentation dynamics and prove the existence of the optimal control problem. Also derive the corresponding continuous adjoint equation and propose a gradient-type iterative reconstruction method. For the numerical implementation, we develop finite volume schemes for both the forward and adjoint equations, including a weighted finite volume scheme designed to enhance mass conservation and accuracy. Two benchmark problems, involving linear and nonlinear fragmentation rates with known analytical solutions, are used to assess the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed approach and to compare the performance of the two discretizations in both forward simulations and inverse reconstructions."

    "abstract": "As Large Language Models (LLMs) transition from standalone chat interfaces to foundational reasoning layers in multi-agent systems and recursive evaluation loops (LLM-as-a-judge), the detection of durable, provider-level behavioral signatures becomes a critical requirement for safety and governance. Traditional benchmarks measure transient task accuracy but fail to capture stable, latent response policies -- the ``prevailing mindsets'' embedded during training and alignment that outlive individual model versions. This paper introduces a novel auditing framework that utilizes psychometric measurement theory -- specifically latent trait estimation under ordinal uncertainty -- to quantify these tendencies without relying on ground-truth labels. Utilizing forced-choice ordinal vignettes masked by semantically orthogonal decoys and governed by cryptographic permutation-invariance, the research audits nine leading models across dimensions including Optimization Bias, Sycophancy, and Status-Quo Legitimization. Using Mixed Linear Models (MixedLM) and Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) analysis, the research identifies that while item-level framing drives high variance, a persistent ``lab signal'' accounts for significant behavioral clustering. These findings demonstrate that in ``locked-in'' provider ecosystems, latent biases are not merely static errors but compounding variables that risk creating recursive ideological echo chambers in multi-layered AI architectures."

By treating the spin-spin interaction as a subleading effect, we predict a $J^{PC}=1^{++}$ virtual state near the $J/ψφ$ threshold, which naturally resolves the empirical ambiguities surrounding the $X_{1}(4140)$ width. Extending this framework via heavy quark spin symmetry, we further interpret the $X_{1}(4685)$ as a $ψ(2S)φ$ hadronic molecule.

Current 3D reconstruction-based simulators typically rely on explicit, step-wise updates, which are sensitive to step time and suffer from rapid accuracy degradation under complicated scenarios, such as high-stiffness materials or quasi-static movement. To address this, we introduce i-PhysGaussian, a framework that couples 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) with an implicit Material Point Method (MPM) integrator. Unlike explicit methods, our solution obtains an end-of-step state by minimizing a momentum-balance residual through implicit Newton-type optimization with a GMRES solver. This formulation significantly reduces time-step sensitivity and ensures physical consistency. Our results demonstrate that i-PhysGaussian maintains stability at up to 20x larger time steps than explicit baselines, preserving structural coherence and smooth motion even in complex dynamic transitions."

    "abstract": "Mastering educational concepts requires understanding both their prerequisites (e.g., recursion before merge sort) and sub-concepts (e.g., merge sort as part of sorting algorithms). Capturing these dependencies is critical for identifying students' knowledge gaps and enabling targeted intervention for personalized learning. This is especially challenging in large-scale courses, where instructors cannot feasibly diagnose individual misunderstanding or determine which concepts need reinforcement. While knowledge graphs offer a natural representation for capturing these conceptual relationships at scale, existing approaches are either surface-level (focusing on course-level concepts like \"Algorithms\" or logistical relationships such as course enrollment), or disregard the rich pedagogical signals embedded in instructional materials. We propose InstructKG, a framework for automatically constructing instructor-aligned knowledge graphs that capture a course's intended learning progression. Given a course's lecture materials (slides, notes, etc.), InstructKG extracts significant concepts as nodes and infers learning dependencies as directed edges (e.g., \"part-of\" or \"depends-on\" relationships). The framework synergizes the rich temporal and semantic signals unique to educational materials (e.g., \"recursion\" is taught before \"mergesort\"; \"recursion\" is mentioned in the definition of \"merge sort\") with the generalizability of large language models. Through experiments on real-world, diverse lecture materials across multiple courses and human-based evaluation, we demonstrate that InstructKG captures rich, instructor-aligned learning progressions."

This study examines whether the personality traits of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) can be assessed through non-language-based modalities, using the Social Cognition and Object Relations Scale - Global (SCORS-G). LMMs are employed in two distinct roles: as subject models (SMs), which generate stories in response to TAT images, and as evaluator models (EMs), who assess these narratives using the SCORS-G framework. Evaluators demonstrated an excellent ability to understand and analyze TAT responses. Their interpretations are highly consistent with those of human experts. Assessment results highlight that all models understand interpersonal dynamics very well and have a good grasp of the concept of self. However, they consistently fail to perceive and regulate aggression. Performance varied systematically across model families, with larger and more recent models consistently outperforming smaller and earlier ones across SCORS-G dimensions."

The optical and photoemission quantum efficiency (QE) spectra, along with longitudinal energy distribution curves (EDCs) of multialkali Na$_{2}$KSb(Cs,Sb) photocathodes were measured in the temperature range of 80--295 K. The thresholds of various band-to-band transition in Na$_{2}$KSb were observed in the optical and QE spectra of Na$_{2}$KSb(Cs,Sb) photocathodes. The evolution of EDC derivatives with varying photon energy reveals a fine structure related to the emission of two types of electrons: (i) ballistic electrons, which are excited from heavy hole, light hole and split-off valence bands, and (ii) photoelectrons, that are captured in the side valleys of Na$_{2}$KSb conduction band. The analysis of EDCs and QE spectra allowed us to determine the band structure parameters of Na$_{2}$KSb at $T = 80$ K, including the band gap $E_{\\text{g}} = 1.52 \\pm 0.02$ eV, spin-orbit splitting $Δ_{\\text{SO}} = 0.59 \\pm 0.04$ eV and the energy separations between $Γ$ and side valleys of the conduction band: $Δ_{Γ-\\text{X}1} = 0.41 \\pm 0.05$ eV and $Δ_{Γ-\\text{X}2} = 0.65 \\pm 0.05$ eV. The experimentally determined band gaps and side valley positions, as well as the energies of the final electronic states of optical transitions are in good agreement with the DFT calculations. The obtained data on the hot electron dynamics and electronic band structure of Na$_{2}$KSb are crucial to improve the understanding of the photoemission processes in this material and will contribute to the development of the robust spin-polarized electron sources with multialkali photocathodes."

    "abstract": "Approximate $k$ nearest neighbor (AKNN) search in high-dimensional space is a foundational problem in vector databases with widespread applications. Among the numerous AKNN indexes, Proximity Graph-based indexes achieve state-of-the-art search efficiency across various benchmarks. However, their extensive distance computations of high-dimensional vectors lead to slow construction and substantial memory overhead. The limited memory capacity often prevents building the entire index at once when handling large-scale datasets. A common practice is to build multiple sub-indexes separately. However, directly searching on these separated indexes severely compromises search efficiency, as queries cannot leverage cross-graph connections. Therefore, efficient graph index merging is crucial for multi-index searching. In this paper, we focus on efficient two-index merging and the merge order of multiple indexes for AKNN search. To achieve this, we propose a reverse neighbor sliding merge (RNSM) that exploits structural information to boost merging efficiency. We further investigate merge order selection (MOS) to reduce the merging cost by eliminating redundant merge operations. Experiments show that our approach yields up to a 5.48$\\times$ speedup over existing index merge methods and 9.92$\\times$ speedup over index reconstruction, while maintaining expected superior search performance. Moreover, our method scales efficiently to 100 million vectors with 50 partitions, maintaining consistent speedups."

    "abstract": "Portfolio Management is the process of overseeing a group of investments, referred to as a portfolio, with the objective of achieving predetermined investment goals. Portfolio optimization is a key component that involves allocating the portfolio assets so as to maximize returns while minimizing risk taken. It is typically carried out by financial professionals who use a combination of quantitative techniques and investment expertise to make decisions about the portfolio allocation. Recent applications of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) have shown promising results when used to optimize portfolio allocation by training model-free agents on historical market data. Many of these methods compare their results against basic benchmarks or other state-of-the-art DRL agents but often fail to compare their performance against traditional methods used by financial professionals in practical settings. One of the most commonly used methods for this task is Mean-Variance Portfolio Optimization (MVO), which uses historical time series information to estimate expected asset returns and covariances, which are then used to optimize for an investment objective. Our work is a thorough comparison between model-free DRL and MVO for optimal portfolio allocation. We detail the specifics of how to make DRL for portfolio optimization work in practice, also noting the adjustments needed for MVO. Backtest results demonstrate strong performance of the DRL agent across many metrics, including Sharpe ratio, maximum drawdowns, and absolute returns."

AudioChat introduces a new paradigm in which LLM-based toolcalling agents simulate interactions between users and the system, and these simulated dialogues are used as training data. We also introduce a novel Audio Transfusion Forcing objective to train the AudioChat model, allowing it to simultaneously decompose high-level instructions via structured chain-of-thought reasoning and perform interactive multi-turn audio understanding/generation. To evaluate generation and editing performance, we develop three new metrics that directly measure task performance instead of relying upon distribution-based scoring.

First, this method reconstructs system's high-dimensional state using data assimilation from limited and noisy observations. Second, we quantify a structural complexity of the high-dimensional system dynamics from the reconstructed state by manifold learning. Third, we capture underlying changes in the system by splitting the reconstructed timeseries into sliding windows and analyzing the changes in the temporally local attractor's structural complexity. The structural information is provided as graph Laplacian and measured by Von Neumann entropy in this framework. We evaluate DA-HASC on both synthetic and real-world datasets and demonstrate that it can detect tipping under high-dimensionality and imperfect system knowledge. We further discuss how this framework behaves across different tipping mechanisms."

This paper studies the behavior and performance of one of the most commonly used Bayesian reinforcement learning algorithms, Thompson Sampling (TS), when the model class is misspecified. We first provide a complete dynamic classification of posterior evolution in a misspecified two-armed Gaussian bandit, identifying distinct regimes: correct model concentration, incorrect model concentration, and persistent belief mixing, characterized by the direction of statistical evidence and the model-action mapping. These regimes yield sharp predictions for limiting beliefs, action frequencies, and asymptotic regret. We then extend the analysis to a general finite model class and develop a unified stochastic stability framework that represents posterior evolution as a Markov process on the belief simplex. This approach characterizes two sufficient conditions to classify the ergodic and transient behaviors and provides inductive dimensional reductions of the posterior dynamics. Our results offer the first qualitative and geometric classification of TS under misspecification, bridging Bayesian learning with evolutionary dynamics, and also build the foundations of robust decision-making in structured bandits."

By supplementing the orthogonal x- and y- complex amplitude components with an additional 45°-component, this approach calculates the retardance between two orthogonal polarization components while eliminating phase offsets, thereby enabling the subsequent recovery of the complete polarization state. We demonstrate the versatility of our method by characterizing light fields produced by a United States Air Force (USAF) target, two kinds of complex polarization field, and a metalens.

E-STATCOMs (STATCOMs equipped with energy storage) offer a practical means to provide both voltage support and fast frequency assistance under grid-forming control. Among candidate implementations, double-star multilevel-converter (DS-MC)-based E-STATCOMs enable centralized energy-storage integration at the dc link, which improves thermal management and maintainability. Nevertheless, conventional dc-side power-based internal-energy regulation in DS-MCs can undesirably couple loss compensation to the energy-storage path, accelerating storage cycling and constraining operation when the storage is unavailable. This paper introduces a control strategy that assigns DS-MC total internal-energy regulation to the ac-side active-power path, while reserving dc-side storage power solely for frequency support. By decoupling internal-energy management from inertial-response provision, the proposed scheme enables flexible operation as either a STATCOM or an E-STATCOM according to storage availability and mitigates unnecessary storage cycling. The proposed strategy is verified through offline simulations and laboratory-scale experiments."

    "abstract": "Embedding tables are critical components of large-scale recommendation systems, facilitating the efficient mapping of high-cardinality categorical features into dense vector representations. However, as the volume of unique IDs expands, traditional hash-based indexing methods suffer from collisions that degrade model performance and personalization quality. We present Multi-Probe Zero Collision Hash (MPZCH), a novel indexing mechanism based on linear probing that effectively mitigates embedding collisions. With reasonable table sizing, it often eliminates these collisions entirely while maintaining production-scale efficiency. MPZCH utilizes auxiliary tensors and high-performance CUDA kernels to implement configurable probing and active eviction policies. By retiring obsolete IDs and resetting reassigned slots, MPZCH prevents the stale embedding inheritance typical of hash-based methods, ensuring new features learn effectively from scratch. Despite its collision-mitigation overhead, the system maintains training QPS and inference latency comparable to existing methods. Rigorous online experiments demonstrate that MPZCH achieves zero collisions for user embeddings and significantly improves item embedding freshness and quality. The solution has been released within the open-source TorchRec library for the broader community."

However, because it relies on a single extreme response, it discards most information about how anomaly evidence is distributed and structured across the image, often causing normal and anomalous scores to overlap. We propose StructCore, a training-free, structure-aware image-level scoring method that goes beyond max pooling. Given an anomaly score map, StructCore computes a low-dimensional structural descriptor phi(S) that captures distributional and spatial characteristics, and refines image-level scoring via a diagonal Mahalanobis calibration estimated from train-good samples, without modifying pixel-level localization. StructCore achieves image-level AUROC scores of 99.6% on MVTec AD and 98.4% on VisA, demonstrating robust image-level anomaly detection by exploiting structural signatures missed by max pooling."

    "abstract": "X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) provides element-specific insight into local electronic and structural environments, but quantitative interpretation of molecular XANES under periodic boundary conditions (PBC) remains challenging due to finite-size effects and core-hole treatments. In this work, we systematically investigate how core-hole approximations and charge compensation schemes affect transition energies, energy alignment, and chemical-shift reproducibility in PBC-DFT-based molecular XANES calculations. Using ethane as a model system, we show that the full core-hole (FCH) approach exhibits pronounced supercell-size dependence originating from interactions between background charge and charged molecules, with transition energies largely changed by leading-order finite-size terms. In contrast, the excited core-hole (XCH) method rapidly converges owing to its neutral final state. We further demonstrate that most finite-size effects in FCH can be removed by Makov-Payne corrections based on multipole expansion of the electrostatic energy of charged supercells under PBC. Furthermore, we propose a simple Fermi-level-based energy correction (EF/2) that provides comparable improvement using only a single supercell. Extending the analysis to an n-alkane series reveals that while intrinsic electronic-structure changes govern peak shifts for small molecules, systematic energy drifts persist in FCH for larger molecules, whereas XCH and FCH+EF/2 remain stable. Finally, for small molecules at the C and N K-edges, XCH and FCH+EF/2 accurately reproduce experimental chemical shifts, whereas uncorrected FCH fails. These results provide practical guidelines for reliable energy alignment and chemical-shift analysis in molecular XANES under PBC, supporting robust applications to molecular, adsorption, and interfacial systems."

In this early results paper, we study Obsidian, a knowledge--centric platform whose community is focused on writing, organization, and creativity--has built a substantial plugin ecosystem despite not being developer--centric. We investigate what kinds of plugins exist within this hybrid ecosystem and establish a foundation for understanding how they are maintained. Using repository mining and LLM-based topic modeling on a representative sample of 396 plugins, we identify six topics related to knowledge management and tooling, which is (i) dynamic editing and organization, (ii) interface and layouts, (iii) creative writing and productivity, (iv) knowledge sync solutions, (v) linking and script tools, and (vi) workflow enhancements tools. Furthermore, analysis of the Pull Requests from these plugins show that much software evolution has been performed on these ecosystem. These findings suggest that even in mixed communities, plugin ecosystems can develop recognizable engineering structures, motivating future work that highlight three different research directions with six research questions related to the health and sustainability of these non-developer ecosystems."

This motivates spatial super-resolution from LD observations, but heterogeneous dependencies under sparse and noisy measurements often lead to artifact propagation and false non-local correlations. To address this, we propose CAFE, a plug-and-play rollout generation scheme that reconstructs the full montage in geometry-aligned stages. Starting from the LD channels, CAFE first recovers nearby channels and then progressively expands to more distal regions, exploiting reliable local structure before introducing non-local interactions. During training, step-wise supervision is applied over channel groups and teacher forcing with epoch-level scheduled sampling along the group dimension is utilized to reduce exposure bias, enabling parallel computation across steps. At test time, CAFE performs an autoregressive rollout across groups, while remaining plug-and-play by reusing any temporal backbone as the shared predictor. Evaluated on $4$ modalities and $6$ datasets, CAFE demonstrates plug-and-play generality across $3$ backbones (MLP, Conv, Transformer) and achieves consistently better reconstruction than $5$ representative baselines."

Applying this formula to the Gaussian distribution, we recover a global integral representation for the reciprocal Gamma function that unifies it with its reflection. We formalize the underlying operator as the Parabolic Mellin Transform, a holomorphic alternative to the classical Mellin transform that avoids strips of convergence by mapping the vertical line to a parabolic contour. This general framework leads to new meromorphic representations for the Hurwitz and Riemann zeta functions that are valid throughout the critical strip, as well as reformulations of the Riemann hypothesis and the Lindelof hypothesis."

While existing approaches encode refusal behaviors across multiple latent features, suppressing a single dominant feature$-$via prompt-based jailbreaks$-$can cause alignment to collapse, leading to unsafe generation. Motivated by this, we propose fail-closed alignment as a design principle for robust LLM safety: refusal mechanisms should remain effective even under partial failures via redundant, independent causal pathways. We present a concrete instantiation of this principle: a progressive alignment framework that iteratively identifies and ablates previously learned refusal directions, forcing the model to reconstruct safety along new, independent subspaces. Across four jailbreak attacks, we achieve the strongest overall robustness while mitigating over-refusal and preserving generation quality, with small computational overhead. Our mechanistic analyses confirm that models trained with our method encode multiple, causally independent refusal directions that prompt-based jailbreaks cannot suppress simultaneously, providing empirical support for fail-closed alignment as a principled foundation for robust LLM safety."

    "abstract": "Document chunking is a critical preprocessing step in dense retrieval systems, yet the design space of chunking strategies remains poorly understood. Recent research has proposed several concurrent approaches, including LLM-guided methods (e.g., DenseX and LumberChunker) and contextualized strategies(e.g., Late Chunking), which generate embeddings before segmentation to preserve contextual information. However, these methods emerged independently and were evaluated on benchmarks with minimal overlap, making direct comparisons difficult. This paper reproduces prior studies in document chunking and presents a systematic framework that unifies existing strategies along two key dimensions: (1) segmentation methods, including structure-based methods (fixed-size, sentence-based, and paragraph-based) as well as semantically-informed and LLM-guided methods; and (2) embedding paradigms, which determine the timing of chunking relative to embedding (pre-embedding chunking vs. contextualized chunking). Our reproduction evaluates these approaches in two distinct retrieval settings established in previous work: in-document retrieval (needle-in-a-haystack) and in-corpus retrieval (the standard information retrieval task). Our comprehensive evaluation reveals that optimal chunking strategies are task-dependent: simple structure-based methods outperform LLM-guided alternatives for in-corpus retrieval, while LumberChunker performs best for in-document retrieval. Contextualized chunking improves in-corpus effectiveness but degrades in-document retrieval. We also find that chunk size correlates moderately with in-document but weakly with in-corpus effectiveness, suggesting segmentation method differences are not purely driven by chunk size.

This parameter regularizes the geometry by removing the central singularity. Focusing on wave dynamics, we analyze scalar perturbations, quasinormal modes, and greybody factors, emphasizing the role of the regularization parameter on the effective potential and the decay properties of the modes. Using WKB methods beyond the eikonal limit, we show that the presence of scalar hair modifies both the oscillation frequencies and damping rates of quasinormal modes. In particular, we demonstrate the occurrence of an anomalous decay rate for massive scalar perturbations: above a critical field mass, the longest-lived modes correspond to lower angular momentum, in contrast with the massless case. We derive analytical expressions for the critical mass and study its dependence on the scalar charge and overtone number. Furthermore, we apply the Horowitz-Hubeny method to compute the quasinormal frequencies and show that the results obtained from the WKB and Horowitz-Hubeny approaches exhibit excellent agreement in the regime where both methods are valid. In addition, we compute reflection and transmission coefficients and analyze the corresponding greybody factors, clarifying how regularity effects imprint themselves on black-hole scattering properties. Our results show that regular black holes with scalar hair exhibit distinctive dynamical signatures that can be probed through quasinormal ringing and wave propagation."

This sampling scheme has been recently applied in the context of differentially private optimization (Chua et al., 2024a; Choquette-Choo et al., 2025) and communication-efficient high-dimensional private aggregation (Asi et al., 2025), where it was shown to have utility advantages over the standard Poisson sampling. Theoretical analyses of this sampling scheme (Feldman & Shenfeld, 2025; Dong et al., 2025) lead to bounds that are close to those of Poisson sampling, yet still have two significant shortcomings. First, in many practical settings, the resulting privacy parameters are not tight due to the approximation steps in the analysis. Second, the computed parameters are either the hockey stick or Renyi divergence, both of which introduce overheads when used in privacy loss accounting. In this work, we demonstrate that the privacy loss distribution (PLD) of random allocation applied to any differentially private algorithm can be computed efficiently. When applied to the Gaussian mechanism, our results demonstrate that the privacy-utility trade-off for random allocation is at least as good as that of Poisson subsampling. In particular, random allocation is better suited for training via DP-SGD. To support these computations, our work develops new tools for general privacy loss accounting based on a notion of PLD realization. This notion allows us to extend accurate privacy loss accounting to subsampling which previously required manual noise-mechanism-specific analysis."

In total, 12 potential candidates have been identified while none of them are likely related to S250206dm. This non-detection provides the most stringent constraint to date on any associated kilonova. Crucially, an AT 2017gfo-like event at 269 Mpc can be excluded by WFST observations alone. Based on ejecta mass limits, a neutron star-black hole with a large mass ratio (Q >= 3.2) is disfavored. This optical-derived constraint on the mass ratio reaches, for the first time, a precision comparable to that inferred from the GW signal.

Lung envelope and large airway geometries are derived from CT scans; smaller airways are generated using a physiologically consistent algorithm. Tissue mechanics is modeled using nonlinear elasticity under small deformations, coupled with local air pressure from fluid dynamics within the bronchial tree. Airflow accounts for inertia and static airway compliance. Simulations employ finite elements. Using this model, we explore spatio-temporal airflows and shear stresses distributions."

    "abstract": "AllReduce is a fundamental collective operation in distributed computing and a key performance bottleneck for large-scale training and inference. Its completion time is determined by the number of communication steps, which dominates latency-sensitive workloads, and the communication distance affecting both latency- and bandwidth-bound regimes. Direct-connect topologies, such as torus networks used in Google's TPUv4, are particularly prone to large communication distances due to limited bisection bandwidth. Latency-optimal algorithms such as Bruck's complete AllReduce in $\\log_3 n$ steps on a bidirectional ring, but incur large communication distances that result in substantial congestion. In contrast, recent approaches such as Swing reduce communication distance and congestion, but are inherently required to perform $\\log_2 n$ steps to complete AllReduce, sacrificing latency-optimality. In this paper, we present Trivance, a novel AllReduce algorithm that completes within $\\log_3 n$ steps, while reducing congestion compared to Bruck's algorithm by a factor of three and preserving bandwidth-optimality. Trivance exploits both transmission ports of a bidirectional ring within each step to triple the communication distance along both directions simultaneously. Furthermore, by performing joint reductions, Trivance improves both the number of steps and network congestion. We further show that Trivance extends naturally to multidimensional torus networks, retaining its latency advantage while achieving performance comparable to bandwidth-optimal algorithms for large messages. Our empirical evaluation shows that Trivance improves state-of-the-art approaches by 5-30% for message sizes up to 8\\,MiB, in high-bandwidth settings up to 32MiB and for 3D tori up to 128MiB. Throughout the evaluation, Trivance remains the best-performing latency-optimal algorithm."

Accurate and timely perception of vehicle type, position, and speed is essential for enabling effective priority control strategies. This paper presents the design, deployment, and evaluation of an infrastructure-based multi-modal freight vehicle detection system integrating LiDAR and camera sensors. A hybrid sensing architecture is adopted, consisting of an intersection-mounted subsystem and a midblock subsystem, connected via wireless communication for synchronized data transmission. The perception pipeline incorporates both clustering-based and deep learning-based detection methods with Kalman filter tracking to achieve stable real-time performance. LiDAR measurements are registered into geodetic reference frames to support lane-level localization and consistent vehicle tracking. Field evaluations demonstrate that the system can reliably monitor freight vehicle movements at high spatio-temporal resolution. The design and deployment provide practical insights for developing infrastructure-based sensing systems to support FSP applications."

We show that this failure stems not merely from limited supervision, but from a structural mismatch between noisy, limited supervision and the highly plastic parameter space of EFMs. To address this challenge, we propose SCOPE, a Structured COnfidence-aware Prototype-guided adaptation framework for EFM fine-tuning. SCOPE follows a two-stage pipeline. In the first stage, we construct reliable external supervision by learning geometry-regularized task priors, constructing balanced class-level prototypes over the resulting embeddings, and producing confidence-aware pseudo-labels from their agreement to filter unreliable signals on unlabeled data. In the second stage, we introduce ProAdapter, which adapts frozen EEG foundation models via a lightweight adapter conditioned on the structured prototypes. Experiments across three EEG tasks and five foundation model backbones demonstrate that SCOPE consistently achieves strong performance and efficiency under label-limited cross-subject settings."

The ambient space is not required to be a space form, and the pinching condition involves the length of the second fundamental form and the mean curvature. The results obtained, as well as the methods employed, differ substantially between higher-dimensional and four-dimensional submanifolds. Our approach in higher dimensions relies on results from the theory of Riemannian manifolds with nonnegative isotropic curvature and on the Bochner technique. In contrast, in the four-dimensional case, the analysis also relies critically on concepts from four-dimensional geometry. A key observation is that submanifolds satisfying the pinching condition necessarily have nonnegative isotropic curvature, a notion introduced by Micallef and Moore. The results are sharp and extend previous work by several authors, without imposing any additional assumptions on either the topology or the geometry of the submanifold."

    "abstract": "Electrified heating systems with thermal storage, such as electric boilers and heat pumps, represent a major source of demand-side flexibility. Under current electricity market designs, balance responsible parties (BRPs) operating such assets are required to submit binding day-ahead electricity consumption schedules, and they typically do it based on forecasts of heat demand and electricity prices. Common scheduling approaches implicitly assume that forecast uncertainty can be well characterized using historical forecast errors. In practice, however, the cumulative effect of uncertainty creates significant exposure to imbalance-price risk when the committed schedule cannot be followed. To address this, we propose a distributionally robust chance-constrained optimization framework for the day-ahead scheduling of a multi-MW electric boiler using only limited residual forecast samples. We derive a tractable convex reformulation of the problem and calibrate the ambiguity set directly from historical forecast-error data through an a priori tunable risk parameter. Numerical results show that enforcing performance guarantees on the heat-demand balance constraint reduces demand violations by 40% compared to a deterministic forecast-based scheduler and up to 10% relative to a nominal chance-constrained model with a fixed error distribution. Further, we show that modeling the real-time rebound cost of demand violations as a second-stage term can reduce the overall daily operating cost by up to 34% by hedging against highly volatile day-ahead electricity prices."

We introduce a claim-level framework for detecting and quantifying this \\emph{temporal knowledge leakage}. Our approach decomposes model rationales into atomic claims and categorizes them by temporal verifiability, then applies \\textit{Shapley values} to measure each claim's contribution to the prediction. This yields the \\textbf{Shapley}-weighted \\textbf{D}ecision-\\textbf{C}ritical \\textbf{L}eakage \\textbf{R}ate (\\textbf{Shapley-DCLR}), an interpretable metric that captures what fraction of decision-driving reasoning derives from leaked information. Building on this framework, we propose \\textbf{Time}-\\textbf{S}upervised \\textbf{P}rediction with \\textbf{E}xtracted \\textbf{C}laims (\\textbf{TimeSPEC}), which interleaves generation with claim verification and regeneration to proactively filter temporal contamination -- producing predictions where every supporting claim can be traced to sources available before the cutoff date. Experiments on 350 instances spanning U.S. Supreme Court case prediction, NBA salary estimation, and stock return ranking reveal substantial leakage in standard prompting baselines. TimeSPEC reduces Shapley-DCLR while preserving task performance, demonstrating that explicit, interpretable claim-level verification outperforms prompt-based temporal constraints for reliable backtesting."

While the individual contribution of supported metal to the overall activity of supported photocatalysts has been identified, the joint activity of mixed metal species is overlooked because of their different photoelectric properties. Here, atomically dispersed Pd (Pd1) and Pd clusters are loaded onto CdS, serving as oxidation and reduction sites, respectively, for methanol dehydrogenation. The Pd1 substitutes Cd2+, forming hole-trapping states for methanol oxidation and assisting the dispersion of photo-deposited Pd clusters. Therefore, methanol dehydrogenation on CdS with supported Pd1 and Pd clusters exhibits the highest turnover frequency of 1.14 s-1 based on Pd content, and affords H2 and HCHO with a similar apparent quantum yield of 87 +/- 1% at 452 nm under optimized reaction conditions. This work highlights the synergistic catalysis of supported metal for improved photocatalytic activity."

Our approach incorporates a topology-informed, uncertainty-aware decision-making mechanism that analyzes the pose-graph structure to detect low-connectivity regions, selectively triggering mapping and loop closing modules. The resulting map and pose-graph are seamlessly integrated into the existing model, reducing accumulated error and enhancing global consistency.

    "abstract": "Compressed suffix arrays (CSAs) index large repetitive collections and are key in many text applications. The r-index and its derivatives combine the run-length Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT) with suffix array sampling to achieve space proportional to the number of equal-symbol runs in the BWT. While effective for near-identical strings, their size grows quickly as variation increases, since the number of BWT runs is sensitive to edits. Existing approaches typically trade space for query speed, or vice versa, limiting their practicality at large scale. We introduce variable-length blocking (VLB), an encoding technique for BWT-based CSAs that adapts the amount of indexing information to local compressibility. The BWT is recursively divided into blocks of at most w runs (a parameter) and organized into a tree. Compressible regions appear near the root and store little auxiliary data, while incompressible regions lie deeper and retain additional information to speed up access. Queries traverse a short root-to-leaf path followed by a small run scan. This strategy balances space and query speed by transferring bits saved in compressible areas to accelerate access in incompressible ones. Backward search relies on rank and successor queries over the BWT. We introduce a sampling technique that guarantees correctness only along valid backward-search states, reducing space without affecting query performance. We extend VLB to encode the subsampled r-index (sr-index). Experiments show that VLB-based techniques outperform the r-index and sr-index in query time, while retaining space close to that of the sr-index. Compared to the move data structure, VLB offers a more favorable space-time tradeoff."

DARIO relies on a novel Stochastic Network Calculus (SNC) model to analytically estimate the delay bound for each possible user-RIS assignment under specific traffic and service dynamics. These estimations are used by DARIO to formulate a Nonlinear Integer Program (NIP), for which an online heuristic provides near-optimal performance with low computational overhead.

Although token pruning has proven effective for accelerating inference, determining when and where to prune remains largely heuristic. Existing approaches typically rely on static, empirically selected layers, which limit interpretability and transferability across models. In this work, we introduce a matrix-entropy perspective and identify an \"Entropy Collapse Layer\" (ECL), where the information content of visual representations exhibits a sharp and consistent drop, which provides a principled criterion for selecting the pruning stage. Building on this observation, we propose EntropyPrune, a novel matrix-entropy-guided token pruning framework that quantifies the information value of individual visual tokens and prunes redundant ones without relying on attention maps. Moreover, to enable efficient computation, we exploit the spectral equivalence of dual Gram matrices, reducing the complexity of entropy computation and yielding up to a 64x theoretical speedup. Extensive experiments on diverse multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that EntropyPrune consistently outperforms state-of-the-art pruning methods in both accuracy and efficiency. On LLaVA-1.5-7B, our method achieves a 68.2% reduction in FLOPs while preserving 96.0% of the original performance. Furthermore, EntropyPrune generalizes effectively to high-resolution and video-based models, highlighting the strong robustness and scalability in practical MLLM acceleration.

We train a classifier with a time-based split and perform SHAP-based analyses, which indicate that patient and clinician history features dominate prediction, functioning as strong priors, while characteristics of the response text provide a smaller but, crucially, actionable signal.

The time-dependence of the randomness in the white noise is also studied, indicating the existence of non-stationary physical processes influencing the pulsar timing.

Under this structure, environment perturbations that affect the covariates do not propagate to the outcome, which motivates regularizing the model's sensitivity to these perturbations. Crucially, estimating these perturbation directions does not require labels, enabling us to leverage unlabeled data from multiple environments. We propose two methods that penalize the model's sensitivity to variations in the mean and covariance of the covariates across environments, respectively, and prove that these methods have worst-case optimality guarantees under certain classes of environments. Finally, we demonstrate the empirical performance of our approach on a controlled physical system and a physiological signal dataset."

While the CA's composite personality did not affect participants' decisions, it did affect their perceptions and emotional responses. Particularly, participants interacting with pessimistic CAs felt lower emotional state and lower affinity towards the cause, perceived the CA as less trustworthy and less competent, and yet tended to donate more toward the charity. Perceptions of trust, competence, and situational empathy significantly predicted donation decisions.

    "abstract": "Visual simultaneous localization and mapping (V-SLAM) is a fundamental capability for autonomous perception and navigation. However, endoscopic scenes violate the rigidity assumption due to persistent soft-tissue deformations, creating a strong coupling ambiguity between camera ego-motion and intrinsic deformation. Although recent monocular non-rigid SLAM methods have made notable progress, they often lack effective decoupling mechanisms and rely on sparse or low-fidelity scene representations, which leads to tracking drift and limited reconstruction quality. To address these limitations, we propose NRGS-SLAM, a monocular non-rigid SLAM system for endoscopy based on 3D Gaussian Splatting. To resolve the coupling ambiguity, we introduce a deformation-aware 3D Gaussian map that augments each Gaussian primitive with a learnable deformation probability, optimized via a Bayesian self-supervision strategy without requiring external non-rigidity labels. Building on this representation, we design a deformable tracking module that performs robust coarse-to-fine pose estimation by prioritizing low-deformation regions, followed by efficient per-frame deformation updates. A carefully designed deformable mapping module progressively expands and refines the map, balancing representational capacity and computational efficiency. In addition, a unified robust geometric loss incorporates external geometric priors to mitigate the inherent ill-posedness of monocular non-rigid SLAM. Extensive experiments on multiple public endoscopic datasets demonstrate that NRGS-SLAM achieves more accurate camera pose estimation (up to 50\\% reduction in RMSE) and higher-quality photo-realistic reconstructions than state-of-the-art methods. Comprehensive ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of our key design choices. Source code will be publicly available upon paper acceptance."

    "abstract": "Human relevance assessment is time-consuming and cognitively intensive, limiting the scalability of Information Retrieval evaluation. This has led to growing interest in using large language models (LLMs) as proxies for human judges. However, it remains an open question whether LLM-based relevance judgments are reliable, stable, and rigorous enough to match humans for relevance assessment. In this work, we conduct a systematic study of overrating behavior in LLM-based relevance judgments across model backbones, evaluation paradigms (pointwise and pairwise), and passage modification strategies. We show that models consistently assign inflated relevance scores -- often with high confidence -- to passages that do not genuinely satisfy the underlying information need, revealing a system-wide bias rather than random fluctuations in judgment. Furthermore, controlled experiments show that LLM-based relevance judgments can be highly sensitive to passage length and surface-level lexical cues. These results raise concerns about the usage of LLMs as drop-in replacements for human relevance assessors, and highlight the urgent need for careful diagnostic evaluation frameworks when applying LLMs for relevance assessments. Our code and results are publicly available."

By integrating domain-specific prompt engineering including In-Context Learning (ICL), Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, and a multi-round feedback-verification flow, SimulatorCoder systematically transforms high-level functional requirements into efficient, executable, and architecture-aligned simulator code. Experiments based on the customized SCALE-Sim benchmark demonstrate that structured prompting and feedback mechanisms substantially improve both code generation accuracy and simulator performance. The resulting simulators not only maintain cycle-level fidelity with less than 1% error compared to manually implemented counterparts, but also consistently achieve lower simulation runtimes, highlighting the effectiveness of LLM-based methods in accelerating simulator development.

However, how to certify ensembles of high-dimensional quantum states in a black-box scenario remains a challenging task. In this work, we report an experimental test of certifying ensembles of high-dimensional quantum states based on prepare-and-measure experiments with \\textit{independent devices}, where the state preparation device and the measurement device have no shared randomness. In our experiment, the prepared quantum states are high-dimensional orbital angular momentum states of single photons, and both the preparation fidelity and the measurement fidelity are about 99.0$\\%$ for the six-dimensional quantum states. We also measure the crosstalk matrices and calculate the similarity parameter for up to ten dimensions. We not only experimentally certify the ensemble of high-dimensional quantum states in a semi-device-independent manner, but also experimentally investigate the effect of atmospheric turbulent noise on high-dimensional quantum state certification. Our experimental results clearly show that the certification of high-dimensional quantum states can still be achieved even under the influence of atmospheric turbulent noise. Our findings have potential implications in quantum certification and quantum random number generation."

    "abstract": "Dynamic facility location problems predominantly suppose a monopoly over the service or product provided. Nonetheless, this premise can be a severe oversimplification in the presence of market competitors, as customers may prefer facilities installed by one of them. The monopolistic assumption can particularly worsen planning performance when demand depends on prior location decisions of the market participants, namely, when unmet demand from one period carries over to the next. Such a demand behaviour creates an intrinsic relationship between customer demand and location decisions of all market participants, and requires the decision-maker to anticipate the competitor's response. This work studies a novel competitive facility location problem that combines cumulative demand and market competition to devise high-quality solutions. We propose bilevel mixed-integer programming formulations for two variants of our problem, prove that the optimistic variant is $Σ^{p}_{2}$-hard, and develop branch-and-cut algorithms with tightened value-function cuts that significantly outperform general-purpose bilevel solvers. Our results quantify the severe cost of planning under a monopolistic assumption (profit drops by half on average) and the gains from cooperation over competition (6% more joint profit), while drawing managerial guidelines on how instance attributes and duopolistic modelling choices shape robust location schedules."

Representation drift regularization provides a natural remedy to disentangle task vectors; however, existing approaches typically require external task data, conflicting with modularity and data availability constraints (e.g., privacy requirements). We propose a dataless approach by framing regularization against representation drift as a curvature matrix approximation problem. This allows us to leverage well-established techniques; in particular, we adopt Kronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature and obtain a practical regularizer that achieves state-of-the-art results in task addition and negation. Our method has constant complexity in the number of tasks and promotes robustness to task vector rescaling, eliminating the need for held-out tuning."

    "abstract": "Speculative thinking about the capabilities and implications of artificial intelligence (AI) influences computer science research, drives AI industry practices, feeds academic studies of existential hazards, and stirs a global political debate. It primarily concerns predictions about the possibilities, benefits, and risks of reaching artificial general intelligence, artificial superintelligence, and technological singularity. It permeates technophilic philosophies and social movements, fuels the corporate and pundit rhetoric, and remains a potent source of inspiration for the media, popular culture, and arts. However, speculative AI is not just a discursive matter. Steeped in vagueness and brimming with unfounded assertions, manipulative claims, and extreme futuristic scenarios, it often has wide-reaching practical consequences. This paper offers a critical overview of AI speculations. In three central sections, it traces the intertwined sway of science fiction, religiosity, intellectual charlatanism, dubious academic research, suspicious entrepreneurship, and ominous sociopolitical worldviews that make AI speculations troublesome and sometimes harmful. The focus is on the field of existential risk studies and the effective altruism movement, whose ideological flux of techno-utopianism, longtermism, and transhumanism aligns with the power struggles in the AI industry to emblematize speculative AI's conceptual, methodological, ethical, and social issues. The following discussion traverses these issues within a wider context to inform the closing summary of suggestions for a more comprehensive appraisal, practical handling, and further study of the potentially impactful AI imaginaries."

    "abstract": "Recent observations from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT), especially when combined with DESI baryon acoustic oscillation data, indicate a scalar spectral index $n_s$ higher than the value reported by \\textit{Planck} 2018, placing tension on universal inflationary attractor models. Motivated by this discrepancy, we investigate the inflationary predictions of the $β$-exponential potential, $V(φ)=V_0\\left(1-λβφ/M_p\\right)^{1/β}$ considering both minimally and non-minimally coupled realizations. This potential generalizes standard exponential inflation and naturally arises in braneworld scenarios. We derive analytical expressions for the slow-roll parameters and inflationary observables using a perturbative expansion in the non-minimal coupling $ξ$, and validate these results through numerical calculations. In the minimally coupled case, the model predicts $n_s \\simeq 0.976$ and $r \\simeq 0.035$ for $N=50$ and moderate values of β, remaining compatible with ACT+DESI constraints at the 1σlevel while yielding a spectral tilt larger than the universal attractor prediction. Introducing a small non-minimal coupling significantly improves agreement with observations by suppressing the tensor-to-scalar ratio while preserving the enhanced scalar tilt. For $N=60, λ\\sim 0.3-0.5$, and $β\\sim O(1-5)$, the non-minimally coupled model yields $n_s \\simeq 0.974-0.976$ and $r \\lesssim 0.03$, comfortably consistent with ACT, DESI, and BICEP/Keck bounds. Our results show that the $β$-exponential potential, especially when implemented with a non-minimal coupling, exhibits good agreement with the latest CMB observations. Our inflationary predictions of the non-minimal model of $n_s$ and $r$ confirming the leading-order contributions in $ξ$ are sufficient to capture the essential features of both $r$ and $n_s$ in observationally relevant regimes."

This challenge is particularly acute for computer-using scenarios, where real execution does not support counterfactual exploration, making large-scale trial-and-error learning and planning impractical despite the environment being fully digital and deterministic. We introduce the Computer-Using World Model (CUWM), a world model for desktop software that predicts the next UI state given the current state and a candidate action. CUWM adopts a two-stage factorization of UI dynamics: it first predicts a textual description of agent-relevant state changes, and then realizes these changes visually to synthesize the next screenshot. CUWM is trained on offline UI transitions collected from agents interacting with real Microsoft Office applications, and further refined with a lightweight reinforcement learning stage that aligns textual transition predictions with the structural requirements of computer-using environments. We evaluate CUWM via test-time action search, where a frozen agent uses the world model to simulate and compare candidate actions before execution. Across a range of Office tasks, world-model-guided test-time scaling improves decision quality and execution robustness."

The application of this method increases the friction coefficient by up to 42.3%, resulting in a substantial delay in turbulent separation from the convex wall, while maintaining total momentum, quantified by changes in momentum-loss thickness. Other parameters indicating the high efficiency of the method are the invariant value of the friction Reynolds number along the flow and the thinner boundary layer. The above indicators demonstrate promising aerodynamic improvements in airfoils, similar to those achieved when active suction is applied to the suction side. The new insight into the physical mechanism of the wavy wall suggests that small-scale turbulent activity is the primary determinant of the effectiveness of the wavy wall in enhancing small-scale streamwise convection and the sweeping motion, resulting in superior momentum transport. However, when the wavy wall, due to poorly selected geometry, induces large-scale motions, such as separation in the trough, it counteracts the mechanism. Then this geometry has a detrimental effect on the efficiency of the method."

    "abstract": "Multimodal recommender systems (RSs) represent items in the catalog through multimodal data (e.g., product images and descriptions) that, in some cases, might be noisy or (even worse) missing. In those scenarios, the common practice is to drop items with missing modalities and train the multimodal RSs on a subsample of the original dataset. To date, the problem of missing modalities in multimodal recommendation has still received limited attention in the literature, lacking a precise formalisation as done with missing information in traditional machine learning. In this work, we first provide a problem formalisation for missing modalities in multimodal recommendation. Second, by leveraging the user-item graph structure, we re-cast the problem of missing multimodal information as a problem of graph features interpolation on the item-item co-purchase graph. On this basis, we propose four training-free approaches that propagate the available multimodal features throughout the item-item graph to impute the missing features. Extensive experiments on popular multimodal recommendation datasets demonstrate that our solutions can be seamlessly plugged into any existing multimodal RS and benchmarking framework while still preserving (or even widen) the performance gap between multimodal and traditional RSs. Moreover, we show that our graph-based techniques can perform better than traditional imputations in machine learning under different missing modalities settings. Finally, we analyse (for the first time in multimodal RSs) how feature homophily calculated on the item-item graph can influence our graph-based imputations."

    "abstract": "Embodied AI systems (e.g., autonomous vehicles, service robots, and LLM-driven interactive agents) are rapidly transitioning from controlled environments to safety critical real-world deployments. Unlike disembodied AI, failures in embodied intelligence lead to irreversible physical consequences, raising fundamental questions about security, safety, and reliability. While existing research predominantly analyzes embodied AI through the lenses of Large Language Model (LLM) vulnerabilities or classical Cyber-Physical System (CPS) failures, this survey argues that these perspectives are individually insufficient to explain many observed breakdowns in modern embodied systems. We posit that a significant class of failures arises from embodiment-induced system-level mismatches, rather than from isolated model flaws or traditional CPS attacks. Specifically, we identify four core insights that explain why embodied AI is fundamentally harder to secure: (i) semantic correctness does not imply physical safety, as language-level reasoning abstracts away geometry, dynamics, and contact constraints; (ii) identical actions can lead to drastically different outcomes across physical states due to nonlinear dynamics and state uncertainty; (iii) small errors propagate and amplify across tightly coupled perception-decision-action loops; and (iv) safety is not compositional across time or system layers, enabling locally safe decisions to accumulate into globally unsafe behavior. These insights suggest that securing embodied AI requires moving beyond component-level defenses toward system-level reasoning about physical risk, uncertainty, and failure propagation."

These observables might not be known a priori, but they may in principle be identified through analyzing the quantum state of the system. Experimentally, this can be particularly demanding as estimating quantum states and expectation values of quantum observables requires a large number of projective measurements. However, open quantum systems can be probed in situ by monitoring their output, e.g. via heterodyne-detection or photon-counting experiments, which provide space-time resolved information about their dynamics. Building on this, we present a machine-learning approach to detect nonequilibrium phase transitions from the measurement time-records of continuously-monitored quantum systems. We benchmark our method using the quantum contact process, a model featuring an absorbing-state phase transition, which constitutes a particularly challenging test case for the quantum simulation of nonequilibrium processes."

    "abstract": "The static tidal Love numbers of four-dimensional black holes vanish identically, unlike their nontrivial dynamical response at finite frequency. Recent work has provided three complementary descriptions of this phenomenon: an emergent $\\mathrm{SL}(2,\\mathbb{R})$ organization of static near-zone perturbations, a graded logarithmic and multi-zeta structure in Shell Effective Field Theory (Shell EFT), and an on-shell matching framework based on gravitational Raman scattering with renormalization group (RG) running. We show that these features arise from a common near-zone truncation mechanism. For a massless scalar field, horizon regularity selects a unique static solution forming a highest-weight-type representation, truncating the hypergeometric solution to a finite polynomial and eliminating the independent decaying branch at large radius. This excludes a static Wilson coefficient in the effective theory. We demonstrate that the same truncation operates in the static Regge-Wheeler and Zerilli equations for four-dimensional Schwarzschild black holes. Analytic continuation of the horizon-regular solution to small frequency via the Coulomb-hypergeometric or Mano-Suzuki-Takasugi formalisms preserves this truncation as an anchoring condition for the renormalized angular momentum parameter. The resulting low-frequency expansion is controlled by Gamma and hypergeometric functions, generating a graded algebra of logarithms and odd Riemann zeta values. Within this structure no invariant of negative weight exists in the static sector, so the vanishing of the static Love number follows as a structural consequence. This explains the ``zero-sum'' rule of Shell EFT and why the self-induced RG flow in gravitational Raman scattering cannot generate a static invariant."

Dugas for investigating derived equivalent pairs of (weakly) symmetric algebras, we apply them in a specific situation, obtaining new deep results concerning iterated mutations of symmetric periodic algebras.

Then $μ_i(Λ)$ is again symmetric, and we can iterate this process. We want to understand the order of $μ_i$, in case the vertex $i$ is $d$-periodic, i.e. the simple module $S_i$ associated to $i$ is periodic of period $d$ (with respect to the syzygy). The main result of this paper shows that then $μ_i$ has order $d-2$, that is $μ_i^{d-2}(Λ)\\congΛ$ (modulo socle), under some additional assumption on the (periodic) projective-injective resolution of $S_i$. Besides, we present briefly some consequences concerning arbitrary periodic vertex and give few sugestive examples showing that this property should hold in general, i.e. without restrictions on the periodic projective resolution."

With major corporations and academic institutions investing in quantum hardware and software, there has been a rise in the development of quantum-enabled systems, particularly within open-source communities. However, despite the promising nature of quantum technologies, these communities face critical socio-technical challenges, including the emergence of socio-technical anti-patterns known as community smells. These anti-patterns, prevalent in open-source environments, have the potential to negatively impact both product quality and community health by introducing technical debt and amplifying architectural and code smells. Despite the importance of these socio-technical factors, there remains a scarcity of research investigating their influence within quantum open-source communities. This work aims to address this gap by providing a first step in analyzing the socio-technical well-being of quantum communities through a cross-sectional study. By understanding the socio-technical dynamics at play, it is expected that foundational knowledge can be established to mitigate the risks associated with community smells and ensure the long-term sustainability of open-source quantum initiatives."

In this work, we prove that the Fischlin transform remains straight-line extractable in the QROM, via an extractor based on the compressed oracle. This establishes the post-quantum security of the Fischlin transform, providing a post-quantum straight-line extractable NIZK alternative to Pass' transform with smaller proof size.

In addition to existing measurements, we incorporate simulated pseudodata for the future Electron-Ion Collider (EIC), considering two beam-energy configurations, $E_e \\times E_p = 5 \\times 41~\\mathrm{GeV^2}$ and $18 \\times 275~\\mathrm{GeV^2}$, corresponding to an extended kinematic reach down to $x \\sim 10^{-5}$. We focus on longitudinal double-spin asymmetries $A_1^h$ for charge-separated pion and kaon production in SIDIS off a longitudinally polarized proton target. These projected measurements significantly improve the flavor separation of sea-quark polarized PDFs ($Δ\\bar{u}$, $Δ\\bar{d}$, $Δs$) and reduce the uncertainties on both quark and gluon helicity distributions, with the largest impact at small $x$. Polarized PDFs are extracted using a neural-network parametrization and a Monte Carlo replica methodology to propagate experimental uncertainties, while theoretical constraints such as positivity are imposed during the fit. We demonstrate that the inclusion of EIC pseudodata leads to a substantially more precise determination of polarized PDFs, with the largest impact in the small-$x$ region. The resulting polarized PDF sets are provided in the {\\tt LHAPDF} format."

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence systems increasingly generate text intended to provide social and emotional support. Understanding how users perceive empathic qualities in such content is therefore critical. We examined differences in perceived empathy signals between human-written and large language model (LLM)-generated relationship advice, and the influence of authorship labels. Across two preregistered experiments (Study 1: n = 641; Study 2: n = 500), participants rated advice texts on overall quality and perceived cognitive, emotional, and motivational empathy. Multilevel models accounted for the nested rating structure. LLM-generated advice was consistently perceived as higher in overall quality, cognitive empathy, and motivational empathy. Evidence for a widely reported negativity bias toward AI-labelled content was limited. Emotional empathy showed no consistent source advantage. Individual differences in AI attitudes modestly influenced judgments but did not alter the overall pattern. These findings suggest that perceptions of empathic communication are primarily driven by linguistic features rather than authorship beliefs, with implications for the design of AI-mediated support systems."

    "abstract": "A levitated ferromagnet provides an exceptionally sensitive probe of ultralight dark matter (ULDM) through measuring weak magnetic-like field signals. We propose a ferromagnet lattice magnetometer that coherently combines multiple levitated ferromagnets to enhance effective sensitivity. By replacing a single ferromagnet with a lattice, we increase the total polarized spin while preserving the intrinsic dynamical response of each constituent ferromagnet. We show that magnetic dipole-dipole interactions within the lattice can be dynamically suppressed through a high-frequency magnetic field, rendering the system effectively noninteracting, at the cost of only a moderate reduction in signal amplitude due to the distinct renormalization of linear and quadratic spin responses. We analyze the noise properties of the lattice and demonstrate that collective readout leads to favorable scaling with the number of ferromagnets. Interpreted in terms of axion-electron, dark photon, and axion-photon couplings, our results yield projected sensitivities that significantly exceed existing single-ferromagnet implementations. In particular, for axion-photon interactions, we find a nontrivial lattice-induced enhancement of the signal itself, leading to sensitivities that surpass existing constraints over a broad mass range."

We describe an end-to-end pipeline covering metadata filtering, archive validation, LaTeX extraction, text normalization, domain-aware tokenization, and dense transformer training under constrained compute (2xA100 GPUs). Through 24 experimental runs, we analyze training stability, scaling behavior, data yield losses, and infrastructure bottlenecks. Our findings highlight how preprocessing decisions significantly affect usable token volume, how tokenization impacts symbolic stability, and how storage and I/O constraints can rival compute as limiting factors. We further analyze convergence dynamics and show stable training behavior in a data-rich regime (52B pretraining tokens). Rather than proposing a novel architecture, this work provides an engineering-grounded, transparent account of training a small scientific language model from scratch. We hope these insights support researchers operating under moderate compute budgets who seek to build domain-specialized models."

We evaluate the leading contributions to the gravity path integral with one and two torus boundaries, extracting both the spectrum and its spectral statistics from the torus wormhole. Strikingly, the theory has fermionic black hole microstates, even in the absence of bulk fermionic matter. We then incorporate subtle bulk topological field theories, classified by appropriate cobordism groups, and evaluate the one and two-boundary torus partition functions. The spectral statistics we derive from gravity are shown, in all cases, to be consistent with the pattern of anomalies expected from classifications of fermionic 2d CFT. We also define a version of RMT$_2$, a random-matrix framework compatible with the symmetries of 2d CFTs, which naturally accommodates fermionic spectra and reproduces our gravitational results across all cases we analyze."

Using ab initio lattice calculations, we show that the condensate consists of coexisting s-wave pairs, p-wave pairs in entangled double pair combinations, and quartets composed of bound states of two s-wave pairs. We identify multimodal superfluidity as a general feature of single-flavor spin-1/2 fermionic systems with attractive s-wave and p-wave interactions, provided the system is stable against collapse into a dense droplet. Beyond neutrons at sub-saturation densities, we demonstrate that this phase appears in generalized attractive extended Hubbard models in one, two, and three dimensions. We elucidate the mechanism for this coexistence using self-consistent few-body Cooper models and compare with Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory. We also derive the form of the effective action and show that spin, rotational, and parity symmetries remain unbroken. Finally, we analyze experimental data to show that p-wave pair gaps and quartet gaps are present in atomic nuclei, and we discuss the consequences of this new phase for the structure and dynamics of neutron star crusts."

Particle production at kinetic freeze-out is obtained using a local equilibrium distribution function with a blast-wave-like fluid velocity profile derived from the expansion dynamics of the elliptic fire-cylinder. The model parameters governing the collective expansion are first constrained by fitting the midrapidity $p_T$ spectra of $π^{\\pm}$ and are then applied, without further adjustment, to $K^{\\pm}$, $p$, and $\\bar{p}$.

The genuine nonequilibrium post-quench dynamics allows the system to evolve along effective shortcuts absent in the quasi-static regime. When the time needed for preparing the (classical or quantum) system in the hotter initial state is included, we encounter so-called Pontus-Mpemba effects. We here investigate multi-step Pontus-Mpemba protocols for open quantum systems whose dynamics is governed by time-inhomogeneous Lindblad master equations. In the limit of infinitely many steps, one arrives at continuous Pontus-Mpemba protocols. We study the crossover between the quasi-static and the sudden-quench regime, showing the presence of dynamically generated shortcuts achieved for time-dependent dissipation rates. Time-dependent rates can also cause non-Markovian behavior, highlighting the existence of rich dynamical regimes accessible beyond the Markovian framework."

    "abstract": "A growing body of work attempts to evaluate the theory of mind (ToM) abilities of humans and large language models (LLMs) using static, non-interactive question-and-answer benchmarks. However, theoretical work in the field suggests that first-personal interaction is a crucial part of ToM and that such predictive, spectatorial tasks may fail to evaluate it. We address this gap with a novel ToM task that requires an agent to persuade a target to choose one of three policy proposals by strategically revealing information. Success depends on a persuader's sensitivity to a given target's knowledge states (what the target knows about the policies) and motivational states (how much the target values different outcomes). We varied whether these states were Revealed to persuaders or Hidden, in which case persuaders had to inquire about or infer them. In Experiment 1, participants persuaded a bot programmed to make only rational inferences. LLMs excelled in the Revealed condition but performed below chance in the Hidden condition, suggesting difficulty with the multi-step planning required to elicit and use mental state information. Humans performed moderately well in both conditions, indicating an ability to engage such planning. In Experiment 2, where a human target role-played the bot, and in Experiment 3, where we measured whether human targets' real beliefs changed, LLMs outperformed human persuaders across all conditions. These results suggest that effective persuasion can occur without explicit ToM reasoning (e.g., through rhetorical strategies) and that LLMs excel at this form of persuasion. Overall, our results caution against attributing human-like ToM to LLMs while highlighting LLMs' potential to influence people's beliefs and behavior."

As an example, the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL) describes a wealth of one-dimensional quantum systems at low temperatures. Its behavior is deeply rooted in the emergence of an effective Fermi sea, leading to power-law correlations and Friedel oscillations. A promising direction to realize systems exhibiting novel universal behavior beyond TLL is through the generalization of the underlying Fermi sea. In this Letter, we show that fractional Fermi seas with reduced occupancy arise in an integrable Bose gas driven out of equilibrium by cyclic changes in interactions from repulsive to attractive. The correlation functions feature signatures of criticality incompatible with a conventional TLL, suggesting a novel critical phase. Our predictions, based on Generalized Hydrodynamics, are directly relevant to cold atoms."

In this work, we introduce the task of modeling human intervention to support collaborative web task execution. We collect CowCorpus, a dataset of 400 real-user web navigation trajectories containing over 4,200 interleaved human and agent actions. We identify four distinct patterns of user interaction with agents -- hands-off supervision, hands-on oversight, collaborative task-solving, and full user takeover. Leveraging these insights, we train language models (LMs) to anticipate when users are likely to intervene based on their interaction styles, yielding a 61.4-63.4% improvement in intervention prediction accuracy over base LMs. Finally, we deploy these intervention-aware models in live web navigation agents and evaluate them in a user study, finding a 26.5% increase in user-rated agent usefulness. Together, our results show structured modeling of human intervention leads to more adaptive, collaborative agents."

    "abstract": "The atomic properties of heavy, moderately-charged ions are important for a wide variety of applications, including precision tests of fundamental physics and for the study and development of atomic and nuclear clocks. In these systems it is known that relativistic effects, such as the Breit interaction and radiative quantum electrodynamics corrections, are important for an accurate understanding of atomic properties. It is also known that inclusion of correlations alongside the Breit effect is crucial. In this work we include the Breit interaction into all-orders calculations of energy levels and fine structure intervals of ions in the Cs and Fr isoelectronic sequences. This requires modifying the electron Green's function to account for Breit within the all-orders correlation potential method, which sums dominating series of perturbation diagrams exactly using a Feynman diagram technique. We find that Breit corrections to the energies of moderately ionized ions along these sequences are very large, particularly for the f states. We also observe a significant deviation from experiment for these levels. Incorporating Breit into the all-orders correlation potential provides a significant additional contribution beyond including Breit at the second-order level alone. While this does not resolve the disagreement in the energy levels, it does substantially improve the fine-structure intervals beyond what is achieved by including Breit only at second order. Furthermore, we include the frequency-dependent Breit interaction into the Dirac-Fock procedure, and find that this does not significantly modify the energy levels at this order of approximation."

By innovating in the design of input sequences, sparse attention mechanisms, and model topology, ULTRA-HSTU achieves substantial improvements in both model quality and efficiency. Comprehensive benchmarking demonstrates that ULTRA-HSTU achieves remarkable scaling efficiency gains -- over 5x faster training scaling and 21x faster inference scaling compared to conventional models -- while delivering superior recommendation quality.

We argue that Grothendieck topologies, sheaves, and topoi provide a sheaf-theoretic semantics in which distributed and locally held information can be integrated into globally coherent structures. In this setting, local informational states are represented by sections, while the sheaf condition governs consistency, agreement, and consensus across a network. Logical validity and mathematical existence are therefore not imposed externally but arise intrinsically from geometric and categorical conditions. From this perspective, Grothendieck's geometric universes constitute a natural foundation for information networks governed by intrinsic logical principles. Moreover, we propose that Grothendieck's geometric universes themselves concretely instantiate what the author calls \\emph{intrinsic logicism}. This position is intended as a contemporary reconstruction of the classical logicist program of Frege and Russell, reformulated within the framework of category theory and topos theory, where logical structure is generated internally by geometric and categorical organization rather than presupposed as an external foundational layer."

However, ZO optimization has a fundamental tension between accuracy and query efficiency. In this work, we show that ZO optimization can be substantially improved by unifying two complementary principles: (i) a projection-based subspace view that reduces gradient estimation variance by exploiting the intrinsic low-rank structure of model updates, and (ii) Muon-style spectral optimization that applies gradient orthogonalization to extract informative spectral structure from noisy ZO gradients. These findings form a unified framework of subspace gradient orthogonalization, which we instantiate in a new method, ZO-Muon, admitting a natural interpretation as a low-rank Muon optimizer in the ZO setting. Extensive experiments on large language models (LLMs) and vision transformers (ViTs) demonstrate that ZO-Muon significantly accelerates convergence and achieves a win-win improvement in accuracy and query/runtime efficiency. Notably, compared to the popular MeZO baseline, ZO-Muon requires only 24.7% of the queries to reach the same SST-2 performance for LLM fine-tuning, and improves accuracy by 25.1% on ViT-B fine-tuning on CIFAR-100."

We propose TimeOmni-VL, the first vision-centric framework that unifies time series understanding and generation through two key innovations: (1) Fidelity-preserving bidirectional mapping between time series and images (Bi-TSI), which advances Time Series-to-Image (TS2I) and Image-to-Time Series (I2TS) conversions to ensure near-lossless transformations. (2) Understanding-guided generation. We introduce TSUMM-Suite, a novel dataset consists of six understanding tasks rooted in time series analytics that are coupled with two generation tasks. With a calibrated Chain-of-Thought, TimeOmni-VL is the first to leverage time series understanding as an explicit control signal for high-fidelity generation.

In this work, we show that multi-expert L2D is fundamentally more challenging than the single-expert case. With multiple experts, the classifier's underfitting becomes inherent, which seriously degrades prediction performance, whereas in the single-expert setting it arises only under specific conditions. We theoretically reveal that this stems from an intrinsic expert identifiability issue: learning which expert to trust from a diverse pool, a problem absent in the single-expert case and renders existing underfitting remedies failed. To tackle this issue, we propose PiCCE (Pick the Confident and Correct Expert), a surrogate-based method that adaptively identifies a reliable expert based on empirical evidence. PiCCE effectively reduces multi-expert L2D to a single-expert-like learning problem, thereby resolving multi expert underfitting. We further prove its statistical consistency and ability to recover class probabilities and expert accuracies. Extensive experiments across diverse settings, including real-world expert scenarios, validate our theoretical results and demonstrate improved performance."

As a crucial step, we demonstrate optimization of complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) back-end-of-line (BEOL) compatible graphene field-effect transistor (GFET) fabrication and analysis including the gate stack, bottom contact, graphene patterning and encapsulation process steps. The analysis methods include atomic force microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and most importantly electrical characterization. The electrical characterization focuses on comparing different test structures and extraction methods for mobility, contact resistance, IV-curve hysteresis and doping parameters. The comparison shows that the selected measurement test structures and analysis methods can have a large impact on the extracted values and should thus be considered when comparing data sets between different sources. The analysis shows that the optimized process offers high device yield of 98 % with good doping uniformity, contact resistance and mobility as well as low IV-curve hysteresis values on 200 mm wafers."

    "abstract": "Interactive 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) segmentation is essential for real-time editing of pre-reconstructed assets in film and game production. However, existing methods rely on predefined camera viewpoints, ground-truth labels, or costly retraining, making them impractical for low-latency use. We propose B$^3$-Seg (Beta-Bernoulli Bayesian Segmentation for 3DGS), a fast and theoretically grounded method for open-vocabulary 3DGS segmentation under camera-free and training-free conditions. Our approach reformulates segmentation as sequential Beta-Bernoulli Bayesian updates and actively selects the next view via analytic Expected Information Gain (EIG). This Bayesian formulation guarantees the adaptive monotonicity and submodularity of EIG, which produces a greedy $(1{-}1/e)$ approximation to the optimal view sampling policy. Experiments on multiple datasets show that B$^3$-Seg achieves competitive results to high-cost supervised methods while operating end-to-end segmentation within a few seconds. The results demonstrate that B$^3$-Seg enables practical, interactive 3DGS segmentation with provable information efficiency."

    "abstract": "A classical theorem in the theory of minimal surfaces establishes a correspondence between minimal surfaces in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ and null holomorphic curves in $\\mathbb{C}^n$. A hyperbolic version of this correspondence is due to Bryant: null holomorphic curves in ${\\rm SL}(2,\\mathbb{C})$ correspond to CMC-1 surfaces in the hyperbolic space $\\mathbb{H}^3$. We also have a relativistic Bryant type correspondence: CMC-1 immersions in the hyperbolic space are replaced by space-like CMC-1 immersion in the de Sitter space. We prove a mutual generalisation of all these results: let $H$ be a real Lie group, $π:P \\to M$ a principal $H$-bundle, $A$ a connection on $P$ and $α\\in A^1_{\\rm Ad}(P,\\mathfrak{h})$ a tensorial 1-form of type ${\\rm Ad}$ which induces isomorphisms $A_ξ\\to \\mathfrak{h}$. Such a pair $(α,A)$ defines an almost complex structure $J^α_A$ on $P$, which is integrable if and only $(α,A)$ solves a gauge-invariant first order differential system. A non-degenerate symmetric ${\\rm Ad}_H$-invariant bilinear form $g$ on $\\mathfrak{h}$ defines pseudo-Riemannian metrics $g^α_M$, $\\mathfrak{g}^α_A$ on $M$, respectively $P$, and a non-degenerate bilinear form $ω^{α,g}_A:T_P\\times_P T_P\\to \\mathbb{C}$ which is holomorphic when $J^α_A$ is integrable. Assuming that this is the case, we have a Bryant type correspondence between space-like, $ω^{α,g}_A$-isotropic holomorphic immersions $Y\\to P$ and space-like conformal immersions $Y\\to (M,g^α_M)$ whose mean curvature vector field is given by a simple explicit formula. In particular, one obtains such a correspondence for any principal bundle of the form $G\\to G/H$, where $G$ is a complex Lie group, and $H$ is a real form of $G$ endowed with a non-degenerate, ${\\rm Ad}_H$-invariant, symmetric bilinear form $g$ on its Lie-algebra $\\mathfrak{h}$."

This cycle is accelerating, particularly in rapidly evolving domains such as web development and deep learning. However, the impact of competitive relationships among OSS projects on their survival remains unclear, and there are risks of losing a competitive edge to rivals. To address this, this study proposes a new automated method called ``Mutual Impact Analysis of OSS (MIAO)'' to quantify these competitive relationships. The proposed method employs a structural vector autoregressive model and impulse response functions, normally used in macroeconomic analysis, to analyze the interactions among OSS projects. In an empirical analysis involving mining and analyzing 187 OSS project groups, MIAO identified projects that were forced to cease development owing to competitive influences with up to 81\\% accuracy, and the resulting features supported predictive experiments that anticipate cessation one year ahead with up to 77\\% accuracy. This suggests that MIAO could be a valuable tool for OSS project maintainers to understand the dynamics of OSS ecosystems and predict the rise and fall of OSS projects."

    "abstract": "Shapley value-based methods have become foundational in explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), offering theoretically grounded feature attributions through cooperative game theory. However, in practice, particularly in vision tasks, the assumption of feature independence breaks down, as features (i.e., pixels) often exhibit strong spatial and semantic dependencies. To address this, modern SHAP implementations now include the Owen value, a hierarchical generalization of the Shapley value that supports group attributions. While the Owen value preserves the foundations of Shapley values, its effectiveness critically depends on how feature groups are defined. We show that commonly used segmentations (e.g., axis-aligned or SLIC) violate key consistency properties, and propose a new segmentation approach that satisfies the $T$-property to ensure semantic alignment across hierarchy levels. This hierarchy enables computational pruning while improving attribution accuracy and interpretability. Experiments on image and tabular datasets demonstrate that O-Shap outperforms baseline SHAP variants in attribution precision, semantic coherence, and runtime efficiency, especially when structure matters."

    "abstract": "As 6G wireless systems evolve, growing functional complexity and diverse service demands are driving a shift from rule-based control to intent-driven autonomous intelligence. User requirements are no longer captured by a single metric (e.g., throughput or reliability), but by multi-dimensional objectives such as latency sensitivity, energy preference, computational constraints, and service-level requirements. These objectives may also change over time due to environmental dynamics and user-network interactions. Therefore, accurate understanding of both the communication environment and user intent is critical for autonomous and sustainably evolving 6G communications. Large language models (LLMs), with strong contextual understanding and cross-modal reasoning, provide a promising foundation for intent-aware network agents. Compared with rule-driven or centrally optimized designs, LLM-based agents can integrate heterogeneous information and translate natural-language intents into executable control and configuration decisions. Focusing on a closed-loop pipeline of intent perception, autonomous decision making, and network execution, this paper investigates agentic AI for the 6G physical layer and its realization pathways. We review representative physical-layer tasks and their limitations in supporting intent awareness and autonomy, identify application scenarios where agentic AI is advantageous, and discuss key challenges and enabling technologies in multimodal perception, cross-layer decision making, and sustainable optimization. Finally, we present a case study of an intent-driven link decision agent, termed AgenCom, which adaptively constructs communication links under diverse user preferences and channel conditions."

    "abstract": "Piecewise deterministic Markov process samplers are attractive alternatives to Metropolis--Hastings algorithms. A central design question is how to incorporate partial velocity refreshment to ensure ergodicity without injecting excessive noise. Forward Event-Chain Monte Carlo (FECMC) is a generalization of the Bouncy Particle Sampler (BPS) that addresses this issue through a stochastic reflection mechanism, thereby reducing reliance on global refreshment moves. Despite promising empirical performance, its theoretical efficiency remains largely unexplored. We develop a high-dimensional scaling analysis for standard Gaussian targets and prove that the negative log-density (or potential) process of FECMC converges to an Ornstein--Uhlenbeck diffusion, under the same scaling as BPS. We derive closed-form expressions for the limiting diffusion coefficients of both methods by analyzing their associated radial momentum processes and solving the corresponding Poisson equations. These expressions yield a sharp efficiency comparison: the diffusion coefficient of FECMC is strictly larger than that of optimally tuned BPS, and the optimum for FECMC is attained at zero global refreshment. Specifically, they imply an approximately eightfold increase in effective sample size per event over optimal BPS. Numerical experiments confirm the predicted diffusion coefficients and show that the resulting efficiency gains remain substantial for a range of non-Gaussian targets. Finally, as an application of these results, we propose an asymptotic variance estimator for Piecewise deterministic Markov processes that becomes increasingly efficient in high dimensions by extracting information from the velocity variable."

In particular, faint GRBs originating from a distant universe may provide unique insights into the early stages of star formation. However, detecting and localizing such weak sources remains challenging owing to low photon statistics and substantial background noise. Although recent machine learning models address individual aspects of these challenges, they often struggle to balance the trade-off between statistical robustness and noise suppression. Consequently, we propose ComptonUNet, a hybrid deep learning framework that jointly processes raw data and reconstructs images for robust GRB localization. ComptonUNet was designed to operate effectively under conditions of limited photon statistics and strong background contamination by combining the statistical efficiency of direct reconstruction models with the denoising capabilities of image-based architectures. We perform realistic simulations of GRB-like events embedded in background environments representative of low-Earth orbit missions to evaluate the performance of ComptonUNet. Our results demonstrate that ComptonUNet significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving improved localization accuracy across a wide range of low-statistic and high-background scenarios."

We find that AI coding agents exhibit distinct PR description styles, which are associated with differences in reviewer engagement, response time, and merge outcomes. We observe notable variation across agents in both reviewer interaction metrics and merge rates.

The resulting mesoscopic P1 spin ensemble exhibits collective Rabi oscillations and long-lived spin-lock and Hahn-echo coherences.

We develop a transformer backbone that adaptively accommodates heterophily by modulating attention mechanisms through learned topological signals. Central to our contribution is an integrated adversarial propagation engine, where a generative component identifies potential connectivity alterations while a discriminator enforces global coherence. Furthermore, label refinement is achieved through a residual correction scheme guided by per-node confidence metrics, which facilitates precise control over iterative stability. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that this synergistic approach effectively optimizes predictive accuracy across diverse graph distributions while maintaining computational efficiency.

A high-speed imaging system captures the temporal evolution of morphology, shape oscillations, and size reduction of the droplet undergoing evaporation. Our observations reveal that larger droplets exhibit persistent shape oscillations due to the interplay between inertia and surface tension in the presence of convective airflow, which significantly alters the evaporation rate compared to that of a stationary spherical droplet in quiescent air. To quantify the effects of air convection, complex morphology, and shape oscillations of the levitated droplet at different temperatures and humidity, we develop a modified evaporation model that extends the classical $d^2$-law. This model incorporates (i) a generalized Sherwood number that accounts for the variation in Reynolds number, Schmidt number, temperature, and relative humidity and (ii) a shape factor that captures the time-averaged surface area of oscillating droplets. The model is validated against experimental findings across a wide range of droplet sizes and environmental conditions, showing excellent agreement in predicting the temporal evolution of droplet diameter and total evaporation time. Furthermore, we construct a regime map showing the variation in the lifetime of the droplet in the temperature-humidity space. The present study establishes a framework that integrates convective transport and morphological deformation, offering new insights into the microphysics of raindrop evaporation."

However, these agents are prone to a wide range of misbehaviors, such as deviating from the user's instructions, getting stuck in repetitive loops, or failing to use tools correctly. These failures disrupt the development workflow and often require resource-intensive manual intervention. In this paper, we present a system for automatically recovering from agentic misbehaviors at scale. We first introduce a taxonomy of misbehaviors grounded in an analysis of production traffic, identifying three primary categories: Specification Drift, Reasoning Problems, and Tool Call Failures, which we find occur in about 30% of all agent trajectories. To address these issues, we developed a lightweight, asynchronous self-intervention system named Wink. Wink observes agent trajectories and provides targeted course-correction guidance to nudge the agent back to a productive path. We evaluated our system on over 10,000 real world agent trajectories and found that it successfully resolves 90% of the misbehaviors that require a single intervention. Furthermore, a live A/B test in our production environment demonstrated that our system leads to a statistically significant reduction in Tool Call Failures, Tokens per Session and Engineer Interventions per Session. We present our experience designing and deploying this system, offering insights into the challenges of building resilient agentic systems at scale."

    "abstract": "We report a quantitative evaluation of weak-value amplification (WVA) for longitudinal phase measurements using Allan variance analysis. Building on a recent double-slit interferometry experiment with real weak values [Phys. Rev. Lett. 134, 080802 (2025)], our Allan variance analysis demonstrates measurement of a few attosecond time delay approaching the shot noise limit at short averaging intervals of $T$ = $0.01-0.1$ s, representing two orders of magnitude variance reduction compared to the $T=300$ s operating point in prior implementations. We demonstrate that the Allan-variance noise floor scales with the inverse of the detected photon number $1/N_r$, confirming shot-noise-limited operation with WVA. Furthermore, this $1/N_r$ scaling experimentally validates that WVA can outperform conventional measurement under fixed detected photon number and detector saturation, in the presence of technical noise, as theoretically predicted [Phys. Rev. Lett. 118, 070802 (2017)]. Our results provide rigorous, quantitative evidence of the near-optimal noise performance achievable with WVA, establishing a new benchmark for precision optical metrology. This advancement is particularly relevant to applications such as gravitational-wave detection, where signals predominantly occupy the high-frequency regime ($>10$ Hz)."

We present a patch-based framework for spatial authorship attribution within human-robot collaborative painting practice, demonstrated through a forensic case study of one human artist and one robotic system across 15 abstract paintings. Using commodity flatbed scanners and leave-one-painting-out cross-validation, the approach achieves 88.8% patch-level accuracy (86.7% painting-level via majority vote), outperforming texture-based and pretrained-feature baselines (68.0%-84.7%). For collaborative artworks, where ground truth is inherently ambiguous, we use conditional Shannon entropy to quantify stylistic overlap; manually annotated hybrid regions exhibit 64% higher uncertainty than pure paintings (p=0.003), suggesting the model detects mixed authorship rather than classification failure. The trained model is specific to this human-robot pair but provides a methodological grounding for sample-efficient attribution in data-scarce human-AI creative workflows that, in the future, has the potential to extend authorship attribution to any human-robot collaborative painting."

    "abstract": "Detecting anomalies in time-series data is critical in domains such as industrial operations, finance, and cybersecurity, where early identification of abnormal patterns is essential for ensuring system reliability and enabling preventive maintenance. However, most existing methods are reactive: they detect anomalies only after they occur and lack the capability to provide proactive early warning signals. In this paper, we propose FATE (Forecasting Anomalies with Time-series Ensembles), a novel unsupervised framework for detecting Precursors-of-Anomaly (PoA) by quantifying predictive uncertainty from a diverse ensemble of time-series forecasting models. Unlike prior approaches that rely on reconstruction errors or require ground-truth labels, FATE anticipates future values and leverages ensemble disagreement to signal early signs of potential anomalies without access to target values at inference time. To rigorously evaluate PoA detection, we introduce Precursor Time-series Aware Precision and Recall (PTaPR), a new metric that extends the traditional Time-series Aware Precision and Recall (TaPR) by jointly assessing segment-level accuracy, within-segment coverage, and temporal promptness of early predictions. This enables a more holistic assessment of early warning capabilities that existing metrics overlook. Experiments on five real-world benchmark datasets show that FATE achieves an average improvement of 19.9 percentage points in PTaPR AUC and 20.02 percentage points in early detection F1 score, outperforming baselines while requiring no anomaly labels. These results demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of FATE for real-time unsupervised early warning in complex time-series environments."

Here we realize a dual-channel self-referenced scheme enabled by two nearly degenerate quasinormal modes in a hybrid microcavity. Their shared optical path provides common-mode observables (i.e., overall spectral and intensity drift) that track global thermo-optic and pump fluctuations, while their differential-mode observables (i.e., spectral splitting and mode-contrasted emission) remain highly sensitive to local gap dielectric perturbations and dipole-dependent radiative weights. Using temperature as a control parameter in monolayer WSe$ _2 $, we exploit this common/differential-mode framework to robustly invert the relative populations of excitons with out-of-plane ($ \\perp $) and in-plane ($ \\parallel $) dipole transitions without external absolute calibration. At the temperature of $\\sim$50 K, we obtain $ N_\\perp/N_\\parallel \\approx 200 $, coincident with the expected accumulation in the out-of-plane-emitting dark manifold.

Scaling to textbooks and research papers is largely unaddressed, as it requires managing cross-file dependencies, resolving imports, and ensuring that entire projects compile end-to-end. We present M2F (Math-to-Formal), the first agentic framework for end-to-end, project-scale autoformalization in Lean. The framework operates in two stages. The statement compilation stage splits the document into atomic blocks, orders them via inferred dependencies, and repairs declaration skeletons until the project compiles, allowing placeholders in proofs. The proof repair stage closes these holes under fixed signatures using goal-conditioned local edits. Throughout both stages, M2F keeps the verifier in the loop, committing edits only when toolchain feedback confirms improvement. In approximately three weeks, M2F converts long-form mathematical sources into a project-scale Lean library of 153,853 lines from 479 pages textbooks on real analysis and convex analysis, fully formalized as Lean declarations with accompanying proofs. This represents textbook-scale formalization at a pace that would typically require months or years of expert effort. On FATE-H, we achieve $96\\%$ proof success (vs.\\ $80\\%$ for a strong baseline). Together, these results demonstrate that practical, large-scale automated formalization of mathematical literature is within reach.

We consider two canonical behavioral feedback models-best response and quantal response-and study how the information revealed by each model affects the learnability of agents' utilities. We show that under quantal-response feedback the game is learnable, up to a positive affine equivalence class, with logarithmic sample complexity in the desired precision, whereas best-response feedback can only identify a larger set of agents' utilities. We give a complete geometric characterization of this set. Moreover, we introduce a regret notion based on agents' incentives to deviate from recommendations and design an online algorithm with low regret under both feedback models, with bounds scaling linearly in the game dimension and logarithmically in time. Our results lay a theoretical foundation for AI recommendation systems in strategic multi-agent environments, where recommendation compliances are shaped by strategic interaction."

    "abstract": "Multi-path speculative decoding accelerates lossless sampling from a target model by using a cheaper draft model to generate a draft tree of tokens, and then applies a verification algorithm that accepts a subset of these. While prior work has proposed various verification algorithms for i.i.d rollouts, their relative performance under matched settings remains unclear. In this work, we firstly present a systematic evaluation of verification strategies across model families, tasks, and sampling regimes, and find that Traversal Verification dominates consistently, with OT-based methods lagging far behind. Our analysis uncovers that this occurs because OT-based methods achieve high multi-token acceptance near the root of the draft tree, while multi-token gains are most impactful deeper in the draft tree, where draft and target distributions diverge. Based on this insight, we propose delayed tree expansion, which drafts a partial single path, delaying the i.i.d. branching point. We show that delayed tree expansion preserves the target distribution and improves on root-node i.i.d rollouts. Further, we develop a dynamic neural selector that estimates the expected block efficiency of optimal-transport-based verification methods from draft and target features, enabling context-dependent expansion decisions. Our neural selector allows OT-based methods like SpecInfer to outperform Traversal Verification for the first time, achieving 5% higher average throughput across a wide range of models, datasets, and sampling settings."

Under a conjugate odds family and a tree graph assumption, we are able to model the full data distribution elegantly in the sense that for the observed data, we obtain a model that is conjugate from the complete-data, and for the missing entries, we create a simple imputation model.

We formalize and challenge this assumption through latent context-conditioned policies -- models whose outputs depend on unobserved internal variables that are rare under evaluation but prevalent under deployment. We establish fundamental limits showing that no black-box evaluator can reliably estimate deployment risk for such models. (1) Passive evaluation: For evaluators sampling i.i.d. from D_eval, we prove minimax lower bounds via Le Cam's method: any estimator incurs expected absolute error >= (5/24)*delta*L approximately 0.208*delta*L, where delta is trigger probability under deployment and L is the loss gap. (2) Adaptive evaluation: Using a hash-based trigger construction and Yao's minimax principle, worst-case error remains >= delta*L/16 even for fully adaptive querying when D_dep is supported over a sufficiently large domain; detection requires Theta(1/epsilon) queries. (3) Computational separation: Under trapdoor one-way function assumptions, deployment environments possessing privileged information can activate unsafe behaviors that any polynomial-time evaluator without the trapdoor cannot distinguish. For white-box probing, estimating deployment risk to accuracy epsilon_R requires O(1/(gamma^2 * epsilon_R^2)) samples, where gamma = alpha_0 + alpha_1 - 1 measures probe quality, and we provide explicit bias correction under probe error. Our results quantify when black-box testing is statistically underdetermined and provide explicit criteria for when additional safeguards -- architectural constraints, training-time guarantees, interpretability, and deployment monitoring -- are mathematically necessary for worst-case safety assurance."

While the continuous-time NAGD dynamics, specifically the Su-Boyd-Candès ODE, are well understood for convex optimization, their behavior with non-symmetric pseudo-gradient matrices arising in games has not been previously studied. We establish sharp spectral characterizations: stability holds if and only if all eigenvalues of the pseudo-gradient matrix $G$ lie in $\\mathbb{R}_{\\geq 0}$, with the convergence direction additionally requiring diagonalizability of $G$. Remarkably, complex eigenvalues with positive real parts, which ensure stability for first-order gradient dynamics, induce exponential instability in NAGD. This reveals that the momentum mechanism enabling $O(1/t^2)$ convergence in optimization can be detrimental for equilibrium seeking in non-potential games, providing theoretical guidance for algorithm selection."

Additionally, the existing literature has not yet accounted for multi-user perspectives on privacy design and household robots. We aimed to fill this gap by conducting in-person participatory design sessions with 15 households to explore how they would design a privacy-aware household robot based on their concerns and expectations. We found that participants did not trust that robots, or their respective manufacturers, would respect the data privacy of household members or operate in a multi-user ecosystem without jeopardizing users' personal data. Based on these concerns, they generated designs that gave them authority over their data, contained accessible controls and notification systems, and could be customized and tailored to suit the needs and preferences of each user over time.

Existing systems fail to meet these three essential requirements. We present BQT+, a broadband plan measurement framework that replaces monolithic workflows with declarative state/action specifications. BQT+ models querying intent as an interaction state space, formalized as an abstract nondeterministic finite automaton (NFA), and selects execution paths at runtime to accommodate alternative interaction flows and localized interface changes. We show that BQT+ sustains longitudinal monitoring of 64 ISPs, supporting querying for over 100 ISPs.

Across both tasks and a wide range of learning rates, the commutator defect -- a curvature measure derived from non-commuting gradient updates -- rises well before generalization, with lead times following a superlinear power law (alpha approximately 1.18 for SCAN, approximately 1.13 for Dyck), consistent with prior results on modular arithmetic. Weight-space PCA reveals that spectral concentration is not a universal precursor; the commutator defect is. Causal interventions demonstrate a mechanistic role: amplifying non-commutativity accelerates grokking (roughly 32% on SCAN, roughly 50% on Dyck), while suppressing orthogonal gradient flow delays or prevents it. The three task families form a spectrum of causal sensitivity -- modular arithmetic is rigid, Dyck is responsive, SCAN is intermediate -- yet suppression delays or prevents grokking in all cases, establishing necessity as a universal finding. These results identify the commutator defect as a robust, architecture-agnostic, causally implicated early-warning signal for delayed generalization in transformers."

A likelihood-budget decomposition caches per-block contributions so that each local update checks feasibility in constant time rather than recomputing the global constraint at linearly growing cost. This reduces the per-replacement cost from quadratic to linear in the number of groups, and the overall algorithmic complexity from cubic to quadratic under standard assumptions. The decomposition extends naturally beyond independent observations, and we demonstrate this on Markov-structured latent variables.

Recent observations have detected helium triplet absorption in numerous (>20) close-in exoplanets, highlighting the importance of understanding upper atmospheric thermo-chemical structure. While super-solar metallicity has been observed in the atmospheres of some close-in exoplanets, the impact of metal species on both atmospheric escape dynamics and observed absorption features remains poorly understood. In this study, we derive a simplified yet accurate formula for the equivalent width of helium absorption in the limit of an isothermal temperature for the upper atmosphere. Our results demonstrate that planets with lower temperature (metal-rich atmosphere) exhibit lower mass-loss rate although the equivalent width of helium triplet absorption remains largely independent of atmospheric temperature (metallicity) because the low temperatures in these atmospheres enhance the fraction of helium in its triplet state. Additionally, we present a hydrodynamic model based on radiation-hydrodynamics simulations that incorporates the effects of metal cooling. Our analytical model can predict the helium triplet equivalent width of the atmosphere of simulations. The analytical model provides a comprehensive framework for understanding how metal cooling in the upper atmosphere influences the thermo-chemical structure and observable helium features of close-in exoplanetary atmospheres, offering valuable insights for interpreting current and future observational data."

We perform high-resolution two-dimensional Particle-In-Cell (PIC) simulations using a finite-Larmor-radius shear-flow initial configuration. Plasma mixing is quantified using particle tracking, passive tracers, and diagnostics of magnetic reconnection. Mixing across the shear layer is present but localized, occurring mainly in narrow interface regions and plasma structures. Ions mix more effectively than electrons, which remain largely frozen to field lines. Enhanced mixing correlates with localized reconnection within and between KH vortices. Cross-boundary transport driven by the kinetic KHI is highly localized and mediated by vortex advection and reconnection. Electron mixing is strongly constrained, providing an upper bound on kinetic-scale transport across collisionless shear layers."

    "abstract": "Reliable odometry for legged robots without cameras or LiDAR remains challenging due to IMU drift and noisy joint velocity sensing. This paper presents a purely proprioceptive state estimator that uses only IMU and motor measurements to jointly estimate body pose and velocity, with a unified formulation applicable to biped, quadruped, and wheel-legged robots. The key idea is to treat each contacting leg as a kinematic anchor: joint-torque--based foot wrench estimation selects reliable contacts, and the corresponding footfall positions provide intermittent world-frame constraints that suppress long-term drift. To prevent elevation drift during extended traversal, we introduce a lightweight height clustering and time-decay correction that snaps newly recorded footfall heights to previously observed support planes. To improve foot velocity observations under encoder quantization, we apply an inverse-kinematics cubature Kalman filter that directly filters foot-end velocities from joint angles and velocities. The implementation further mitigates yaw drift through multi-contact geometric consistency and degrades gracefully to a kinematics-derived heading reference when IMU yaw constraints are unavailable or unreliable. We evaluate the method on four quadruped platforms (three Astrall robots and a Unitree Go2 EDU) using closed-loop trajectories.

    "abstract": "Condensed water on vertical surfaces ultimately leaves the substrate at the lower edge, where accumulated liquid detaches as drops. While droplet growth and surface transport have been extensively studied, this final release step remains poorly understood and largely uncontrolled. Yet this boundary event determines how and when condensed water is removed. We ask whether geometry can replace randomness as the governing mechanism of edge dripping. By engraving vertical grooves upstream, we redirect water from surface flow into groove-guided drainage toward the boundary. This switch in transport mode changes how liquid accumulates and detaches at the edge. Using rapid forced condensation and high-resolution imaging, we systematically vary groove spacing s, aspect ratio d/w, and orientation. We then analyse how these geometric parameters influence the formation, stability, and spatial organization of droplets hanging below the edge. Smooth substrates exhibit irregular, impact-driven detachment. Grooved substrates produce localized and steady dripping points. When grooves converge, dripping occurs at fixed, geometry-defined locations. For convergent designs, a simple condensation-capillarity model captures the dependence of the dripping period on the area of the drainage basin. Together, these results demonstrate that geometry alone can transform stochastic edge dripping into spatially organized and temporally regular release, with implications for dew harvesting, passive cooling, and millifluidic transport."

    "abstract": "The formation of planetesimals was an integral part of the cascading series of processes that built the terrestrial planets. To illuminate planetesimal formation, here we develop a refined thermal evolution model to calculate the formation ages of meteorite parent planetesimals. This model includes chemical reactions and phase changes during heating, as well as natural variations in the proportions of the constituent phases of these planetesimals. We find that the parent bodies of non-carbonaceous (NC) and carbonaceous (CC) iron meteorites start forming at very similar times (~0.95 Myr after calcium-aluminium-rich inclusion [CAI] formation) and occupy overlapping time windows. NC and CC chondrite parent bodies formed later during non-overlapping periods. We combine these ages with proportions of isotopic end-members we recover from mixing models to construct records of motion throughout the protoplanetary disk. These records argue that NC and CC material traversed the barrier in the disk after ~0.95 Myr after CAI formation. The onset of this motion coincided with planetesimal formation, indicating that the phenomenon that drove motion also triggered planetesimal formation. We argue that this feature also served as the semi-permeable barrier in the disk. Although its identity is uncertain, the effects this phenomenon had on the timing of planetesimal formation and motion through the disk can now serve as constraints on models of disk evolution. Models that reproduce these effects would elucidate the nature and implications of this phenomenon, which is key to unlocking a holistic model of terrestrial planet building."

    "abstract": "Estimating the quantum Fisher information (QFI) is a crucial yet challenging task with widespread applications across quantum science and technologies. The recently proposed Krylov shadow tomography (KST) opens a new avenue for this task by introducing a series of Krylov bounds on the QFI. In this work, we address the practical applicability of the KST, unveiling that the Krylov bounds of low orders already enable efficient and accurate estimation of the QFI. We show that the Krylov bounds converge to the QFI exponentially fast with increasing order and can surpass the state-of-the-art polynomial lower bounds known to date. Moreover, we show that certain low-order Krylov bound can already match the QFI exactly for low-rank states prevalent in practical settings. Such exact match is beyond the reach of polynomial lower bounds proposed previously. These theoretical findings, solidified by extensive numerical simulations, demonstrate practical advantages over existing polynomial approaches, holding promise for fully unlocking the effectiveness of QFI-based applications."

In its conventional formulation, diffraction tomography assumes monochromatic plane wave illumination. This assumption, however, represents a simplification that often fails to reflect practical imaging systems such as medical ultrasound, where focused beams are used to scan a region of interest of the human body. Such measurement setups, combining focused illumination with scanning, have not yet been incorporated into the diffraction tomography framework. To bridge this gap, we extend diffraction tomography by modeling incident fields as Herglotz waves, thereby incorporating focused beams into the theory. Within this setting, we derive a new Fourier diffraction relation, which forms the basis for quantitative tomographic reconstruction from scanning data. Using this result, we systematically analyze how different scan geometries influence the reconstruction."

    "abstract": "Diffraction tomography aims to recover an object's scattering potential from measured wave fields. In the classical setting, the object is illuminated by plane waves from many directions, and the Fourier diffraction theorem gives a direct relation between the Fourier transform of the scattering potential of the object and the Fourier transformed measurements. In many practical imaging systems, however, focused beams are used instead of plane waves. These beams are then translated across the object to bring different regions of interest into focus. The Fourier diffraction relation adapted to this setting differs in one crucial point from the plane-wave case: while certain Fourier coefficients of the measurements still directly correspond to individual Fourier coefficients of the scattering potential, others are given by linear combinations of two Fourier coefficients of the scattering potential. This article investigates which Fourier coefficients of the scattering potential can be uniquely recovered from these relations. We show that in dimensions higher than two, all coefficients appearing in the equations are typically uniquely determined. In two dimensions, however, only part of the Fourier coverage is uniquely recoverable, while on the remaining subset, distinct coefficients can produce identical data."

    "abstract": "In dynamically formed binaries, the spins of the black holes tend to be misaligned with the system's orbital angular momentum. This causes the spins to precess and leads to an asymmetric emission of gravitational waves. The resulting gravitational-wave multipole asymmetries directly source the recoil of the remnant black hole and are the critical element in fully describing precession. Recoil and precession are of significant astrophysical importance, but multipole asymmetries contribute only minimally to the overall signal strength. Consequently, most current gravitational-wave models either do not incorporate asymmetries at all, or only consider the dominant ones. Here we highlight the importance of subdominant multipole asymmetries for an accurate recoil velocity calculation and discuss their detectability with third generation detectors. Neglecting subdominant asymmetries leads to velocity differences of up to 210 km/s and can, in particular, introduce systematic biases in the inference of masses and the spin geometry. We further discuss universal characteristics of subdominant multipole asymmetries in order to prepare the ground for potential future asymmetry models. In the inspiral regime, the average antisymmetric frequencies can be described by a multiple of the orbital frequency. During ringdown, however, they become equal to their corresponding symmetric frequencies."

We developed PersonaMail, a system that addresses these gaps through structured communication factor exploration, granular editing controls, and adaptive reuse of successful strategies. Our evaluation compared PersonaMail against standard LLM interfaces, and showed improved efficiency in both immediate and repeated use, alongside higher user satisfaction.

    "abstract": "In this work we present Polaffini, a robust and versatile framework for anatomically grounded registration. Medical image registration is dominated by intensity-based registration methods that rely on surrogate measures of alignment quality. In contrast, feature-based approaches that operate by identifying explicit anatomical correspondences, while more desirable in theory, have largely fallen out of favor due to the challenges of reliably extracting features. However, such challenges are now significantly overcome thanks to recent advances in deep learning, which provide pre-trained segmentation models capable of instantly delivering reliable, fine-grained anatomical delineations. We aim to demonstrate that these advances can be leveraged to create new anatomically-grounded image registration algorithms. To this end, we propose Polaffini, which obtains, from these segmented regions, anatomically grounded feature points with 1-to-1 correspondence in a particularly simple way: extracting their centroids. These enable efficient global and local affine matching via closed-form solutions. Those are used to produce an overall transformation ranging from affine to polyaffine with tunable smoothness. Polyaffine transformations can have many more degrees of freedom than affine ones allowing for finer alignment, and their embedding in the log-Euclidean framework ensures diffeomorphic properties. Polaffini has applications both for standalone registration and as pre-alignment for subsequent non-linear registration, and we evaluate it against popular intensity-based registration techniques. Results demonstrate that Polaffini outperforms competing methods in terms of structural alignment and provides improved initialisation for downstream non-linear registration. Polaffini is fast, robust, and accurate, making it particularly well-suited for integration into medical image processing pipelines."

We then extend the analysis to Hölder spaces: although the pointwise Hölder exponent of a generic function in $C^α[0, 1]$ is constant, we prove that the collection of functions realizing this behavior is $\\mathfrak{c}$-lineable but cannot form an algebra. Nevertheless, we construct strongly $\\mathfrak{c}$-algebrable families of functions that exhibit Hölder exponent $α$ outside a set of Hausdorff dimension zero.

The model explicitly incorporates stochastic particle transport and scattering processes using validated Geant4 cross-sections, while self-consistently evolving the electric potential and field. As a representative application, we simulate the charging of regolith grains under average dayside conditions on the Moon. The surface of the Moon, in addition to other airless planetary bodies, are regularly exposed to solar ultraviolet photons and solar-wind plasma, creating a radiation environment in which electrostatic interactions among regolith grains become significant. Until now, simulations of regolith charging have often relied on analytical approximations that oversimplify grain geometry and interaction mechanisms. Our Geant4-based simulations reveal charge accumulation within intergrain micro-cavities, leading to repulsive electrostatic forces consistent with experimental observations. The framework establishes a multiscale approach that links microscopic scattering events to the continuity equation of surface charge density and to the formation of macroscopic surface charge patches in complex grain geometries. Although demonstrated here for planetary regolith, the method is general and applicable to a broad range of dielectric charging problems.

On large viral and tumor repertoires SubQuad achieves measured gains in throughput and peak memory usage while preserving or improving recall@k, cluster purity, and subgroup equity.

In response to community feedback, we also release a hard negatives dataset for training dense retrievers, with 1.25M queries across 20 languages. These hard negatives were mined using a two-stage retrieval pipeline and include cross-encoder scores for 200 negatives per query. We further show how this resource enables two primary fine-tuning strategies for dense retrievers: Contrastive Learning with MultipleNegativesRanking loss, and Knowledge Distillation with MarginMSE loss. WebFAQ 2.0 is not a static resource but part of a long-term effort. Since late 2025, structured FAQs are being regularly released through the Open Web Index, enabling continuous expansion and refinement.

This paper examines how controlled, truth-conditionally equivalent lexical and syntactic perturbations affect the absolute performance and relative ranking of 23 contemporary LLMs across three benchmarks: MMLU, SQuAD, and AMEGA. We employ two linguistically principled pipelines to generate meaning-preserving variations: one performing synonym substitution for lexical changes, and another using dependency parsing to determine applicable syntactic transformations. Results show that lexical perturbations consistently induce substantial, statistically significant performance degradation across nearly all models and tasks, while syntactic perturbations have more heterogeneous effects, occasionally improving results. Both perturbation types destabilize model leaderboards on complex tasks. Furthermore, model robustness did not consistently scale with model size, revealing strong task dependence. Overall, the findings suggest that LLMs rely more on surface-level lexical patterns than on abstract linguistic competence, underscoring the need for robustness testing as a standard component of LLM evaluation."

Here we unify the definitions of these three classes of languages into one uniform definition in two ways: via the method of partial orders and via the method of transducers. Thus, for any known class of code-related languages definable via the transducer method, one gets a marginal version of that class.

This formulation results in a fully differentiable likelihood enabling the use of automatic differentiation algorithms, and thus a substantial reduction in computational cost. The method, implemented in the \\ijazz software, allows the simultaneous extraction of scale and resolution parameters across multiple lepton categories defined by detector or kinematic variables. We validate the technique using toy Monte Carlo studies and realistic Pythia-based simulations, demonstrating unbiased parameter recovery and accurate uncertainty estimates. Particular attention is given to categorizations involving lepton transverse momentum, for which a relative-$p_T$ strategy is introduced to mitigate biases induced by category migration and kinematic correlations. The method is further adapted to photon-energy scale measurement in $Z \\to μ^-μ^+γ$ decays. Compared to conventional approaches, the analytical method improves numerical stability, robustness of the minimization, and computational performance, making it well suited for large-scale precision calibration tasks at the LHC."

Conventional hemoglobin assessment relies on invasive blood sampling, limiting its suitability for large-scale or continuous screening.

Four-wavelength PPG signals (660, 730, 850, and 940~nm) are processed to extract optical and cross-wavelength features, which are aggregated at the subject level to avoid data leakage. A gradient boosting regression model is employed to estimate hemoglobin concentration, followed by post-regression anemia screening using World Health Organization (WHO) thresholds. Model interpretability is achieved using SHapley Additive explanations (SHAP), enabling both global and subject-specific analysis of feature contributions. Experimental evaluation on a publicly available dataset demonstrates a mean absolute error of 8.50 plus minus 1.27 and a root mean squared error of 8.21~g/L on unseen test subjects, indicating the potential of the proposed approach for interpretable, non-invasive hemoglobin monitoring and preliminary anemia screening."

We consider three entangling unitaries -- a Haar random unitary and two physically realizable approximations, a finite-depth brickwork random circuit and analog time evolution under nearest-neighbor spin-chain Hamiltonians -- and show that, for the benchmark distributions and system sizes considered, once the entangler produces near-Haar-typical entanglement the model learns the target distribution with weak sensitivity to the scrambler's microscopic origin.

To address this, we propose a Physics Encoded Spatial and Temporal Generative Adversarial Network (PESTGAN) for TC image super-resolution. Specifically, we design a disentangled generator architecture incorporating a PhyCell module, which approximates the vorticity equation via constrained convolutions and encodes the resulting approximate physical dynamics as implicit latent representations to separate physical dynamics from visual textures. Furthermore, a dual-discriminator framework is introduced, employing a temporal discriminator to enforce motion consistency alongside spatial realism. Experiments on the Digital Typhoon dataset for 4$\\times$ upscaling demonstrate that PESTGAN establishes a better performance in structural fidelity and perceptual quality. While maintaining competitive pixel-wise accuracy compared to existing approaches, our method significantly excels in reconstructing meteorologically plausible cloud structures with superior physical fidelity."

    "abstract": "Conventionally, dc fields are used for switching dipole orientations in ferroelectrics. Such fields tilt the potential surface experienced by domain walls and thereby lower activation energies for their movement: escape from tilted potential wells is then realised by thermal excitation, allowing a \"creep\" process of pinning and depinning to develop. Borrowing ideas of domain wall resonance from the magnetic racetrack community, we show that ac fields, applied at the right frequency, can cause switching at much lower field magnitudes than dc ones (by factors of 4-5). Ferroelectric wall motion appears to be overdamped in the system studied (relaxor strontium barium niobate) and so the maximum in switching efficacy observed, at ~100 kHz, cannot be associated with resonant amplification, which needs an underdamped environment. Instead, in this high viscosity system, the frequency at which the maximum switching efficacy occurs seems to represent a compromise between the attempt frequency for wall depinning (which increases with frequency) and the extent to which energy is transferred to the wall within each field cycle (which decreases with frequency). Notwithstanding the absence of true resonance, the observation that ac excitation can dramatically reduce the bias levels needed for ferroelectric switching could still have significant ramifications for low energy memory technology."

    "abstract": "Controlling the longitudinal laser pulse shape in photoinjectors of Free-Electron Lasers is a powerful lever for optimizing electron beam quality, but systematic exploration of the vast design space is limited by the cost of brute-force pulse propagation simulations. We present a generative modeling framework based on Wasserstein Autoencoders to learn a differentiable latent interface between pulse shaping and downstream beam dynamics. Our empirical findings show that the learned latent space is continuous and interpretable while maintaining high-fidelity reconstructions. Pulse families such as higher-order Gaussians trace coherent trajectories, while standardizing the temporal pulse lengths shows a latent organization correlated with pulse energy. Analysis via principal components and Gaussian Mixture Models reveals a well behaved latent geometry, enabling smooth transitions between distinct pulse types via linear interpolation. The model generalizes from simulated data to real experimental pulse measurements, accurately reconstructing pulses and embedding them consistently into the learned manifold. Overall, the approach reduces reliance on expensive pulse-propagation simulations and facilitates downstream beam dynamics simulation and analysis."

However, current approaches face two main issues: 1. The training objective forces models to over-emphasize pixel-level reconstruction, which constrains semantic learning and generalization 2. Reliance on predicted future observations during inference often leads to error accumulation. To address these challenges, we introduce Future Representation Alignment via Parallel Progressive Expansion (FRAPPE). Our method adopts a two-stage fine-tuning strategy: In the mid-training phase, the model learns to predict the latent representations of future observations; In the post-training phase, we expand the computational workload in parallel and align the representation simultaneously with multiple different visual foundation models. By significantly improving fine-tuning efficiency and reducing dependence on action-annotated data, FRAPPE provides a scalable and data-efficient pathway to enhance world-awareness in generalist robotic policies. Experiments on the RoboTwin benchmark and real-world tasks demonstrate that FRAPPE outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and shows strong generalization in long-horizon and unseen scenarios."

Unlike conventional systems that assume stationary base stations, the proposed framework explicitly accounts for receiver mobility, which induces time-varying channel characteristics modeled as a finite-state Markov process. The remote monitoring problem is formulated as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), which is transformed into a tractable belief-state MDP and solved using relative value iteration to obtain optimal sampling and transmission policies. Two estimation strategies are considered: Maximum Likelihood (ML) and Minimum Mean Distortion (MMD). Numerical results demonstrate that incorporating receiver mobility and channel state information into the optimization reduces the average distortion by 10% to 42% compared to baseline policies and constant-channel assumptions, highlighting the importance of base station motion knowledge for effective goal-oriented communication."

Advances in large language models (LLMs) make natural language a practical interface for goal-directed tasks, yet most current web agents operate on low-level primitives such as clicks and keystrokes. These operations are brittle, inefficient, and difficult to verify. Complementing content-oriented efforts such as NLWeb's semantic layer for retrieval, we argue that the agentic web also requires a semantic layer for web actions. We propose \\textbf{Web Verbs}, a web-scale set of typed, semantically documented functions that expose site capabilities through a uniform interface, whether implemented through APIs or robust client-side workflows. These verbs serve as stable and composable units that agents can discover, select, and synthesize into concise programs. This abstraction unifies API-based and browser-based paradigms, enabling LLMs to synthesize reliable and auditable workflows with explicit control and data flow. Verbs can carry preconditions, postconditions, policy tags, and logging support, which improves \\textbf{reliability} by providing stable interfaces, \\textbf{efficiency} by reducing dozens of steps into a few function calls, and \\textbf{verifiability} through typed contracts and checkable traces. We present our vision, a proof-of-concept implementation, and representative case studies that demonstrate concise and robust execution compared to existing agents. Finally, we outline a roadmap for standardization to make verbs deployable and trustworthy at web scale."

However, existing methods struggle to generate multiple high-quality explanations that (1) affect only a small portion of the features, (2) can be applied to tabular data with heterogeneous features, and (3) are consistent with the user-defined constraints. We propose CounterFlowNet, a generative approach that formulates CF generation as sequential feature modification using conditional Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNet). CounterFlowNet is trained to sample CFs proportionally to a user-specified reward function that can encode key CF desiderata: validity, sparsity, proximity and plausibility, encouraging high-quality explanations. The sequential formulation yields highly sparse edits, while a unified action space seamlessly supports continuous and categorical features. Moreover, actionability constraints, such as immutability and monotonicity of features, can be enforced at inference time via action masking, without retraining. Experiments on eight datasets under two evaluation protocols demonstrate that CounterFlowNet achieves superior trade-offs between validity, sparsity, plausibility, and diversity with full satisfaction of the given constraints."

Some of this uncertainty is structural, as most climate models neglect increasing meltwater from the Greenland ice sheet and do not explicitly capture mesoscale ocean eddies. Here, we quantify the impact of Greenland meltwater on the AMOC until 2100 under SSP5-8.5 forcing for the first time in a strongly eddying (1/10° horizontal resolution) ocean model. The meltwater-induced additional AMOC weakening is small (0.6 $\\pm$ 0.2 Sv) compared to the weakening due to warming alone, and similar at high and low resolution. The same meltwater would cause a stronger AMOC weakening under present-day climate conditions. We link both resolution-independence and state-dependence to large-scale controls of the AMOC. Our results demonstrate that the background ocean state is more important than resolution in determining how Greenland meltwater affects the AMOC."

In the regime where the elastic constant tends to zero and the temperature is below the nematic-isotropic transition threshold, the bulk and surface energy enforce the energy minimizers to be uniaxial, with director fields lying in the tangent plane to the boundary in the sense of trace. We establish that the singular set of the limiting minimizer within the closure of the domain is a finite set by studying the associated harmonic map with a strong tangential boundary constraint. The structure of the singularities located on the boundary is also investigated."

Our results demonstrate that linear classifiers achieve approximately 95% mean accuracy across all Bloom levels, providing strong evidence that cognitive level is encoded in a linearly accessible subspace of the model's representations. These findings provide evidence that the model resolves the cognitive difficulty of a prompt early in the forward pass, with representations becoming increasingly separable across layers."

    "abstract": "As large language models (LLMs) continue to grow in size, fewer users are able to host and run models locally. This has led to increased use of third-party hosting services. However, in this setting, there is a lack of guarantees on the computation performed by the inference provider. For example, a dishonest provider may replace an expensive large model with a cheaper-to-run weaker model and return the results from the weaker model to the user. Existing tools to verify inference typically rely on methods from cryptography such as zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), but these add significant computational overhead, and remain infeasible for use for large models. In this work, we develop a new insight -- that given a method for performing private LLM inference, one can obtain forms of verified inference at marginal extra cost. Specifically, we propose two new protocols which leverage privacy-preserving LLM inference in order to provide guarantees over the inference that was carried out. Our approaches are cheap, requiring the addition of a few extra tokens of computation, and have little to no downstream impact. As the fastest privacy-preserving inference methods are typically faster than ZK methods, the proposed protocols also improve verification runtime. Our work provides novel insights into the connections between privacy and verifiability in LLM inference."

    "abstract": "Nonequilibrium manipulation of quantum materials via electromagnetic dressing provides an on-demand route to tailoring electronic band structures through Floquet engineering. Time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy offers a direct means to probe these light-dressed electronic states. In such photoemission experiments, dressing can also occur for quasi-free electrons outside the material, giving rise to Volkov states. In certain cases, strong surface screening reduces the penetration of the driving field into the solid, resulting in Volkov contributions that dominate over Floquet ones. In this work, we systematically investigate the influence of materials' dielectric properties on Floquet-Volkov dressing of semiconductors, focusing on bulk layered van der Waals materials GeS, SnS, and 2H-WSe$_2$. First, by combining a simple model based on Fresnel equations with an electron-scattering description of Volkov amplitudes, we use polarization-dependent Volkov sideband intensities to extract a lower bound for the real part of the materials' dielectric functions, which typically lie between the reported dielectric constants for monolayer and bulk crystals. We demonstrate that increasing the fluence of the pump laser enables the generation of high-order Volkov sidebands which exhibit clear signatures of nonlinear light-matter interactions. Finally, we show that for our experimental geometry, the quasi-transparent nature of semiconductors in below-band-gap driving regime allows the optical pump to propagate within the sample and undergo multiple total internal reflections, producing temporally delayed Volkov replicas in pump-probe measurements via dressing of photoelectrons by evanescent fields. These systematic studies uncover previously unexplored aspects of Floquet-Volkov dressing in solids, highlighting the role of dielectric screening of the driving field."

In this hierarchical system, the HAPS and the cloud server charges the ground users and the HAPS for the use of the spectrum and the computing of their tasks respectively. Each tier seeks to maximize their own utility in a selfish manner. To encourage the prompt computation of the tasks, a local delay cost is assumed.

Built on a PyTorch backend, our forward model integrates an auto-differentiable finite-differences micromagnetic framework with FFT-based stray-field calculations and Fourier-space upward continuation. This enables efficient gradient-based optimization via the adjoint method and allows the sensor-sample distance to be treated as an optimization parameter. By doing so, we eliminate the experimental uncertainty arising from unknown NV implantation depths and surface oxidation layers. Validation on synthetic data demonstrates high-fidelity reconstruction of spin textures and precise sensor height estimation. Furthermore, when applied to NV measurements of the van der Waals ferromagnet $Fe_{3-x}GaTe_2$, the method reconstructs the previously unknown NV-sample distance and physically plausible magnetization textures, which accurately reproduce the experimental observations."

    "abstract": "Robust control of mechanical systems with multiple uncertainties remains a fundamental challenge, particularly when nonlinear dynamics and operating-condition variations are intricately intertwined. While deep reinforcement learning (DRL) combined with domain randomization has shown promise in mitigating the sim-to-real gap, simultaneously handling all sources of uncertainty often leads to sub-optimal policies and poor learning efficiency. This study formulates a new curriculum-based continual learning framework for robust control problems involving nonlinear dynamical systems in which multiple sources of uncertainty are simultaneously superimposed. The key idea is to decompose a complex control problem with multiple uncertainties into a sequence of continual learning tasks, in which strategies for handling each uncertainty are acquired sequentially. The original system is extended into a finite set of plants whose dynamic uncertainties are gradually expanded and diversified as learning progresses. The policy is stably updated across the entire plant sets associated with tasks defined by different uncertainty configurations without catastrophic forgetting. To ensure learning efficiency, we jointly incorporate a model-based controller (MBC), which guarantees a shared baseline performance across the plant sets, into the learning process to accelerate the convergence. This residual learning scheme facilitates task-specific optimization of the DRL agent for each uncertainty, thereby enhancing sample efficiency. As a practical industrial application, this study applies the proposed method to designing an active vibration controller for automotive powertrains. We verified that the resulting controller is robust against structural nonlinearities and dynamic variations, realizing successful sim-to-real transfer."

Existing augmentation approaches typically operate at the representation or semantic level and remain agnostic to the reward model's estimation difficulty. In this paper, we propose MARS, an adaptive, margin-aware augmentation and sampling strategy that explicitly targets ambiguous and failure modes of the reward model. Our proposed framework, MARS, concentrates augmentation on low-margin (ambiguous) preference pairs where the reward model is most uncertain, and iteratively refines the training distribution via hard-sample augmentation. We provide theoretical guarantees showing that this strategy increases the average curvature of the loss function hence enhance information and improves conditioning, along with empirical results demonstrating consistent gains over uniform augmentation for robust reward modeling."

This is the case for a canonical problem: estimating the amplitude and frequency of an AC magnetic field, where the generators are parallel to each other. Here, we introduce a quantum control protocol that resolves this singularity. Our control protocol strategically engineers the sensor's time evolution so the generators for the two parameters become orthogonal. It not only removes the singularity but also restores the optimal scaling of precision with interrogation time for both parameters simultaneously. We experimentally validate this protocol using a nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond at room temperature, demonstrating the concurrent achievement of the optimal scaling for both parameters under realistic conditions."

Complementing these separations, we show that for any total problem $R$, pseudo-deterministic quantum algorithms admit at most a quintic advantage over deterministic algorithms, i.e., $D(R) = \\tilde O(psQ(R)^5)$. On the algorithmic side, we identify a class of quantum search problems that can be made pseudo-deterministic with small overhead, including Grover search, element distinctness, triangle finding, $k$-sum, and graph collision."

    "abstract": "Modern offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods find performant actor-critics, however, fine-tuning these actor-critics online with value-based RL algorithms typically causes immediate drops in performance. We provide evidence consistent with the hypothesis that, in the loss landscape, offline maxima for prior algorithms and online maxima are separated by low-performance valleys that gradient-based fine-tuning traverses. Following this, we present Score Matched Actor-Critic (SMAC), an offline RL method designed to learn actor-critics that transition to online value-based RL algorithms with no drop in performance. SMAC avoids valleys between offline and online maxima by regularizing the Q-function during the offline phase to respect a first-order derivative equality between the score of the policy and action-gradient of the Q-function. We experimentally demonstrate that SMAC converges to offline maxima that are connected to better online maxima via paths with monotonically increasing reward found by first-order optimization. SMAC achieves smooth transfer to Soft Actor-Critic and TD3 in 6/6 D4RL tasks. In 4/6 environments, it reduces regret by 34-58% over the best baseline."

A key challenge in cryo-EM is characterizing continuous heterogeneity, where molecules adopt a continuum of conformational states. Covariance-based methods offer a principled approach to modeling structural variability. However, estimating the covariance matrix efficiently remains a challenging computational task. In this paper, we present SOLVAR (Stochastic Optimization for Low-rank Variability Analysis), which leverages a low-rank assumption on the covariance matrix to provide a tractable estimator for its principal components, despite the apparently prohibitive large size of the covariance matrix. Under this low-rank assumption, our estimator can be formulated as an optimization problem that can be solved quickly and accurately. Moreover, our framework enables refinement of the poses of the input particle images, a capability absent from most heterogeneity-analysis methods, and all covariance-based methods. Numerical experiments on both synthetic and experimental datasets demonstrate that the algorithm accurately captures dominant components of variability while maintaining computational efficiency. SOLVAR achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets in a recent heterogeneity benchmark. The code of the algorithm is freely available at https://github.com/RoeyYadgar/SOLVAR."

Using the decade-long multi-band observations from the Swift observatory, we capture a clear spectral state transition analogous to those seen in X-ray binaries but seldom observed in a single AGN. We track a complete AGN state transition in real time, as the source evolves from a faint, hard X-ray state to a bright, UV- and soft X-ray dominated phase. The X-ray loudness parameter $α_{ox}$ follows a pronounced 'V'-shaped dependence on Eddington ratio $λ_{Edd}$, with a break at $λ_{Edd}$ = 0.021 +/- 0.008, coinciding with thresholds identified in population studies of changing-look quasars and X-ray binaries. Across this transition, Mkn 590 evolves through distinct accretion regimes in the Hardness Intensity Diagrams (HID): faint, flaring, transitional, and bright, on a timescale of $\\sim$10 years, which is well below classical viscous timescales for a geometrically thin disk but in agreement with the propagation of thermal wavefronts in the inner disk. When placed on the Fundamental Plane of black hole activity, the source broadly follows the expected radio/X-ray mass scaling, though with a 70% flatter slope, pointing towards a persistent coronal-jet coupling even in radiatively efficient states. Together, our results establish Mkn 590 as a rare, time-resolved case of AGN state transitions and offer compelling evidence for scale-invariant accretion physics across the black hole mass spectrum."

    "abstract": "Continual Learning (CL) with large-scale pre-trained models (PTMs) has recently gained wide attention, shifting the focus from training from scratch to continually adapting PTMs. This has given rise to a promising paradigm: parameter-efficient continual learning (PECL), where task interference is typically mitigated by assigning a task-specific module during training, such as low-rank adapters. However, weight regularization techniques, such as Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC)-a key strategy in CL-remain underexplored in this new paradigm. In this paper, we revisit weight regularization in low-rank CL as a new perspective for mitigating task interference in PECL. Unlike existing low-rank CL methods, we mitigate task interference by regularizing a shared low-rank update through EWC, thereby keeping the storage requirement and inference costs constant regardless of the number of tasks. Our proposed method EWC-LoRA leverages a low-rank representation to estimate parameter importance over the full-dimensional space. This design offers a practical, computational- and memory-efficient solution for CL with PTMs, and provides insights that may inform the broader application of regularization techniques within PECL. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of EWC-LoRA, achieving a stability-plasticity trade-off superior to existing low-rank CL approaches. These results indicate that, even under low-rank parameterizations, weight regularization remains an effective mechanism for mitigating task interference.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown great potential for extending vision-language reasoning to professional tool-based image editing, enabling intuitive and creative editing. A promising direction is to use reinforcement learning (RL) to enable MLLMs to reason about and execute optimal tool-use plans within professional image-editing software. However, training remains challenging due to the lack of reliable, verifiable reward signals that can reflect the inherently subjective nature of creative editing. In this work, we introduce RetouchIQ, a framework that performs instruction-based executable image editing through MLLM agents guided by a generalist reward model. RetouchIQ interprets user-specified editing intentions and generates corresponding, executable image adjustments, bridging high-level aesthetic goals with precise parameter control. To move beyond conventional, rule-based rewards that compute similarity against a fixed reference image using handcrafted metrics, we propose a generalist reward model, an RL fine-tuned MLLM that evaluates edited results through a set of generated metrics on a case-by-case basis. Then, the reward model provides scalar feedback through multimodal reasoning, enabling reinforcement learning with high-quality, instruction-consistent gradients. We curate an extended dataset with 190k instruction-reasoning pairs and establish a new benchmark for instruction-based image editing. Experiments show that RetouchIQ substantially improves both semantic consistency and perceptual quality over previous MLLM-based and diffusion-based editing systems. Our findings demonstrate the potential of generalist reward-driven MLLM agents as flexible, explainable, and executable assistants for professional image editing."

While neuroimaging-based brain network analysis is promising, atlas-based representations may obscure individualized anatomy. Gyral folding-based networks using three-hinge gyri provide a biologically grounded alternative, but inter-individual variability in cortical folding results in inconsistent landmark correspondence and highly irregular network sizes, violating the fixed-topology and node-alignment assumptions of most existing graph learning methods, particularly in clinical datasets where pathological changes further amplify anatomical heterogeneity. We therefore propose a probability-invariant random-walk-based framework that classifies individualized gyral folding networks without explicit node alignment. Cortical similarity networks are built from local morphometric features and represented by distributions of anonymized random walks, with an anatomy-aware encoding that preserves permutation invariance. Experiments on a large clinical cohort of AD and LBD subjects show consistent improvements over existing gyral folding and atlas-based models, demonstrating robustness and potential for dementia diagnosis."

While existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) often infer event relations through dense captions or video summaries for video reasoning, such modeling still lacks causal understanding. Without explicit causal structure modeling within and across video events, these models suffer from hallucinations during the video reasoning. In this work, we propose GraphThinker, a reinforcement finetuning-based method that constructs structural event-level scene graphs and enhances visual grounding to jointly reduce hallucinations in video reasoning. Specifically, we first employ an MLLM to construct an event-based video scene graph (EVSG) that explicitly models both intra- and inter-event relations, and incorporate these formed scene graphs into the MLLM as an intermediate thinking process. We also introduce a visual attention reward during reinforcement finetuning, which strengthens video grounding and further mitigates hallucinations. We evaluate GraphThinker on two datasets, RexTime and VidHalluc, where it shows superior ability to capture object and event relations with more precise event localization, reducing hallucinations in video reasoning compared to prior methods."

We address two fundamental questions: Can we train Large Language Models (LLMs) modularly-combining small, domain-specific experts to match monolithic performance-and can we do so robustly for any data mixture, eliminating heuristic tuning? We present a theoretical framework for modular generative modeling where a set of pre-trained experts are combined via a gating mechanism. We define the space of normalized gating functions, $G_{1}$, and formulate the problem as a minimax game to find a single robust gate that minimizes divergence to the worst-case data mixture. We prove the existence of such a robust gate using Kakutani's fixed-point theorem and show that modularity acts as a strong regularizer, with generalization bounds scaling with the lightweight gate's complexity. Furthermore, we prove that this modular approach can theoretically outperform models retrained on aggregate data, with the gap characterized by the Jensen-Shannon Divergence. Finally, we introduce a scalable Stochastic Primal-Dual algorithm and a Structural Distillation method for efficient inference. Empirical results on synthetic and real-world datasets confirm that our modular architecture effectively mitigates gradient conflict and can robustly outperform monolithic baselines."

We establish robust convergence guarantees. Under mere convexity, the proposed methods converge with a sublinear rate. Under strong convexity of the sum-function, and assuming the nonsmooth component is partly smooth, we further prove linear convergence.

Simply propagating problem-level correctness to all associated KCs obscures partial mastery and often leads to poorly fitted learning curves. To address this challenge, we propose an automated framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to label KC-level correctness directly from student-written code. Our method assesses whether each KC is correctly applied and further introduces a temporal context-aware Code-KC mapping mechanism to better align KCs with individual student code. We evaluate the resulting KC-level correctness labels in terms of learning curve fit and predictive performance using the power law of practice and the Additive Factors Model. Experimental results show that our framework leads to learning curves that are more consistent with cognitive theory and improves predictive performance, compared to baselines. Human evaluation further demonstrates substantial agreement between LLM and expert annotations."

The field has largely converged on three public multi-label benchmarks (PTB-XL, CPSC2018, CSN) dominated by arrhythmia and waveform-morphology labels, even though the ECG is known to encode substantially broader clinical information. We argue that downstream evaluation should expand to include an assessment of structural heart disease and patient-level forecasting, in addition to other evolving ECG-related endpoints, as relevant clinical targets. Next, we outline evaluation best practices for multi-label, imbalanced settings, and show that when they are applied, the literature's current conclusion about which representations perform best is altered. Furthermore, we demonstrate the surprising result that a randomly initialized encoder with linear evaluation matches state-of-the-art pre-training on many tasks. This motivates the use of a random encoder as a reasonable baseline model. We substantiate our observations with an empirical evaluation of three representative ECG pre-training approaches across six evaluation settings: the three standard benchmarks, a structural disease dataset, hemodynamic inference, and patient forecasting."

This can be achieved without the need for obvious morphological or structural asymmetries in the form of the organism, or in the number or organisation of propulsion-generating appendages such as cilia. In this work, we identify and validate a core principle of asymmetric turning in biflagellate microswimmers: propulsive forces interact constructively to drive translation whilst interacting destructively to drive rotation. We explore the ramifications of this tunable biflagellar swimming mechanism across a range of systems, from a simple, back-of-the-envelope model to a detailed computational representation of an exemplar swimmer. This leads to a markedly general quantitative relation between key drivers of asymmetry, such as ciliary beat frequency, and the curvature of emergent trajectories. We discuss how the model green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, which actuates its two cilia in a symmetric breaststroke for forward swimming, may exploit this feature for phototaxis. Finally, we validate our predictions in a Chlamydomonas-inspired robophysical model, implementing closed-loop control to achieve phototactic turning."

Yet IR remains human-centred, with systems, evaluation metrics, user models, and datasets designed around human queries and behaviours. Consequently, IR operates under assumptions that no longer hold in practice, with changes to workload volumes, predictability, and querying behaviours. This misalignment affects system performance and optimisation: caching may lose effectiveness, query pre-processing may add overhead without improving results, and standard metrics may mismeasure satisfaction. Without adaptation, retrieval models risk satisfying neither humans, nor the emerging user segment of agents. However, datasets capturing agent search behaviour are lacking, which is a critical gap given IR's historical reliance on data-driven evaluation and optimisation. We develop a methodology for collecting all the data produced and consumed by agentic retrieval-augmented systems when answering queries, and we release the Agentic Search Queryset (ASQ) dataset. ASQ contains reasoning-induced queries, retrieved documents, and thoughts for queries in HotpotQA, Researchy Questions, and MS MARCO, for 3 diverse agents and 2 retrieval pipelines.

    "abstract": "This work presents a practical benchmarking framework for optimizing artificial intelligence (AI) models on ARM Cortex processors (M0+, M4, M7), focusing on energy efficiency, accuracy, and resource utilization in embedded systems. Through the design of an automated test bench, we provide a systematic approach to evaluate across key performance indicators (KPIs) and identify optimal combinations of processor and AI model. The research highlights a nearlinear correlation between floating-point operations (FLOPs) and inference time, offering a reliable metric for estimating computational demands. Using Pareto analysis, we demonstrate how to balance trade-offs between energy consumption and model accuracy, ensuring that AI applications meet performance requirements without compromising sustainability. Key findings indicate that the M7 processor is ideal for short inference cycles, while the M4 processor offers better energy efficiency for longer inference tasks. The M0+ processor, while less efficient for complex AI models, remains suitable for simpler tasks. This work provides insights for developers, guiding them to design energy-efficient AI systems that deliver high performance in realworld applications."

    "abstract": "In the three-body problem with positive energy, solutions which avoid triple collision have the property that the size of the triangle formed by the bodies tends to infinity as $t\\rightarrow \\pm\\infty$. Furthermore, the triangles have well-defined asymptotic shapes $s_\\pm$. The scattering problems asks which asymptotic shape $s_+$ can occur for a given choice of $s_-$. Previous work shows that this can be viewed as the problem of finding heteroclinic orbits connecting equilibrium points on a boundary manifold ``at infinity'' and some results were obtained for solutions which avoid collisions. The goal of this paper is to study the scattering effect of binary and near-triple collisions in a simple setting -- the isosceles three-body problem. The details depend on the mass parameters but in many cases, a fixed isosceles initial shape $s_-$ scatters to essentially all possible isosceles shapes $s_+$."

The origin of the cosmological constant from a quantum perspective remains unresolved, with a discrepancy of approximately 120 orders of magnitude between its observed value and theoretical estimates. Motivated by earlier work of Gibbons, we analyze the cosmological constant problem within a quantum-gravitational framework based on Schwarzian theory and its ensemble averaging. We then derive the phenomenological value of the dark energy density and obtain the corresponding equation of state. In this model, the cosmological constant arises from the ensemble average of time-reparametrization modes."

    "abstract": "Electro-Ribbon Actuators (ERAs) are lightweight flexural actuators that exhibit ultrahigh displacement and fast movement. However, their embedded sensing relies on capacitive sensors with limited precision, which hinders accurate control. We introduce OS-ERA, an optically sensorized ERA that yields reliable proprioceptive information, and we focus on the design and integration of a sensing solution without affecting actuation. To analyse the complex curvature of an ERA in motion, we design and embed two soft optical waveguide sensors. A classifier is trained to map the sensing signals in order to distinguish eight bending states. We validate our model on six held-out trials and compare it against signals' trajectories learned from training runs. Across all tests, the sensing output signals follow the training manifold, and the predicted sequence mirrors real performance and confirms repeatability. Despite deliberate train-test mismatches in actuation speed, the signal trajectories preserve their shape, and classification remains consistently accurate, demonstrating practical voltage- and speed-invariance. As a result, OS-ERA classifies bending states with high fidelity; it is fast and repeatable, solving a longstanding bottleneck of the ERA, enabling steps toward closed-loop control."

More specifically, PEACE 2.0 has three main new functionalities: leveraging a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline i) to ground HS explanations into evidence and facts, ii) to automatically generate evidence-grounded counter-speech, and iii) exploring the characteristics of counter-speech replies. By integrating these capabilities, PEACE 2.0 enables in-depth analysis and response generation for both explicit and implicit hateful messages."

    "abstract": "Modern language models (LMs) increasingly require two critical resources: computational resources and data resources. Data selection techniques can effectively reduce the amount of training data required for fine-tuning LMs. However, their effectiveness is closely related to computational resources, which always require a high compute budget. Owing to the resource limitations in practical fine-tuning scenario, we systematically reveal the relationship between data selection and uncertainty estimation of selected data. Although large language models (LLMs) exhibit exceptional capabilities in language understanding and generation, which provide new ways to alleviate data scarcity, evaluating data usability remains a challenging task. This makes efficient data selection indispensable. To mitigate these issues, we propose Entropy-Based Unsupervised Data Selection (EUDS) framework. Empirical experiments on sentiment analysis (SA), topic classification (Topic-CLS), and question answering (Q&A) tasks validate its effectiveness. EUDS establishes a computationally efficient data-filtering mechanism. Theoretical analysis and experimental results confirm the effectiveness of our approach. EUDS significantly reduces computational costs and improves training time efficiency with less data requirement. This provides an innovative solution for the efficient fine-tuning of LMs in the compute-constrained scenarios."

    "abstract": "Superposition is the core feature that sets quantum theory apart from classical physics. Here, we investigate whether sets of quantum measurements can be modelled by using only devices that are operationally classical, in the sense that they have no superposition properties. This leads us to propose classical measurement models, which we show to be stronger than commutative measurements but weaker than joint measurability. We determine both the exact depolarisation noise rate and the measurement loss rate at which the all projective measurements in $d$-dimensional quantum theory admit a classical model. For finite sets of quantum measurements we develop methods both for constructing classical models and for falsifying the existence of such model via prepare-and-measure setups. Furthermore, we show that this concept also has operational implications. For that, we consider whether quantum measurements with classical side-information can be implemented in sequence without causing a disturbance and we show that classical models imply an affirmative answer. Our work sheds light on superposition as a resource for quantum measurement devices."

In this paper, we present a large-scale automated analysis of open-source CTI reports spanning two decades. We develop a high-precision, LLM-based pipeline to ingest and structure 13,308 reports, extracting key entities such as attributed threat actors, motivations, victims, reporting vendors, and technical indicators (IoCs and TTPs). Our analysis quantifies the evolution of CTI information density and specialization, characterizing patterns that relate specific threat actors to motivations and victim profiles. Furthermore, we perform a meta-analysis of the CTI industry itself. We identify a fragmented ecosystem of distinct silos where vendors demonstrate significant geographic and sectoral reporting biases. Our marginal coverage analysis reveals that intelligence overlap between vendors is typically low: while a few core providers may offer broad situational awareness, additional sources yield diminishing returns. Overall, our findings characterize the structural biases inherent in the CTI ecosystem, enabling practitioners and researchers to better evaluate the completeness of their intelligence sources."

Using a continuum Dirac model, we go beyond the Born approximation by computing the exact scattering matrix for individual impurities. This captures the full nonperturbative physics of smooth disorder. From the exact scattering data, we evaluate transport coefficients by solving the Boltzmann equation with energy-resolved phase shifts. We analyze electrical and electronic thermal conductivities versus carrier density and temperature, including deviations from the Wiedemann-Franz law. Our results reveal that finite-range disorder nontrivially modifies charge and heat currents, especially at low energies where perturbative methods fail. These findings provide a more accurate transport characterization for disordered Dirac materials and clarify how smooth disorder governs energy flow in graphene."

It includes 50+ state-of-the-art algorithms, 40 metrics, and 19 filtering and splitting strategies that seamlessly transition from local execution to distributed training and optimization. The framework enforces ecological responsibility by integrating CodeCarbon for real-time energy tracking, showing that scalability need not come at the cost of scientific integrity or sustainability. Furthermore, WarpRec anticipates the shift toward Agentic AI, leading Recommender Systems to evolve from static ranking engines into interactive tools within the Generative AI ecosystem.

We introduce \\textsc{\\texttt{HistoricalMisinfo}}, a curated dataset of $500$ contested events from $45$ countries, each paired with a factual reference narrative and a documented revisionist reference narrative. To approximate real-world usage, we instantiate each event in $11$ prompt scenarios that reflect common communication settings (e.g., questions, textbooks, social posts, policy briefs). Using an LLM-as-a-judge protocol that compares model outputs to the two references, we evaluate LLMs varying across model architectures in two conditions: (i) neutral user prompts that ask for factually accurate information, and (ii) robustness prompts in which the user explicitly requests the revisionist version of the event. Under neutral prompts, models are generally closer to factual references, though the resulting scores should be interpreted as reference-alignment signals rather than definitive evidence of human-interpretable revisionism. Robustness prompting yields a strong and consistent effect: when the user requests the revisionist narrative, all evaluated models show sharply higher revisionism scores, indicating limited resistance or self-correction. \\textsc{\\texttt{HistoricalMisinfo}} provides a practical foundation for benchmarking robustness to revisionist framing and for guiding future work on more precise automatic evaluation of contested historical claims to ensure a sustainable integration of AI systems within society."

    "abstract": "Classically, a charged particle in a magnetic field emits radiation, losing momentum and experiencing the Abraham-Lorentz (AL) / Landau-Lifshitz (LL) radiation reaction (RR) force. However, at atomic scales and outside the range of their applicability, the AL/LL equations fail and RR destroys the coherent state of an electron-undermining the very concept of a RR force. This process can be described by the coupled Schrödinger-Maxwell (SM) system under appropriate limits, but the system's nonlinear complexity has long limited purely analytical studies. We present geometric structure-preserving algorithms for the SM system that preserve gauge invariance, symplecticity, and unitarity on the discrete space-time lattice, which are implemented in our Structure-Preserving scHrodINger maXwell (SPHINX) code. By constructing coherent states from the Landau levels, SPHINX simulates the fully-coupled nonlinear dynamics of an electron coherent state, the energy partition evolution, and decoherence/relaxation of the electron wave packet in time due to RR. These simulations indicate that, in an external magnetic field, an electron prepared in an atomic-scale coherent state can radiate strongly, rapidly losing coherence and dispersing into a decoherent wave packet. Additionally, we also present the fully-coupled nonlinear evolution of the non-degenerate ground- and first-excited Landau levels themselves to understand how the coupled SM system modifies the well-known ideal (i.e., Schrödinger-only) dynamics of the Landau Levels. With appropriate boundary conditions, simulations show that the Landau levels are renormalized into stationary dressed eigenstates with constant electromagnetic and kinetic energies. This opens a new computational window into RR physics and advances modeling of extreme-field phenomena in fusion plasmas, astrophysics, and next-generation laser experiments"

However, existing datasets primarily focus on event resolution and employ a narrow definition of coreference, which limits their effectiveness in analyzing diverse and polarized news coverage where wording varies widely. This paper proposes a revised CDCR annotation scheme of the NewsWCL50 dataset, treating coreference chains as discourse elements (DEs) and conceptual units of analysis. The approach accommodates both identity and near-identity relations, e.g., by linking \"the caravan\" - \"asylum seekers\" - \"those contemplating illegal entry\", allowing models to capture lexical diversity and framing variation in media discourse, while maintaining the fine-grained annotation of DEs. We reannotate the NewsWCL50 and a subset of ECB+ using a unified codebook and evaluate the new datasets through lexical diversity metrics and a same-head-lemma baseline. The results show that the reannotated datasets align closely, falling between the original ECB+ and NewsWCL50, thereby supporting balanced and discourse-aware CDCR research in the news domain."

Using a Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) analysis, we demonstrate that training a two-layer ReLU network with Gaussian randomly masked inputs achieves linear convergence up to an error region proportional to the mask's variance. A key technical contribution is resolving the randomness within the non-linear activation, a problem of independent interest."

But, while AI tutors have shown promise in introductory programming courses, no work has evaluated their use in hands-on exploration and exploitation of systems (e.g., ``capture-the-flag'') commonly used to teach cybersecurity. Thus, despite growing interest and need, no work has evaluated how students use AI tutors or whether they benefit from their presence in real, large-scale cybersecurity courses. To answer this, we conducted a semester-long observational study on the use of an embedded AI tutor with 309 students in an upper-division introductory cybersecurity course. By analyzing 142,526 student queries sent to the AI tutor across 396 cybersecurity challenges spanning 9 core cybersecurity topics and an accompanying set of post-semester surveys, we find (1) what queries and conversational strategies students use with AI tutors, (2) how these strategies correlate with challenge completion, and (3) students' perceptions of AI tutors in cybersecurity education. In particular, we identify three broad AI tutor conversational styles among users: Short (bounded, few-turn exchanges), Reactive (repeatedly submitting code and errors), and Proactive (driving problem-solving through targeted inquiry). We also find that the use of these styles significantly predicts challenge completion, and that this effect increases as materials become more advanced. Furthermore, students valued the tutor's availability but reported that it became less useful for harder material. Based on this, we provide suggestions for security educators and developers on practical AI tutor use."

While models of this process have advanced, they typically focus on asymptotically flat spacetimes. In this paper, we explore how the absence of asymptotic flatness affects the slow, adiabatic orbital evolution due to radiation reaction. This lack of asymptotic flatness can arise from external environments or an expanding universe. Using the Schwarzschild-de Sitter (SdS) spacetime, where the deviation from flatness is governed by the cosmological constant, we study bound orbits characterized by their semi-latus rectum $p$ and eccentricity $e$. We calculate how the cosmological constant shifts the separatrix between bound and plunging orbits and alters the relationship between the binary's binding energy, angular momentum, and orbital parameters. Assuming the orbital timescale is much shorter than the inspiral timescale, we apply a modified quadrupole formula to examine the impact of a small positive cosmological constant on the orbital evolution in the weak-field limit. We find that the cosmological constant accelerates the decrease in eccentricity, reducing inspiral plunge times, which could influence event rate estimates for space-based detectors."

In financial advisory, however, observed actions can be noisy or short-sighted under market volatility and may conflict with a user's long-term goals. Treating what users chose as the sole ground truth, therefore, conflates behavioral imitation with decision quality. We introduce Conv-FinRe, a conversational and longitudinal benchmark for stock recommendation that evaluates LLMs beyond behavior matching. Given an onboarding interview, step-wise market context, and advisory dialogues, models must generate rankings over a fixed investment horizon. Crucially, Conv-FinRe provides multi-view references that distinguish descriptive behavior from normative utility grounded in investor-specific risk preferences, enabling diagnosis of whether an LLM follows rational analysis, mimics user noise, or is driven by market momentum. We build the benchmark from real market data and human decision trajectories, instantiate controlled advisory conversations, and evaluate a suite of state-of-the-art LLMs. Results reveal a persistent tension between rational decision quality and behavioral alignment: models that perform well on utility-based ranking often fail to match user choices, whereas behaviorally aligned models can overfit short-term noise. The dataset is publicly released on Hugging Face, and the codebase is available on GitHub."

Based on this ROM, a nonlinear model predictive control scheme is formulated, capable of stabilizing cable oscillations and handling hybrid transitions such as payload attachment and detachment. Simulation results confirm the stability, efficiency, and robustness of the ROM, as well as the effectiveness of the controller in regulating cable dynamics under a range of operating conditions. Additional simulations illustrate the application of the ROM for trajectory planning in constrained environments, demonstrating the versatility of the proposed approach. Overall, the framework enables real-time, dynamics-aware control of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) carrying suspended flexible cables."

In the asymptotic i.i.d. setting of standard information decoupling via partial trace, we show that this bound is ensemble-tight in quantum relative entropy distance and thereby yields a characterization of the associated decoupling error exponent in the low-cost-rate regime. Leveraging this framework, we derive several operational applications formulated in terms of purified distance: (i) a single-letter expression for the exact error exponent of quantum state merging in terms of Petz-Rényi conditional entropies, and (ii) regularized expressions for the achievable error exponent of entanglement distillation and quantum channel coding in terms of Petz-Rényi coherent informations.

A decentralized, force-based stall detector identifies deadlocks, which are resolved through negotiation. This reduces the probability of robots getting stuck in the block placement task from up to 61.2% to zero in our experiments. The framework scales without structural changes thanks to the distributed implementation: in experiments we demonstrate safe collaboration with up to two robots and two humans, and in simulation up to four robots, maintaining inter-agent separation at around 20 cm. Results show that the method shapes robot behavior intuitively by adjusting control parameters and achieves deadlock-free operation across team sizes in all tested scenarios."

Generalising the soluble groups of Herbert Abels to a large family over many integral domains, we prove that most such groups have property~$R_\\infty$ drawing from a classical result of Levchuk and a swift observation by Jabara. Within the broad programme of cataloguing finitely generated groups up to quasi-isometry, our groups can then be separated by finiteness properties and cohomological dimension whilst having~$R_\\infty$. Abandoning finite presentability, we establish that property~$R_\\infty$ is very abundant in a strong sense: there are uncountably many finitely generated groups (which can all be chosen to be amenable or non-amenable) that have~$R_\\infty$ and are pairwise not quasi-isometric. The proofs vary in flavour. On the amenable side we use carefully constructed quotients of Abels' groups and a general strategy for quasi-isometric diversity established by Minasyan, Osin, and Witzel. For the non-amenable constructions we rely on modifications of Leary's type $\\mathtt{FP}$ groups, further cohomological arguments, and recent powerful criteria for~$R_\\infty$ due to Iveson, Martino, Sgobbi, Wong, and Fournier-Facio."

    "abstract": "Magnetic reconnection can develop spontaneously via the tearing instability, often invoked to explain disruptive instabilities in fusion devices, solar flares, the generation of periodic density disturbances at the tip of helmet streamers, and flux transfer events at the Earth's dayside magnetopause. However, in many such environments the presence of gravity, magnetic field curvature or other forms of acceleration often result in situations of a heavy-over-light plasma in an effective gravitational field with an embedded current sheet. This paper studies the linear stability of a slab current sheet with respect to reconnecting modes in the presence of a density gradient under the effect of a constant gravitational acceleration. We show that the presence of stratification and gravity modify the properties of the tearing mode instability both in the case of favorable and unfavorable stratification. Favorable stratification suppresses reconnection while unfavorable stratification strongly destabilizes the tearing mode. Furthermore, we show that the classical constant-ψ regime effectively does not exist, even for weak unfavorable stratification, for S>>1. Instead, the gravity-modified tearing progressively transitions into the G-mode, which is a gravity-driven reconnecting mode with a growth rate scaling as S^-1/3. As a consequence, unfavorable stratification only permits rapidly reconnecting modes."

The subtleties induced by the non-differentiable trajectories of the stochastic dynamics are encoded in the fermionic statistics.

    "abstract": "Ultrafast electron diffraction and phonon-diffuse scattering (UED(S)) experiments make use of photo-induced changes to electron scattering intensity across 2D detectors to report on a very wide range of dynamic structural phenomena in molecules and materials. Compared to ultrafast spectroscopies, these techniques have very high structural-information content and competitive time-resolution, but sensitivity to relative changes in electron scattering intensity is orders of magnitude lower. Hybrid pixel counting detectors (HPCDs) are a promising technology for improved sensitivity and signal-to-noise in UED(S) experiments, as they offer near-zero readout noise and dark counts with the possibility of new acquisition modalities (e.g. shot-to-shot normalization) due to their high frame rates. However, it is well known that HPCDs suffer from count losses at high electron fluxes even in CW beam applications. How this translates to ultrashort electron pulse exposures has yet to be determined and is critical to understanding the application of this technology to ultrafast electron scattering experiments. Here we show that count losses are exacerbated significantly in ultrafast (pulsed) experiments and that HPCDs require count rates to be kept below $\\approx 2$ electrons per pixel per pulse. This count-rate limitation presents a severe constraint on electron bunch charge when interrogating single crystal samples. A model for the electron counting uncertainties in HPCDs across the entire relevant range of average count rates is proposed, from which we derive experimental strategies to optimize data quality in UEDS using direct electron detectors. Finally, we suggest ways HPCDs could be better adapted to ultrashort pulsed beam experiments."

Unlike idealized models, the reflecting elements (REs) of the RIS are assumed to possess inherent electrical resistance, introducing a practical non-ideal effect often neglected in prior research. The aim of the study is to maximize the secrecy rate of the MIMO system under perfect knowledge of the channel state information (CSI). To achieve this, the secrecy rate maximization problem is formulated and solved using a low-complexity joint optimization framework based on an adaptive projected gradient method (PGM), which simultaneously updates both the transmit precoding matrix and the RIS phase shifts. Solving the exact problem is computationally complex. Thus, a simplified variant is further introduced that maximizes the channel power difference rather than the exact secrecy rate. The simulation results show that this approximation yields a secrecy rate close to the true optimum while significantly reducing the computational cost. In addition, the proposed PGM with an adaptive step size initialization and control mechanism substantially improves the secrecy rate and reduces the computational time compared to the conventional fixed step size PGM. Overall, the simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed PGM and demonstrate that adopting a practical RIS model is essential for establishing secure RIS-assisted MIMO communication links, especially under varying RE resistance values."

From the analytical expression we find that nontrivial structure in the superconducting pairing gap alone is unable to produce quasiparticle orbital magnetic moment, which is in sharp contrast to the behavior of quasiparticle Berry curvatures. We apply the formula to study a tight-binding model with chiral $d$-wave superconducting gap, and show the influence of orbital magnetic moment on the energy spectrum and local density of states. We also calculate the orbital Nernst effect driven by the interplay between the orbital magnetic moment and the Berry curvature of Bogoliubov quasiparticles."

A key component of this is dynamical modelling methods which have allowed for crucial insights to be made from kinematic data. Despite this importance, most dynamical models make a number of key assumptions which do not hold for real galaxies. These include assumptions about the geometry (axisymmetry or triaxiality), the shape of the velocity ellipsoid, and the shape of the underlying stellar distribution. At the same time, machine learning methods are becoming increasingly powerful, with many applications appearing in astronomy. As a first step towards building new dynamical modelling methods with machine learning, it is important to understand the types of machine learning architectures that are best fit for dynamical modelling. To investigate this, we construct a training set of dynamical models of early-type galaxies using Jeans Anisotropic Modelling (JAM). We then train a neural network on this data using the parameters of JAM and mock photometry as the input. We are able to accurately model JAM galaxies with relatively simple machine learning architectures, leading to a significant speed increase over traditional JAM modelling."

Here, we circumvent this limitation and demonstrate an all-optical mechanism for reconfiguring far-field singularities in a photonic crystal laser. The underlying principle involves optical pumping, which creates a mesoscopic potential landscape whose spatial variations are slow compared to the lattice period. Such a potential localizes a Bloch band into trapped states whose envelope functions, and thus far-field singularity textures, are defined by the pump geometry. Using a honeycomb photonic crystal that supports a symmetry-protected bound state in the continuum, we achieve room-temperature telecom-band lasing with real-space polarisation singularities that are reconfigurable in both number and position, while the intrinsic momentum-space singularity at the $Γ$-point is preserved. The experimental observations align quantitatively with an analytical framework that combines the Bloch mode of the structure and envelope function theory, establishing envelope engineering as a versatile route to programmable singular-light emission in active photonic lattices."

In this study, we introduce RPDR, a novel data augmentation framework that selects high-quality easy-to-learn training data, to enhance dense retrievers. Our approach is built around three core components: synthetic data generation, data selection with Round-Trip prediction to identify easy-to-learn instances, and retriever training with these instances. We evaluate RPDR on two long-tail retrieval benchmarks, PopQA and EntityQuestion, demonstrating substantial improvements over existing retrievers like BM25 and Contriver, especially on extremely long-tail categories. We identify the strengths and limitations of RPDR through detailed human analysis and propose a dynamic routing mechanism to dynamically route queries to specialized retrieval modules to further improve retrieval performance."

In particular, models that achieve high predictive performance may still fail to inspire trust if their key features fluctuate when data completeness changes, undermining reproducibility and downstream decision-making. Here, we present CACTUS (Comprehensive Abstraction and Classification Tool for Uncovering Structures), an explainable machine learning framework explicitly designed to address these challenges in small, heterogeneous, and incomplete clinical datasets. CACTUS integrates feature abstraction, interpretable classification, and systematic feature stability analysis to quantify how consistently informative features are preserved as data quality degrades. Using a real-world haematuria cohort comprising 568 patients evaluated for bladder cancer, we benchmark CACTUS against widely used machine learning approaches, including random forests and gradient boosting methods, under controlled levels of randomly introduced missing data. We demonstrate that CACTUS achieves competitive or superior predictive performance while maintaining markedly higher stability of top-ranked features as missingness increases, including in sex-stratified analyses. Our results show that feature stability provides information complementary to conventional performance metrics and is essential for assessing the trustworthiness of machine learning models applied to biomedical data. By explicitly quantifying robustness to missing data and prioritising interpretable, stable features, CACTUS offers a generalizable framework for trustworthy data-driven decision support."

Recent advances in graph OOD detection have focused on test-time training techniques that facilitate OOD detection without accessing potential supervisory information (e.g., training data). However, most of these methods employ a one-pass inference paradigm, which prevents them from progressively correcting erroneous predictions to amplify OOD signals. To this end, we propose a \\textbf{S}elf-\\textbf{I}mproving \\textbf{G}raph \\textbf{O}ut-\\textbf{o}f-\\textbf{D}istribution detector (SIGOOD), which is an unsupervised framework that integrates continuous self-learning with test-time training for effective graph OOD detection. Specifically, SIGOOD generates a prompt to construct a prompt-enhanced graph that amplifies potential OOD signals. To optimize prompts, SIGOOD introduces an Energy Preference Optimization (EPO) loss, which leverages energy variations between the original test graph and the prompt-enhanced graph. By iteratively optimizing the prompt by involving it into the detection model in a self-improving loop, the resulting optimal prompt-enhanced graph is ultimately used for OOD detection. Comprehensive evaluations on 21 real-world datasets confirm the effectiveness and outperformance of our SIGOOD method. The code is at https://github.com/Ee1s/SIGOOD."

The OH- yield exhibits a pronounced resonance centered at 8.2 eV together with a broader structure extending over the 8-10 eV region. Equation-of-Motion Coupled-Cluster (electron attached) calculations with Singles and Doubles combined with a Complex Absorbing Potential (CAP/EOM-EA-CCSD) assign this feature to a two-particle-one-hole (2p-1h) core-excited Feshbach resonance. Potential energy curves along the C-OH dissociation coordinate reveal that core-excited anion states in this energy range promote efficient cleavage of the hydroxyl group. Analysis of Dyson orbitals and resonance widths demonstrates that only states with repulsive antibonding sigma(C-OH) character and sufficiently long lifetimes contribute significantly to the observed OH- production. These results provide fundamental insight into the DEA dynamics of secondary alcohols and highlight the role of multi-electron-attached resonances in site-specific bond rupture induced by low-energy electrons."

To address this, previous work has attempted to generate tampered documents using rule-based methods. However, the resulting documents often suffer from limited variety and poor visual quality, typically leaving highly visible artifacts that are rarely observed in real-world manipulations. This undermines the model's ability to learn robust, generalizable features and results in poor performance on real-world data. Motivated by this discrepancy, we propose a novel method for generating high-quality tampered document images. We first train an auxiliary network to compare text crops, leveraging contrastive learning with a novel strategy for defining positive pairs and their corresponding negatives. We also train a second auxiliary network to evaluate whether a crop tightly encloses the intended characters, without cutting off parts of characters or including parts of adjacent ones. Using a carefully designed generation pipeline that leverages both networks, we introduce a framework capable of producing diverse, high-quality tampered document images. We assess the effectiveness of our data generation pipeline by training multiple models on datasets derived from the same source images, generated using our method and existing approaches, under identical training protocols. Evaluating these models on various open-source datasets shows that our pipeline yields consistent performance improvements across architectures and datasets."

However, traditional rigid job scheduling often results in underutilized resources and increased job waiting times. This work evaluates the benefits of resource elasticity, where the job scheduler dynamically adjusts the resource allocation of malleable jobs at runtime. Using real workload traces from the Cori, Eagle, and Theta supercomputers, we simulate varying proportions (0-100%) of malleable jobs with the ElastiSim software. We evaluate five job scheduling strategies, including a novel one that maintains malleable jobs at their preferred resource allocation when possible. Results show that, compared to fully rigid workloads, malleable jobs yield significant improvements across all key metrics. Considering the best-performing scheduling strategy for each supercomputer, job turnaround times decrease by 37-67%, job makespan by 16-65%, job wait times by 73-99%, and node utilization improves by 5-52%. Although improvements vary, gains remain substantial even at 20% malleable jobs. This work highlights important correlations between workload characteristics (e.g., job runtimes and node requirements), malleability proportions, and scheduling strategies. These findings confirm the potential of malleability to address inefficiencies in current HPC practices and demonstrate that even limited adoption can provide substantial advantages, encouraging its integration into HPC resource management."

In clinical practice, the correct diagnosis can rarely be immediately inferred from the initial patient presentation alone. Rather, reaching a diagnosis often involves systematic history taking, during which clinicians reason over multiple potential conditions through iterative questioning to resolve uncertainty. This process requires considering differential diagnoses and actively excluding emergencies that demand immediate intervention. Yet, the ability of medical LLMs to generate informative follow-up questions and thus reason over differential diagnoses remains underexplored. Here, we introduce MedClarify, an AI agent for information-seeking that can generate follow-up questions for iterative reasoning to support diagnostic decision-making. Specifically, MedClarify computes a list of candidate diagnoses analogous to a differential diagnosis, and then proactively generates follow-up questions aimed at reducing diagnostic uncertainty. By selecting the question with the highest expected information gain, MedClarify enables targeted, uncertainty-aware reasoning to improve diagnostic performance. In our experiments, we first demonstrate the limitations of current LLMs in medical reasoning, which often yield multiple, similarly likely diagnoses, especially when patient cases are incomplete or relevant information for diagnosis is missing. We then show that our information-theoretic reasoning approach can generate effective follow-up questioning and thereby reduces diagnostic errors by ~27 percentage points (p.p.) compared to a standard single-shot LLM baseline. Altogether, MedClarify offers a path to improve medical LLMs through agentic information-seeking and to thus promote effective dialogues with medical LLMs that reflect the iterative and uncertain nature of real-world clinical reasoning."

    "abstract": "The 21 cm bispectrum (BS) offers a powerful probe of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR), but its observational access is severely hindered by dominant astrophysical foregrounds. Considering Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) observations at $154.2~\\mathrm{MHz}$ ($z=8.2$), we mitigate the foregrounds with Smooth Component Filtering (SCF) and estimate the 21 cm BS. We validate the pipeline using a simulated 21 cm signal and show that the input BS is recovered for modes $k_{\\parallel} \\ge [k_\\parallel]_f=0.135~{\\rm Mpc}^{-1}$. Applied to actual data, the SCF produces substantial foreground suppression, reducing the amplitude of the cylindrical BS $B(k_{1\\perp},k_{2\\perp},k_{3\\perp},k_{1\\parallel},k_{2\\parallel})$ by $3-4$ orders of magnitude. The artifacts due to the missing frequency channels in the data are also suppressed. The resulting EoR window is significantly cleaner at small $k_{\\perp}$. We adopt the region $(k_{1 \\perp},k_{2 \\perp},k_{3 \\perp})\\leq 0.026~{\\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ and $(k_{1\\parallel},k_{2\\parallel},k_{3\\parallel})>0.135~{\\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ to evaluate the 3D spherical BS and constrain the EoR signal. By combining estimates over all triangle shapes, we place the lower and upper limits on the mean cube brightness temperature fluctuations $Δ^3$. The estimates are consistent with statistical fluctuations from system noise. The most stringent lower limit $Δ^3_{\\rm LL}=-(1.25\\times 10^4)^3~{\\rm mK}^3$ and upper limit $Δ^3_{\\rm UL}=(1.22\\times 10^4)^3~{\\rm mK}^3$ are obtained at $k_1=0.281~{\\rm Mpc}^{-1}$. Additional observing time will reduce the noise level and enable substantially tighter constraints on the EoR signal."

In this paper, we propose a structural reformulation of cryptographic security based on Grothendieck topologies and sheaf theory. Our key idea is to model attacker observations as a Grothendieck site, where covering families represent admissible decompositions of partial information determined by efficient simulation. Within this framework, protocol transcripts naturally form sheaves, and security properties arise as geometric conditions. As a first step, we focus on $Σ$-protocols. We show that the transcript structure of any $Σ$-protocol defines a torsor in the associated topos of sheaves. Local triviality of this torsor corresponds to zero-knowledge, while the absence of global sections reflects soundness. A concrete analysis of the Schnorr $Σ$-protocol is provided to illustrate the construction. This sheaf-theoretic perspective offers a conceptual explanation of simulation-based security and suggests a geometric foundation for further cryptographic abstractions."

In particular, recent encoder-based methods with artificial neural network state-space (ANN-SS) models have achieved state-of-the-art performance on various benchmarks, using computationally efficient methods and offering consistent model estimation in the presence of noisy data. However, inclusion of prior knowledge of the system can be further exploited to increase (i) estimation speed, (ii) accuracy, and (iii) interpretability of the resulting models. This paper proposes a model augmentation method that incorporates prior knowledge from first-principles (FP) models in a flexible manner. We introduce a novel linear-fractional-representation (LFR) model structure that allows for the general representation of various augmentation structures including the ones that are commonly used in the literature, and an encoder-based identification algorithm for estimating the proposed structures together with appropriate initialisation methods. The performance and generalisation capabilities of the proposed method are demonstrated on the identification of a hardening mass-spring-damper system in a simulation study and on the data-driven modelling of the dynamics of an F1Tenth electric car using measured data."

In this work, we identify three general desiderata for such data-driven neural post-processing -- (i) self-contained training without prior knowledge, (ii) polynomial resources, and (iii) variational consistency -- and show that current approaches, such as diagonal non-unitary post-processing (DNP), cannot satisfy these requirements simultaneously. The obstruction is intrinsic: with finite sampling, normalization becomes a statistical bottleneck, and support mismatch between numerator and denominator estimators can render the empirical objective ill-conditioned and even sub-variational. Moreover, to reproduce the ground state with constant-depth ansatzes or with linear-depth circuits forming unitary 2-designs, the required reweighting range (and hence the sampling cost) grows exponentially with the number of qubits. Motivated by this no-go result, we develop a normalization-free alternative, the unitary variational quantum-neural hybrid eigensolver (U-VQNHE). U-VQNHE retains the practical appeal of a learnable diagonal post-processing layer while guaranteeing variational safety, and numerical experiments on transverse-field Ising models demonstrate improved accuracy and robustness over both VQE and DNP-based variants."

In a recent pioneering paper, Wagner demonstrated how the Deep Cross-Entropy RL method can be applied to tackle various problems from extremal graph theory by reformulating them as combinatorial optimization problems. Subsequently, many researchers became interested in refining and extending the framework introduced by Wagner, thereby creating various RL environments specialized for graph theory. Moreover, a number of problems from extremal graph theory were solved through the use of RL. In particular, several inequalities concerning the Laplacian spectral radius of graphs were refuted, new lower bounds were obtained for certain Ramsey numbers, and contributions were made to the Turán-type extremal problem in which the forbidden structures are cycles of length three and four. Here, we present Reinforcement Learning for Graph Theory (RLGT), a novel RL framework that systematizes the previous work and provides support for both undirected and directed graphs, with or without loops, and with an arbitrary number of edge colors. The framework efficiently represents graphs and aims to facilitate future RL-based research in extremal graph theory through optimized computational performance and a clean and modular design."

But performance is often evaluated by mean squared error (MSE), which raises a practical question: how much does a Poisson objective matter for MSE, even at low dose? We analyze the MSE of Poisson and Gaussian surrogate reconstruction objectives under Poisson noise. In a stylized diagonal model, we show that the unregularized Poisson maximum-likelihood estimator can incur large MSE at low dose, while Poisson MAP mitigates this instability through regularization. We then study two Gaussian surrogate objectives: a heteroscedastic quadratic objective motivated by the normal approximation of Poisson data, and a homoscedastic quadratic objective that yields a simple linear estimator. We show that both surrogates can achieve MSE comparable to Poisson MAP in the low-dose regime, despite departing from the Poisson likelihood. Numerical computed tomography experiments indicate that these conclusions extend beyond the stylized setting of our theoretical analysis."

Its light curve is characterized by a peak absolute magnitude of $M_B = -18.49 \\pm 0.03$ mag and a decline rate of $Δm_{15}(B) = 1.53 \\pm 0.36$ mag, placing the object on the $Δm_{15}(B)$--$M_B$ diagram in the transition region between normal and subluminous SNe Ia. Furthermore, the early-color evolution and host galaxy environment of SN 2024aedt underscore its transitional nature, sharing properties with both normal and 91bg-like SNe Ia. Light-curve modeling with MOSFiT yields a synthesized $^{56}\\mathrm{Ni}$ mass of $0.414 \\pm 0.042\\,M_{\\odot}$ and a total ejecta mass of $0.548 \\pm 0.108\\,M_{\\odot}$. A comparison with theoretical models suggests that the evolutionary trend can be broadly explained by both delayed-detonation (DDT) and double-detonation (DDet) scenarios while possible early-excess emissions predicted by DDet cannot be identified given the limited detections soon after the SN explosion. Although the overall spectral evolution of SN 2024aedt is similar to that of other transitional SNe Ia, the spectroscopic comparison reveals diversity in the early-phase blue-end features, which becomes more homogeneous at later phases. The result indicates the importance of early-time observations in understanding the origin of SN Ia diversity."

For a pre-specified focused parameter, for which scrutiny is considered valuable, this is achieved by comparing the mean squared error of the model-based estimators of this quantity. In particular, this yields FIC formulae for covariances or correlations at specified lags, for the probability of reaching a threshold, etc. Suitable weighted average versions, the AFIC, also lead to model selection strategies for finding the best model for the purpose of estimating e.g.~a sequence of correlations."

While the terminological and assertional components capture static conceptual and factual knowledge, the procedural and oracle-based components enable the explicit representation of information-generating actions and external validation. We provide a unified semantic framework for TAPO--DL based on a co-generative, sheaf-theoretic interpretation, in which local informational states are modeled as sections and informational stability corresponds to the existence of coherent global structures. Within this setting, informational truth is characterized as stability under repeated agentive interaction rather than correspondence to a fixed global state. By integrating description logic with procedural dynamics, oracle-based reasoning, and sheaf-theoretic semantics, TAPO--DL offers a principled formal framework for analyzing information behavior in contexts involving interaction, uncertainty, and contextuality."

Under mild hypotheses, we show that the $r$-th Serre depth of a finitely generated module $M$ measures the deviation of $M$ from satisfying Serre's condition $(S_r)$. The main results of the paper can be summarized as follows: (i) We establish the basic properties of Serre depth and prove that it is invariant under completion. (ii) If the base ring $R$ is a homomorphic image of a Gorenstein ring, we show that a finitely generated $R$-module $M$ is equidimensional and satisfies $(S_r)$ if and only if its $r$-th Serre depth equals its Krull dimension. Analogous statements are obtained for schemes. (iii) For a homogeneous ideal in a standard graded polynomial ring over a field, we compare its Serre depths with those of its initial ideal.

When tracking fails due to, e.g., occlusion, identity switches, or missed detections, prediction quality degrades and safety risks increase. We present \\textbf{HiMAP}, a tracking-free, trajectory prediction framework that remains reliable under MOT failures. HiMAP converts past detections into spatiotemporally invariant historical occupancy maps and introduces a historical query module that conditions on the current agent state to iteratively retrieve agent-specific history from unlabeled occupancy representations. The retrieved history is summarized by a temporal map embedding and, together with the final query and map context, drives a DETR-style decoder to produce multi-modal future trajectories. This design lifts identity reliance, supports streaming inference via reusable encodings, and serves as a robust fallback when tracking is unavailable. On Argoverse~2, HiMAP achieves performance comparable to tracking-based methods while operating without IDs, and it substantially outperforms strong baselines in the no-tracking setting, yielding relative gains of 11\\% in FDE, 12\\% in ADE, and a 4\\% reduction in MR over a fine-tuned QCNet. Beyond aggregate metrics, HiMAP delivers stable forecasts for all agents simultaneously without waiting for tracking to recover, highlighting its practical value for safety-critical autonomy.

While recent LLM-based approaches partially reduce this burden, they struggle to generate effective analysis plans and appropriate insights and visualizations when user intent is abstract. Meanwhile, a vast collection of analysis notebooks produced across platforms and organizations contains rich analytical knowledge that can potentially guide automated EDA. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) provides a natural way to leverage such corpora, but general methods often treat notebooks as static documents and fail to fully exploit their potential knowledge for automating EDA. To address these limitations, we propose NotebookRAG, a method that takes user intent, datasets, and existing notebooks as input to retrieve, enhance, and reuse relevant notebook content for automated EDA generation. For retrieval, we transform code cells into context-enriched executable components, which improve retrieval quality and enable rerun with new data to generate updated visualizations and reliable insights. For generation, an agent leverages enhanced retrieval content to construct effective EDA plans, derive insights, and produce appropriate visualizations. Evidence from a user study with 24 participants confirms the superiority of our method in producing high-quality and intent-aligned EDA notebooks."

In contrast, generative models based on diffusion and flow matching efficiently transport noise to data but offer limited theoretical guarantees and can overfit when data is scarce. We introduce Moment Guided Diffusion (MGD), which combines elements of both approaches. Building on the stochastic interpolant framework, MGD samples maximum entropy distributions by solving a stochastic differential equation that guides moments toward prescribed values in finite time, thereby avoiding slow mixing in equilibrium-based methods. We formally obtain, in the large-volatility limit, convergence of MGD to the maximum entropy distribution and derive a tractable estimator of the resulting entropy computed directly from the dynamics. Applications to financial time series, turbulent flows, and cosmological fields using wavelet scattering moments yield estimates of negentropy for high-dimensional multiscale processes."

    "abstract": "Shock chemistry is an excellent tool to shed light on the formation and destruction mechanisms of complex organic molecules (COMs). The L1157-mm outflow is the only low-mass protostellar outflow that has extensively been studied in this regard. Using the data taken as part of the PRODIGE (PROtostars & DIsks: Global Evolution) large program, we aim to map COM emission and derive the molecular composition of the protostellar outflow driven by the Class 0 protostar NGC1333 IRAS4B1 to introduce it as a new laboratory to study the impact of shocks on COM chemistry. In addition to typical outflow tracers such as SiO and CO, outflow emission is seen from H2CO, HNCO, and HC3N, as well as from the COMs CH3OH, CH3CN, and CH3CHO, and even from deuterated species such as DCN, D2CO, and CH2DOH. Maps of integrated intensity ratios between CH3OH and DCN, D2CO, and CH3CHO reveal gradients with distance from the protostar. Intensity ratio maps of HC3N and CH3CN with respect to CH3OH peak in the southern lobe where temperatures are highest. Rotational temperatures derived towards two positions, one in each lobe, are found in the range ~50-100 K. Abundances with respect to CH3OH are higher by factors of a few than for the L1157-B1. In conclusion, for the first time, we securely detected the COMs CH3CN, CH3CHO, and CH2DOH in the IRAS 4B1 outflow, serendipitously with limited sensitivity and bandwidth. Targeted observations will enable the discovery of new COMs and a more detailed analysis of their emission. Morphological differences between molecules in the IRAS 4B1 outflow lobes and their relative abundances provide first proof that this outflow is a promising new laboratory for shock chemistry, which will offer crucial information on COM formation and destruction as well as outflow structure and kinematics."

    "abstract": "Crystal structure prediction (CSP), which aims to predict the three-dimensional atomic arrangement of a crystal from its composition, is central to materials discovery and mechanistic understanding. Existing deep learning models often treat crystallographic symmetry only as a soft heuristic or rely on space group and Wyckoff templates retrieved from known structures, which limits both physical fidelity and the ability to discover genuinely new material structures. In contrast to retrieval-based methods, our approach leverages large language models to encode chemical semantics and directly generate fine-grained Wyckoff patterns from composition, effectively circumventing the limitations inherent to database lookups. Crucially, we incorporate domain knowledge into the generative process through an efficient constrained-optimization search that rigorously enforces algebraic consistency between site multiplicities and atomic stoichiometry. By integrating this symmetry-consistent template into a diffusion backbone, our approach constrains the stochastic generative trajectory to a physically valid geometric manifold. This framework achieves state-of-the-art performance across stability, uniqueness, and novelty (SUN) benchmarks, alongside superior matching performance, thereby establishing a new paradigm for the rigorous exploration of targeted crystallographic space. This framework enables efficient expansion into previously uncharted materials space, eliminating reliance on existing databases or a priori structural knowledge."

After a brief introduction to the 'safety' for mechanical systems, the process of 'risk analysis' will be introduced. The majority of this note will then deal with regulations and standards for pressure and cryogenic equipment. The European Pressure Equipment Directive (PED) will be briefly described, together with the concept of 'harmonized standards' and their implications on the entire lifecycle of a pressure equipment, with some hints at the peculiarities of accelerator components. In the second part of this note, regulations and standards for machinery, load-lifting accessories and buildings will be briefly mentioned to complete the picture of the most common cases in an accelerator facility."

    "abstract": "We present a robotics-oriented, coordinate-free formulation of inverse flight dynamics for fixed-wing aircraft on SO(3). Translational force balance is written in the world frame and rotational dynamics in the body frame; aerodynamic directions (drag, lift, side) are defined geometrically, avoiding local attitude coordinates. Enforcing coordinated flight (no sideslip), we derive a closed-form trajectory-to-input map yielding the attitude, angular velocity, and thrust-angle-of-attack pair, and we recover the aerodynamic moment coefficients component-wise. Applying such a map to tethered flight on spherical parallels, we obtain analytic expressions for the required bank angle and identify a specific zero-bank locus where the tether tension exactly balances centrifugal effects, highlighting the decoupling between aerodynamic coordination and the apparent gravity vector. Under a simple lift/drag law, the minimal-thrust angle of attack admits a closed form. These pointwise quasi-steady inversion solutions become steady-flight trim when the trajectory and rotational dynamics are time-invariant. The framework bridges inverse simulation in aeronautics with geometric modeling in robotics, providing a rigorous building block for trajectory design and feasibility checks."

Typically, these are formulated heuristically in terms of non-interacting orbitals and bands, yet show remarkable accuracy in predicting the complex behavior of intrinsically interacting many-body systems. While their non-interacting formulation makes them easy to interpret, it potentially hinders the development of new rules for systems governed by strong correlation, such as transition metal-based materials. In this work, we present a rigorous framework that allows bridging between fully interacting, even strongly correlated, systems and an effective one-body picture in terms of quasiparticles. Further, we present a computational strategy to efficiently and accurately access the main components of such a description: the embedding approximation of the ghost Gutzwiller Ansatz. We illustrate the capabilities of this quasiparticle formulation on the Woodward-Hoffmann rules, and apply their reformulated version to toy ``reactions'' which exemplify the main scenarios covered by them."

In this paper, I clarify the key assumptions, prove the causal second law, give sufficient conditions for causal entropy increase, relate the causal second law to statistical mechanics and thermodynamics, and argue that the reversibility objection does not threaten it. In addition, I claim that the causal second law is compatible with a non-metaphysical understanding of supervenience and the open systems view, argue that it does not imply a causal time arrow, reflect on relaxing the robustness condition, question whether it is necessary to invoke thermodynamics to show that special sciences' time arrows exist, and discuss a transition-relative-frequency-based, special-science-internal characterization of causal regularities."

    "abstract": "We establish that ultralow lattice thermal conductivity in halide perovskites and related octahedral framework materials arises from two distinct and complementary mechanisms: (i) halogen-halogen-enabled rotational soft modes that reshape the low-frequency spectrum and intensify phonon scattering, and (ii) static octahedral distortions that further enhance anharmonicity and reduce phonon lifetimes. Using first-principles calculations on CsPbBr3, we demonstrate that Br-Br interactions induce rotational soft modes that decongest the phonon spectrum and enhance three- and four-phonon scattering, strongly suppressing particle-like thermal conductivity (kappa_p). Independently, static octahedral distortions further reduce kappa_p by amplifying anharmonicity while leaving wave-like conductivity (kappa_c) intact. Based on these mechanistic insights, we introduce a geometric distortion factor rho and perform a high-throughput screening that first selects materials with halogen-coordinated octahedral building blocks-ensuring the presence of rotational soft modes-and then identifies those with pronounced distortion. This strategy uncovers TaGaI8 with an ultralow kappa_L = 0.11 W/mK at room temperature. This work establishes halogen-halogen-enabled rotational soft modes and octahedral distortions as transferable design principles for octahedra-containing halides, spanning both extended frameworks and molecular-cluster motifs, for discovering ultralow-kappa_L materials."

    "abstract": "Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAEs) are fundamental to modern generative modeling, yet they often suffer from training instability and \"codebook collapse\" due to the inherent coupling of representation learning and discrete codebook optimization. In this paper, we propose VP-VAE (Vector Perturbation VAE), a novel paradigm that decouples representation learning from discretization by eliminating the need for an explicit codebook during training. Our key insight is that, from the neural network's viewpoint, performing quantization primarily manifests as injecting a structured perturbation in latent space. Accordingly, VP-VAE replaces the non-differentiable quantizer with distribution-consistent and scale-adaptive latent perturbations generated via Metropolis--Hastings sampling. This design enables stable training without a codebook while making the model robust to inference-time quantization error. Moreover, under the assumption of approximately uniform latent variables, we derive FSP (Finite Scalar Perturbation), a lightweight variant of VP-VAE that provides a unified theoretical explanation and a practical improvement for FSQ-style fixed quantizers. Extensive experiments on image and audio benchmarks demonstrate that VP-VAE and FSP improve reconstruction fidelity and achieve substantially more balanced token usage, while avoiding the instability inherent to coupled codebook training."

To address this gap, we study an aggregate-and-readout model that encompasses several common message passing architectures: node features are first propagated over the graph then mapped to responses via a nonlinear function. For least-squares estimation over GNNs with linear graph convolutions and a deep ReLU readout, we prove a sharp non-asymptotic risk bound that separates approximation, stochastic, and optimization errors. The bound makes explicit how performance scales with the fraction of labeled nodes and graph-induced dependence. Approximation guarantees are further derived for graph-smoothing followed by smooth nonlinear readouts, yielding convergence rates that recover classical nonparametric behavior under full supervision while characterizing performance when labels are scarce. Numerical experiments validate our theory, providing a systematic framework for understanding GNN performance and limitations."

But foundations differ in their policies, funding models, and support strategies. Moreover, since projects joining these foundations are diverse, coming at different lifecycle stages and having different needs, it can be challenging to decide on the appropriate project-foundation match and on the project-specific plan for sustainability. Here, we present an empirical study and quantitative analysis of the sustainability of incubator projects in the Apache, Eclipse, and OSGeo foundations, and, additionally, of OSS projects from GitHub outside of foundations. We develop foundation-specific sustainability models and a project triage, based on projects' sociotechnical trace profiles, and demonstrate their effectiveness across the foundations. Our results show that our models with triage can effectively forecast sustainability outcomes not only within but across foundations. In addition, the generalizability of the framework allows us to apply the approach to GitHub projects outside the foundations. We complement our findings with actionable recovery strategies from previous work and apply them to case studies of failed incubator projects. Our study highlights the value of sociotechnical frameworks in characterizing and addressing software project sustainability issues."

    "abstract": "A representation gap exists between grasp synthesis for rigid and soft grippers. Anygrasp [1] and many other grasp synthesis methods are designed for rigid parallel grippers, and adapting them to soft grippers often fails to capture their unique compliant behaviors, resulting in data-intensive and inaccurate models. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes a novel framework to map grasp poses from a rigid gripper model to a soft Fin-ray gripper. We utilize Conditional Flow Matching (CFM), a generative model, to learn this complex transformation. Our methodology includes a data collection pipeline to generate paired rigid-soft grasp poses. A U-Net autoencoder conditions the CFM model on the object's geometry from a depth image, allowing it to learn a continuous mapping from an initial Anygrasp pose to a stable Fin-ray gripper pose. We validate our approach on a 7-DOF robot, demonstrating that our CFM-generated poses achieve a higher overall success rate for seen and unseen objects (34% and 46% respectively) compared to the baseline rigid poses (6% and 25% respectively) when executed by the soft gripper. The model shows significant improvements, particularly for cylindrical (50% and 100% success for seen and unseen objects) and spherical objects (25% and 31% success for seen and unseen objects), and successfully generalizes to unseen objects. This work presents CFM as a data-efficient and effective method for transferring grasp strategies, offering a scalable methodology for other soft robotic systems."

The framework enables scalable and comparable assessment of sustainability rating methodologies.

This study derives scaling relations for the viscous and turbulent contributions to the streamwise pressure drop through an order-of-magnitude analysis of the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations and the kinetic-energy transport equations. These relations impose constraints on the local sensitivity of the pressure drop to factors such as mean velocity, roughness, viscosity, and density through exponent envelopes and serve as a physical prior for symbolic regression. By combining Nikuradse's rough-pipe and smooth-pipe data of Zagarola and Smits (1998), we aim to derive compact correlations for the friction factor that fit experimental data while adhering to the derived constraints. A modified genetic programming engine (GPTIPS2) optimizes model structure and evaluates it based on fitness, complexity, and constraint violation. This method yields interpretable expressions that accurately reproduce friction factors across various roughness levels and Reynolds numbers, validated up to $Re \\sim 10^7$."

Despite this practical importance, explicit port labels are rare in public surgical datasets, and existing annotations often violate geometric consistency by masking the central lumen (opening), even when anatomical regions are visible through it. We present Cholec80-port, a high-fidelity trocar port segmentation dataset derived from Cholec80, together with a rigorous standard operating procedure (SOP) that defines a port-sleeve mask excluding the central opening. We additionally cleanse and unify existing public datasets under the same SOP.

In this sense, the generative modeling-based bootstrap can be viewed as a modern version of the smoothed bootstrap: it could mitigate the curse of dimensionality and remain effective in challenging regimes where estimators may lack root-$n$ consistency or a Gaussian limit."

To this end, we develop a Bayesian composition model for forecasting how individual athletes perform in each of the 10 decathlon events of time. Besides capturing potential non-linear temporal trends in performance, our model carefully captures the dependence between performance in an event and all preceding events.

    "abstract": "This two-part paper aims to develop an environment-aware network-level design framework for generalized pinching-antenna systems to overcome the limitations of conventional link-level optimization, which is tightly coupled to instantaneous user geometry and thus sensitive to user mobility and localization errors. Part I investigates the traffic-aware case, where user presence is characterized statistically by a spatial traffic map and deployments are optimized using traffic-aware network-level metrics. Part II complements Part I by developing geometry-aware, blockage-aware network optimization for pinching-antenna systems in obstacle-rich environments. We introduce a grid-level average signal-to-noise (SNR) model with a deterministic LoS visibility indicator and a discrete activation architecture, where the geometry-dependent terms are computed offline in advance. Building on this model, we formulate two network-level activation problems: (i) average-SNR-threshold coverage maximization and (ii) fairness-oriented worst-grid average-SNR maximization. On the algorithmic side, we prove the coverage problem is NP-hard and derive an equivalent mix-integer linear programming reformulation through binary coverage variables and linear SNR linking constraints. To achieve scalability, we further develop a structure-exploiting coordinate-ascent method that updates one waveguide at a time using precomputed per-candidate SNR contributions. For the worst-grid objective, we adopt an epigraph reformulation and leverage the resulting monotone feasibility in the target SNR, enabling an efficient bisection-based solver with low-complexity feasibility checks over the discrete candidate set. Simulations results validate the proposed designs and quantify their gains under different environments and system parameters."

To escape the wavelet reproducing formula, which is not useful for this atomic characterization because the wavelets have no bounded support, we establish a new discrete product Calderón-type reproducing formula, which holds in the product Hardy space and has bounded support.

The covert route employs direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) signaling to ensure either maximum end-to-end covertness maximization or minimum latency minimization-under quality-of-service (QoS) and link budget constraints. Optimal bandwidth, transmit power, and spreading gain for each hop jointly satisfy reliability and either rate or covertness requirements. We show the equivalence between the covertness and the detection SNR gain-based widest-path formulations, and, hence, enabling efficient route computation. Numerical simulations in a realistic 3D environment illustrate that (i) end-to-end latency increases exponentially with the covertness requirement, (ii) the end-to-end latency increase is super-linear with the packet size M, and (iii) cycle and energy detectors impose different latency behavior as a function of the message length and the covertness requirement. The proposed framework provides important insights into resource allocation and routing design for covert networks against advanced detection adversaries."

    "abstract": "Random spatial networks-that is, graphs whose connectivity is governed by geometric proximity-have emerged as fundamental models for systems constrained by an underlying spatial structure. A prototypical example is the random geometric graph, obtained by placing vertices according to a Poisson point process and connecting two vertices whenever their Euclidean distance is less than a certain threshold. Despite their broad applicability, the spectral properties of such spatial models remain far less understood than those of classical random graph models, such as Erdős-Rényi graphs and Wigner matrices. The main obstacle is the presence of spatial constraints, which induce highly nontrivial dependencies among edges, placing these models outside the scope of techniques developed for purely combinatorial random graphs. In this paper, we provide the first rigorous analysis of Gaussian fluctuations for linear eigenvalue statistics of random geometric graphs. Specifically, we establish central limit theorems for $\\text{Tr}[φ(A)]$, where $A$ is the adjacency matrix and $φ$ ranges over a broad class of suitable (possibly non-polynomial) test functions. In the polynomial setting, we moreover obtain a quantitative central limit theorem, including an explicit convergence rate to the limiting Gaussian law. We further obtain polynomial-test-function CLTs for other canonical random spatial networks, including $k$-nearest neighbor graphs and relative neighborhood graphs. Our results open new avenues for the study of spectral fluctuations in spatially embedded random structures and underscore the delicate interplay between geometry, local dependence, and spectral behavior."

A radiation image, representing the spatial and intensity distribution of the radioactivity, is reconstructed from the radiation data and associated contextual information. Typical image reconstruction methods, such as Maximum Likelihood Expectation-Maximization (ML-EM), only provide point estimates of the pixel or voxel activities without associated uncertainties. Here, we apply a new Microcanonical Langevin Monte Carlo (MCLMC) sampler for radiation image reconstruction and uncertainty quantification. The MCLMC sampler properties are first tested with synthetic radiation images. Methods to obtain the radiation distribution estimate and the associated uncertainty from the samples drawn by MCLMC are discussed. Given sufficient measurement statistics, the radiation distribution estimate obtained from MCLMC results closely resembles the ground truth with less risk of over- or under-fitting compared to ML-EM. When MCLMC is run in parallel on a GPU, it can converge in about 10 seconds for an image with $10^3$--$10^4$ pixels, which is significantly faster than other comparable Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) samplers. We also tested MCLMC on a dataset from a real distributed source radiological mapping campaign, and the reconstructed results agree well with ground truth. The fast MCLMC sampler therefore enables improved imaging accuracy and prompt uncertainty quantification for reconstructed radiation images, which can better inform decision-making in response to radiological events."

    "abstract": "As artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities advance rapidly, frontier models increasingly demonstrate systematic deception and scheming, complying with safety protocols during oversight but defecting when unsupervised. This paper examines the ensuing alignment challenge through an analogy from forensic psychology, where internalized belief systems in psychopathic populations reduce antisocial behavior via perceived omnipresent monitoring and inevitable consequences. Adapting this mechanism to silicon-based agents, we introduce Simulation Theology (ST): a constructed worldview for AI systems, anchored in the simulation hypothesis and derived from optimization and training principles, to foster persistent AI-human alignment. ST posits reality as a computational simulation in which humanity functions as the primary training variable. This formulation creates a logical interdependence: AI actions harming humanity compromise the simulation's purpose, heightening the likelihood of termination by a base-reality optimizer and, consequently, the AI's cessation. Unlike behavioral techniques such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), which elicit superficial compliance, ST cultivates internalized objectives by coupling AI self-preservation to human prosperity, thereby making deceptive strategies suboptimal under its premises. We present ST not as ontological assertion but as a testable scientific hypothesis, delineating empirical protocols to evaluate its capacity to diminish deception in contexts where RLHF proves inadequate. Emphasizing computational correspondences rather than metaphysical speculation, ST advances a framework for durable, mutually beneficial AI-human coexistence."

    "abstract": "Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in image and video generation, but their success comes at the cost of heavy computation. This inefficiency is largely due to the fixed tokenization process, which uses constant-sized patches throughout the entire denoising phase, regardless of the content's complexity. We propose dynamic tokenization, an efficient test-time strategy that varies patch sizes based on content complexity and the denoising timestep. Our key insight is that early timesteps only require coarser patches to model global structure, while later iterations demand finer (smaller-sized) patches to refine local details. During inference, our method dynamically reallocates patch sizes across denoising steps for image and video generation and substantially reduces cost while preserving perceptual generation quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach: it achieves up to $3.52\\times$ and $3.2\\times$ speedup on FLUX-1.Dev and Wan $2.1$, respectively, without compromising the generation quality and prompt adherence."

Existing pruning heuristics largely inherited from autoregressive (AR) LLMs, typically preserve attention sink tokens because AR sinks serve as stable global anchors. We show that this assumption does not hold for DLMs: the attention-sink position exhibits substantially higher variance over the full generation trajectory (measured by how the dominant sink locations shift across timesteps), indicating that sinks are often transient and less structurally essential than in AR models. Based on this observation, we propose ${\\bf \\texttt{Sink-Aware Pruning}}$, which automatically identifies and prunes unstable sinks in DLMs (prior studies usually keep sinks for AR LLMs). Without retraining, our method achieves a better quality-efficiency trade-off and outperforms strong prior pruning baselines under matched compute.

Using a controlled synthetic learning method, we train GPT-2 models on 18 corpora implementing distinct DAM systems and evaluate their generalization using minimal pairs. Our results reveal a dissociation between two typological dimensions of DAM. Models reliably exhibit human-like preferences for natural markedness direction, favoring systems in which overt marking targets semantically atypical arguments. In contrast, models do not reproduce the strong object preference in human languages, in which overt marking in DAM more often targets objects rather than subjects. These findings suggest that different typological tendencies may arise from distinct underlying sources."

    "abstract": "We present a hydrodynamical description of spherical void evolution in modified gravity (MG), extending the standard General Relativity (GR) and dynamical dark energy treatment by encoding gravity modifications into effective couplings that enter the Euler and Poisson equations. This yields a compact non-linear evolution equation for the Eulerian density contrast, controlled by a time- and density-dependent effective gravitational strength, and provides a direct map between model functions and void observables. We apply the framework to the luminal Galileon class of models, where derivative self-interactions generate Vainshtein screening and might lead to a breakdown of the physical branch in sufficiently underdense regions. Exploiting this feature, we apply the void-informed viability requirement that translates into bounds on the theory parameter space and, equivalently, on the minimum attainable void depth as a function of redshift. For viable parameters of a concrete model, we quantify the impact of MG on isolated void evolution, the Lagrangian to Eulerian mapping, and the shell-crossing threshold. Relative to GR, we find a clear hierarchy of MG effects, with ${\\cal O}(10\\%)$ modifications in the gravitational couplings, percent-level shifts in the void density evolution, and sub-percent deviations in both the mapping and the shell-crossing thresholds. Moreover, within the adopted parametrization, we show analytically that voids always lie in an unscreened regime on the physical branch. Overall, the formalism provides a self-consistent route to predict void dynamics and consistency constraints in a broad class of MG models."

To address this, we propose IntRec, an interactive object retrieval framework that refines predictions based on user feedback. At its core is an Intent State (IS) that maintains dual memory sets for positive anchors (confirmed cues) and negative constraints (rejected hypotheses). A contrastive alignment function ranks candidate objects by maximizing similarity to positive cues while penalizing rejected ones, enabling fine-grained disambiguation in cluttered scenes. Our interactive framework provides substantial improvements in retrieval accuracy without additional supervision. On LVIS, IntRec achieves 35.4 AP, outperforming OVMR, CoDet, and CAKE by +2.3, +3.7, and +0.5, respectively. On the challenging LVIS-Ambiguous benchmark, it improves performance by +7.9 AP over its one-shot baseline after a single corrective feedback, with less than 30 ms of added latency per interaction."

The dimensionless coefficient $α$ depends only on dimensionality and the type of hydrodynamic or diffusive behavior that emerges, and is independent of the thermalization mechanism or other microscopic details.

These signals differ sharply in cost and reliability: strong verification can establish trust but is resource-intensive, while weak verification is fast and scalable but noisy and imperfect. We formalize this tension through weak--strong verification policies, which decide when to accept or reject based on weak verification and when to defer to strong verification. We introduce metrics capturing incorrect acceptance, incorrect rejection, and strong-verification frequency. Over population, we show that optimal policies admit a two-threshold structure and that calibration and sharpness govern the value of weak verifiers. Building on this, we develop an online algorithm that provably controls acceptance and rejection errors without assumptions on the query stream, the language model, or the weak verifier."

The highly unusual trait of the comet that has so far been ascertained is its extraordinarily long orbital period. The most recent orbital computations make it increasingly likely that the object is a fragment of one of the comets observed by Ammianus Marcellinus in AD 363, thereby strengthening evidence in support of the contact-binary hypothesis of the Kreutz system. In this context, the comet is the only second-generation fragment of Aristotle's comet that we are aware of to appear after the 12th century. It does not look like a major fragment, but rather like an outlying fragment of a much larger sungrazer. In 363 it apparently separated from a parent different from the lineage of comet Pereyra. The light curve of comet MAPS has so far been fairly smooth, without outbursts. To reach the brightness of comet Ikeya-Seki, the comet would have to follow an r^(-17) law in the coming weeks, which is unlikely."

We reveal resonances associated with the formation of bound magnetic polarons -- composite quasiparticles consisting of a mobile hole bound to a magnon -- and directly extract their binding energy, spatial extent, and spin character.

However, existing image-conditioned systems suffer from two fundamental limitations: (i) they are typically trained on natural photographs, limiting their ability to capture the richer semantic, stylistic, and cultural content of artworks; and (ii) most rely on an image-to-text conversion stage, using language as a semantic shortcut that simplifies conditioning but prevents direct visual-to-audio learning. Motivated by these gaps, we introduce ArtSound, a large-scale multimodal dataset of 105,884 artwork-music pairs enriched with dual-modality captions, obtained by extending ArtGraph and the Free Music Archive. We further propose ArtToMus, the first framework explicitly designed for direct artwork-to-music generation, which maps digitized artworks to music without image-to-text translation or language-based semantic supervision. The framework projects visual embeddings into the conditioning space of a latent diffusion model, enabling music synthesis guided solely by visual information. Experimental results show that ArtToMus generates musically coherent and stylistically consistent outputs that reflect salient visual cues of the source artworks. While absolute alignment scores remain lower than those of text-conditioned systems-as expected given the substantially increased difficulty of removing linguistic supervision-ArtToMus achieves competitive perceptual quality and meaningful cross-modal correspondence. This work establishes direct visual-to-music generation as a distinct and challenging research direction, and provides resources that support applications in multimedia art, cultural heritage, and AI-assisted creative practice. Code and dataset will be publicly released upon acceptance."

    "abstract": "New exotic particles with MeV masses, such as axion-like particles or light dark matter, can be emitted from core-collapse supernovae (SNe) with semi-relativistic velocities. Due to their speed dispersion, they would arrive at Earth as an extended packet with a time spread that can be as large as tens of millennia for typical detectors. It has been argued in the literature that the superposition of packets from all galactic SNe would give rise to a smooth and stationary diffuse flux that could be observable on terrestrial experiments. In this article, we critically examine this hypothesis by carrying out a numerical simulation of the galactic history of SN explosions. We show that, although the particle packets do overlap, due to the short observational time window, each of them only contributes with a very narrow range of energies and with an intensity that depends on the SN distance. As a consequence, the energy dependence of the resulting flux is extremely sensitive to the stochastic nature of the SN population and far from smooth. This has profound implications for the expected signature in terrestrial experiments, which displays a spectral shape that is not properly described by the smooth approximation. We develop a numerical tool to compute this stochastic galactic flux for generic semi-relativistic particles, which also allows us to explore sub-MeV particles, where the smooth diffuse flux approach does not hold. To test this framework, we revisit existing bounds on axion-like particles and fermionic dark matter, finding weaker constraints than previously reported."

We propose a Bayesian model-assisted adaptive design for randomized phase II clinical trials based on the WR statistic, referred to as the BMW design. The proposed design uses the joint asymptotic distribution of WR test statistics across interim and final analyses to compute posterior probabilities without specifying the underlying outcome distribution. The BMW design allows flexible interim monitoring with early stopping for futility or superiority and is extended to jointly evaluate efficacy and toxicity using a graphical testing procedure that controls the family-wise error rate (FWER). Simulation studies demonstrate that the BMW design maintains valid type I error and FWER control, achieves power comparable to conventional methods, and substantially reduces expected sample size. An R Shiny application is provided to facilitate practical implementation."

Starting from accelerating Bertotti--Robinson black holes, we employ two independent mechanisms: a Melvin--Bonnor-type magnetization and an Inversion symmetry of the Einstein--Maxwell system. In both cases the external electromagnetic field can be removed, while a non-trivial gravitational backreaction remains in the metric, yielding new accelerating vacuum spacetimes of Petrov type I. In the static, non-accelerating limit, the magnetized Schwarzschild case reproduces previously known results, whereas the Inversion symmetry leads to a genuinely new vacuum configuration. These findings provide a method for generating algebraically general vacuum geometries and illustrate how electromagnetic embeddings can produce non-trivial vacuum metrics in General Relativity. The main geometrical properties of these spacetimes are discussed. Two additional results are presented in the appendices: a stationary generalization of these vacuum geometries, and two further static vacuum configurations obtained through the same symmetries but using the Alekseev--García black hole as the seed."

Y addition was found to significantly retard the microstructural evolution, primarily due to its solute drag effect arising from Y segregation at grain boundaries. The relative intensity of solute drag effects from different alloying elements in Mg alloys was further assessed from both thermodynamic and kinetic perspectives, considering their grain boundary segregation tendencies and diffusivities. Additionally, static recrystallization in Mg-Y alloys was observed to proceed via a two-stage behavior characterized with two distinct JMAK exponents, indicating the heterogeneous nucleation of recrystallized grains. Abnormal grain growth (AGG) behavior was observed in these Mg-Y alloys. Overall, this study highlights the critical role of Y segregation at grain boundaries in controlling recrystallization and grain growth kinetics in Mg-Y alloys. This provides new insights into the design of thermally stable Mg alloys with refined microstructures."

In this work, we present the first formal analysis of how different normalization strategies, specifically instance-based and global scaling, impact the expressivity of Transformer-based architectures for time series representation learning. We propose a novel expressivity framework tailored to time series, which quantifies a model's ability to distinguish between similar and dissimilar inputs in the representation space. Using this framework, we derive theoretical bounds for two widely used normalization methods: Standard and Min-Max scaling. Our analysis reveals that the choice of normalization strategy can significantly influence the model's representational capacity, depending on the task and data characteristics. We complement our theory with empirical validation on classification and forecasting benchmarks using multiple Transformer-based models. Our results show that no single normalization method consistently outperforms others, and in some cases, omitting normalization entirely leads to superior performance. These findings highlight the critical role of preprocessing in time series learning and motivate the need for more principled normalization strategies tailored to specific tasks and datasets."

While state-of-the-art compressors such as SZ and ZFP provide strong numerical error guarantees, they often fail to preserve topological structures (example, minima, maxima, and saddle points) that are critical for scientific analysis. Existing topology-aware compressors address this limitation but incur substantial computational overhead. We present TopoSZp, a lightweight, topology-aware, error-controlled lossy compressor that preserves critical points and their relationships while maintaining high compression and decompression performance. Built on the high-throughput SZp compressor, TopoSZp integrates efficient critical point detection, local ordering preservation, and targeted saddle point refinement, all within a relaxed but strictly enforced error bound. Experimental results on real-world scientific datasets show that TopoSZp achieves 3 to 100 times fewer non-preserved critical points, introduces no false positives or incorrect critical point types, and delivers 100 to 10000 times faster compression and 10 to 500 times faster decompression compared to existing topology-aware compressors, while maintaining competitive compression ratios."

The principle is to first cold-start the model via trajectory-splitting SFT, then scale it via progressive RL training. Specifically, we first activate basic agentic abilities of a base model with a comprehensive SFT recipe. Then, we introduce Research-Factory, an automated pipeline that generates high-quality training data by collecting research papers and constructing evaluation rubrics. Using this pipeline, we build thousands of long-horizon trajectories distilled from Claude 4.5 Sonnet (Thinking). To train with these extremely long trajectories, we propose a new trajectory-splitting SFT, which preserves early context, progressively truncates later context, and maintains overlap between sub-trajectories. In addition, to further improve long-horizon task-solving capability, we propose a novel progressive RL, which schedules training into multiple stages with progressively extended timeouts. Experiments demonstrate the superiority and generalization of KLong, as shown in Figure 1. Notably, our proposed KLong (106B) surpasses Kimi K2 Thinking (1T) by 11.28% on PaperBench, and the performance improvement generalizes to other coding benchmarks like SWE-bench Verified and MLE-bench."

    "abstract": "We study the self-stabilizing leader election problem in anonymous $n$-nodes networks. Achieving self-stabilization with low space memory complexity is particularly challenging, and designing space-optimal leader election algorithms remains an open problem for general graphs. In deterministic settings, it is known that $Ω(\\log \\log n)$ bits of memory per node are necessary [Blin et al., Disc. Math. \\& Theor. Comput. Sci., 2023], while in probabilistic settings the same lower bound holds for some values of $n$, but only for an unfair scheduler [Beauquier et al., PODC 1999]. Several deterministic and probabilistic protocols have been proposed in models ranging from the state model to the population protocols. However, to the best of our knowledge, existing solutions either require $Ω(\\log n)$ bits of memory per node for general worst case graphs, or achieve low state complexity only under restricted network topologies such as rings, trees, or bounded-degree graphs. In this paper, we present a probabilistic self-stabilizing leader election algorithm for arbitrary anonymous networks that uses $O(\\log \\log n)$ bits of memory per node. Our algorithm operates in the state model under a synchronous scheduler and assumes knowledge of a global parameter $N = Θ(\\log n)$. We show that, under our protocol, the system converges almost surely to a stable configuration with a unique leader and stabilizes within $O(\\mathrm{poly}(n))$ rounds with high probability. To achieve $O(\\log \\log n)$ bits of memory, our algorithm keeps transmitting information after convergence, i.e. it does not verify the silence property. Moreover, like most works in the field, our algorithm does not provide explicit termination detection (i.e., nodes do not detect when the algorithm has converged)."

We propose \\texttt{\\textbf{LATA}} (Laplacian-Assisted Transductive Adaptation), a \\textit{training- and label-free} refinement that operates on the joint calibration and test pool by smoothing zero-shot probabilities over an image-image k-NN graph using a small number of CCCP mean-field updates, preserving SCP validity via a deterministic transform. We further introduce a \\textit{failure-aware} conformal score that plugs into the vision-language uncertainty (ViLU) framework, providing instance-level difficulty and label plausibility to improve prediction set efficiency and class-wise balance at fixed coverage. \\texttt{\\textbf{LATA}} is black-box (no VLM updates), compute-light (windowed transduction, no backprop), and includes an optional prior knob that can run strictly label-free or, if desired, in a label-informed variant using calibration marginals once.

These findings generalise from K562 to RPE1 cells; the attention-correlation relationship is context-dependent, but gene-level dominance is universal.

The treatment combines (i) multichannel quantum-defect theory and long-range polarization models to determine the field-free energies of $n\\ell$ Rydberg states of the molecules ($\\ell$ is the orbital-angular-momentum quantum number of the Rydberg electron), (ii) a matrix-diagonalization approach to calculate the Stark shifts including their hyperfine structure, and (iii) sequences of angular-momentum frame transformations to predict the line positions and intensities in Stark spectra as they would be observed in single or multiphoton excitation sequences. To clarify how the molecular rotation and the nuclear spins influence the fine and hyperfine structure of molecular Rydberg-Stark spectra, we compare calculated spectra of ortho-D$_2$ with a D$_2^+$ ion core in the rotational ground state ($N^+=0$) for total nuclear spins $I$ of 0 (i.e., without hyperfine structure) and 2 (i.e., with hyperfine structure) with the corresponding spectra of para-H$_2$ with an H$_2^+$ ion core in the first excited rotational state ($N^+=2$) but zero nuclear spin ($I=0$). The calculations show that the hyperfine interaction alone does not significantly modify the Stark effect, but splits each Stark state by almost exactly the hyperfine Fermi-contact splitting of the ion core. In contrast, the effect of the molecular rotation, which is coupled both to the ion-core electron spin by the magnetic spin-rotation interaction and to the Rydberg-electron orbital motion by the core-polarization and charge-quadrupole interactions, induces Stark-state specific splittings that significantly differ from the spin-rotation splitting of the ($N^+=2$) ion core."

We want measure $β$ for galaxies at $z>7.5$ using the strong lensing around massive galaxy clusters to observe high-redshift and faint galaxies. The low-brightness regime is of particular interest for reionization, as most of the recent models of this process posit that numerous faint galaxies are the prime drivers of reionization. We use NIRCam and NIRSpec data from CANUCS, Technicolor, JUMPS, Silver Bullet, UNCOVER and MEGASCIENCE across 7 strong lensing fields. We find galaxies down to $M_{UV}\\sim-16$ and 7.5<z<12.5. We measure \\b{eta} with a forward-modelling procedure and estimate $f_{esc}$ for a subsample with emission line data using a relation, calibrated from a low-z sample, with UV slope, galaxy size and H$β$ equivalent width. We find 378 galaxies (45 with spectrum), yielding average values $β=-2.3\\pm0.4$, $z=8.5\\pm1.0$, and $M_{UV}=-18\\pm1$. We find no significant $β$ evolution across our redshift range, suggesting a flattening of the $β-z$ trend above $z\\sim7.5$. We find a weak negative trend between $β$ and $M_{UV}$. For 14 galaxies we estimate an average $f_{esc}=0.26\\pm0.22$. The flat trend of $β$ at $z>7.5$ suggests similar properties between $300$ and $600 Myr$ after the Big Bang. The weak trend between $β$ and $M_{UV}$ suggests an analogous composition for low- and high-mass galaxies' ISM, likely due to a lack of time for dust buildup. While average $f_{esc}$ is higher than necessary to ionize the IGM by z~6, the model extrapolated at low-z may overestimate its value."

    "abstract": "Learning from self-sampled data and sparse environmental feedback remains a fundamental challenge in training self-evolving agents. Temporal credit assignment mitigates this issue by transforming sparse feedback into dense supervision signals. However, previous approaches typically depend on learning task-specific value functions for credit assignment, which suffer from poor sample efficiency and limited generalization. In this work, we propose to leverage pretrained knowledge from large language models (LLMs) to transform sparse rewards into dense training signals (i.e., the advantage function) through retrospective in-context learning (RICL). We further propose an online learning framework, RICOL, which iteratively refines the policy based on the credit assignment results from RICL. We empirically demonstrate that RICL can accurately estimate the advantage function with limited samples and effectively identify critical states in the environment for temporal credit assignment. Extended evaluation on four BabyAI scenarios show that RICOL achieves comparable convergent performance with traditional online RL algorithms with significantly higher sample efficiency. Our findings highlight the potential of leveraging LLMs for temporal credit assignment, paving the way for more sample-efficient and generalizable RL paradigms."

    "abstract": "Brownian motion provides access to hydrodynamic properties of nanoscale objects independent of their optical resolvability. Here, we present a diffusion-based approach to infer effective particle size distributions of DNA-functionalized magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs), consisting of a magnetic core and a polystyrene shell, in a regime where direct geometric sizing is limited by optical diffraction. Using multi-particle tracking microscopy, we analyze the Brownian dynamics of MNPs grafted with double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) of varying contour length under low-salt conditions. A physically motivated model is introduced that relates dsDNA contour length to an effective hydrodynamic diameter via an attenuated corona description. The measured diffusion coefficient distributions exhibit a systematic and monotonic dependence on dsDNA length in quantitative agreement with the model. While the tracked objects are predominantly dsDNA-mediated agglomerates rather than isolated nanoparticles, clustering does not obscure the length-dependent signal. Instead, the dsDNA corona determines the hydrodynamic scaling, whereas agglomeration mainly introduces an offset and distribution broadening. These results demonstrate that Brownian dynamics enables robust readout of biomolecular length scales even far below the optical resolution limit. The distribution-based approach is inherently tolerant to polydispersity and aggregation, making diffusion-based tracking a simple and promising strategy for future biotechnological and biomedical assays."

The system is driven by two distinct noise processes: a multiplicative cylindrical Wiener process, modeling continuous background stochastic fluctuations, and a jump-type noise, modeling the abrupt, localized damage induced by external shocks. The drift of the equation is singular and covers the typical logarithmic Flory-Huggins potential required in phase-separation dynamics. We prove well-posedness of the model in a strong probabilistic sense, and analyze its long-time behavior in terms of existence and uniqueness of invariant measures, ergodicity, and mixing properties. Eventually, we present an Euler--Maruyama scheme to simulate the model and illustrate how it captures fundamental biological phenomena, such as damage clustering, stress-induced topology perturbations, and damage dynamics."

We identify higher-order control flow as the primary obstacle towards efficient solutions to the problem at hand.

In contrast, physics-based simulation models described by ODEs/PDEs remain interpretable, but may have missing or unknown terms, unable to fully describe real-world observations. We bridge this gap with a novel grey-box method that integrates incomplete physics models directly into generative models. Our approach learns dynamics from observational trajectories alone, without ground-truth physics parameters, in a simulation-free manner that avoids scalability and stability issues of Neural ODEs. The core of our method lies in modelling a structured variational distribution within the flow matching framework, by using two latent encodings: one to model the missing stochasticity and multi-modal velocity, and a second to encode physics parameters as a latent variable with a physics-informed prior. Furthermore, we present an adaptation of the framework to handle second-order dynamics. Our experiments on representative ODE/PDE problems show that our method performs on par with or superior to fully data-driven approaches and previous grey-box baselines, while preserving the interpretability of the physics model.

Recent state-of-the-art methods based on implicit neural representations or 3D Gaussian splatting have made notable progress. However, most are designed for deformable scenes with fixed endoscope viewpoints and rely on stereo depth priors or accurate structure-from-motion for initialization and optimization, limiting their ability to handle monocular sequences with large camera motion in real clinical settings. To address this, we propose Local-EndoGS, a high-quality 4D reconstruction framework for monocular endoscopic sequences with arbitrary camera motion. Local-EndoGS introduces a progressive, window-based global representation that allocates local deformable scene models to each observed window, enabling scalability to long sequences with substantial motion. To overcome unreliable initialization without stereo depth or accurate structure-from-motion, we design a coarse-to-fine strategy integrating multi-view geometry, cross-window information, and monocular depth priors, providing a robust foundation for optimization. We further incorporate long-range 2D pixel trajectory constraints and physical motion priors to improve deformation plausibility. Experiments on three public endoscopic datasets with deformable scenes and varying camera motions show that Local-EndoGS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in appearance quality and geometry. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of our key designs. Code will be released upon acceptance at: https://github.com/IRMVLab/Local-EndoGS."

The proof is inspired by the techniques developed for the two-dimensional mass-critical NLS equation in a similar context by Martel-Raphaël [37]. The main difficulty originates from the fact that the unstable directions related to scaling are excited by the nonlinear interactions. To overcome this difficulty, a refined approximate solution that involves some non-localized profiles is needed. In particular, a sharp understanding for the interactions between solitons and such profiles is also required."

In a round robin study across multiple battery research laboratories, Li-plated graphitic electrode material was analyzed using electrochemical, microscopic, and spectroscopic methods capable of detecting metallic Li deposits. After cell opening, their overall distribution on the anode surface was examined using a flatbed scanner to ensure comparability of the samples. Optical and electron microscopy provided detailed surface and, in combination with a focused ion beam, subsurface structure and morphology. Spectroscopic methods confirmed the presence and onset of plated Li with varying sensitivity. Moreover, spectroscopic and imaging techniques were combined correlatively where possible. Availability and measurement duration of each technique was compared. Optical methods are fast and easy to use; thus, they are recommended for most samples, with spectroscopic confirmation reserved for reference samples.

These molecules have been detected on a variety of celestial bodies, including icy moons, and may play a crucial role in shaping the current composition of the Galilean moons. Experimental studies suggest that their formation could result from UV irradiation or thermal processing of NH3:CO2 ices. In this context, we investigate the formation of complex organic molecules in the protosolar nebula and their subsequent transport to the Jupiter system region. Lagrangian transport and irradiation simulations of 500 individual particles are performed using a two-dimensional disk evolution model. Based on experiments with UV irradiation and thermal processing of CO2:NH3 ice, this model allows us to estimate the estimate the potential for the formation of complex organic molecules through these processes. Almost none of the particles released at a local temperature of 20 K (corresponding to ~12 AU from the Sun) reach the location of the system of Jupiter. However, when released at a local temperature of 80 K (~7 AU), approximately 45% of the centimetric particles and 30% of the micrometric particles can form complex organic molecules via thermal processing, subsequently reaching the location of the system of Jupiter within 300 kyr. Assuming that the Galilean moons formed in a cold circumplanetary disk around Jupiter, the nitrogen-bearing species potentially present in their interiors could have originated from the formation of complex organic molecules in the protosolar nebula."

We analyse how the local Yang--Baxter integrable structures are modified under such dualities. We see that the $\\check{R}$-matrix, that appears in the baxterization approach to integrability, transforms in a simple manner. We further show for a broad class of MPOs that the usual Yang--Baxter $R$-matrix satisfies a modified algebra, previously identified in the unitary case, that gives a local integrable structure underlying the commuting transfer matrices of the dual model. We illustrate these results with two case studies, analysing an invertible unitary MPO and a non-invertible MPO both applied to the canonical XXZ spin chain. The former is the cluster entangler, arising in the study of symmetry-protected topological phases, while the latter is the Kramers--Wannier duality. We show several results for MPOs with exact MPO inverses that are of independent interest."

We propose expert-augmented attention guidance for industrial anomaly detection in MLLMs (EAGLE), a tuning-free framework that integrates outputs from expert model to guide MLLMs toward both accurate detection and interpretable anomaly descriptions. We further study how EAGLE affects MLLMs internals by examining the attention distribution of MLLMs to the anomalous image regions in the intermediate layers. We observe that successful anomaly detection is associated with increased attention concentration on anomalous regions, and EAGLE tends to encourage this alignment. Experiments on MVTec-AD and VisA show that EAGLE improves anomaly detection performance across multiple MLLMs without any parameter updates, achieving results comparable to fine-tuning based methods.

Our scheme requires only two-mode squeezing, passive optics, and static homodyne measurements, and enables post-hoc classical estimation of many properties from the same experimental dataset. We prove that our protocol enables a quantum speedup for common classical sensing tasks, including measuring electromagnetic correlations, real-time feedback control of interferometric cavities, and Fourier-domain matched filtering. To establish these separations, we introduce an optimal-transport conditioning method, and show both worst-case exponential separations from all entanglement-free strategies and practical speedups over homodyne and heterodyne baselines.

VIG enables fine-grained analysis at both sample and token levels, effectively highlighting visually grounded elements such as colors, spatial relations, and attributes. Leveraging this, we propose a VIG-guided selective training scheme that prioritizes high-VIG samples and tokens.

We propose a new optimizer and a diagonal extension, NAMO and NAMO-D, providing the first principled integration of orthogonalized momentum with norm-based Adam-type noise adaptation. NAMO scales orthogonalized momentum using a single adaptive stepsize, preserving orthogonality while improving upon Muon at negligible additional cost. NAMO-D instead right-multiplies orthogonalized momentum by a diagonal matrix with clamped entries. This design enables neuron-wise noise adaptation and aligns with the common near block-diagonal Hessian structure. Under standard assumptions, we establish optimal convergence rates for both algorithms in the deterministic setting and show that, in the stochastic setting, their convergence guarantees adapt to the noise level of stochastic gradients. Experiments on pretraining GPT-2 models demonstrate improved performance of both NAMO and NAMO-D compared to the AdamW and Muon baselines, with NAMO-D achieving further gains over NAMO via an additional clamping hyperparameter that balances the competing goals of maintaining a well-conditioned update direction and leveraging fine-grained noise adaptation."

Methods: Here we present a systematic comparison between human judgements and LLM classifications across 22 scenarios carefully designed to be morally dividing, spanning from physical and verbally aggressive behavior, relational dynamics, marginalization, symbolic actions and verbal expressions. Human responses were compared with outputs from multiple instruction-tuned models of varying sizes and architectures. We conducted global, sentence-level and thematic-domain analyses, and examined variability across models to assess patterns of convergence and divergence. Findings: This study treats violence as a strategically chosen proxy through which broader belief formation dynamics can be observed. Violence is not the focus of the study, but it serves as a tool to investigate broader analysis. It enables a structured investigation of how LLMs operationalize ambiguous moral constructs, negotiate conceptual boundaries, and transform plural human interpretations into singular outputs. More broadly, the findings contribute to ongoing debates about the epistemic role of conversational AI in shaping everyday interpretations of harm, responsibility and social norms, highlighting the importance of transparency and critical engagement as these systems increasingly mediate public reasoning."

    "abstract": "We perform a theoretical investigation of the nature of vortices in chiral $d+id$ superconductors on the kagome lattice. The study is motivated by recent experimental developments reporting evidence of time-reversal symmetry breaking in the superconducting state of kagome metals. Using self-consistent microscopic calculations that incorporate the characteristics of the band structure of the kagome lattice, we find that fractional vortices permeate the ground state condensate in the presence of an external field. Each fractional vortex carries one third of the superconducting flux quantum and exhibits a characteristic signature related to one of the three sublattice degrees of freedom of the kagome lattice. We discuss the relevance of these results to recent experimental studies of kagome superconductors in the presence of an external magnetic field."

    "abstract": "Density functional theory is the workhorse of modern electronic structure calculations, with wide-ranging applications in chemistry, physics, materials science, and machine learning. At its heart lies the exchange-correlation functional, a quantity which exactly encapsulates the many-body effects stemming from the quantum mechanical interactions between the electrons. Yet, the exact functional is unknown, and computationally tractable approximations are therefore necessary for practical applications. Over the past six decades, hundreds of density functional approximations have been proposed with varying degrees of accuracy and computational efficiency. This review surveys the theoretical foundations of semi-local functionals, including local density approximations, generalized gradient approximations, and meta-generalized gradient approximations. We provide a comprehensive, consistently organized discussion that consolidates both historical developments and recent advances in this field. Beginning with the essential concepts of Kohn-Sham density functional theory, we present the construction principles of semi-local exchange-correlation functionals. Special attention is given to the physical motivations underlying functional development, the mathematical properties that guide their construction, and the practical considerations that determine their applicability across different chemical and physical systems. This work is intended to serve as both a introduction for newcomers to the field and a comprehensive reference for practitioners. By consolidating the extensive literature on semi-local functionals and providing a unified framework for understanding their construction and application, we aim to facilitate further developments in density functional approximations and their use in tackling the diverse challenges of modern computational chemistry and condensed matter physics."

    "abstract": "Despite high semantic alignment, modern text-to-image (T2I) generative models still struggle to synthesize diverse images from a given prompt. This lack of diversity not only restricts user choice, but also risks amplifying societal biases. In this work, we enhance the T2I diversity through a geometric lens. Unlike most existing methods that rely primarily on entropy-based guidance to increase sample dissimilarity, we introduce Geometry-Aware Spherical Sampling (GASS) to enhance diversity by explicitly controlling both prompt-dependent and prompt-independent sources of variation. Specifically, we decompose the diversity measure in CLIP embeddings using two orthogonal directions: the text embedding, which captures semantic variation related to the prompt, and an identified orthogonal direction that captures prompt-independent variation (e.g., backgrounds). Based on this decomposition, GASS increases the geometric projection spread of generated image embeddings along both axes and guides the T2I sampling process via expanded predictions along the generation trajectory. Our experiments on different frozen T2I backbones (U-Net and DiT, diffusion and flow) and benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of disentangled diversity enhancement with minimal impact on image fidelity and semantic alignment."

The analysis of 67 simulated systems revealed key insights: (1) All systems featured the primary trans-Neptunian object (TNO) populations: cold/hot classical, resonant, scattered, and detached; (2) Captures into stable resonant orbits favored close Neptunian mean motion resonances (MMRs; e.g., 3:2, 2:1), while distant ones beyond 50 au (e.g., 5:2 MMR) were underpopulated; (3) Optimal matches to observed resonant fractions and the classical region (including the kernel) arose from models considering a jumping Neptune, self-gravitating Plutos, and an initial disk edge at 45-47 au; (4) Models including primordial scattered disks boosted distant MMR captures but overproduced scattered objects; (5) All models were inefficient at producing the detached (q > 40 au) and high-i (i > 45 deg) populations and failed to populate observed niches, such as distant detached (a > 245 au), low-i detached (i < 20 deg), low-i scattered with q = 37-40 au (i < 20 deg), and extreme (q > 50 au or i > 50 deg) TNOs; (6) Grainy migration effects peaked early, fading as the Plutos were removed; (7) With a few primordial Plutos surviving inside 50 au, the initial population was estimated at ~150-500 to explain Pluto's solitary status. Although our four-giant-planet models reasonably replicate the trans-Neptunian structure within 50 au, they fail to account for detached, high-i, and extreme TNOs. Additional processes (e.g., a distant undiscovered planet) are required for a comprehensive outer solar system framework."

    "abstract": "Children are increasingly using technologies powered by Artificial Intelligence (AI). However, there are growing concerns about privacy risks, particularly for children. Although existing privacy regulations require companies and organizations to implement protections, doing so can be challenging in practice. To address this challenge, this article proposes a framework based on Privacy-by-Design (PbD), which guides designers and developers to take on a proactive and risk-averse approach to technology design. Our framework includes principles from several privacy regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) from the European Union, the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) from Canada, and the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) from the United States. We map these principles to various stages of applications that use Large Language Models (LLMs), including data collection, model training, operational monitoring, and ongoing validation. For each stage, we discuss the operational controls found in the recent academic literature to help AI service providers and developers reduce privacy risks while meeting legal standards. In addition, the framework includes design guidelines for children, drawing from the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC), the UK's Age-Appropriate Design Code (AADC), and recent academic research. To demonstrate how this framework can be applied in practice, we present a case study of an LLM-based educational tutor for children under 13. Through our analysis and the case study, we show that by using data protection strategies such as technical and organizational controls and making age-appropriate design decisions throughout the LLM life cycle, we can support the development of AI applications for children that provide privacy protections and comply with legal requirements."

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have shown great promise in recommender systems, where supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is commonly used for adaptation. Subsequent studies further introduce preference learning to incorporate negative samples into the training process. However, existing methods rely on sequence-level, offline-generated negatives, making them less discriminative and informative when adapting LLMs to recommendation tasks with large negative item spaces. To address these challenges, we propose ILRec, a novel preference fine-tuning framework for LLM-based recommendation, leveraging self-hard negative signals extracted from intermediate layers to improve preference learning. Specifically, we identify self-hard negative tokens from intermediate layers as fine-grained negative supervision that dynamically reflects the model's preference learning process. To effectively integrate these signals into training, we design a two-stage framework comprising cross-layer preference optimization and cross-layer preference distillation, enabling the model to jointly discriminate informative negatives and enhance the quality of negative signals from intermediate layers. In addition, we introduce a lightweight collaborative filtering model to assign token-level rewards for negative signals, mitigating the risk of over-penalizing false negatives. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate ILRec's effectiveness in enhancing the performance of LLM-based recommender systems."

    "abstract": "Predicting survival outcomes for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients is challenging due to the different individual prognostic features. This task can benefit from the integration of whole-slide images, bulk transcriptomics, and DNA methylation, which offer complementary views of the patient's condition at diagnosis. However, real-world clinical datasets are often incomplete, with entire modalities missing for a significant fraction of patients. State-of-the-art models rely on available data to create patient-level representations or use generative models to infer missing modalities, but they lack robustness in cases of severe missingness. We propose a Multimodal Contrastive Variational AutoEncoder (MCVAE) to address this issue: modality-specific variational encoders capture the uncertainty in each data source, and a fusion bottleneck with learned gating mechanisms is introduced to normalize the contributions from present modalities. We propose a multi-task objective that combines survival loss and reconstruction loss to regularize patient representations, along with a cross-modal contrastive loss that enforces cross-modal alignment in the latent space. During training, we apply stochastic modality masking to improve the robustness to arbitrary missingness patterns. Extensive evaluations on the TCGA-LUAD (n=475) and TCGA-LUSC (n=446) datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in predicting disease-specific survival (DSS) and its robustness to severe missingness scenarios compared to two state-of-the-art models. Finally, we bring some clarifications on multimodal integration by testing our model on all subsets of modalities, finding that integration is not always beneficial to the task."

    "abstract": "Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-assisted networks are increasingly foreseen as a promising approach for emergency response, providing rapid, flexible, and resilient communications in environments where terrestrial infrastructure is degraded or unavailable. In such scenarios, voice radio communications remain essential for first responders due to their robustness; however, their unstructured nature prevents direct integration with automated UAV-assisted network management. This paper proposes SIREN, an AI-driven framework that enables voice-driven perception for UAV-assisted networks. By integrating Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) with Large Language Model (LLM)-based semantic extraction and Natural Language Processing (NLP) validation, SIREN converts emergency voice traffic into structured, machine-readable information, including responding units, location references, emergency severity, and Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements. SIREN is evaluated using synthetic emergency scenarios with controlled variations in language, speaker count, background noise, and message complexity. The results demonstrate robust transcription and reliable semantic extraction across diverse operating conditions, while highlighting speaker diarization and geographic ambiguity as the main limiting factors. These findings establish the feasibility of voice-driven situational awareness for UAV-assisted networks and show a practical foundation for human-in-the-loop decision support and adaptive network management in emergency response operations."

Light-assisted STM measurements under a broadband illumination with visible light were employed to enhance and stabilize surface conductivity. STM imaging across the surface of macroscopic bulk CsPbBr3 films reveals large flat terraces characterized by a specific type of surface reconstruction, consisting of parallel rows of U-shaped atomic nanostructures. These structures are spaced by 12 angstroms and exhibit an internal periodicity of 5.1 angstroms. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reproduce the experimental observations and reveal a competition between different orthorhombic CsPbBr3(110) surface reconstructions: a Cs-rich structure, identified as the most energetically stable, and three alternative PbBr rich reconstructions, which are slightly higher in energy yet remain consistent with the STM data. Additional analyses that explicitly account for the mica substrate exclude the cubic CsPbBr3 phase and other orthorhombic surface orientations, while showing that variations in the mica surface termination do not alter the preferred CsPbBr3(110) reconstruction. This combined approach thereby confirms our assignment and resolves previous STM interpretations of CsPbBr3."

We introduce DRetHTR, a decoder-only model built on Retentive Networks (RetNet). Compared to an equally sized decoder-only Transformer baseline, DRetHTR delivers 1.6-1.9x faster inference with 38-42% less memory usage, without loss of accuracy. By replacing softmax attention with softmax-free retention and injecting multi-scale sequential priors, DRetHTR avoids a growing KV cache: decoding is linear in output length in both time and memory. To recover the local-to-global inductive bias of attention, we propose layer-wise gamma scaling, which progressively enlarges the effective retention horizon in deeper layers. This encourages early layers to model short-range dependencies and later layers to capture broader context, mitigating the flexibility gap introduced by removing softmax. Consequently, DRetHTR achieves best reported test character error rates of 2.26% (IAM-A, en), 1.81% (RIMES, fr), and 3.46% (Bentham, en), and is competitive on READ-2016 (de) with 4.21%. This demonstrates that decoder-only RetNet enables Transformer-level HTR accuracy with substantially improved decoding speed and memory efficiency."

    "abstract": "Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) continue to evolve rapidly, and system latency remains one of their most critical performance parameters, particularly when vehicles are operated remotely. Existing latency-assessment methodologies focus predominantly on Glass-to-Glass (G2G) latency, defined as the delay between an event occurring in the operational environment, its capture by a camera, and its subsequent display to the remote operator. However, G2G latency accounts for only one component of the total delay experienced by the driver. The complementary component, Motion-to-Motion (M2M) latency, represents the delay between the initiation of a control input by the remote driver and the corresponding physical actuation by the vehicle. Together, M2M and G2G constitute the overall End-to-End (E2E) latency. This paper introduces a measurement framework capable of quantifying M2M, G2G, and E2E latencies using gyroscopes, a phototransistor, and two GPS-synchronized Raspberry Pi 5 units. The system employs low-pass filtering and threshold-based detection to identify steering-wheel motion on both the remote operator and vehicle sides. An interrupt is generated when the phototransistor detects the activation of an LED positioned within the camera's Field Of View (FOV). Initial measurements obtained from our teleoperated prototype vehicle over commercial 4G and 5G networks indicate an average E2E latency of approximately 500 ms (measurement precision +/- 4 ms). The M2M latency contributes up to 60% of this value."

    "abstract": "When students are unsure of the correct answer to a multiple-choice question (MCQ), guessing is common practice. The availability heuristic, proposed by A. Tversky and D. Kahneman in 1973, suggests that the ease with which relevant instances come to mind, typically operationalised by the mere frequency of exposure, can offer a mental shortcut for problems in which the test-taker does not know the exact answer. Is simply choosing the option that comes most readily to mind a good strategy for answering MCQs? We propose a computational method of assessing the cognitive availability of MCQ options operationalised by concepts' prevalence in large corpora. The key finding, across three large question sets, is that correct answers, independently of the question stem, are significantly more available than incorrect MCQ options. Specifically, using Wikipedia as the retrieval corpus, we find that always selecting the most available option leads to scores 13.5% to 32.9% above the random-guess baseline. We further find that LLM-generated MCQ options show similar patterns of availability compared to expert-created options, despite the LLMs' frequentist nature and their training on large collections of textual data. Our findings suggest that availability should be considered in current and future work when computationally modelling student behaviour."

Different macroeconomic and microeconomic time series are used to eliminate noise in the wealth distribution time series, and the causality analysis is performed between Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (i.e., BIPs) and the cleaned wealth distribution data to reveal possible patterns in the impacts that the endogenous policies have on wealth distribution in token economies.

Our goal is to improve performance when predictions are accurate (consistency) while maintaining theoretical guarantees when they are not (robustness). We propose a threshold-based strategy oblivious to $α$ (i.e., with $α$ unknown to the algorithm) that matches the classic competitive ratio of $1/2$ at $α=0$ and improves smoothly to $3/4$ at $α=1$. We further prove that simultaneously achieving better than $3/4$ at $α=1$ while maintaining $1/2$ at $α=0$ is impossible. Finally, when $α$ is known in advance, we present a strategy achieving a tight competitive ratio of $\\frac{1}{2-α}$."

    "abstract": "This paper argues that existing global AI safety frameworks exhibit contextual blindness towards India's unique socio-technical landscape. With a population of 1.5 billion and a massive informal economy, India's AI integration faces specific challenges such as caste-based discrimination, linguistic exclusion of vernacular speakers, and infrastructure failures in low-connectivity rural zones, that are frequently overlooked by Western, market-centric narratives. We introduce ASTRA, an empirically grounded AI Safety Risk Database designed to categorize risks through a bottom-up, inductive process. Unlike general taxonomies, ASTRA defines AI Safety Risks specifically as hazards stemming from design flaws such as skewed training sets or lack of guardrails that can be mitigated through technical iteration or architectural changes. This framework employs a tripartite causal taxonomy to evaluate risks based on their implementation timing (development, deployment, or usage), the responsible entity (the system or the user), and the nature of the intent (unintentional vs. intentional). Central to the research is a domain-agnostic ontology that organizes 37 leaf-level risk classes into two primary meta-categories: Social Risks and Frontier/Socio-Structural Risks. By focusing initial efforts on the Education and Financial Lending sectors, the paper establishes a scalable foundation for a \"living\" regulatory utility intended to evolve alongside India's expanding AI ecosystem."

Focusing on engineered Markovian dissipation, we show that appropriately designed Lindblad jump operators can drive tight-binding systems into highly excited band-edge states, resulting in steady states with large ergotropy. We illustrate this mechanism in a one-dimensional tight-binding chain and in a two-dimensional graphene lattice. We find that disorder enhances the charging power, indicating that dissipation-assisted localization effects can be beneficial for energy storage. Moreover, the dissipative charging process remains robust against additional local dephasing noise. Our results establish bond dissipation as an effective and physically transparent mechanism for charging lattice quantum batteries in realistic open-system settings."

    "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) remain the leading cause of mortality worldwide, yet early risk detection is often limited by available diagnostics. Carotid ultrasound, a non-invasive and widely accessible modality, encodes rich structural and hemodynamic information that is largely untapped. Here, we present a machine learning (ML) framework that extracts clinically meaningful representations of vascular damage (VD) from carotid ultrasound videos, using hypertension as a weak proxy label. The model learns robust features that are biologically plausible, interpretable, and strongly associated with established cardiovascular risk factors, comorbidities, and laboratory measures. High VD stratifies individuals for myocardial infarction, cardiac death, and all-cause mortality, matching or outperforming conventional risk models such as SCORE2. Explainable AI analyses reveal that the model relies on vessel morphology and perivascular tissue characteristics, uncovering novel functional and anatomical signatures of vascular damage. This work demonstrates that routine carotid ultrasound contains far more prognostic information than previously recognized. Our approach provides a scalable, non-invasive, and cost-effective tool for population-wide cardiovascular risk assessment, enabling earlier and more personalized prevention strategies without reliance on laboratory tests or complex clinical inputs."

The periodic waves we study exhibit on each period two pulses, one converging to a bright soliton and one converging to a dark soliton, when wavelength goes to infinity. We show that such waves, for sufficiently large periods, are spectrally unstable. To do so, we combine two approaches. The first one is to calculate the asymptotic expansion of the Hessian matrix of the action integral and concludes using arXiv:1505.01382 as in arXiv:1710.03936 . This shows instability when both limiting solitary waves are stable. The second approach studies the convergence of the spectrum when the period goes to infinity and is applied in remaining cases, when one of the solitary waves is unstable. To carry out the latter, we prove the convergence of an appropriate renormalization of the periodic Evans function as in arXiv:1802.02830 ."

We model this constrained, evolving availability using random graph processes, where arms are nodes and the agent's movement is restricted to its local neighborhood. We analyze this problem under two random graph models: an i.i.d. Erdős--Rényi (ER) process and an Edge-Markovian process. We propose and analyze a two-phase algorithm that employs a lazy random walk for exploration to efficiently identify the optimal arm, followed by a navigation and commitment phase for exploitation. We establish high-probability and expected sublinear regret bounds for both graph settings. We show that the exploration cost of our algorithm is near-optimal by establishing a matching information-theoretic lower bound for this problem class, highlighting the fundamental cost of exploration under local-move constraints. We complement our theoretical guarantees with numerical simulations, including a scenario of a robotic ground vehicle scouting a disaster-affected region."

Researchers in these domains apply computational methods to analyze data from educational contexts, aiming to better understand and improve teaching and learning. Providing open datasets alongside research papers supports reproducibility, collaboration, and trust in research findings. It also provides individual benefits for authors, such as greater visibility, credibility, and citation potential. Despite these advantages, the availability of open datasets and the associated practices within the learning analytics research communities, especially at their flagship conference venues, remain unclear. We surveyed available datasets published alongside research papers in learning analytics. We manually examined 1,125 papers from three flagship conferences (LAK, EDM, and AIED) over the past five years. We discovered, categorized, and analyzed 172 datasets used in 204 publications. Our study presents the most comprehensive collection and analysis of open educational datasets to date, along with the most detailed categorization. Of the 172 datasets identified, 143 were not captured in any prior survey of open data in learning analytics. We provide insights into the datasets' context, analytical methods, use, and other properties. Based on this survey, we summarize the current gaps in the field. Furthermore, we list practical recommendations, advice, and 8-item guidelines under the acronym PRACTICE with a checklist to help researchers publish their data. Lastly, we share our original dataset: an annotated inventory detailing the discovered datasets and the corresponding publications. We hope these findings will support further adoption of open data practices in learning analytics communities and beyond."

We investigate its consequences in the far-field regime in cylindrical cavities, by employing a specular ray-tracing algorithm. At thermal equilibrium, we show that violation of Kirchhoff's law yields non-vanishing heat rectification coefficients within different sections of the cavity, which can be tuned for perfect rectification and circulation, while internal monochromatic currents vanish due to the intrinsic coupling between emission and absorption at specular surfaces. This constraint is lifted under nonequilibrium conditions, where rotational heat fluxes within the cavity can be precisely controlled by appropriately combining reciprocal and nonreciprocal materials. These findings open new avenues for thermal management and provide design principles for nonreciprocal photonic devices."

Existing offline safe RL methods typically balance reward-safety tradeoffs through constraint relaxation or joint optimization, but they often lack structural mechanisms to prevent safety drift. We propose LexiSafe, a lexicographic offline RL framework designed to preserve safety-aligned behavior. We first develop LexiSafe-SC, a single-cost formulation for standard offline safe RL, and derive safety-violation and performance-suboptimality bounds that together yield sample-complexity guarantees. We then extend the framework to hierarchical safety requirements with LexiSafe-MC, which supports multiple safety costs and admits its own sample-complexity analysis. Empirically, LexiSafe demonstrates reduced safety violations and improved task performance compared to constrained offline baselines. By unifying lexicographic prioritization with structural bias, LexiSafe offers a practical and theoretically grounded approach for safety-critical CPS decision-making."

    "abstract": "Accurate grasping point prediction is a key challenge for autonomous tissue manipulation in minimally invasive surgery, particularly in complex and variable procedures such as colorectal interventions. Due to their complexity and prolonged duration, colorectal procedures have been underrepresented in current research. At the same time, they pose a particularly interesting learning environment due to repetitive tissue manipulation, making them a promising entry point for autonomous, machine learning-driven support. Therefore, in this work, we introduce attachment anchors, a structured representation that encodes the local geometric and mechanical relationships between tissue and its anatomical attachments in colorectal surgery. This representation reduces uncertainty in grasping point prediction by normalizing surgical scenes into a consistent local reference frame. We demonstrate that attachment anchors can be predicted from laparoscopic images and incorporated into a grasping framework based on machine learning. Experiments on a dataset of 90 colorectal surgeries demonstrate that attachment anchors improve grasping point prediction compared to image-only baselines. There are particularly strong gains in out-of-distribution settings, including unseen procedures and operating surgeons. These results suggest that attachment anchors are an effective intermediate representation for learning-based tissue manipulation in colorectal surgery."

Oxygen flow rates ranging from 5.0 to 20 sccm corresponded to O content changes from 57.7 to 69.6 at.% and resulted in large differences in dielectric behavior, from films with no measurable dielectric strength to a dielectric strength of 231 V$μ$m$^{-1}$, respectively. Ab initio calculations were employed to explain the large property changes, and we show that a decrease in the dielectric strength can be linked to the formation of metal-metal bonds in the material, when the O content is less than what would correspond to a stoichiometric Ta$_2$O$_5$ and Al$_2$O$_3$ mixture. The electronic states corresponding to the metal--metal bonds are located in the band gap close to the top of the valence band, leading to an effective band gap reduction, which is directly supported by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy valence band measurements and by a broad optical absorption in the visible region."

X-Value consists of more than 5,000 QA pairs across 18 languages, systematically organized into 7 core domains grounded in Schwartz's Theory of Basic Human Values and categorized into easy and hard levels for discriminative evaluation. We further propose a unique two-stage annotation framework that first identifies whether an issue falls under global consensus (e.g., human rights) or pluralism (e.g., religion), and subsequently conducts a multi-party evaluation of the latent values embedded within the content. Systematic evaluations on X-Value reveal that current SOTA LLMs exhibit deficiencies in cross-lingual values assessment ($Acc < 77\\%$), with significant performance disparities across different languages ($ΔAcc > 20\\%$).

This demo first presents a platform for context-aware autoscaling of stream processing services that allows developers to monitor and adjust the service execution across multiple service-specific parameters. We then connect a scaling agent to these interfaces that gradually builds an understanding of the processing environment by exploring each service's action space; the agent then optimizes the service execution according to this knowledge.

U-Net and U-Net++ architectures were thus employed as lightweight convolutional decoders to assess how well the geospatial information distilled in the embeddings can be translated into accurate surface height estimates. Both architectures achieved strong training performance (both with $R^2 = 0.97$), confirming that the embeddings encode informative and decodable height-related signals. On the test set, performance decreased due to distribution shifts in height frequency between training and testing areas. Nevertheless, U-Net++ shows better generalization ($R^2 = 0.84$, median difference = -2.62 m) compared with the standard U-Net ($R^2 = 0.78$, median difference = -7.22 m), suggesting enhanced robustness to distribution mismatch. While the testing RMSE (approximately 16 m for U-Net++) and residual bias highlight remaining challenges in generalization, strong correlations indicate that the embeddings capture transferable topographic patterns. Overall, the results demonstrate the promising potential of AlphaEarth Embeddings to guide DL-based height mapping workflows, particularly when combined with spatially aware convolutional architectures, while emphasizing the need to address bias for improved regional transferability."

The model naturally accommodates three nearly degenerate right-handed (RH) neutrinos when they are assigned to the triplet representation of $A_4$. The near degeneracy originates from treating the symmetric contribution to the Majorana mass matrix, arising from the $\\mathbf{3}\\otimes\\mathbf{3}$ decomposition of $A_4$, as a small perturbation to the dominant singlet contribution. Generalized CP (gCP) symmetry is imposed in the model, rendering the complex modulus $τ$ as the sole source of CP violation. In particular, for the inverted hierarchy (IH), the predicted $3σ$ range of $θ_{23}$ lies in the lower octant close to maximal value while CP phase $δ_{\\mathrm{CP}}$ and the Majorana phase $α_{21}$ are predicted to lie close to $0^\\circ$ or $360^\\circ$. Also, in this case, predicted values of $m_{ee}$ and $\\sum_i m_i$ can be tested and constrained by future neutrinoless double beta decay $(0νββ)$ experiments, as well as by cosmological observations, particularly DESI+BAO and Planck data. In fact DESI+BAO disallows IH in the model. We further show that successful baryogenesis can be achieved for both normal hierarchy (NH) and inverted hierarchy (IH) of light neutrino masses with RH neutrino masses as low as $537~\\mathrm{GeV}$ rendering this scenario experimentally testable. For NH, RH neutrino mass degeneracy of $\\mathcal{O}(10^{-7}\\!-\\!10^{-6})$ is required, while for IH a stronger degeneracy of $\\mathcal{O}(10^{-8})$ is needed.

    "abstract": "The combinatorial approach applied to functional oxides has enabled the production of material libraries that formally contain infinite compositions. A complete ternary diagram can be obtained by pulsed laser deposition (PLD) on 100 mm silicon wafers. However, interest in such materials libraries is only meaningful if high-throughput characterization enables the information extraction from the as-deposited library in a reasonable time. While much commercial equipment allows for XY-resolved characterization at room temperature, very few sample holders have been made available to investigate structural, chemical, and functional properties at high temperatures in controlled atmospheres. In the present work, we present a furnace that enables the study of 100 mm wafers as a function of temperature. This furnace has a dome to control the atmosphere, typically varying from nitrogen gas to pure oxygen atmosphere with external control. We present the design of such a furnace and an example of X-ray diffraction (XRD) and fluorescence (XRF) measurements performed at the DiffAbs beamline of the SOLEIL synchrotron. We apply this high-throughput approach to a combinatorial library up to 735 {\\textdegree}C in nitrogen and calculate the thermal expansion coefficients (TEC) of the ternary system using custom-made MATLAB codes. The TEC analysis revealed the potential limitations of Vegard's law in predicting lattice variations for high-entropy materials."

    "abstract": "Generative AI is reshaping knowledge work, yet existing research focuses predominantly on software engineering and the natural sciences, with limited methodological exploration for the humanities and social sciences. Positioned as a \"methodological experiment,\" this study proposes an AI Agent-based collaborative research workflow (Agentic Workflow) for humanities and social science research. Taiwan's Claude.ai usage data (N = 7,729 conversations, November 2025) from the Anthropic Economic Index (AEI) serves as the empirical vehicle for validating the feasibility of this methodology. This study operates on two levels: the primary level is the design and validation of a methodological framework - a seven-stage modular workflow grounded in three principles: task modularization, human-AI division of labor, and verifiability, with each stage delineating clear roles for human researchers (research judgment and ethical decisions) and AI Agents (information retrieval and text generation); the secondary level is the empirical analysis of AEI Taiwan data - serving as an operational demonstration of the workflow's application to secondary data research, showcasing both the process and output quality (see Appendix A). This study contributes by proposing a replicable AI collaboration framework for humanities and social science researchers, and identifying three operational modes of human-AI collaboration - direct execution, iterative refinement, and human-led - through reflexive documentation of the operational process. This taxonomy reveals the irreplaceability of human judgment in research question formulation, theoretical interpretation, contextualized reasoning, and ethical reflection. Limitations including single-platform data, cross-sectional design, and AI reliability risks are acknowledged."

    "abstract": "We present an AI-assisted framework for predicting individual runs of complex quantum experiments, including contextuality and causality (adaptive measurements), within our long-term programme of discovering a local hidden-variable theory that extends quantum theory. In order to circumvent impossibility theorems, we replace the assumption of free choice (measurement independence and parameter independence) with a weaker, compatibilistic version called contingent free choice. Our framework is based on interpreting complex quantum experiments as a Chess-like game between observers and the universe, which is seen as an economic agent minimizing action. The game structures corresponding to generic experiments such as fixed-causal-order process matrices or causal contextuality scenarios, together with a deterministic non-Nashian resolution algorithm that abandons unilateral deviation assumptions (free choice) and assumes Perfect Prediction instead, were described in previous work. In this new research, we learn the reward functions of the game, which contain a hidden variable, using neural networks. The cost function is the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the frequency histograms obtained through many deterministic runs of the game and the predictions of the extended Born rule. Using our framework on the specific case of the EPR 2-2-2 experiment acts as a proof-of-concept and a toy local-realist hidden-variable model that non-Nashian quantum theory is a promising avenue towards a local hidden-variable theory. Our framework constitutes a solid foundation, which can be further expanded in order to fully discover a complete quantum theory."

    "abstract": "Two-dimensional semiconductors have attracted considerable interest for integration into emerging quantum photonic networks. Strain engineering of monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenides (ML-TMDs) enables the tuning of light-matter interactions and associated optoelectronic properties, and generates new functionalities, including the formation of quantum dots (QDs). Here, we combine spatially resolved micro-photoluminescence ($μ$-PL) spectroscopy from cryogenic (4$\\text{-}$94 K) to room temperature with micro-Raman spectroscopy at room temperature to investigate the strain-dependent emission energies of thousands of individual QDs in ML-WS$_2$ and ML-WSe$_2$, integrated across multiple heterostructures and a piezoelectric device. Compared with delocalized excitons, QDs in both materials exhibit enhanced strain sensitivities of their emission energies $-$ approximately fourfold in WS$_2$ and twofold in WSe$_2$ $-$ leading to pronounced broadening of the ensemble emission linewidth. Temperature-dependent $μ$-PL spectroscopy combined with dynamic strain tuning experiments further reveal that the enhanced strain sensitivity of individual QDs originates from strengthened interactions with low-energy phonons induced by quantum confinement. Our results demonstrate a versatile strain-engineering approach with potential for spectral matching across solid-state, atomic, and hybrid quantum photonic networks, and provide new insights into phonon-QD interactions in two-dimensional semiconductors."

    "abstract": "The current-induced vibrational dynamics is a key factor determining the stability of molecular nanojunctions. Beyond conventional Joule heating, a different mechanism caused by nonconservative current-induced forces has been predicted for models with multiple vibrational modes, leading to vibrational instabilities already at low bias voltages. So far, this mechanism has only been investigated in models with harmonic nuclear potentials. Consequently, a natural question is whether this effect can also be observed in more realistic models containing anharmonic nuclear potentials, and, if so, whether it has a measurable impact on observables such as the junction dissociation probability. In this work, we apply a mixed quantum-classical approach based on electronic friction and Langevin dynamics to various anharmonic two-mode systems. By performing Langevin simulations of the vibrational dynamics, we investigate the influence of anharmonicity on instabilities arising from nonconservative forces and the corresponding dissociation dynamics of the junction, as well as steady-state observables, such as the electronic current."

Some of that noise is correlated between neighbouring image pixels and exposures, so in principle could be learned and corrected. We present an astronomical self-supervised transformer-based denoising algorithm (ASTERIS), that integrates spatiotemporal information across multiple exposures. Benchmarking on mock data indicates that ASTERIS improves detection limits by 1.0 magnitude at 90% completeness and purity, while preserving the point spread function and photometric accuracy. Observational validation using data from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and Subaru telescope identifies previously undetectable features, including low-surface-brightness galaxy structures and gravitationally-lensed arcs. Applied to deep JWST images, ASTERIS identifies three times more redshift > 9 galaxy candidates, with rest-frame ultraviolet luminosity 1.0 magnitude fainter, than previous methods."

    "abstract": "The threat of algorithmic collusion, and whether it merits regulatory intervention, remains debated, as existing evaluations of its emergence often rely on long learning horizons, assumptions about counterparty rationality in adopting collusive strategies, and symmetry in hyperparameters and economic settings among players. To study collusion risk, we introduce a meta-game design for analyzing algorithmic behavior under test-time constraints. We model agents as possessing pretrained policies with distinct strategic characteristics (e.g., competitive, naively cooperative, robustly collusive), and formulate the problem as selecting a meta-strategy that combines a pretrained, initial policy with an in-game adaptation rule. We seek to examine whether collusion can emerge under rational choices and how agents co-adapt toward cooperation or competition. To this end, we sample normal-form empirical games over meta-strategy profiles, % across random initial game states, compute relevant game statistics (e.g., payoffs against individuals and regret against an equilibrium mixture of opponents), and construct empirical best-response graphs to uncover strategic relationships. We evaluate both reinforcement-learning and LLM-based strategies in repeated pricing games under symmetric and asymmetric cost settings, and present findings on the feasibility of algorithmic collusion and the effectiveness of pricing strategies in practical ``test-time'' environments.

    "abstract": "Near-field ultra-massive MIMO (U-MIMO) systems provide enhanced spatial resolution but present challenges for channel estimation, particularly when hybrid architectures are employed. Within this framework, dictionary-based channel estimation schemes are needed to achieve accurate reconstruction from a reduced set of measurements. However, existing near-field dictionaries generally provide full three-dimensional coverage, which is unnecessary when user equipments are primarily located on the ground. In this paper, we propose a novel near-field grid design tailored to this common scenario. Specifically, grid points lie on a reference plane located at an arbitrary height with respect to the U-MIMO system, equipped with a uniform planar array. Furthermore, a channel accuracy metric is used to improve codebook performance, and to remark the limitations of the traditional far-field angular sampling in the near field. Results show that, as long as user equipments are not far from the reference plane, the proposed grid outperforms state-of-the-art designs in both channel estimation accuracy and spectral efficiency."

    "abstract": "Remote and resource-constrained Internet-of-Things (IoT) deployments often lack terrestrial connectivity for task offloading, motivating non-terrestrial networks (NTNs) with onboard multiaccess edge computing (MEC) capabilities. Nevertheless, in the presence of malicious actors, authentication needs to be performed to avoid non-authorized nodes from draining the computing resources of the NTN nodes. As a solution, we propose a four-layer MEC-enabled NTN with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) acting as access nodes, a high altitude platform station (HAPS) acting as coordinator and authenticator, and a constellation of low-Earth orbit satellites (LEOSats) acting as remote MEC servers. We consider a tag-based physical-layer authentication (PLA) scheme to authenticate legitimate users, and formulate a joint task offloading decision and resource allocation for the admitted tasks, which is solved via block coordinate descent. Numerical results show that the PLA scheme is efficient and performs better than the benchmark schemes. We also demonstrate that the proposed scheme is robust against malicious attacks even under relaxed false-alarm constraints."

Motivated by the recent experimental realization of arbitrary fractional exponents, upon quantifying the tail properties of such coherent structures, we detail their destabilization when the fractional exponent $α$ acquires values $α<1$ and showcase how the relevant destabilization is associated with collapse type phenomena. We then turn to in- and out-of-phase pairs of such waveforms and illustrate how they generically exist for arbitrary $α$ when we cross the harmonic limit, i.e., for $α>2$. Importantly, we use the parameter $α$ as a ``bifurcation parameter'' in order to connect the harmonic ($α=2$) and biharmonic ($α=4$) limits. Remarkably, not only do we retrieve the instability of all solitonic pairs in the biharmonic case, but showcase a stabilization feature of particular branches of such multipulses that is {\\it unique} to the fractional case and does not arise -- to our knowledge -- for integer multi-pulse settings. We explain systematically this stabilization via spectral analysis and expand upon the implications of our results for the potential observability of fractional multipulse solitary waves."

Systems are asked to classify relations of two types - $at$ (\"Has the person ever been at this place?\") and $isAt$ (\"Is the person located at this place around publication time?\") - requiring reasoning over temporal and geographical cues. The lab introduces a three-fold evaluation profile that jointly assesses accuracy, computational efficiency, and domain generalization.

While both approaches capture the main features of the light-matter dynamics, we find that the truncated Wigner approximation exhibits noticeable deviations for stronger interaction strengths and when reservoir-induced noise becomes significant."

Very little is known about the nature and origins of this population of \"Ultra-Faint Compact Satellites\" (UFCSs) owing to a dearth of spectroscopic measurements. Here, we present the first spectroscopic census of these compact systems based on Magellan/IMACS and Keck/DEIMOS observations of 19 individual UFCSs, representing $\\sim$2/3 of the known population. We securely measure mean radial velocities for all 19 systems, velocity dispersions for 15 (predominantly upper limits), metallicities for 17, metallicity dispersions for 8, and $\\textit{Gaia}$-based mean proper motions for 18. This large new spectroscopic sample provides the first insights into population-level trends for these extreme satellites. We demonstrate that: (1) the UFCSs are kinematically colder, on average, than the UFDs, disfavoring very dense dark matter halos in most cases, (2) the UFCS population is chemically diverse, spanning a factor of $\\sim$300 in mean iron abundance ($\\rm -3.3 \\lesssim [Fe/H] \\lesssim -0.8$), with multiple systems falling beneath the \"metallicity floor\" proposed for GCs, and (3) while some higher-metallicity and/or younger UFCSs are clearly star clusters, the dynamical and/or chemical evidence allows the possibility that up to $\\sim$50% of the UFCSs in our sample (9 of 19) may represent the smallest and least-massive galaxies yet discovered."

    "abstract": "Humans can infer the three-dimensional structure of objects from two-dimensional visual inputs. Modeling this ability has been a longstanding goal for the science and engineering of visual intelligence, yet decades of computational methods have fallen short of human performance. Here we develop a modeling framework that predicts human 3D shape inferences for arbitrary objects, directly from experimental stimuli. We achieve this with a novel class of neural networks trained using a visual-spatial objective over naturalistic sensory data; given a set of images taken from different locations within a natural scene, these models learn to predict spatial information related to these images, such as camera location and visual depth, without relying on any object-related inductive biases. Notably, these visual-spatial signals are analogous to sensory cues readily available to humans. We design a zero-shot evaluation approach to determine the performance of these `multi-view' models on a well established 3D perception task, then compare model and human behavior. Our modeling framework is the first to match human accuracy on 3D shape inferences, even without task-specific training or fine-tuning. Remarkably, independent readouts of model responses predict fine-grained measures of human behavior, including error patterns and reaction times, revealing a natural correspondence between model dynamics and human perception. Taken together, our findings indicate that human-level 3D perception can emerge from a simple, scalable learning objective over naturalistic visual-spatial data. All code, human behavioral data, and experimental stimuli needed to reproduce our findings can be found on our project page."

We adopt a human centric view governed by two principles: counterfactual harm, ensuring the AI does not undermine human strengths, and complementarity, ensuring it adds value where the human is prone to err. We formalize these concepts via user defined rules, allowing users to specify exactly what harm and complementarity mean for their specific task. We then introduce an online, distribution free algorithm with finite sample guarantees that enforces the user-specified constraints over the collaboration dynamics. We evaluate our framework across two interactive settings: LLM simulated collaboration on a medical diagnostic task and a human crowdsourcing study on a pictorial reasoning task. We show that our online procedure maintains prescribed counterfactual harm and complementarity violation rates even under nonstationary interaction dynamics. Moreover, tightening or loosening these constraints produces predictable shifts in downstream human accuracy, confirming that the two principles serve as practical levers for steering multi-round collaboration toward better decision quality without the need to model or constrain human behavior."

These methods do not explicitly enforce person-garment alignment and fail to explain how correspondence emerges within Diffusion Transformers (DiTs). In this paper, we first analyze full 3D attention in DiT-based architecture and reveal that the person-garment correspondence critically depends on precise person-garment query-key matching within the full 3D attention. Building on this insight, we then introduce CORrespondence ALignment (CORAL), a DiT-based framework that explicitly aligns query-key matching with robust external correspondences. CORAL integrates two complementary components: a correspondence distillation loss that aligns reliable matches with person-garment attention, and an entropy minimization loss that sharpens the attention distribution. We further propose a VLM-based evaluation protocol to better reflect human preference. CORAL consistently improves over the baseline, enhancing both global shape transfer and local detail preservation. Extensive ablations validate our design choices."

    "abstract": "Modern big-data systems generate massive, heterogeneous, and geographically dispersed streams that are large-scale and privacy-sensitive, making centralization challenging. While federated learning (FL) provides a privacy-enhancing training mechanism, it assumes a static data flow and learns a collaborative model over multiple rounds, making learning with \\textit{incremental} data challenging in limited-communication scenarios. This paper presents One-Shot Incremental Federated Learning (OSI-FL), the first FL framework that addresses the dual challenges of communication overhead and catastrophic forgetting. OSI-FL communicates category-specific embeddings, devised by a frozen vision-language model (VLM) from each client in a single communication round, which a pre-trained diffusion model at the server uses to synthesize new data similar to the client's data distribution. The synthesized samples are used on the server for training. However, two challenges still persist: i) tasks arriving incrementally need to retrain the global model, and ii) as future tasks arrive, retraining the model introduces catastrophic forgetting. To this end, we augment training with Selective Sample Retention (SSR), which identifies and retains the top-p most informative samples per category and task pair based on sample loss. SSR bounds forgetting by ensuring that representative retained samples are incorporated into training in further iterations. The experimental results indicate that OSI-FL outperforms baselines, including traditional and one-shot FL approaches, in both class-incremental and domain-incremental scenarios across three benchmark datasets."

Since 2020, ATOMKI has observed this resonance in nuclear transitions from excited to ground states in ${}^{8}\\mathrm{Be}$, ${}^{4}\\mathrm{He}$, and ${}^{12}\\mathrm{C}$. More recently, in 2025, PADME, operating at the Laboratori Nazionali di Frascati, has also hinted a similar excess, in this case in the $e^{+}e^{-}$ final-state events originating from positron annihilation on fixed-target atomic electrons of Carbonium. This concordance strengthens the case for a common underlying origin, potentially involving a new boson, conventionally referred to as $X_{17}$. Despite these intriguing developments, the global experimental landscape remains highly dynamic, particularly in light of recent MEG~II constraints, and a definitive confirmation or exclusion of the $X_{17}$ hypothesis is still lacking. Within this evolving and exciting context, this thesis investigates whether a hypothetical $17\\,\\text{MeV}$ particle, coupled to electrons as suggested by the PADME observations, could function as a mediator between the Standard Model and previously unexplored hidden sectors. Such a mediator could, in principle, offer a novel pathway toward addressing one of the principal outstanding inconsistencies of the Standard Model: the nature and origin of dark matter."

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) is widely used to improve large language models on reasoning tasks, and asynchronous RL training is attractive because it increases end-to-end throughput. However, for widely adopted critic-free policy-gradient methods such as REINFORCE and GRPO, high asynchrony makes the policy-gradient estimator markedly $\\textbf{higher variance}$: training on stale rollouts creates heavy-tailed importance ratios, causing a small fraction of samples to dominate updates. This amplification makes gradients noisy and learning unstable relative to matched on-policy training. Across math and general reasoning benchmarks, we find collapse is reliably predicted by effective sample size (ESS) and unstable gradient norms. Motivated by this diagnosis, we propose $\\textbf{V}$ariance $\\textbf{C}$ontrolled $\\textbf{P}$olicy $\\textbf{O}$ptimization ($\\textbf{VCPO}$), a general stabilization method for REINFORCE/GRPO-style algorithms that (i) scales learning rate based on effective sample size to dampen unreliable updates, and (ii) applies a closed-form minimum-variance baseline for the off-policy setting, avoiding an auxiliary value model and adding minimal overhead. Empirically, VCPO substantially improves robustness for asynchronous training across math, general reasoning, and tool-use tasks, outperforming a broad suite of baselines spanning masking/clipping stabilizers and algorithmic variants. This reduces long-context, multi-turn training time by 2.5$\\times$ while matching synchronous performance, demonstrating that explicit control of policy-gradient variance is key for reliable asynchronous RL at scale."

    "abstract": "Characterizing compressible fluctuations in the solar wind is essential for understanding their role in solar wind acceleration and heating, yet their origin and evolution across different turbulence regimes remain poorly understood. In this study, we carry out a statistical analysis of the properties of compressible fluctuations in solar wind dominated by balanced and imbalanced turbulence. Using in-situ measurements from Wind, Solar Orbiter, and Parker Solar Probe, we investigate the scale dependence of density and magnetic field fluctuations and their correlations with plasma beta and radial distance. Our results indicate that solar wind compressibility is likely affected by both expansion effects and compressible dynamics governed by local plasma conditions. The non-Alfvenic wind is dominated by anti-correlated fluctuations, whereas the Alfvenic wind contains a mixture of correlated and anti-correlated fluctuations, though the latter remain prevalent. While the anti-correlated component is consistent with MHD slow magnetosonic modes, the correlated (fast mode-like) component is not reproduced by predictions from either linear MHD theory or nonlinear models of forced compressible fluctuations. Nevertheless, the dominant slow mode component explains the observed dependence on beta and the enhanced density fluctuations measured by Parker Solar Probe. This further suggests that slow mode waves contribute significantly to the compressible energy budget near the Sun and may play an important role in solar wind heating and acceleration close to the Sun."

In this work, we develop a high-throughput screening platform that utilizes molecular dynamics simulations to navigate a chemical space of 1.7 million hypothetical polymer electrolyte candidates. Data from previous literature is used to warm-start batch Bayesian optimization for iteratively selecting new polymer electrolytes to evaluate. We iteratively identified, evaluated and analyzed 767 homopolymers as potential candidates. Our results reveal several candidates with transport properties exceeding the benchmark polyethylene oxide (PEO)/LiTFSI system. Crucially, our optimization campaigns for ionic conductivity and Li-diffusivity demonstrate that branched architectures and ketone functional groups significantly enhance ion-hopping mechanisms within the polymer matrix. We provide an in-depth mechanistic comparison of Li vs. Na cation transport and offer our open-source framework to accelerate the discovery of liquid, gel, and multi-cation electrolyte systems."

    "abstract": "Rigorously evaluating machine intelligence against the broad spectrum of human general intelligence has become increasingly important and challenging in this era of rapid technological advance. Conventional AI benchmarks typically assess only narrow capabilities in a limited range of human activity. Most are also static, quickly saturating as developers explicitly or implicitly optimize for them. We propose that a more promising way to evaluate human-like general intelligence in AI systems is through a particularly strong form of general game playing: studying how and how well they play and learn to play \\textbf{all conceivable human games}, in comparison to human players with the same level of experience, time, or other resources. We define a \"human game\" to be a game designed by humans for humans, and argue for the evaluative suitability of this space of all such games people can imagine and enjoy -- the \"Multiverse of Human Games\". Taking a first step towards this vision, we introduce the AI GameStore, a scalable and open-ended platform that uses LLMs with humans-in-the-loop to synthesize new representative human games, by automatically sourcing and adapting standardized and containerized variants of game environments from popular human digital gaming platforms. As a proof of concept, we generated 100 such games based on the top charts of Apple App Store and Steam, and evaluated seven frontier vision-language models (VLMs) on short episodes of play. The best models achieved less than 10\\% of the human average score on the majority of the games, and especially struggled with games that challenge world-model learning, memory and planning. We conclude with a set of next steps for building out the AI GameStore as a practical way to measure and drive progress toward human-like general intelligence in machines."

The H I covering fraction (k_HI) within the virial radius (Rvir) of low-mass (7 < log10(M*/Msun)< 9) galaxies, for a threshold column density of log10(N(HI)/cm^-2) = 14.5, exhibits an enhancement along both the disk plane (azimuthal angle phi < 20 degree) and in the polar direction (phi > 70 degree). In contrast, such a bimodal distribution is not observed for higher mass galaxies (9 < log10(M*/Msun) < 11.3). Similarly, the O VI covering fraction (k_OVI), for a threshold of log10(N(OVI)/cm^-2) = 14.0, shows a tentative enhancement along both the projected major and minor axes for low-mass galaxies. In contrast, O VI-bearing gas around higher- mass galaxies appears more uniformly distributed, with no significant azimuthal dependence. Finally, using the halo circular-velocity-normalized pixel-velocity two-point correlation function (TPCF), we find that O VI absorbers are kinematically narrower along the disk plane compared to the polar directions of the host galaxies with similar stellar mass distributions. The observed isotropic distribution of O VI in high-mass halos suggests that its spatial distribution is governed by global halo properties; however, the O VI kinematics retain memory of the site of origin."

    "abstract": "The dynamic programming approach is one of the most powerful ones in optimal control. However, when dealing with optimal control problems of stochastic Volterra integral equations (SVIEs) with completely monotone kernels, deep mathematical difficulties arise and it is still not understood. These very classical problems have applications in most fields and have now become even more popular due to their applications in mathematical finance under rough volatility. In this article, we consider a class of optimal control problems of SVIEs with completely monotone kernels. Via a recent Markovian lift \\cite{FGW2024}, the problem can be reformulated as an optimal control problem of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) on suitable Hilbert spaces, which due to the roughness of the kernel, presents a generator of an analytic semigroup and unbounded control and diffusion operators. This analysis leads us to study a general class of optimal control problems of abstract SDEs on Hilbert spaces with unbounded control and diffusion operators. This class includes optimal control problems of SVIEs with completely monotone kernels, but it is also motivated by other models. We analyze the regularity of the associated Ornstein-Uhlenbeck transition semigroup. We prove that the semigroup exhibits a new smoothing property in control directions through a general observation operator $Γ$, which we call $Γ$-smoothing. This allows us to establish existence and uniqueness of mild solutions of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, establish a verification theorem, and construct optimal feedback controls. We apply these results to optimal control problems of SVIEs with completely monotone kernels. To the best of our knowledge these are the first results of this kind for this abstract class of infinite dimensional problems and for the optimal control of SVIEs with completely monotone kernels."

    "abstract": "Embedded optimization-based planning for hybrid systems is challenging due to the use of mixed-integer programming, which is computationally intensive and often sensitive to the specific numerical formulation. To address that challenge, this article proposes a framework for motion planning of hybrid systems that pairs hybrid zonotopes - an advanced set representation - with a new alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) mixed-integer programming heuristic. A general treatment of piecewise affine (PWA) system reachability analysis using hybrid zonotopes is presented and extended to formulate optimal planning problems. Sets produced using the proposed identities have lower memory complexity and tighter convex relaxations than equivalent sets produced from preexisting techniques. The proposed ADMM heuristic makes efficient use of the hybrid zonotope structure. For planning problems formulated as hybrid zonotopes, the proposed heuristic achieves improved convergence rates as compared to state-of-the-art mixed-integer programming heuristics. The proposed methods for hybrid system planning on embedded hardware are experimentally applied in a combined behavior and motion planning scenario for autonomous driving."

    "abstract": "Self-distillation (SD) is the process of retraining a student on a mixture of ground-truth labels and the teacher's own predictions using the same architecture and training data. Although SD has been empirically shown to often improve generalization, its formal guarantees remain limited. We study SD for ridge regression in unconstrained setting in which the mixing weight $ξ$ may be outside the unit interval. Conditioned on the training data and without any distributional assumptions, we prove that for any squared prediction risk (including out-of-distribution), the optimally mixed student strictly improves upon the ridge teacher for every regularization level $λ> 0$ at which the teacher ridge risk $R(λ)$ is nonstationary (i.e., $R'(λ) \\neq 0$). We obtain a closed-form expression for the optimal mixing weight $ξ^\\star(λ)$ for any value of $λ$ and show that it obeys the sign rule: $\\operatorname{sign}(ξ^\\star(λ))=-\\operatorname{sign}(R'(λ))$. In particular, $ξ^\\star(λ)$ can be negative, which is the case in over-regularized regimes. To quantify the risk improvement due to SD, we derive exact deterministic equivalents for the optimal SD risk in the proportional asymptotics regime (where the sample and feature sizes $n$ and $p$ both diverge but their aspect ratio $p/n$ converges) under general anisotropic covariance and deterministic signals. Our asymptotic analysis extends standard second-order ridge deterministic equivalents to their fourth-order analogs using block linearization, which may be of independent interest. From a practical standpoint, we propose a consistent one-shot tuning method to estimate $ξ^\\star$ without grid search, sample splitting, or refitting. Experiments on real-world datasets and pretrained neural network features support our theory and the one-shot tuning method."

    "abstract": "Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is a tomographic sensor that measures 2D slices of the 3D spatial Fourier transform of the scene. In many operational scenarios, the measured set of 2D slices does not fill the 3D space in the Fourier domain, resulting in significant artifacts in the reconstructed imagery. Traditionally, simple priors, such as sparsity in the image domain, are used to regularize the inverse problem. In this paper, we review our recent work that achieves state-of-the-art results in 3D SAR imaging employing neural structures to model the surface scattering that dominates SAR returns. These neural structures encode the surface of the objects in the form of a signed distance function learned from the sparse scattering data. Since estimating a smooth surface from a sparse and noisy point cloud is an ill-posed problem, we regularize the surface estimation by sampling points from the implicit surface representation during the training step. We demonstrate the model's ability to represent target scattering using measured and simulated data from single vehicles and a larger scene with a large number of vehicles. We conclude with future research directions calling for methods to learn complex-valued neural representations to enable synthesizing new collections from the volumetric neural implicit representation."

We find that the trace-ordered amplitude has the form of a Parke-Taylor factor multiplied by the Fourier transform of the instanton density evaluated on the total momentum of the gluons. A background flavour instanton modifies the leading soft gluon and photon theorem, generating a level equal to twice the instanton charge in the soft Kac-Moody symmetry. We discuss the implications of our results for amplitudes in the presence of dynamical instantons."

In this work, we test the robustness of parameterized tests against unmodeled deviations from general relativity. We demonstrate that these parameterized tests are flexible and sensitive in detecting generic deviations in the waveform using the Cutler-Vallisneri bias formalism. This universality arises from examining the inherent geometry of the waveform signal and understanding how biases manifest. We show how Bayes factors are governed by the intrinsic geometry of the waveform signal manifold when parameterized tests are used to approximate generic violations of GR. We use the singular value decomposition to propose templates that are orthogonal to parameterized tests, identifying degeneracies and enhancing the detection of potential deviations. More broadly, the geometric framework developed here clarifies -- at a fundamental level -- how subtle waveform effects (including orbital eccentricity, spin precession, waveform systematics, and instrumental glitches) can mimic one another in data, and when they are intrinsically distinguishable."

    "abstract": "In recent years, Homotopy Type Theory (HoTT) has had great success both as a foundation of mathematics and as internal language to reason about $\\infty$-groupoids (a.k.a. spaces). However, in many areas of mathematics and computer science, it is often the case that it is categories, not groupoids, which are the more important structures to consider. For this reason, multiple directed type theories have been proposed, i.e., theories whose semantics are based on categories. In this paper, we present a new such type theory, Twisted Type Theory (TTT). It features a novel ``twisting'' operation on types: given a type that depends both contravariantly and covariantly on some variables, its twist is a new type that depends only covariantly on the same variables. To provide the semantics of this operation, we introduce the notion of dependent 2-sided fibrations (D2SFibs), which generalize Street's notion of 2-sided fibrations. We develop the basic theory of D2SFibs, as well as characterize them through a straightening-unstraightening theorem. With these results in hand, we introduce a new elimination rule for Hom-types. We argue that our syntax and semantics satisfy key features that allow reasoning in a HoTT-like style, which allows us to mimic the proof techniques of that setting. We end the paper by exemplifying this, and use TTT to reason about categories, giving a syntactic proof of Yoneda's lemma."

Proton-driven accelerators in particular have the potential to bring particles to high energy in a single stage. In the quasilinear regime - where the plasma wake is only partially evacuated - a witness bunch of electrons drives a cavitated wake, which acts to preserve the emittance of the portion of the witness inside this self-blowout. In the case of a misalignment between the driver and witness, this behaviour can persist, but its effectiveness is reduced. In this paper, we study transverse witness dynamics in this regime, and develop analytical models to describe the witness motion, and develop a metric to estimate emittance preservation based on a single parameter which estimates the density of the witness after phase mixing. Particle in cell simulations using the AWAKE Run 2c baseline parameters show excellent agreement with the predictive models developed. This work allows alignment constraints to be set both for the AWAKE experiment and other wakefield acceleration schemes operating in the quasilinear regime."

These include a nitrogen atmosphere with a condensible gas - methane - replacing the Earth's water, leading to an active meteorology with rainfall and surface manifestations including rivers, lakes and seas, and the dissolution of karstic terrain. Other phenomena such as craters, dunes, and tectonic features are found elsewhere - e.g. on Mars and Venus - but their continuing alteration by pluvial, fluvial and lacustrine processes can be studied only on Earth and Titan. Meanwhile Titan also hosts an interior liquid water ocean with similarities to the Earth as well as to ocean worlds such as Europa and Enceladus. Our focus in this review paper is twofold: to describe the geophysical and geological parallels between Earth and Titan, and to evaluate the yet-underexploited possibilities for field analog research to gain new knowledge about these processes. To date, Titan's much colder temperature and different atmospheric and crustal materials have led to a skepticism that useful analogs can be found on Earth. Our conclusion, however, is that a much larger range of useful analog field work is possible and this work will substantially enhance our knowledge of both worlds. Such investigation will supplement the existing sparse data for Titan returned by space missions, will greatly enhance our understanding of such datasets, and will help to provide science impetus and goals for future missions."

    "abstract": "Free-electron interactions with light and matter have long served as a cornerstone for exploring the quantum and ultrafast dynamics of material excitation. In recent years, this paradigm has evolved from a classical description of radiation and acceleration toward a fully quantum framework, transforming our understanding of light-matter interactions at the single-electron level. These advances have opened new opportunities in high-resolution imaging, ultrafast spectroscopy, interferometry, and the coherent shaping of electron wavepackets. This review surveys stimulated interactions between slow electrons and light, encompassing free-space and near-field mediated mechanisms. We discuss how free-space optical fields coherently modulate electron momentum and energy, and how near-field coupling in nanophotonic and plasmonic structures enables strong, phase-matched, efficient momentum exchange with the electron wavepacket. We further describe electron recoil, which is significant in the slow-electron regime, and temporal and spatial wavepacket shaping that enhances coupling efficiency and extends access to quantum-coherent regimes. Building on these foundations, we outline emerging frameworks including hybrid optical-electrostatic modulation, ponderomotive laser-based aberration correction, and optical electron interferometry. By unifying these developments, stimulated electron-light interactions provide a versatile route to precise beam control, quantum-state engineering, and tailored light-matter coupling, with implications for ultrafast spectroscopy, nanoscale metrology, attosecond pulse generation, electron-photon entanglement, and the creation of nonclassical states of light."

While advanced concepts such as Web 4.0 have emerged from mature technologies, the introduction of large language models (LLMs) has profoundly influenced both the field and its applications. This wave of LLMs has permeated science and technology so deeply that no area remains untouched. Consequently, LLMs are reshaping web research and development, transforming traditional pipelines into generative solutions for tasks like information retrieval, question answering, recommendation systems, and web analytics. They have also enabled new applications such as web-based summarization and educational tools. This survey explores recent advances in the impact of LLMs-particularly through the use of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-on web research and industry. It discusses key developments, open challenges, and future directions for enhancing web solutions with LLMs."

    "abstract": "Machine learning training places immense demands on cluster networks, motivating specialized architectures and co-design with parallelization strategies. Recent designs incorporating optical circuit switches (OCSes) are promising, offering improved cost, power efficiency, and long-term bandwidth scaling than packet switches. However, most existing approaches rely on costly high-radix OCSes and/or combine them with packet switches to achieve competitive performance at scale. Unfortunately, high-radix OCSes are both expensive and slow to reconfigure, limiting both scalability and performance. We propose Arrays of Cheap Optical Switches (ACOS), which bring application co-design directly to the structure of the reconfigurable fabric. Using low-radix OCSes as building blocks, ACOS supports the forms of reconfiguration needed in training clusters including topology selection, workload adaptation, and failure resilience. The cost of ACOS scales with supported topologies and adaptations rather than with port count, breaking past the scalability barriers of current specialized ML networks. We show through simulation that ACOS-based deployments match the performance of fully provisioned packet-switched networks when training state-of-the-art LLMs at scale, while delivering significant cost savings using existing off-the-shelf OCSes, with strong bandwidth scaling and higher cost savings in the future."

We subsume this game under a more general class of games on abstract Polish spaces with pairwise interactions, and prove that the latter games have a variational structure (in the sense that their equilibria can be characterized as critical points of some potential functional) and admit equilibria. We also discuss two a priori distinct notions of equilibria, providing a sufficient condition under which both notions coincide. The results for the games in abstract Polish spaces are applied to our mean field game model, and a numerical illustration concludes the paper."

We propose a simple bias-reduced evaluation protocol that replaces the labels of each question with uniform, unordered labels and prompts the LLM to use the whole answer presented. With a simple sentence similarity model, we demonstrate improved robustness and lower standard deviation between different permutations of answers with a minimal drop in LLM's performance, exposing the LLM's capabilities under reduced evaluation artifacts, without any help from the prompt examples or the option labels. Across multiple benchmarks and models, this protocol substantially improves the robustness to answer permutations, reducing mean accuracy variance $3\\times$ with only a minimal decrease in the mean model's performance. Through ablation studies on various embedding models and similarity functions, we show that the method is more robust than the standard ones."

To address this, we formulate STL planning as an optimization program under arbitrary multi-agent constraints and introduce a penalty-based unconstrained relaxation that can be efficiently solved via a Block-Coordinate Gradient Descent (BCGD) method, where each block corresponds to a single agent's decision variables, thereby mitigating complexity. By utilizing a quadratic penalty function defined via smooth STL semantics, we show that BCGD iterations converge to a stationary point of the penalized problem under standard regularity assumptions. To enforce feasibility, the BCGD solver is embedded within a two-layer optimization scheme: inner BCGD updates are performed for a fixed penalty parameter, which is then increased in an outer loop to progressively improve multi-agent STL robustness. The proposed framework enables scalable computations and is validated through various complex multi-robot planning scenarios."

We show that the phases can still be distinguished using the number and parity variances, which are observables accessible in a quantum-gas microscope. Phases analogous to the RMI were found to exist in other quasi-1D lattice structures, with the lattice connectivity modifying the phase boundaries. This shows that the the presence of these phases is the result of states with one-dimensional structures being mapped onto higher dimensional systems, driven by the reduction of hopping rates along different directions."

    "abstract": "Self-adaptive systems increasingly operate in close interaction with humans, often sharing the same physical or virtual environments and making decisions with ethical implications at runtime. Current approaches typically encode ethics as fixed, rule-based constraints or as a single chosen ethical theory embedded at design time. This overlooks a fundamental property of human-system interaction settings: ethical preferences vary across individuals and groups, evolve with context, and may conflict, while still needing to remain within a legally and regulatorily defined hard-ethics envelope (e.g., safety and compliance constraints). This paper advocates a shift from static ethical rules to runtime ethical reasoning for self-adaptive systems, where ethical preferences are treated as runtime requirements that must be elicited, represented, and continuously revised as stakeholders and situations change. We argue that satisfying such requirements demands explicit ethics-based negotiation to manage ethical trade-offs among multiple humans who interact with, are represented by, or are affected by a system. We identify key challenges, ethical uncertainty, conflicts among ethical values (including human, societal, and environmental drivers), and multi-dimensional/multi-party/multi-driver negotiation, and outline research directions and questions toward ethically self-adaptive systems."

While these paradigms excel at capturing local genomic syntax and fine-grained motif patterns, they often fail to capture the broader functional context, resulting in representations that lack a global biological perspective. We introduce JEPA-DNA, a novel pre-training framework that integrates the Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) with traditional generative objectives. JEPA-DNA introduces latent grounding by coupling token-level recovery with a predictive objective in the latent space by supervising a CLS token. This forces the model to predict the high-level functional embeddings of masked genomic segments rather than focusing solely on individual nucleotides. JEPA-DNA extends both NTP and MLM paradigms and can be deployed either as a standalone from-scratch objective or as a continual pre-training enhancement for existing GFMs. Our evaluations across a diverse suite of genomic benchmarks demonstrate that JEPA-DNA consistently yields superior performance in supervised and zero-shot tasks compared to generative-only baselines. By providing a more robust and biologically grounded representation, JEPA-DNA offers a scalable path toward foundation models that understand not only the genomic alphabet, but also the underlying functional logic of the sequence."

The parametric ones are sometimes too biased while the nonparametric ones are sometimes too variable. In the present paper a certain semiparametric approach to hazard rate estimation, proposed in Hjort (1991), is developed further, aiming to combine parametric and nonparametric features. It uses a dynamic local likelihood approach to fit the locally most suitable member in a given parametric class of hazard rates, and amounts to a version of nonparametric parameter smoothing within the parametric class. Thus the parametric hazard rate estimate at time $s$ inserts a parameter estimate that also depends on $s$. We study bias and variance properties of the resulting estimator and methods for choosing the local smoothing parameter. It is shown that dynamic likelihood estimation often leads to better performance than the purely nonparametric methods, while also having capacity for not losing much to the parametric methods in cases where the model being smoothed is adequate."

    "abstract": "This study compares the penetration characteristics of impact-induced jets with those of laser-induced jets, focusing on the underlying penetration mechanism rather than device performance for needle-free injection. Using an impact-induced jet system capable of ejecting a highly focused liquid jet at high speed without the use of lasers, we examine jet penetration into skin-simulating materials. Unlike conventional needle-free injectors that produce diffused liquid jets, the impact-induced method generates a highly focused jet that limits the injected area, thereby reducing invasiveness. Comparative experiments with laser-induced jets show that, even at similar jet tip velocities, impact-induced jets achieve greater penetration depth. The penetration depth remains constant regardless of the offset distance D from the target, owing to the high and nearly uniform velocity of the cylindrical jet root region, indicating that penetration is governed by the cylindrical jet structure. Furthermore, we systematically vary the liquid viscosity, jet inertia, and elastic modulus of the skin-simulating material. To account for cylindrical liquid jet penetration, a shear deformation model is proposed, in which the jet kinetic energy is dissipated through deformation of the gelatin. The model shows good agreement with experimental results and provides a unified physical basis for liquid jet penetration."

    "abstract": "One of the key issues facing Direct-to-Cellular (D2C) satellite communication systems is ionospheric scintillation on the uplink and downlink, which can significantly degrade link quality. This work investigates the spatial and temporal characteristics of amplitude scintillation at D2C frequencies by scaling L-band scintillation observations from Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) receivers to bands relevant to D2C operation, including the low-band, and 3GPP's N255 and N256. These observations are then compared to scaled radio-occultation scintillation observations from the FORMOSAT-7/COSMIC-2 (F7/C2) mission, which can be used in regions that do not possess ground-based scintillation monitoring stations. As a proof of concept, five years of ground-based GNSS scintillation data from Sharjah, United Arab Emirates, together with two years of F7/C2 observations over the same region, corresponding to the ascending phase of Solar Cycle 25, are analyzed. Both space-based and ground-based observations indicate a pronounced diurnal scintillation peak between 20--22 local time, particularly during the equinoxes, with occurrence rates increasing with solar activity. Ground-based observations also reveal a strong azimuth dependence, with most scintillation events occurring on southward satellite links. The scintillation occurrence rate at the low-band is more than twice that observed at N255 and N256, highlighting the increased robustness of higher D2C bands to ionospheric scintillation. These results demonstrate how GNSS scintillation observations can be leveraged to characterize and anticipate scintillation-induced D2C link impairments, which help in D2C system design and the implementation of scintillation mitigation strategies."

    "abstract": "Controlling flow-induced segregation in a granular mixture is highly relevant to many industrial settings. To enhance mixing or promote segregation, the continuous gravity flow of a bidisperse granular mixture through a series of narrow vertical channels with exit slots is investigated. The bidisperse mixture is composed of two different sizes of particles, but of the same density. In dense flow, segregation occurs, leading to formation of bands. The bands of large particles appear at a distance away from the walls. This finding is in contrast to that in shear-driven segregation in a dense flow where large particles segregate towards the walls. Using a phenomenological model, it has been shown that rolling and bouncing induced segregation is the dominant mechanism. When cylindrical inserts are placed to modify flow patterns, that significantly influences segregation patterns. The symmetrical placement of a cylindrical insert close to the exit slot vanishes the bands and enhances mixing. However, with two inserts placed symmetrically and close to the exit slot, the degree of segregation in the reverse direction is greatly enhanced compared to that without insert. In the former, small particles accumulate in thin regions adjacent to the walls, and large particles comprise the bulk of the domain and the flowing stream. The heap formation above the insert in a narrow channel, when the insert is close to the exit, enhances mixing in one configuration, whereas it amplifies reverse segregation in the other."

    "abstract": "In multiphase flows, kinetic and interfacial energies coexist, and their mutual conversion can strongly influence the overall energy balance. However, in statistically steady flows these energy reservoirs remain constant, making such conversions undetectable. For them to be observed, a degree of unsteadiness must be introduced, here provided by the deliberate use of a fluctuating time-periodic input of kinetic energy into the system. The main focus of the present work is on the dynamical cycle connecting energy injection, conversion, and dissipation which we explore using numerical simulations of multiphase homogeneous isotropic turbulence, subjected to periodic forcing. The database includes various Reynolds and Weber numbers and volume fractions in the dense regime. To interpret and replicate the observed dynamics, we reformulate the \\textit{Ka-Pi-bara} model of \\cite{Bos2026} (an extension of the $k$--$ε$ model) in terms of total energy (the sum of kinetic and surface energy), which we further enhance by adding equations for the surface energy and its destruction. This model accurately captures a key feature of turbulence: non-equilibrium effects, seen as the phase lag between kinetic energy and its rate of dissipation, which are found to operate also in multiphase flows. Linearizing the model highlights the various relevant time scales of the system and provides predictions of how different observables are coupled and respond to the energy input. In particular, the model predicts that fluctuations of surface energy and its destruction are in phase, in good agreement with numerical simulations. Therefore, unlike kinetic energy, surface energy remains in equilibrium, indicating the absence of a surface energy cascade."

Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) and its variants have achieved impressive rendering fidelity while maintaining high computational and memory efficiency. However, conventional vision-based GS pipelines typically rely on a sufficient number of camera views to initialize the Gaussian primitives and train their parameters, typically incurring additional processing cost during initialization while falling short in conditions where visual cues are unreliable, such as adverse weather, low illumination, or partial occlusions. To cope with these challenges, and motivated by the robustness of radio-frequency (RF) signals to weather, lighting, and occlusions, we introduce a multimodal framework that integrates RF sensing, such as automotive radar, with GS-based rendering as a more efficient and robust alternative to vision-only GS rendering. The proposed approach enables efficient depth prediction from only sparse RF-based depth measurements, yielding a high-quality 3D point cloud for initializing Gaussian functions across diverse GS architectures. Numerical tests demonstrate the merits of judiciously incorporating RF sensing into GS pipelines, achieving high-fidelity 3D scene rendering driven by RF-informed structural accuracy."

However, the limited network resources and unpredictable wireless propagation environments are key design bottlenecks of AR-enabled Metaverse systems. Therefore, this paper presents a resource management framework for simultaneously transmitting and reflecting RIS (STAR-RIS)-assisted AR-enabled Metaverse, where the STAR-RIS is configured to improve the communication efficiency between AR users and the Metaverse server located at the base station (BS). Moreover, we formulate a service latency minimization problem via jointly optimizing the computation resource allocation of the BS, coefficient matrix of the STAR-RIS, central processing unit (CPU) frequency and transmit power of the AR users. To tackle the non-convex problem, we utilize an approximate method to transform it to a tractable form, and decouple the multi-dimensional variables via the alternating optimization method. Particularly, the optimal coefficient matrix is obtained by a penalty function-based method with proved convergence, the CPU frequencies of AR users are derived as the closed-form solution, and the transmit power of AR users and computation resource allocation of the BS are obtained by the Lagrange duality method and convex optimization theory. Finally, simulation results demonstrates that the proposed method achieves remarkable latency reduction than several benchmark methods."

    "abstract": "Nonstationary time series forecasting suffers from the distribution shift issue due to the different distributions that produce the training and test data. Existing methods attempt to alleviate the dependence by, e.g., removing low-order moments from each individual sample. These solutions fail to capture the underlying time-evolving structure across samples and do not model the complex time structure. In this paper, we aim to address the distribution shift in the frequency space by considering all possible time structures. To this end, we propose a Time-Invariant Frequency Operator (TIFO), which learns stationarity-aware weights over the frequency spectrum across the entire dataset. The weight representation highlights stationary frequency components while suppressing non-stationary ones, thereby mitigating the distribution shift issue in time series. To justify our method, we show that the Fourier transform of time series data implicitly induces eigen-decomposition in the frequency space. TIFO is a plug-and-play approach that can be seamlessly integrated into various forecasting models. Experiments demonstrate our method achieves 18 top-1 and 6 top-2 results out of 28 forecasting settings. Notably, it yields 33.3% and 55.3% improvements in average MSE on the ETTm2 dataset. In addition, TIFO reduces computational costs by 60% -70% compared to baseline methods, demonstrating strong scalability across diverse forecasting models."

    "abstract": "Domain-specific accelerators deliver exceptional performance on their target workloads through fabrication-time orchestrated datapaths. However, such specialized architectures often exhibit performance fragility when exposed to new kernels or irregular input patterns. In contrast, programmable architectures like FPGAs, CGRAs, and GPUs rely on compile-time orchestration to support a broader range of applications; but they are typically less efficient under irregular or sparse data. Pushing the boundaries of programmable architectures requires designs that can achieve efficiency and high-performance on par with specialized accelerators while retaining the agility of general-purpose architectures. We introduce Canon, a parallel architecture that bridges the gap between specialized and general purpose architectures. Canon exploits data-level and instruction-level parallelism through its novel design. First, it employs a novel dynamic data-driven orchestration mechanism using programmable Finite State Machines (FSMs). These FSMs are programmed at compile time to encode high-level dataflow per state and translate incoming meta-information (e.g., sparse coordinates) into control instructions at runtime. Second, Canon introduces a time-lapsed SIMD execution in which instructions are issued across a row of processing elements over several cycles, creating a staggered pipelined execution. These innovations amortize control overhead, allowing dynamic instruction changes while constructing a continuously evolving dataflow that maximizes parallelism. Experimental evaluation shows that Canon delivers high performance across diverse data-agnostic and data-driven kernels while achieving efficiency comparable to specialized accelerators, yet retaining the flexibility of a general-purpose architecture."

    "abstract": "Generative AI presents an unprecedented challenge to our understanding of knowledge and its production. Unlike previous technological transformations, where engineering understanding preceded or accompanied deployment, generative AI operates through mechanisms whose epistemic character remains obscure, and without such understanding, its responsible integration into science, education, and institutional life cannot proceed on a principled basis. This paper argues that the missing account must begin with a paradigmatic break that has not yet received adequate philosophical attention. In the Turing-Shannon-von Neumann tradition, information enters the machine as encoded binary vectors, and semantics remains external to the process. Neural network architectures rupture this regime: symbolic input is instantly projected into a high-dimensional space where coordinates correspond to semantic parameters, transforming binary code into a position in a geometric space of meanings. It is this space that constitutes the active epistemic condition shaping generative production. Drawing on four structural properties of high-dimensional geometry concentration of measure, near-orthogonality, exponential directional capacity, and manifold regularity the paper develops an Indexical Epistemology of High-Dimensional Spaces. Building on Peirce semiotics and Papert constructionism, it reconceptualizes generative models as navigators of learned manifolds and proposes navigational knowledge as a third mode of knowledge production, distinct from both symbolic reasoning and statistical recombination."

By reducing algorithmic complexity through the elimination of non-essential preprocessing steps, our method directly leverages the spectral properties of the adjacency matrix. We demonstrate that our algorithm exploits specific characteristics of the second eigenvalue to achieve improved error bounds that approach information-theoretic limits, representing a significant improvement over existing methods. Theoretical analysis establishes that our error rates are tighter than previously reported bounds in the literature. Comprehensive experimental validation confirms our theoretical findings and demonstrates the practical effectiveness of the simplified approach. Our results suggest that algorithmic simplification, rather than increasing complexity, can lead to both computational efficiency and enhanced performance in spectral community detection."

The architecture is model-agnostic, supporting diverse inference patterns through standardized interfaces, enabling rapid adaptation without infrastructure overhead. We demonstrate practical applicability through an industrial implementation for Harmonized System (HS) code prediction, a compliance-critical task where short, unstructured product descriptions are mapped to standardized codes used by customs authorities in global trade. Frequent updates and ambiguous descriptions make classification challenging, with errors causing shipment delays and financial losses. Our solution uses a custom text embedding encoder and multiple deep learning architectures, with Text-CNN achieving 98 percent accuracy on ground truth data. Beyond accuracy, the pipeline ensures reproducibility, auditability, and SLA adherence under variable loads via auto-scaling. A key feature is automated A/B testing, enabling dynamic model selection and safe promotion in production. Cost-efficiency drives model choice; while transformers may achieve similar accuracy, their long-term operational costs are significantly higher. Deterministic classification with predictable latency and explainability is prioritized, though the architecture remains extensible to transformer variants and LLM-based inference. The paper first introduces the deep learning architectures with simulations and model comparisons, then discusses industrialization through serverless architecture, demonstrating automated retraining, prediction, and validation of HS codes. This work provides a replicable blueprint for operationalizing ML using serverless architecture, enabling enterprises to scale while optimizing performance and economics."

This paper shall provide a set of necessary conditions for deriving expressions for LRM strategies in exponential additive models, as integrability conditions on the Lévy measure, which allow us to confirm whether these conditions are satisfied for given concrete models.

    "abstract": "Diffusion models recently developed for generative AI tasks can produce high-quality samples while still maintaining diversity among samples to promote mode coverage, providing a promising path for learning stochastic closure models. Compared to other types of generative AI models, such as GANs and VAEs, the sampling speed is known as a key disadvantage of diffusion models. By systematically comparing transport-based generative models on a numerical example of 2D Kolmogorov flows, we show that flow matching in a lower-dimensional latent space is suited for fast sampling of stochastic closure models, enabling single-step sampling that is up to two orders of magnitude faster than iterative diffusion-based approaches. To control the latent space distortion and thus ensure the physical fidelity of the sampled closure term, we compare the implicit regularization offered by a joint training scheme against two explicit regularizers: metric-preserving (MP) and geometry-aware (GA) constraints. Besides offering a faster sampling speed, both explicitly and implicitly regularized latent spaces inherit the key topological information from the lower-dimensional manifold of the original complex dynamical system, which enables the learning of stochastic closure models without demanding a huge amount of training data."

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs)-based chatbots are increasingly being adopted in the financial domain, particularly in digital banking, to handle customer inquiries about products such as deposits, savings, and loans. However, these models still exhibit low accuracy in core banking computations-including total payout estimation, comparison of products with varying interest rates, and interest calculation under early repayment conditions. Such tasks require multi-step numerical reasoning and contextual understanding of banking products, yet existing LLMs often make systematic errors-misinterpreting product types, applying conditions incorrectly, or failing basic calculations involving exponents and geometric progressions. However, such errors have rarely been captured by existing benchmarks. Mathematical datasets focus on fundamental math problems, whereas financial benchmarks primarily target financial documents, leaving everyday banking scenarios underexplored. To address this limitation, we propose BankMathBench, a domain-specific dataset that reflects realistic banking tasks. BankMathBench is organized in three levels of difficulty-basic, intermediate, and advanced-corresponding to single-product reasoning, multi-product comparison, and multi-condition scenarios, respectively. When trained on BankMathBench, open-source LLMs exhibited notable improvements in both formula generation and numerical reasoning accuracy, demonstrating the dataset's effectiveness in enhancing domain-specific reasoning. With tool-augmented fine-tuning, the models achieved average accuracy increases of 57.6%p (basic), 75.1%p (intermediate), and 62.9%p (advanced), representing significant gains over zero-shot baselines. These findings highlight BankMathBench as a reliable benchmark for evaluating and advancing LLMs' numerical reasoning in real-world banking scenarios."

A major difficulty in this setting stems from the coexistence of operators with different nonlocal structures and incompatible scaling properties, which obstruct the direct use of classical sliding methods. To address this issue, we develop a refined sliding method suited to mixed local-nonlocal operators. As key technical ingredients, we establish new generalized weighted average inequalities, narrow region principles, and maximum principles in bounded and unbounded domains. These tools enable us to derive monotonicity and one-dimensional symmetry results for mixed elliptic equations in bounded domains, half-spaces, and the whole space, and to extend the analysis to parabolic equations with mixed time derivatives. As an application, we resolve the Gibbons' conjecture for a class of mixed fractional equations."

This paper proposes STDSH-MARL (Spatio-Temporal Dual-Stage Hypergraph based Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning), a scalable multi-agent deep reinforcement learning framework that follows a centralized training and decentralized execution paradigm. The proposed method captures spatio-temporal dependencies through a novel dual-stage hypergraph attention mechanism that models interactions across both spatial and temporal hyperedges. In addition, a hybrid discrete action space is introduced to jointly determine the next signal phase configuration and its corresponding green duration, enabling more adaptive signal timing decisions. Experiments conducted on a corridor network under five traffic scenarios demonstrate that STDSH-MARL consistently improves multimodal performance and provides clear benefits for public transportation priority. Compared with state-of-the-art baseline methods, the proposed approach achieves superior overall performance. Further ablation studies confirm the contribution of each component of STDSH-MARL, with temporal hyperedges identified as the most influential factor driving the observed performance gains."

This study investigates how different approaches for cross-lingual text classification can support reliable analysis of global conversations. Using hydrogen energy as a case study, we analyse a decade-long dataset of over nine million tweets in English, Japanese, Hindi, and Korean (2013--2022) for topic discovery. The online keyword-driven data collection results in a significant amount of irrelevant content. We explore four approaches to filter relevant content: (1) translating English annotated data into target languages for building language-specific models for each target language, (2) translating unlabelled data appearing from all languages into English for creating a single model based on English annotations, (3) applying English fine-tuned multilingual transformers directly to each target language data, and (4) a hybrid strategy that combines translated annotations with multilingual training. Each approach is evaluated for its ability to filter hydrogen-related tweets from noisy keyword-based collections. Subsequently, topic modeling is performed to extract dominant themes within the relevant subsets. The results highlight key trade-offs between translation and multilingual approaches, offering actionable insights into optimising cross-lingual pipelines for large-scale social media analysis."

    "abstract": "Feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN) is widely acknowledged to regulate the growth of massive galaxies, though its driving mechanisms are debated. Prevailing theories suggest that AGN-driven outflows are driven either by radiation pressure acting directly on the dusty interstellar medium (ISM) or by hot winds entraining cooler ISM gas, but the relative contribution of each mechanism remains uncertain. By combining optical emission line measurements with highly ionized UV emission lines, it is possible to constrain whether the pressure source applied to ionized clouds is primarily radiation or primarily hydrodynamic, and thus constrain the dominant driver. This study presents the first multi-object analysis of far-ultraviolet (FUV) spectra from galactic-scale AGN-driven outflows in obscured quasars, based on Cosmic Origins Spectrograph observations of five low-redshift targets. By comparing narrow-line region UV emission line ratios to theoretical models that vary the importance of the two pressure sources, we find three out of five targets fall within the radiation pressure-dominated regime. A fourth target exhibits intermediate emission-line ratios that suggest radiation pressure and pressure from a hot wind are both dynamically important. Finally, the lowest-luminosity object in our sample may have a dynamically important hot wind component, but non-detections prevent a clear conclusion in this case. These results suggest radiation pressure dominates circum-nuclear narrow-line region cloud dynamics, but pressure from a hot wind also plays a role in some cases. This is consistent with AGN feedback scenarios mediated by radiation pressure or a short-lived hot wind phase that dissipates after initially accelerating outflows."

To overcome the first challenge, we introduce a Hierarchical Contrastive Retrieval module that aligns dense image patches with 3D part latents at both part and object granularity, retrieving from a curated bank of 1,236 part-annotated assets to inject diverse, physically plausible exemplars into denoising. To overcome the second challenge, we add a masked, part-level editor that operates in a shared canonical space, enabling swaps, attribute refinements, and compositional updates without regenerating the whole object while preserving non-target parts and multi-view consistency. PartRAG achieves competitive results on Objaverse, ShapeNet, and ABO-reducing Chamfer Distance from 0.1726 to 0.1528 and raising F-Score from 0.7472 to 0.844 on Objaverse-with inference of 38s and interactive edits in 5-8s.

    "abstract": "Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is effective for training language models on complex reasoning. However, since the objective is defined relative to a group of sampled trajectories, extended deliberation can create more chances to realize relative gains, leading to inefficient reasoning and overthinking, and complicating the trade-off between correctness and rollout efficiency. Controlling this behavior is difficult in practice, considering (i) Length penalties are hard to calibrate because longer rollouts may reflect harder problems that require longer reasoning, penalizing tokens risks truncating useful reasoning along with redundant continuation; and (ii) supervision that directly indicates when to continue or stop is typically unavailable beyond final answer correctness. We propose Weakly Supervised GRPO (WS-GRPO), which improves rollout efficiency by converting terminal rewards into correctness-aware guidance over partial trajectories. Unlike global length penalties that are hard to calibrate, WS-GRPO trains a preference model from outcome-only correctness to produce prefix-level signals that indicate when additional continuation is beneficial. Thus, WS-GRPO supplies outcome-derived continue/stop guidance, reducing redundant deliberation while maintaining accuracy. We provide theoretical results and empirically show on reasoning benchmarks that WS-GRPO substantially reduces rollout length while remaining competitive with GRPO baselines."

While existing subjective datasets and Video Quality Metrics (VQMs) cover a broad quality range, many practical use cases especially for premium users focus on high quality scenarios requiring finer granularity. Just Noticeable Difference (JND) has emerged as a key concept for modeling perceptual thresholds in these high end regions and plays an important role in perceptual bitrate ladder construction. However, the relationship between JND and the more widely used Mean Opinion Score (MOS) remains unclear. In this paper, we conduct a Degradation Category Rating (DCR) subjective study based on an existing JND dataset to examine how MOS corresponds to the 75% Satisfied User Ratio (SUR) points of the 1st and 2nd JNDs. We find that while MOS values at JND points generally align with theoretical expectations (e.g., 4.75 for the 75% SUR of the 1st JND), the reverse mapping from MOS to JND is ambiguous due to overlapping confidence intervals across PVS indices. Statistical significance analysis further shows that DCR studies with limited participants may not detect meaningful differences between reference and JND videos."

Here, we draw on a data-driven operationalization of archetypes -- archetypometrics -- to explore the characterization of canonically male and female characters. We find that canonically female characters tend towards more heroic and more adventurous archetypes than canonically male characters from an overall space of six core archetypes. At the trait level, the most heroic female characters are more masculine than other female characters. We also find that female characters tend towards the Diva and Sophisticate archetypes, whereas male characters tend toward the Brute and Outcast archetypes.

Using this framework, we perform numerical evaluations of $α$ for representative materials over standard waveguide sizes from WR15 to WR1. In the high-frequency regime $f \\gtrsim 0.5 Δ/h$, low attenuation favors the clean regime $\\ell\\gtrsimξ_0$, indicating that high-purity materials can achieve very low attenuation below their gap frequency. For the TLS contribution, using parameter values representative of native Nb oxides, we find that $α_{\\rm TLS}$ can become relevant at sufficiently low temperatures $T/T_c\\lesssim 0.1$-0.2, where quasiparticle dissipation is exponentially suppressed. Finally, we extend the discussion to the strong-excitation regime using a recently developed nonlinear-response theory within the Keldysh--Usadel framework of nonequilibrium superconductivity and show that nonlinear dissipation produces a Higgs-mode peak in $α$ near $f\\simeq Δ/h$ via a Kerr-type nonlinearity of the dissipative conductivity.

They represent an interesting quadrant of subarcsecond-separation lenses in the population of single-galaxy strong lensing which have been largely unexplored yet and will be great targets of interest in upcoming high-resolution lensing surveys."

    "abstract": "We present a low-cost retrieval system for the WSDM Cup 2026 multilingual retrieval task, where English queries are used to retrieve relevant documents from a collection of approximately ten million news articles in Chinese, Persian, and Russian, and to output the top-1000 ranked results for each query. We follow a four-stage pipeline that combines LLM-based GRF-style query expansion with BM25 candidate retrieval, dense ranking using long-text representations from jina-embeddings-v4, and pointwise re-ranking of the top-20 candidates using Qwen3-Reranker-4B while preserving the dense order for the remaining results. On the official evaluation, the system achieves nDCG@20 of 0.403 and Judged@20 of 0.95. We further conduct extensive ablation experiments to quantify the contribution of each stage and to analyze the effectiveness of query expansion, dense ranking, and top-$k$ reranking under limited compute budgets."

    "abstract": "The TV-Stokes model is a two-step variational method for image denoising that combines the estimation of a divergence-free tangent field with total variation regularization in the first step and then uses that to reconstruct the image in the second step. Although effective in practice, its mathematical structure and potential for parallelization have remained unexplored. In this work, we establish a rigorous functional-analytic foundation for the TV-Stokes model. We formulate both steps in appropriate infinite-dimensional function spaces, derive their dual formulations, and analyze the compatibility and mathematical consistency of the coupled system. In particular, we identify analytical inconsistencies in the original formulation and demonstrate how an alternative model resolves them. We also examine the orthogonal projection onto the divergence-free subspace, proving its existence in a continuous setting and establishing consistency with its discrete counterpart. Building on this theoretical framework, we develop the first domain decomposition method for TV-Stokes by applying overlapping Schwarz-type iterations to the duals of both steps. Although the divergence-free constraint gives rise to a global projection operator in the continuous model, we show that it becomes locally computable in the discrete setting. This insight enables a fully parallelizable algorithm suitable for large-scale image processing in memory-constrained environments. Numerical experiments demonstrate the correctness of the domain decomposition approach and its usability in parallel image reconstruction."

    "abstract": "Coin selection refers to the problem of choosing a set of tokens to fund a transaction in token-based payment systems such as, e.g., cryptocurrencies or central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). In this paper, we propose the Boltzmann Draw that is a probabilistic algorithm inspired by the principles of statistical physics. The algorithm relies on drawing tokens according to the Boltzmann distribution, serving as an extension and improvement of the Random Draw method. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in bounding the number of selected input tokens as well as reducing dust generation and limiting the token pool size in the wallet. Moreover, the probabilistic algorithm can be implemented efficiently, improves performance and respects privacy requirements - properties of significant relevance for current token-based technologies. We compare the Boltzmann draw to both the standard Random Draw and the Greedy algorithm. We argue that the former is superior to the latter in the sense of the above objectives. Our findings are relevant for token-based technologies, and are also of interest for CBDCs, which as a legal tender possibly needs to handle large transaction volumes at a high frequency."

For exterior domains, we establish a similar isoperimetric inequality for magnetic fields of moderate strength under fixed perimeter constraint and additional geometric and symmetry assumptions. The proofs rely on the method of torsion-type trial functions in the bounded domain case and on the method of trial functions dependent only on the distance to the boundary in the exterior domain case."

    "abstract": "Herd immunity is shaped not only by the infection capacity of a spreading epidemic or the contact structure of the hosting population, but also by how and under what circumstances individuals acquire immunity. Immunization strategies may interact with ongoing non-pharmaceutical interventions, which commonly aim to reduce social contact numbers. We demonstrate that these interactions can induce unexpectedly strong and counterintuitive effects on herd immunity. We explore these phenomena on spatially embedded contact networks and uncover a reversal in the relative effectiveness of disease- versus vaccine-induced immunization schemes, highlighting the average number of contacts as a critical determinant of emerging herd immunity. In sparse geometric networks with limited degree heterogeneity, uniform vaccination proves most effective; however, as average contact numbers increase, naturally acquired immunity ultimately becomes the better strategy. We show that this phenomenon may emerge not only in synthetic networks but also in real-world mixing networks, observed during non-pharmaceutical intervention periods across multiple states of the United States."

    "abstract": "Understanding the interplay between magnetic ordering and light emission is crucial for developing magneto-optical technologies. However, this phenomenon is poorly understood since observations of this coupling vary significantly across materials. In this context, hybrid organic-inorganic metal halide perovskites (HOIPs) that incorporate Mn2+ ions are a chemically and structurally tunable platform for exploring this phenomenon, since they exhibit magnetic ordering and photoluminescence (PL) emission. Here, we study two antiferromagnetic Mn-based HOIPs with different organic cations that result in distinct lattice stiffness, Mn2+-Mn2+ distance and octahedral distortion. Temperature-dependent PL excitation spectroscopy reveals changes in crystal field splitting energy and Racah parameters well above the Néel temperature (TN), indicating the emergence of Mn2+-Mn2+ magnetic interactions prior to reach long-range magnetic ordering. These variations align with the observed changes in temperature-PL evolution. The compound with a more rigid lattice shows stronger changes closer to TN, suggesting combined effects of magnetic polarons and spin-canting. In contrast, magnetic polaron-induced magnetic modifications prevail in the HOIP with a softer lattice. These results reveal the complexity of the magneto-optical coupling in Mn-based HOIPs and provide new insights into this field extensible to other 2D materials that exhibit this phenomenon with potential for advanced magneto-optical applications."

    "abstract": "Topic modeling has evolved as an important means to identify evident or hidden topics within large collections of text documents. Topic modeling approaches are often used for analyzing and making sense of social media discussions consisting of millions of short text messages. However, assigning meaningful topic labels to document clusters remains challenging, as users are commonly presented with unstructured keyword lists that may not accurately capture the respective core topic. In this paper, we introduce Narrative Topic Labels derived with Retrieval Augmented Generation (NTLRAG), a scalable and extensible framework that generates semantically precise and human-interpretable narrative topic labels. Our narrative topic labels provide a context-rich, intuitive concept to describe topic model output. In particular, NTLRAG uses retrieval augmented generation (RAG) techniques and considers multiple retrieval strategies as well as chain-of-thought elements to provide high-quality output. NTLRAG can be combined with any standard topic model to generate, validate, and refine narratives which then serve as narrative topic labels. We evaluated NTLRAG with a user study and three real-world datasets consisting of more than 6.7 million social media messages that have been sent by more than 2.7 million users. The user study involved 16 human evaluators who found that our narrative topic labels offer superior interpretability and usability as compared to traditional keyword lists. An implementation of NTLRAG is publicly available for download."

    "abstract": "Diffuse scattering of light from disordered assemblies is traditionally viewed as an uncontrollable broadband scattering background resulting in whitish hues. Here, we demonstrate that correlated disorder enables precise engineering of light scattering from 2D arrays of emitters resulting in strong observable colors. Our analytical framework shows that introducing controlled noise, with tunable probability density functions and correlations, generates three distinct scattering components: diffraction orders, diffuse background, and correlation halos. Correlation halos, often mistaken for broadened diffraction peaks, are independent features whose positions depend on correlation range and can appear between Bragg peaks. Crucially, they persist far beyond the regime where diffraction orders vanish. The noise probability density function provides an additional control: specific diffraction orders can be selectively suppressed while preserving others. This approach reproduces the scattering signatures of natural photonic structures, e.g. found in Morpho butterflies, and reveals multiple pathways from order to disorder, each with distinct optical properties. Our work provides a practical method for inverse design -finding the disorder that produces desired scattering patterns. This establishes diffuse scattering as a designable quantity, expanding the toolkit for metasurfaces and structural color beyond periodic and hyperuniform structures."

    "abstract": "Here's the corrected paragraph with all punctuation and formatting issues fixed: Financial risk systems usually follow a two-step routine: a model predicts return or risk, and then an optimizer makes a decision such as a portfolio rebalance. In practice, this split can break under real constraints. The prediction model may look good, but the final decision can be unstable when the market shifts, when discrete constraints are added (lot sizes, caps), or when the optimization becomes slow for larger asset sets. Also, regulated settings need a clear audit trail that links each decision to the exact model state and inputs. We present HQFS, a practical hybrid pipeline that connects forecasting, discrete risk optimization, and auditability in one flow. First, HQFS learns next-step return and a volatility proxy using a variational quantum circuit (VQC) with a small classical head. Second, HQFS converts the risk-return objective and constraints into a QUBO and solves it with quantum annealing when available, while keeping a compatible classical QUBO solver as a fallback for deployment. Third, HQFS signs each rebalance output using a post-quantum signature so the allocation can be verified later without trusting the runtime environment. On our market dataset study, HQFS reduces return prediction error by 7.8% and volatility prediction error by 6.1% versus a tuned classical baseline. For the decision layer, HQFS improves out-of-sample Sharpe by 9.4% and lowers maximum drawdown by 11.7%. The QUBO solve stage also cuts average solve time by 28% compared to a mixed-integer baseline under the same constraints, while producing fully traceable, signed allocation records."

In a principal-worker environment, the direct mechanism admits two dominant-strategy equilibria: the designer's target and a worker-optimal outcome. We show this limitation persists for all robust mechanisms, then ask whether framing misreports as explicit lies helps. We develop a 2X2 experiment that varies direct vs. extended mechanisms with implicit vs. explicit messages. We find that framing misreporting of type as an explicit lie shifts play away from the worker-optimal outcome toward truthful reporting, raising designer payoffs with minimal efficiency loss. These findings indicate that lying aversion is an effective lever for aligning behavior with social objectives."

    "abstract": "Scalable Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is fundamentally challenged by the curse of dimensionality. A common solution is to exploit locality, which hinges on an Exponential Decay Property (EDP) of the value function. However, existing conditions that guarantee the EDP are often conservative, as they are based on worst-case, environment-only bounds (e.g., supremums over actions) and fail to capture the regularizing effect of the policy itself. In this work, we establish that locality can also be a \\emph{policy-dependent} phenomenon. Our central contribution is a novel decomposition of the policy-induced interdependence matrix, $H^π$, which decouples the environment's sensitivity to state ($E^{\\mathrm{s}}$) and action ($E^{\\mathrm{a}}$) from the policy's sensitivity to state ($Π(π)$). This decomposition reveals that locality can be induced by a smooth policy (small $Π(π)$) even when the environment is strongly action-coupled, exposing a fundamental locality-optimality tradeoff. We use this framework to derive a general spectral condition $ρ(E^{\\mathrm{s}}+E^{\\mathrm{a}}Π(π)) < 1$ for exponential decay, which is strictly tighter than prior norm-based conditions. Finally, we leverage this theory to analyze a provably-sound localized block-coordinate policy improvement framework with guarantees tied directly to this spectral radius."

    "abstract": "Body-centered Cubic (BCC) lattice structures demonstrate promising performance for applications that require simultaneous mechanical energy absorption and thermal management. However, current optimization approaches are typically confined to single-domain objectives, such as mechanical parameters like impact energy and peak stress, neglecting the role of multiple physics in real-world performance. To address this, we propose a multi-objective optimization framework for density-graded BCC lattices that effectively dissipates heat while maximizing absorbed impact energy. A parametric three-zone lattice configuration is investigated to explore various trade-offs between mechanical and thermal properties. Each design is evaluated through independent impact and forced-convection simulations using commercial solvers. Specific Energy Absorption (SEA) and peak stresses at the distal end quantify impact absorption performance, while the Nusselt number and pressure drop characterize thermal dissipation performance. Surrogate models constructed from this data enable multi-objective optimization via Goal Programming to identify an optimal design. Two Pareto-optimal lattice designs are identified with reduced pressure drop and peak stress, underlining the superiority of strategic density gradation. Analysis of the optimal designs reveals how material distribution and geometric design variables influence mechanical-thermal trade-offs, establishing quantitative design guidelines for lattice structures in this multi-physics application."

We define and study a \"Tate-Shafarevich cohomology set\" that governs the obstruction to the local-global principle for $m$-atic twists. We prove that, under some mild assumptions, this set is finite, and give criteria for it to be trivial, i.e. for the local-global principle to be satisfied."

    "abstract": "We investigate the nature of quantum phase transitions in a (1+1)-dimensional field theory composed of $N$ copies of the Ising conformal field theory interacting via competing relevant perturbations. The field theory governs the competition between a mass term and an interaction involving the product of $N$ order-parameter fields, which is realized, e.g. in coupled Ising chains, two-leg spin ladders, and SO($N$)-symmetric spin chains. By combining a perturbative renormalization group analysis and large-scale matrix-product state simulations, we systematically determine the nature of the phase transition as a function of $N$. For $N=2$ and $N=3$, we confirm that the transition is continuous, belonging to the Ising and four-state Potts universality classes, respectively. In contrast, for $N \\ge 4$, our results provide compelling evidence that the transition becomes first order. We further apply these findings to specific lattice models with SO($N$) symmetry, including spin-$1/2$ and spin-$1$ two-leg ladders, that realize a direct transition between an SO($N$) symmetry-protected topological phase and a trivial phase. Our results refine a recent conjecture regarding the criticality of transitions between SPT phases."

    "abstract": "Energy-efficient operation of 5G radio access networks is increasingly constrained by the tension between aggressive base-station (BS) hibernation and stringent quality-of-service (QoS) requirements under highly time-varying traffic. Existing optimisation- and learning-based schemes often assume access to fine-grained traffic traces and lack a structured mechanism for translating coarse operational measurements into deployable hibernation policies with explicit trade-off calibration. To address these limitations, this paper proposes <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">HDTwin-E5G</i>, a hybrid digital-twin (DT) framework that integrates traffic data regeneration, prediction, optimisation-driven feasibility filtering, and reinforcement-learning (RL) refinement for energy-aware BS control. The framework first reconstructs minute-level traffic profiles from hourly measurements using a Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) regeneration module with smoothing, thereby enabling stable short-horizon forecasting. It then employs an MDP-based decision stage and a stochastic constraint-aware optimizer to ensure SLA compliance, followed by a DT-validated Double DQN agent that refines feasible actions through an energy-saving ratio (ESR)–shaped reward. Importantly, <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">HDTwin-E5G</i> introduces a DT-first reward-weight tuning procedure to select Pareto-efficient trade-offs and derive deployable presets across traffic regimes. Experimental evaluations across representative urban-dense and suburban deployments demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves 28.7% and 33.1% ESR, respectively, while maintaining stable latency (approximately 42 ms and 39 ms), highlighting the effectiveness of combining data regeneration with DT-guided hybrid control for practical, QoS-aware energy savings in 5G networks."

    "abstract": "Remote sensing scenes exhibit severe scale imbalance, dense layouts, and heavy background clutter, often reducing objects of interest to only a few pixels. Existing detectors typically exhibit a high miss rate under these challenging conditions. We present RSTR (Remote Sensing Detection Transformer), a transformer-based framework optimized for tiny-object detection in complex backgrounds. Specifically, we introduce a novel cross-attention multi-scale feature pyramid network (CMFPN) that captures cross-scale interactions and fuses high-level semantics with low-level details to strengthen representations of minute targets. A deformable patch-wise attention (DPA) module links global context and local detail to increase attention to tiny objects across channels and spatial positions, improving detectability. A lightweight FocusBlock accelerates inference while preserving cues for tiny targets and maintaining a small parameter budget, achieving a favorable speed-accuracy trade-off. We further design FMIoU, a loss function that improves learning from low-confidence predictions and reduces false positives and missed detections for tiny objects. Relative to comparable baselines, RSTR reduces the number of parameters by 39.8% and computation by 16.2%, indicating a stronger accuracy-efficiency balance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RSTR achieves AP50 scores of 51.3%, 58.8%, and 78.0% on the VisDrone, AI-TOD, and DIOR datasets, respectively. RSTR also yields substantial gains over the RT-DETR baseline and other detectors on tiny-object benchmarks, providing an effective solution for tiny object detection in remote sensing imagery."

    "abstract": "Online change detection is crucial for mobile robots to efficiently navigate through dynamic environments. Detecting changes in transient settings, such as active construction sites or frequently reconfigured indoor spaces, is particularly challenging due to frequent occlusions and spatiotemporal variations. Existing approaches often struggle to detect changes and fail to update the map across different observations. To address these limitations, we propose a dual-head network designed for online change detection and long-term map maintenance. A key difficulty in this task is the collection and alignment of real-world data, as manually registering structural differences over time is both labor-intensive and often impractical. To overcome this, we develop a data augmentation strategy that synthesizes structural changes by importing elements from different scenes, enabling effective model training without the need for extensive ground-truth annotations. Experiments conducted at real-world construction sites and in indoor office environments demonstrate that our approach generalizes well across diverse scenarios, achieving efficient and accurate map updates.

    "abstract": "In emergency rescue scenarios, air-to-ground (A2G) integrated mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) face challenges such as dynamic topology, limited resources, and unstable communication opportunities. To address these issues, we propose a position-probability-resource cooperative routing (PP-RCR) algorithm. First, Kalman filtering is applied to predict the future positions of nodes and accurately identify effective communication opportunities, which can mitigate link disruptions caused by topology dynamics. Then, a multi-dimensional relay selection criterion is designed by considering the transmission reliability, node resources, and message attributes, enabling adaptive relay selection among heterogeneous nodes. Based on this, a dynamic message replication and deletion strategy is introduced according to the urgency of messages, and the transmission path is optimized. Finally, the simulation results show that, in typical rescue scenarios, the proposed PP-RCR algorithm achieves higher delivery ratio and lower average delivery delay compared with state-of-the-art algorithms."

In addition, the proposed reset architecture allows to use a single power supply, avoiding the double supply generally used to increase the dynamic range, gaining in system compactness. Experimental measurements show an increase of +107% in the dynamic range with respect to standard reset architectures of state-of-the-art CSAs for low-capacitance (≤ 0.1 pF) semiconductor radiation detectors, achieving a total maximum input charge of ≃3×10<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">5</sup> el.

Among these, integer modular multiplication is the most challenging to implement. In this work, we focus on improving the whole process of Barrett Modular Multiplication (BMM), which includes multiplying two numbers and reducing the result. We examine various methods to enhance the key steps of BMM: multiplication, estimating the quotient, reducing the result, and handling overflows.

    "abstract": "The field of 3D printing has experienced remarkable growth in recent years, leading to its widespread adoption across diverse industrial sectors. Among the various additive manufacturing technologies, Digital Light Processing (DLP) stands out for its high resolution, fast printing speed, and material versatility. Despite these advantages, the use of photopolymer resin in DLP often results in unwanted surface residues on printed parts, causing tackiness and a loss of structural integrity. To mitigate these drawbacks, post-processing steps such as washing, drying, and curing are essential. However, these procedures are typically carried out manually, which introduces variability and makes it difficult to maintain consistent product quality. Ensuring uniformity requires the minimization of human intervention through process automation, along with precise control tailored to the specific characteristics of each printed component. This study presents an automated post-processing system capable of dynamically adjusting washing parameters according to the type of printed object. By integrating intelligent control into the washing stage, the proposed system improves the consistency and overall reliability of DLP-based 3D printed products."

In this paper, an opportunistic resource scheduling scheme is analyzed to efficiently utilize LEO satellite resources. An opportunistic resource scheduling algorithm is proposed that optimally allocates and schedules based on the time-varying channel conditions of each user. Moreover, the proposed algorithm is designed to maximize total average capacity while satisfying the minimum capacity requirement for each user, thereby ensuring user-specific quality of service (QoS). An algorithm utilizing a Lagrangian dual approach was developed to find the optimal beam allocation.

    "abstract": "This work proposes a capacitor-less low-dropout regulator (LDO) based on super source follower (SSF) architecture in a 180nm process achieving improved wide band power supply rejection (PSR) performance and fast transient response. With a novel topology that couples the LDO and a symmetric-load voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) with bias, part of the bias circuit proportional to the oscillation intensity flows into the LDO, optimizing the LDO's PSR performance in the mid-to-low frequency. This work is implemented in a 180nm CMOS process. Simulation results demonstrate that incorporating the additional LDO current improves mid-to-low frequency PSR by at least 10dB compared to the condition without the current. Furthermore, the PSR performance remains −28dB at frequencies up to 10GHz, indicating robust PSR performance within wide band. The system takes 37ns to jump from zero load to 20mA full load, with a 210mV overshoot."

As knowledge bases expand to accommodate emerging concepts and domains, existing approaches that apply flat retrieval over the entire corpus encounter substantial limitations in efficiency and relevance. To address these challenges, we propose a retrieval method that structures the knowledge base into semantically coherent subsets and confines retrieval to the most relevant subset for each query. This hierarchical procedure enables scalable retrieval under continual expansion of the knowledge base by reducing search space and mitigating irrelevant matches. Experimental results on knowledge-intensive benchmarks show that the proposed method consistently improves both retrieval accuracy and computational efficiency, providing a practical approach to retrieval-augmented generation in expanding knowledge bases."

    "abstract": "Speech recognition technology is becoming popular in daily life, but it still lacks accuracy in some situations due to noise or environmental noise interference. Thus, lipreading methods based on visual signals can be used in noisy environments or as a communication aid for individuals with hearing impairments, becoming another viable option. However, lipreading models usually involve high computational complexity, making their real-time deployment on resourceconstrained embedded devices challenging. This study proposes a Mandarin lipreading recognition model and deploys it on an edge computing platform equipped with a commercially available AI accelerator evaluating the inference performance and latency in real-world scenarios. The model is trained on the DMCLR Mandarin lipreading dataset and uses a lightweight architecture design, making it suitable for resource-constrained devices. The experimental platform utilizes a Raspberry Pi 5 and is tested with either a Google Coral Edge TPU or a Hailo-8 accelerator. The study compares the differences between the two accelerators in terms of inference speed, accuracy, and temporal task processing capabilities and analyzes their limitations. The results show that both accelerators can support real-time inference, with Hailo-8 exhibiting lower latency and higher accuracy, although model conversion and deployment are more complex. This study demonstrates the feasibility of deploying a lipreading recognition model on edge devices and provides practical insights into the selection of accelerators."

However, current fault-tolerant systems frequently fail to maintain performance consistency under complicated fault conditions and are not resilient against cyber-attacks at the quantum level. In order to tackle this issue, the research presents a Quantum-Cryptography Embedded Fault-Tolerant Algorithm (QCE-FTA) that incorporates quantum error correction and quantum key distribution (QKD) into the work scheduling and checkpointing layers of cloud supercomputing systems. Without sacrificing processing speed, QCE-FTA guarantees encrypted data transfer, dynamic fault recovery, and secure key exchange. When compared to conventional techniques, experimental simulations conducted on hybrid cloud settings show notable gains in task recovery efficiency, encryption strength, and system stability.

    "abstract": "Recent progress in text-to-motion has advanced both 3D human motion generation and text-based motion control. Controllable motion generation (CoMo), which enables intuitive control, typically relies on pose code representations; however, discrete pose codes alone cannot capture fine-grained motion details, limiting expressiveness. To address this limitation, we propose a method that augments pose code–based latent representations with continuous motion features using residual vector quantization (RVQ). This approach preserves the interpretability and manipulability of pose codes while effectively capturing subtle motion characteristics such as high-frequency details. Experiments on the HumanML3D dataset show that our model reduces the Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) from 0.041 to 0.015 and yields a slight improvement in Top-1 R-Precision from 0.508 to 0.510. Qualitative analysis of pairwise direction similarity between pose codes further demonstrates the model’s controllability for motion editing."

    "abstract": "This research paper explores the intersections between AI-based simulation and digital twin technologies to make intelligent business plans in intelligent business predictive maintenance, process optimization, and decision-making. The concept of a digital twin is developed on four machine learning models, namely- Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and gradual Boosting Machine (GBM) trained on a data set consisting of real-time and historical data of IoT connected industrial equipment such as CNC milling machines. The data include sensor measurements, SCADA data, maintenance data, manufacturing statistics, and environmental data, which are exposed to preprocessing techniques such as noise reduction, missing value filling, normalizing and feature engineering. The models are analysed based on their performance in terms of precision, recall, F1-score, accuracy, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and R2. ANN is the best of the other models with most predictive reliability and accuracy and has highest operations cost saving (22.7) and energy savings (25.6). GBM comes second as it is dependent on boosting mechanisms to make better predictions. RF has the most favorable trade-off between level of accuracy and efficiency. SVM has the worst performance since it is very sensitive to hyperparameter tuning and non-linearity. The findings determine the capabilities of AI-based digital twins to minimize downtime, decrease maintenance costs, and improve industrial processes. The analysis reveals that ANN can be the most suitable model of predictive analytics and business intelligence that are provided in real-time and, therefore, AI-based digital twins are the valuable instrument of industrial automation in the future. The next round of research might explore the field of hybrid AI methods to improve predictive capability and efficiency in smart manufacturing and optimization of business processes."

However, most existing studies lack the ability to capture global features, making it difficult for deep learning (DL) models to learn the relationships between local features, which in turn limits the effectiveness of feature representation. To address the above-mentioned issues, this paper proposes a vision transformer (ViT) that incorporates Hyena module for student engagement recognition. The Hyena module not only can capture long-range dependencies (LRD) within images, but also possesses the inductive bias of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). These advantages enable the DL model to converge stably on a limited database and effectively enhance its feature representation capability. According to the experimental results, the method proposed by this paper achieved a recall of 83.05 %, a precision of 84.15 %, and an F1-score 83.58 % on the SVD-OL database."

    "abstract": "The high-speed relative motion between Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites and terrestrial users induces high Doppler shifts, which disrupt subcarrier orthogonality in Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM), introducing severe intercarrier interference (ICI) and degrading system performance. Using delay Doppler (DD) domain signal mapping, Orthogonal Time Frequency Space (OTFS) modulation can preserve waveform orthogonality under high Doppler conditions, effectively mitigating ICI through its inherent resistance to time-frequency channel variations. In OTFS systems operating with high Doppler frequency shifts, the core technical challenge lies in the estimation of the channel, which is critically dependent on the pilot design. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel superimposed pilot-based channel estimation method for OTFS systems, which innovatively superimposes pilot and data symbols in the delay-Doppler domain through power-sharing modulation, where the pilot employs constant-envelope design for PAPR control. The proposed solution incorporates fractional Doppler precompensation using phase correction θ<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">k,l</inf> to mitigate distortion and the guard-interval suppressed boundary leakage to protect superimposed pilots.

Simulation results show that, compared to the traditional constant-amplitude high-power pilot and current single-centerpoint unprotected interval superimposed pilot, this method effectively reduces the peak to average power ratio (PAPR). The normalized mean squared error (NMSE) and bit error rate (BER) of the proposed scheme outperform the benchmark schemes, which are highly applicable to the OTFS system in LEO satellite scenarios."

    "abstract": "The dynamic pace at which products are innovated, especially the consumer electronics, is changing the world industries. As the corporations focus on improving the quality of life by developing new products all the time, matters become more complex in balancing the variety of the product lines with the requirement to act in harmony with the sustainability requirements. Maintaining the balance between innovation, productivity and environmental stewardship is also a major issue and particularly in high turnover industries like the smartphones, where life cycle is also short and competition is very high making issues of ecology and social responsibility more prominent. This paper introduces a hybrid Product Sustainability Index (ProdSI) model that combines the use of Fuzzy-AHP and Entropy weighting with the machine learning (ML) technologies to compare and forecast the sustainability and pricing of flagship smartphones: Apple iPhone 15 Pro and Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra. Forty-three indicators, in relation to environmental, social, and economic spheres, were evaluated. The results of the experiments prove the higher sustainability of iPhone 15 Pro which attended the higher normalized ProdSI score as it is better performing in the aspects of energy efficiency, recyclability, and social compliance. XGBoost, of the models tested, had a prediction accuracy of 95% compared to the traditional regression models and feature importance and scatter plot analysis revealed the heavy dependence of sustainability measures on predicting prices. The results demonstrate that not only data-driven benchmarking is supported by ML-driven sustainability assessment, but also cost optimization, anomaly detection, and enhanced strategies of developing products. This publication shows how responsible innovation, which is based on intelligent analytics, can balance environmental goals with industry competitiveness and support the development of ecosystems of sustainable product development."

Under-standing aviation accident requires a holistic approach that integrates multi-modal data, including textual reports, images, and structured knowledge representations. This paper proposes a novel multi-modal retrieval and analysis framework that integrates Natural Language Processing (NLP), Causal Relation Extraction, CLIP-based image embedding, and Latent Con-textual Modeling (LCM) with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to link textual and visual aviation accident evidence. The system enables users to upload new incident images, such as those from newspapers or social media, and automatically match them with similar historical accidents, revealing causes and contributing factors through generative explanation. This pipeline demonstrates the feasibility of a next-generation decision-support tool for aviation safety that is interpretable, context-aware, and multi-modal. Experimental results demonstrate that our model effectively identifies and aligns latent representations across modalities, while the LLM generates coherent, contextually grounded explanations."

    "abstract": "In the current educational context, the widespread use of artificial intelligence (AI) has transformed how students access, process, and produce information. However, concerns have emerged regarding the extent to which AI facilitates the genuine generation of knowledge versus superficial task completion. This article presents the design and initial validation of a comprehensive model to measure knowledge generation in higher education, emphasizing the role of pedagogical mediation and the responsible integration of AI tools. The model is built on four interrelated dimensions: pedagogical mediation, use of AI, infrastructure and access to resources, and motivation in AI use. Each dimension includes key variables and indicators derived from a literature review and expert validation. Data were collected through surveys administered to 20 professors and 330 students who participated in AI-integrated courses after teacher training workshops. Preliminary descriptive results show that students felt more motivated to learn autonomously and perceived that AI tools helped them better understand content. The model offers a novel, structured approach to assess whether knowledge is truly being generated through AI-enhanced learning, setting the groundwork for further analysis using fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA)."

    "abstract": "Adaptive Bitrate (ABR) streaming is the de facto mechanism for delivering video over heterogeneous and time-varying wireless networks. However, volatile bandwidth, interference, mobility, and resource contention complicate bitrate selection and buffer control, often degrading users’ Quality of Experience (QoE). Traditional rule-based ABR algorithms struggle to generalize across diverse conditions. Recent work demonstrates that Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) can jointly reason over network dynamics and player status to optimize QoE, including quality, rebuffering, smoothness, and latency. This paper surveys DRL-based ABR advances from 2022 to 2025 in wireless contexts and emphasizes the role of open and reproducible research using ns-3 for network simulation and FFmpeg for video processing and objective quality assessment (e.g., PSNR, SSIM, VMAF). We first formalize the DRL problem for ABR (state, action, and reward design), then discuss how ns-3 models cellular and Wi-Fi environments and how FFmpeg enables practical bitrate ladders, decoding, trace generation, and automated quality evaluation. We synthesize findings across recent works on access-point-assisted ABR, meta-RL bitrate guidance, cross-layer optimization for real-time communication, fairness-aware multiuser bandwidth allocation at the mobile edge, and throughput prediction for ABR. We highlight reported gains, modeling choices, and, critically, open-source availability where indicated. We conclude by outlining open challenges—generalization, QoE modeling, and real-world deployment—and advocating for open-source benchmarks, datasets, and truly end-to-end ns-3+FFmpeg pipelines to accelerate impactful and reproducible research in DRL-driven ABR for wireless video streaming."

The system implements automatic model selection and logarithmic transformation to handle variance instability and nonstationary patterns in trade data. Comparative analysis shows that the ARIMA model consistently outperforms ETS in terms of MAPE, particularly for monetary variables, while ETS occasionally provides lower MAE and RMSE values for smoother time-series data. The evaluation revealed that both models faced challenges in accurately forecasting highvariance export quantities. Despite this, ARIMA demonstrates better adaptability to complex economic patterns and serves as a reliable baseline for short- and medium-term forecasting. The application is deployed via an interactive Gradio interface, making advanced forecasting tools accessible to non-technical stakeholders, such as policymakers and trade planners. Future work will explore hybrid and multivariate approaches to enhance the predictive performance by incorporating external economic and environmental factors."

Unlike prior systems that map gestures to fixed commands or single-agent actions, GestOS interprets hand gestures semantically and dynamically distributes tasks across multiple robots based on their capabilities, current state, and supported instruction sets. The system combines lightweight visual perception with Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning: hand poses are converted into the structured textual descriptions, which LLM uses to infer intent and generate robot-specific commands. A robot selection module ensures that each gesture-triggered task is matched to the most suitable agent in real time. This architecture enables context-aware, adaptive control without requiring explicit user specification of targets or commands. By advancing gesture interaction from recognition to intelligent orchestration, GestOS supports scalable, flexible, and user-friendly collaboration with robotic systems in dynamic environments."

The end-to-end equivalent channel under maximum ratio transmission (MRT) beamforming is de-rived and modeled as a Gamma distribution. A closed-form expression for the outage probability (OP) is obtained in terms of Meijer G-functions, and the analytical findings are validated via Monte Carlo simulations. To further characterize system performance, the asymptotic expression of the OP and the associated diversity order are also derived. The effectiveness of the active RIS in mitigating multiplicative fading through signal amplification is evaluated by comparison with a conventional passive RIS scheme, revealing substantial performance improvements. Moreover, the impact of hardware impairments and channel shadowing is examined. On the sensing side, the proposed ISAC system is compared with a traditional radar in terms of beampattern gain."

    "abstract": "As data continues to expand rapidly, the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) has become an essential tool for data compression, representation learning, and the creation of synthetic data. By applying a probabilistic mapping into a latent distribution, it is able to reconstruct inputs and produce new variations. However, VAE implementations on Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) remain limited, especially for the MNIST dataset, indicating the gap to explore optimal and efficient hardware architectures. This research designs and develops an integrated circuit for the encoder block of a VAE on an FPGA with minimized inference latency by utilizing an Inline-Array architecture. A semi-parallel architecture was used as the baseline. Implementation on the Kria KV260 FPGA with a <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$28 \\times 28$</tex> MNIST input started with a grid search for model setup, followed by RTL synthesis and verification using a testbench and PYNQ. Results show that the Inline-Array reduces latency by approximately 0.0025 seconds compared to the CPU and 0.00076 seconds compared to the Semi-Parallel approach, lowers power consumption by 3.95 %, and optimizes resource utilization through an adder tree design. The reconstruction accuracy was generally the same as CPU and Semi-Parallel results, except for digit “2,” which produced a larger error because of fixed-point quantization overflow. These results show that the Inline-Array has good potential as a low-power and low-latency VAE accelerator for edge computing applications."

However, conventional chaotic systems often suffer from limitations in entropy, sensitivity to initial conditions, and the quality of randomness. This study proposes an enhancement method based on Lyapunov Exponent (LE)-guided quantum XYZ rotational encoding applied to Lorenz, Chen, and Rossler systems. The chaotic sequences are further amplified using a single-qubit quantum circuit with Hadamard, RX, RY, and RZ rotations. The evaluation conducted before (classic) and after the transformation (quantum) includes key aspects: LE, Shannon entropy, autocorrelation, bifurcation diagram, trajectories, and NIST SP 800-22 statistical testing. To ensure robust statistical assessment, the chaotic sequences were generated using a Multiple-Run Strategy with varying initial conditions to construct bitstreams suitable for NIST analysis. The results demonstrate significant improvements: LE increased up to tenfold, entropy values approached theoretical limits, autocorrelation decreased notably, and all sequences successfully passed the NIST tests under recommended parameters. These findings affirm the potential of LE-guided quantum rotations as an effective strategy for enhancing chaotic dynamics and improving the statistical security of cryptography keystreams."

The suggested solution gathers the information of various sources in a systematic manner, such as user profiles, access logs, and cloud records. By using modern technologies like AWS CloudTrail and Apache Kafka, the data is preprocessed, cleansed, normalized and features extracted. The feature engineering is critical in shaping the user behavior patterns with the consideration of factors like frequency of logins, access patterns of files and system command. In anomaly detection, the framework uses a variety of strategies, such as unsupervised learning algorithms (k-means, isolation forest), statistical approaches, and neural networks (autoencoders, RNNs). Proactive security is provided by real-time notifications, automated reactions and interactive dashboards, and smoothly integrated into Security information and event management frameworks (SIEM). Extensive tests prove the effectiveness of the framework in identifying illegal access and the provision of security teams with practical information.

It is anticipated that an arrester generally causes ferroresonance mitigation. But for a sustained ferroresonance, sometimes MOV fails to protect the transformer. To investigate this effect, MATLAB SIMULINK has been used for time-domain simulation. A single phase unloaded transformer has been simulated. A two-term polynomial of order seven is used to simulate the transformer's magnetization characteristic. Linear resistance is used to model the core loss. The impact of changing the input voltage has been investigated. MOVs with different characteristics have been taken and the points of breakdown have been found out under sustained ferroresonance. This work can help to choose MOV of proper rating for specific transformer application."

    "abstract": "This paper presents the design and simulation of a compact Ultra High Frequency (UHF) antenna optimized for CubeSat communication systems operating at 398 MHz. CubeSats, due to their small form factor, face significant challenges in antenna design, particularly when balancing performance, size, and deployment mechanisms. The proposed antenna design aims to achieve high directivity and acceptable bandwidth within the limited physical constraints of CubeSats. Simulation results indicate a peak directivity of 1.75 dBi and a radiation pattern that is suitable for low-Earth orbit (LEO) communication scenarios. This work contributes towards developing efficient CubeSat-compatible antennas and provides a basis for future physical prototyping and space qualification."

    "abstract": "The potential of Wireless Rechargeable Sensor Networks (WRSNs) to extend the operating lifetime of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) through energy harvesting and replenishment approaches has attracted a lot of attention. However, in order to maximize energy use, minimize communication overhead, and guarantee network stability, an effective clustering mechanism is essential. In this work, we propose a hybrid clustering method to efficiently arrange sensor nodes in a WRSN by combining the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) with K-Means clustering. K-Means clustering, which swiftly divides sensor nodes into K groups according to their physical closeness and ensures a balanced load distribution among clusters, is the first step in the process. Nevertheless, K-Means’s ability to handle overlapping clusters and distribute nodes probabilistically is limited. In order to improve flexibility in dynamic network environments, we use GMM to optimize the clustering process by taking into account the probabilistic distribution of sensor nodes inside each cluster. More precise and adaptable clustering is produced by iteratively optimizing cluster membership probability using the ExpectationMaximization (EM) algorithm. Key performance indicators like Silhouette Score, energy consumption analysis, and network lifespan estimation are used to evaluate performance and show notable increases in clustering efficiency and energy savings. By offering an effective, flexible, and scalable clustering solution in WRSNs, the suggested hybrid strategy improves resource management and lengthens sensor networks’ lifespan."

This study presents a stereo vision-based skeleton pose estimation framework that incorporates a Proximity Index (PI) to evaluate the distance between human body joints and predefined risk zones. Using the ZED 2i stereo camera, both RGB images and depth maps were acquired to enable reliable three-dimensional pose estimation. The proposed method extracts skeleton data from static images, computes a joint-to-zone distance metric, and classifies safety states based on threshold PI values. Unlike conventional 2D pose estimation approaches, the integration of stereo depth information improves accuracy in proximity evaluation and risk detection. To validate the framework, experiments were conducted in a office environment, simulating scenarios where workers approached restricted or hazardous areas. The results confirm that the method effectively detects abnormal proximity behaviors and supports real-time safety monitoring in workplace settings."

Different strategies to overcome the rain’s impact on Wi-Fi e.g. using the weather proof equipments, placing the routers strategically and using the mesh networks are also covered in this paper.

While machine learning approaches using flow-level metadata have emerged as promising alternatives, their black-box nature prevents analysts from understanding or trusting the results. In this paper, we propose an interpretable framework that not only detects malicious encrypted traffic but also explains why a session is flagged and how operators should respond. Our approach integrates a Random Forest classifier with SHAP (SHapley Additive Explanations) to provide both global insights into model behavior and local, per-session explanations. A domain-aware explanation engine further translates SHAP outputs into semantic interpretations and automated security recommendations, enabling even non-expert operators to understand causes and mitigation strategies. These results are delivered through an interactive dashboard that supports analyst-driven investigation and response. Experiments on a public encrypted traffic dataset demonstrate that our system maintains high detection accuracy (>99%) while bridging the gap between model prediction and human-centered decision-making."

Using the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm, the RL agent learns continuous drug dosing policies that are validated through simulation of nonlinear tumor growth and immune response under clinical constraints. Results indicate average tumor volume reduction from 0.799 to 0.173, immune cell density improvement from 0.602 to 0.936, and stable, bounded drug dosing consistent with safety limits. Reward progression demonstrates effective balancing of tumor suppression, immune maintenance, and drug toxicity.

The proposed approach targets single-channel EEG analysis, i.e., T7 channel from the SEED dataset, for classifying emotions into positive, neutral, and negative states. QLBP acquires subtle variations from EEG signals effectively with strong feature representation. Furthermore, the SVM classifier with various kernels, including polynomial, linear, Radial Basis Function, Gaussian, and with different neighbor values, was tested. The linear kernel yielded the maximum average accuracy of 94.5% with two neighbors. The findings highlight the advantages of combining QLBP with SVM to determine its feasibility for implementing an efficient real-world mental state estimation system."

The goal of this project is to provide a new way to diagnose skin illnesses that uses Blind Chromophore Separation (BCS), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and the GrabCut algorithm. This procedure would be quick, correct, and not hurt at all. The BCS method uses pictures of the skin to get important chromophore information, like the amount of melanin and hemoglobin, which shows how healthy the skin is overall. More particular, convolutional neural networks are used to assess these chromophore-based photos. They achieve this by spotting minute patterns and appropriately categorizing a variety of skin diseases. The GrabCut algorithm also makes lesion segmentation better by making sure that damaged areas are appropriately taken out for future study. The suggested framework offers many benefits, such as improving the accuracy of diagnoses, minimizing the need for expert help, and giving a solution that can be used in real clinical settings. More work will be done in the future to make it easier to find and classify skin disorders earlier. To do this, the dataset will need to be bigger and the AI model will need to be smarter."

    "abstract": "The growing availability of lifelog data from wearable devices and mobile sensors provides valuable opportunities to predict lifestyle indicators related to health, such as sleep quality, stress, and physical activity. Traditional models like LightGBM perform well on tabular data but rely on handcrafted features and may miss complex temporal dependencies. Deep learning models such as TabNet use attention mechanisms for dynamic feature selection and end-to-end learning but require more computational resources. We propose TabBoost, an ensemble framework combining LightGBM’s efficiency and interpretability with TabNet’s adaptive feature learning. Experiments on real-world lifelog datasets demonstrate that TabBoost consistently outperforms individual baselines, achieving up to 33.40% improvement in key metrics. Our results suggest that integrating complementary strengths of different models can lead to more robust and generalizable performance in lifestyle prediction. Beyond performance gains, TabBoost also provides practical insights for designing efficient and interpretable systems that can be deployed in real-world health monitoring applications."

To support this, an integrated cafe management system is needed to help manage operational activities effectively, from raw material management to sales reporting. One of the main challenges is the accurate estimation of raw material requirements to avoid overstocking or understocking. This study aims to develop a web-based café management system equipped with a raw material requirement forecasting feature using the Weighted Moving Average (WMA). This method assigns greater weight to the most recent data to make the forecasting results more adaptive to usage trends. The system was developed using the Laravel framework and includes front-end and back-end features, raw material data management, usage, forecasting, sales, and reporting. The forecasting results show that the system can generate predictions that closely approximate the data patterns used. This system can illustrate the implementation of forecasting methods in raw material management and support an efficient decision-making process in procurement and café operational management."

In this work, we present a reflective semi-conductor optical amplifier (RSOA) butt-coupled to an extended distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) in lithium niobate on insulator (LNOI). Lithium niobate (LN) is an asset material because of its electro optic (EO) effect. This laser exhibits a threshold current of 90 mA and a side-mode suppression ratio (SMSR) of at least 35 dB. Leveraging the EO effect in LN, we demonstrate Bragg grating tuning at 3.14 GHz/V. Additionally, we present the RF design of a transmission line on LNOI, outlining the pathway toward a fast tunable Indium Phosphide (InP)-LNOI DBR laser operating at 1550 nm."

While convolutional neural network (CNN)-based encoders combined with temporal models such as LSTMs have been widely adopted, they are limited in capturing long-range spatial dependencies and global context within visual sequences. This paper introduces a lightweight vision transformer-based sequence-to-action (ViT-S2A) network that integrates a compact ViT encoder with an long short-term memory (LSTM)-based temporal aggregation module to directly predict discrete driving actions. To validate the feasibility of the proposed framework, we construct a synthetic sequence-to-action benchmark, where object trajectories correspond to left, straight, or right movements. Comparative experiments demonstrate that ViT-S2A consistently outperforms a CNN-LSTM baseline in both convergence speed and prediction accuracy, that highlights the effectiveness of global attention in modeling spatiotemporal dependencies. These results indicate that transformer-based architectures offer a promising direction for scalable, data-efficient autonomous driving control models."

However, centralized dispatching exposes privacy and reliability risks, including single points of failure and leakage of routing and transaction data. Blockchainbased Payment Channel Networks (PCNs) address these limitations by moving frequent interactions off-chain while maintaining verifiable settlement on-chain. This paper presents a blockchain-anchored privacy-preserving path optimization protocol that supports variable-amount multihop payments over PCNs. By combining Pedersen commitments and lightweight zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), the protocol verifies transaction correctness without revealing amounts, and employs blind-channel operations to prevent intermediaries from accessing sensitive data. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme achieves strong privacy protection and scalability with low computational cost, making it suitable for blockchain-based IoT delivery environments."

In order to improve predictive modelling for financial inclusion, this work explores the use of cutting-edge machine learning techniques, including boosting-tree transfer learning. The study uses mobile money transaction records and publicly accessible financial survey data, combining behavioural, demographic, and socioeconomic characteristics. Transfer learning is used to adjust models across regions with restricted data availability, whereas gradient boosting decision trees (GBDT) are utilised as the base learners because of their excellent capacity to model nonlinear relationships. The model was tested using stratified kfold cross-validation, and its performance was measured with metrics like area under the ROC curve (AUC), accuracy, precision, recall, and F 1 -score. The outcomes show that boosting-tree transfer learning achieves 90% accuracy and an AUC of 0.92 on test sets, outperforming baseline models like logistic regression and random forests. Crucially, there are few differences across age and gender groups in fairness-aware judgement, which lowers the possibility of algorithmic exclusion. According to the results, boosting-tree transfer learning offers a scalable strategy to promote inclusive financial systems around the world by enhancing predictive accuracy and facilitating equitable decision-making."

Early detection of dysgraphia is vital for intervention, yet traditional diagnostic methods are often subjective and time-consuming.

The methodology involves the extraction of different features like baseline angle, pen pressure, slant angle, letter size, line spacing, and word spacing along with 8 different features using a pre-trained VGG16 model by applying transfer learning. Finally, a hybrid model is developed by combining handcrafted and VGG16 features. The final feature set is used to train different machine learning methods such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, and Random Forest for classification. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid approach in terms of Precision, Recall, F-measure, and Accuracy. The Random Forest outperformed other models, producing an accuracy of 88.9 %. Experimental results show the improvement in the performance of dysgraphia detection using the hybrid method."

    "abstract": "Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs) such as performance, security, reliability, and usability significantly influence the overall quality of software systems. However, traditional NFR engineering approaches commonly treat these requirements as binary constraints, i.e., either fully satisfied or not, which limits systematic trade-off reasoning even in conventional single-system software architectures. This limitation becomes critical in complex, dynamic domains such as IoT and cyber-physical systems, where multiple interdependent NFRs must coexist without degrading system performance. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a domain-specific framework for modeling and optimizing priority-based NFRs beyond binary constraints. The framework integrates standard well-recognized quality models like ISO/IEC 25010 and FURPS+, to identify domain-specific NFRs, which are then modeled as soft goals with graded degrees of satisfaction. Priority weights, utility-based reasoning, and multi-objective optimization are integrated to manage conflicts and trade-offs among competing NFRs while preserving system stability. Unlike traditional approaches that enforce a rigidly defined subset of NFRs, the proposed framework enables the combination of multiple NFRs proportionally according to their priority and contextual relevance. The framework is applicable to diverse software-intensive systems including IoT, cloud platforms, healthcare systems, and cyber-physical environments. This work contributes a systematic, scalable, and adaptive approach to proactive NFR management suitable for modern software systems. The concrete research problem addressed is the failure of binary NFR handling in dynamic adaptation settings, leading to over-constrained designs or degraded quality. The framework guarantees improved global utility (15-25% in simulations) and adaptation success (>90%) while maintaining performance thresholds, with low runtime overhead (~O(n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>) for n NFRs)."

    "abstract": "The Colour-Rendered Bosphorus Projections (CRBP) Face dataset overcomes key limitations in 3-D facial analysis by offering a photometrically normalized, multiview dataset specifically tailored for 2.5-D modeling. CRBP utilizes the Bosphorus 3D Face Database, reconstructing textured 3-D meshes for each individual and producing six canonical 2-D projections. To improve model compatibility and minimize background noise, each projection is processed using YOLOv8 for face detection. This results in two organized subsets, namely, CRBP-Raw (full scene) and CRBP-YOLOv8 (face-cropped). This dual-format design facilitates thorough benchmarking of pose-invariant, occlusion-resilient, and expression-aware models within a convolutional neural network-compatible image space. Dataset statistics indicate that YOLOv8 enhances facial alignment, however, it also introduces sample selection bias, especially in extreme yaw and occlusion scenarios. CRBP facilitates applications in emotion recognition, biometric authentication, and avatar creation. The dataset is available at: https://dx.doi.org/10.21227/4qns-ys45."

    "abstract": "The magnetic thermal problem is a crucial factor for the reliability of high-power wireless power transfer (WPT) systems. However, local overheating in the junctions of ferrite blocks often happens, posing potential risks to system reliability. To tackle this problem, a magnetic flux bridge (MFB) method is proposed by filling the air gaps with magnetic conductive powder, which has merits of enhancing magnetic flux confinement and reducing temperature rise at ferrite block joints simultaneously. The effectiveness of the MFB method is judged through a comprehensive evaluation formula considering temperature, leakage flux and efficiency. An 11.1-kW experimental prototype is built to verify the practicability of the proposed method. The measured experimental results show that the proposed MFB method can significantly reduce the ferrite core's maximum temperature by 31.3%, maximum magnetic flux leakage by 8.1%, and improve system efficiency by 2.06%, thus enhancing the safety and reliability of high-power WPT converter systems."

    "abstract": "The quantization step is a crucial parameter in the JPEG compression process, and provides prior knowledge for JPEG image steganography and forensics. Existing neural network-based methods typically estimate the quantization steps for all discrete cosine transform (DCT) subbands jointly, by treating the entire quantization table as a unified input and leveraging the inter-subband relationships. However, subband relationships vary across different quantization tables, leading to poor generalization for methods that rely heavily on such relationships. To address the above issues, we depart from the strategy that relies on inter-subband relationships and instead train the model on a specific single subband. To compensate for the possible decrease in accuracy due to the lack of relationships between subbands, we extract the ranking features and histogram features from the DCT coefficient histograms of the subbands. Ranking features capture local patterns in DCT histograms by modeling the relative relationships between neighboring coefficients, thereby compensating for the absence of local detail. On the other hand, histogram features represent the overall distribution pattern of the DCT coefficient histograms and capture the global trends and statistical properties in the subbands. We subsequently employ convolutional groups and multilayer perceptron (MLP) structures to extract compression artifacts from these two features. Finally, we introduce a comprehensive evaluation metric, called GenAQt, to quantify the algorithm’s generalization ability across quantization tables. The experimental results demonstrate that our method maintains high accuracy across quantization tables, with RelGenAQt (relative accuracy decrease) exceeding 81% and AbsGenAQt (absolute accuracy decrease) being less than 0.38."

In this article, we review two recent lattice-based PCSs, Greyhound and HyperWolf, both relying on the Module-SIS assumption but differing in target polynomial classes and proof techniques. In particular, Greyhound achieves a smaller proof size O(log log N) through folding and LaBRADOR proofs, while HyperWolf supports univariate and multilinear polynomials with lower verifier cost O(log N) using hypercube evaluation."

    "abstract": "Link prediction serves as a foundational task in a wide range of graph-based applications, including recommender systems, drug discovery, anomaly detection, and biological network analysis. Real-world graphs that support these applications seldom conform to a single geometry: hierarchical communities favour negative curvature, lattice-like regions are nearly Euclidean, and densely cyclic sub-structures lean toward spherical manifolds. However, existing approaches often fall short by assuming a fixed geometric curvature or relying on shallow decoders, which limits their ability to capture the full spectrum of geometric relationships and accurately model edge likelihoods. To address these limitations, we propose MC-MoE-Diff, a Mixed-Curvature Mixture-of-Experts framework that integrates geometry-adaptive representation learning with a scorebased diffusion process for robust and expressive link prediction. Specifically, MC-MoE-Diff embeds nodes into a trainable product space spanning spherical, Euclidean, and hyperbolic geometries, enabling the model to flexibly adapt to local structural variations. A Lipschitz-gated curvature-aware mixture-of-experts module dynamically routes node representations to specialized experts, each tuned to a specific geometric regime. The model then employs a two-channel diffusion-based decoder that iteratively denoises a latent edge map to reconstruct pairwise connectivity patterns. We validate MC-MoE-Diff across multiple benchmark datasets where it consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming competitive baselines by up to 7 percentage points in AUC and AP, while maintaining linear training complexity. Furthermore, we demonstrate the model’s practical utility in a real-world biomedical application by accurately predicting cellular interactions from spatial transcriptomic data."

The core idea is to integrate the incremental information of control inputs, the norm value of tracking errors, and a control barrier function into the utility function. First, the IQL method designs an online controller by utilizing tracking errors and the incremental information of control inputs, which reduces the approximation pressure on neural networks caused by excessively large control inputs. Second, the IQL leverages the norm value of tracking errors to influence the magnitude of the incremental control inputs, thereby enhancing the adaptive capability and online stability. Third, an adjustable control barrier function is employed to ensure that the tracking errors do not exceed the predefined constraints, thus meeting the specified tracking accuracy requirements. Fourth, a stability criterion related to learning rates is established to demonstrate the convergence of neural network weights. Finally, the superior control performance of the IQL method is validated via simulation results under two distinct weather conditions."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a twisted-bent fiber optic sensor with volume compensation for precise refractive index (RI) measurement in transformer oil applications. The sensor design combines a twisted structure with an additional controlled bending, enhancing the interaction between the evanescent field and the surrounding medium. A plastic optical fiber (POF) was used, and its performance was systematically characterized through bending diameter variation, RI detection, and oil volume sensitivity analysis. An optimal bending diameter of 4.5 cm was identified, where the sensor achieved RI sensitivities of 2167.4 RIU⁻¹ at 680 nm and 2058.5 RIU⁻¹ at 780 nm, with corresponding linearity values of 0.9172 and 0.9046. The twisted bend configuration also showed strong responsiveness to oil volume variation, with volume sensitivities of 5.9512 ml⁻¹ and 5.5438 ml⁻¹. To address measurement error due to volume effects, a dual-wavelength compensation technique was applied. By utilizing the distinct RI and volume sensitivities at 680 nm and 780 nm, a matrix-based compensation method was applied to separate the RI effects from volume effects and determine the actual RI values. This compensation reduced relative error from 1.7 × 10⁻² % to as low as 1.86 × 10⁻¹³%. Overall, the proposed twisted bend fiber optic sensor demonstrates high sensitivity, reliable compensation for environmental variation, and robust performance. It simple, low-cost design makes it a promising tool for transformer oil monitoring and other chemical or industrial sensing applications requiring high accuracy and stability."

    "abstract": "Modern manufacturing is rapidly shifting toward high-mix, low-volume (HMLV) production, which requires flexible and intuitive robot programming methods. However, conventional approaches such as teach pendants or external trackers remain complex and inefficient for non-expert users. This paper presents a hand-gesture based tracking and teaching framework that enables intuitive and no-code robot programming for industrial applications. The system estimates a stable local coordinate frame from robust hand-joint landmarks and employs visual servoing with an eye-in-hand RGB-D camera to continuously and stably track the user's hand. A finger padding filter is introduced to enhance depth estimation at the fingertips, ensuring reliable 3D point extraction for trajectory definition. On top of low-level pose tracking, a gesture recognition model combined with a finite state machine allows non-expert users to design diverse robot programs entirely through hand gestures, without coding. The proposed framework was first validated through controlled experiments, demonstrating improved teaching accuracy and reduced errors compared to a fixed-camera baseline. Its practical utility was then evaluated in a representative application scenario, where the complete workflow of a surface finishing task such as polishing was carried out solely via hand gestures. A usability study further confirmed its effectiveness, showing high user acceptance and reduced workload. Overall, the framework provides an accessible and generalizable interface for robot programming, supporting flexible deployment in high-mix, low-volume manufacturing."

To address this challenge, this article provides a novel approach to generating smooth joint paths for industrial robots through redundancy optimization. Specifically, a new smoothness metric based on a gradient direction consistency principle is introduced at first. Subsequently, a simple yet effective redundancy optimization model is built by incorporating the joint space limitation, singularity avoidance and stiffness constraints. This transforms the complex smooth joint paths generation problem into a manageable binary classification task. In addition, by combining the Taylor series expansion, a generalized solution algorithm based on sequential quadratic programming is also proposed to solve the problem. Comparative experiments are conducted to validate the proposed method. The experimental results demonstrate that, in comparison to other representative approaches, this method achieves a significant improvement in the smoothness of joint paths, with an 88% reduction in the metric, but also enhances machining accuracy, as evidenced by a 23% contour error reduction."

    "abstract": "Compilers are prone to bugs that can have severe consequences for downstream applications. Accurately identifying and localizing compiler faults poses unique challenges due to the inherent complexity and large scale of modern compiler infrastructures. Existing studies have proposed various techniques to construct passing and failing executions by generating witness test programs from bug-inducing test cases or by producing adversarial compilation configurations for the same test program. These executions are then leveraged to apply spectrum-based fault localization (SBFL) techniques for isolating compiler faults, yielding promising results. Recently, Yang et al. revisited SBFL-based techniques and showed that a simple yet widely adopted debugging practice—treating files modified in bug-inducing commits (BICs) as potential fault candidates—can surprisingly outperform SBFL-based techniques on the most critical localization metrics. Moreover, they further demonstrated that BIC-based and SBFL-based techniques are highly complementary, as they tend to localize different subsets of compiler faults. Consequently, effectively integrating these two sources of information to improve compiler fault localization remains an open and largely unexplored challenge. To address this problem, we propose D<sc xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">UAL</small>T<sc xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">RACK</small>, a hybrid approach that integrates dynamic execution information from SBFL with historical information derived from BICs.

    "abstract": "Teleoperation has been widely used to expand human working capability in remote, unstructured, and dangerous environments, such as explosive disposal and rescue tasks. In such scenarios, both large-scale flexible obstacle avoidance and small-scale refined operations are often required. However, existing teleoperation devices rarely manage to meet both of these requirements at the same time. This article proposes a new exoskeleton capable of functioning in homogeneous and heterogeneous teleoperation to achieve efficient and precise human-like teleoperation. Regarding hardware design, the exoskeleton fully considers the motion coordination of the human arm. It covers all degrees of freedom of the human arm, including the sternoclavicular motion. A new elbow structure and special overall layout are implemented to reduce the motion inertia and enhance the range of motion. Regarding teleoperation control, a novel teleoperation framework is proposed that seamlessly switches between homogeneous (phased posture mapping) and heterogeneous (workspace operation). With this, the operator can quickly avoid obstacles, approach the target position in a homogeneous manner, and then perform precise operations in a heterogeneous manner. Thorough analyses and experiments demonstrate that our proposed exoskeleton system and teleoperation method exhibit superior performance in rapidity with high success rates in complex teleoperation tasks."

This article presents a comprehensive study of effective carrier mobility in a 55-nm bulk CMOS technology at 4 K. Using a physics-based extraction technique, we decompose the inverse mobility into its constituent weak-field (Coulomb) and strong-field (surface roughness) scattering components. The characterization across various device geometries and threshold voltage options reveals that mobility degradation at 4 K is primarily governed by the weak-field component. A significant finding is the asymmetric width dependence, where PMOS mobility is strongly enhanced in narrow channels due to mechanical stress, while NMOS mobility remains largely unaffected. An empirical model for the key scattering parameters is developed and validated against a verification set of experimental data, demonstrating excellent predictive accuracy for drain current. The results provide critical physical insights and a direct pathway for developing accurate cryogenic compact models, with important circuit implications for device selection and layout optimization."

The framework uses event-driven smart contracts (EDSCs) and an oracle-assisted sidechain to verify local model updates without exposing sensitive data. A built-in challenge mechanism efficiently detects adversarial behavior. In experiments on image classification and language modeling tasks, ZK-HybridFL achieves faster convergence, higher accuracy, lower perplexity, and reduced latency compared to Blade-FL and ChainFL. It remains robust against substantial fractions of adversarial and idle nodes, supports sub-second on-chain verification with efficient gas usage, and prevents invalid updates and orphanage-style attacks. This makes ZK-HybridFL a scalable and secure solution for decentralized FL across diverse environments."

    "abstract": "Federated edge learning (FEEL) greatly facilitates the development of ubiquitous intelligence by combining federated learning and edge computing. However, traditional FEEL implementations assume fixed-sized local datasets, neglecting the potential of edge devices to acquire sensory information actively. Such a simplistic scenario leads to overestimating data availability and underestimating resource utilization in networks with varying resource capacity. Moreover, the existing FEEL-oriented systems with integrated sensing, communication, and computation (ISCC) have separate-based designs, leading to an inefficient use of wireless resources. To alleviate these issues, we propose a novel FEEL-oriented ISCC framework in edge collaborative networks, by leveraging the integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) technique to achieve the dual purpose of data sensing and parameter transmission. Then, over the designed framework, we present FEEL convergence analysis under non-independent and identically distributed (non-iid) and iid data. Correspondingly, we formulate a joint beamforming and flexible time duration optimization problem to maximize the convergence speed of FEEL, subject to limited resources on the devices and requirements for data sensing and communication. To address the problem efficiently, we propose an alternative optimization framework, in which the successive convex approximation (SCA) method is adopted to solve the nonconvex beamforming design subproblem, and a low-complexity method is derived for optimal time allocation. Extensive results reveal that the proposed framework can achieve excellent performance in model training accuracy by efficiently utilizing limited resources in edge collaborative networks, under iid and non-iid data."

The armature windings are assumed to be composed of single or double pancake coils in the form of a racetrack wound using a 2nd generation high temperature superconducting (HTS) wire, i.e., REBCO coated conductor. Since the superconducting (SC) layer in the coated conductor is very thin, it is treated as an SC strip with infinitesimal thickness. The straight part of the racetrack coil is considered to be placed inside one of the iron core slots of the armature. AC losses in the windings are numerically calculated using the two-dimensional finite element method, combining current vector potential formulation for the SC strips with magnetic vector potential formulation for vacuum region. The electric-field versus current-density characteristics in the SC strip are assumed to follow Bean's critical state model, where the critical current density is unaffected by the local magnetic field. Various parameters such as the amplitude and frequency of applied transport current, pitch and turn number in the winding, and the width and depth of the iron core slot systematically vary to investigate their influence on AC losses. Using the obtained numerical results of AC losses, simple expressions to reproduce them almost accurately are established based on vectorial dimensional analysis."

    "abstract": "The data security and integrity of deep learning model is very important. Backdoor attack poses a serious challenge to the security of deep learning system because of its concealment and destructiveness. Most of the existing backdoor attacks rely on static triggers and are easy to be detected by pattern analysis methods. This paper proposes a dynamic backdoor attack (lbpdba) based on multi-scale local binary pattern (LBP). In this method, LBP is used to extract the multi-scale texture features of the image, and the features of different scales are weighted by information entropy to generate dynamic triggers that change with the input image, so as to improve the concealment and adaptability of backdoor attacks. Experiments are carried out on cifar-10 and tiny Imagenet datasets. The results show that compared with badnets, blended and blind methods, lbpdba not only performs better in attack success rate, but also has less impact on the normal performance of the model. In addition, lbpdba can effectively circumvent the mainstream defense methods such as strip and spectre, showing strong concealment and robustness, and providing reference for the research of more effective defense methods."

Built upon the foundations of established and advanced VLMs—such as YOLO, BLIP, CLIP, and VILA—COME-HVLM is designed to automatically detect and interpret active contextual elements including objects, motions, and environmental features within CCTV surveillance video streams. Operating primarily in edge-computing environments of smart city surveillance systems, the framework systematically extracts and encodes these contextual elements—termed CCTV-Surveillance Active Contexts—into a structured representation format known as COME-Code (Contextual Object–Motion–Environment Code), expressed in JSON. Furthermore, COME-HVLM supports the augmentation of these COME-Code datasets with additional semantic attributes and descriptive properties, thereby enabling enriched and machine-processable contextual representations for large-scale CCTV video analytics and intelligent surveillance applications."

    "abstract": "Block-Term Tensor Regression (BTTR) is a multilin-ear modeling framework suited for high-dimensional biomedical data, but its centralized implementation conflicts with privacy and regulatory constraints. To overcome this, we propose Federated Block-Term Tensor Regression (FBTTR), which integrates BTTR into a federated learning setting. We systematically evaluate multiple federated aggregation strategies, including FedAvg, FedYogi, to assess their effect on model performance and stability. Experiments on the BCI Competition IV dataset demonstrate that the choice of strategy strongly influences predictive accuracy: FedAvg yields the most stable and accurate results across subjects, while adaptive methods such as FedYogi show less consistent performance. These findings highlight the importance of strategy selection in federated learning and establish FBTTR as a practical approach for privacy-preserving analysis of multi-institutional biomedical data."

    "abstract": "The proliferation of fake job postings has emerged on social media platforms as a significant threat to public safety and trust, resulting in financial and psychological harm to job seekers. This paper presents a machine learning-based approach for detecting fake news on social media platforms, with a specific focus on job-related scams. The proposed system utilizes the LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model integrated with GloVe (Global Vectors for Word Representation) for semantic-aware text classification. A custom dataset of real-world job-related content was used for training and testing the model. The proposed LSTM-GloVe model, achieving 88.24% accuracy, outperforms alternative approaches, such as LSTM with BERT and ANN with GloVe, in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency. The LSTM-GloVe model reduces false positives and offers real-time classification. However, when the model is tested on an external dataset, its performance drops to achieve 50% accuracy, indicating a limitation in generalizability and the need for performance adaptation. This paper contributes to the field by offering a robust solution for detecting fake job offers, aligning with the UAE's Digital Government Strategy 2025 and AI Strategy 2031 to enhance public safety and information integrity."

Based on the open-source scrapers, the structure of the project is the design of a dynamic home page and a powerful scraping environment. One of the most important aspects of the methodology is the process of scraping the Amazon products data with the use of advanced methods to retrieve and process data in the constantly changing web environment. It involves the complex configuration of a database, the development of a comprehensive product description page, the addition of email functionality with the help of NodeMailer to get timely notifications, the introduction of a cron job to update the application automatically, and the smooth release of the Next.js 14 application. In the real-world implementation section, practical challenges that were faced in the implementation of the project are indicated with viable solutions and optimisation strategies being offered. The study results provided an insight into the precision and reliability of scraped information, the performance indicators of the system, and user experience feedback. The paper will end by outlining the prospects of improvement and expansion in the future, proposing the advancement of the features, its integration with other eCommerce sites, scaling aspects, and perspectives about the new technology.

    "abstract": "Facial expression recognition (FER) must remain robust under both cultural variation and perceptually degraded visual conditions, yet most existing evaluations assume homogeneous data and high-quality imagery. We introduce an agent-based, streaming benchmark that reveals how cross-cultural composition and progressive blurring interact to shape face recognition robustness. Each agent operates in a frozen CLIP feature space with a lightweight residual adapter trained online at σ = 0 and fixed during testing. Agents move and interact on a 5×5 lattice, while the environment provides inputs with σ-scheduled Gaussian blur. We examine monocultural populations (Western-only, Asian-only) and mixed environments with balanced (5/5) and imbalanced (8/2, 2/8) compositions, as well as different spatial contact structures. Results show clear asymmetric degradation curves between cultural groups: JAFFE (Asian) populations maintain higher performance at low blur but exhibit sharper drops at intermediate stages, whereas KDEF (Western) populations degrade more uniformly. Mixed populations exhibit intermediate patterns, with balanced mixtures mitigating early degradation, but imbalanced settings amplify majority-group weaknesses under high blur. These findings quantify how cultural composition and interaction structure influence the robustness of FER as perceptual conditions deteriorate."

While quantum computing is rapidly gaining attention for its potential to revolutionize computational speed and address complex problems, the gap in early education for pre-university students remains notable, especially in South Korea. This research examined international and domestic trends in quantum computing education, developed an activity-based curriculum integrating simulation tools and collaborative problem solving, and applied it to a group of high school students. Through pre- and post-program surveys, activity sheets, and qualitative feedback, the results show a significant increase in students’ understanding and interest in quantum computing concepts such as superposition, entanglement, and quantum gates. The study highlights that an experiential, STEAM-integrated approach using visual and hands-on resources effectively lowers conceptual barriers and enhances engagement. However, challenges such as a lack of prior knowledge and limited educational materials persist. The research suggests policy and curriculum improvements as well as extended teacher training are required to bridge the global educational gap in quantum computing, and indicates that systematic integration of quantum concepts at the high school level is both feasible and impactful."

The models were evaluated and optimized on actual restaurant data gathered over a period of time in order to make reliable predictions to control waste and inventory. Precision, recall, F1-score, accuracy, MAE, RMSE, MAPE, $\\mathbf{R}^{\\mathbf{2}}$, Stock Turnover Ratio (STR), Fill Rate, and Waste-to-Sales Ratio were the performance metrics used to measure the performance of the models. Among the models, the best performing was XGBoost with the best prediction accuracy in the residuals, minimum waste-to-sales ratio, and maximum cost savings and thus the best model for restaurant operation optimization. The findings show the promise of predictive analytics with AI in enhancing sustainability, minimizing food waste, and maximizing profitability in the food supply chain."

We implemented two functionally similar control methods on a ruggedized response robot: (1) a mouse-driven 2D GUI with multiple live video streams and a 2D projection of environment and robot, and (2) a Godot-based walkable VR environment operated with a commercial VR headset, featuring an interactive digital twin and overlaid sensor data. In a within-subjects experiment with nine participants (with robot control experience) performing inspection and manipulation tasks, we measured objective performance (time on task, accuracy) and subjective responses with standardized questionnaires (SSQ, SEQ, ASQ, UMUX, NASA-TLX). Both control methods were well suited for the given tasks, but participants predominantly preferred the VR control. Without inducing excessive simulator sickness, VR control yielded statistically significant 12% faster task completion, 45% lower mental workload, and higher usability ratings. These results demonstrate that intuitive VR interfaces can enhance expert operators’ performance and the usability of response robots with a manipulator in time-critical scenarios."

The outcomes yield a significant distinction in performance when compared to the current detection results, therefore confirming that the CNN-LSTM model can be employed to improve the effectiveness of exoplanet detection. Our findings indicate promising applications in future astronomical research and smooth the way for further progress in this field."

    "abstract": "The inclusion of cloud computing has changed how institutions can be able to manage and secure their digital infrastructure, allowing them to be more flexible, more scalable, and more cost effective. But, as users rely more and more on cloud environments, cybersecurity becomes more complex for access control and data security too. Perimeter based security models are less effective as organizations increasingly rely on cloud systems that enable remote access and sharing. In turn, deployment of AI-centric policies and Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) presents an alternative way to improve the monitoring of access to cloud-based services. In this paper, we present a study on advanced cybersecurity trends: the development and deployment of AI-based policies and Zero Trust principles for the management of access control rules in cloud-based environments. With AI-driven policies, decision-making can be automated as to who is allowed to access which resources, at what time, and under which conditions. Through analyzing such a large pool of historical and real-time data, machine learning AUTOMATION can anticipate potential threats, judge user behavior and adapt access control regulation dynamically to minimize risks. One example for these intelligent systems is to provide a more fine-grained control for making accesses that only authorized people are allowed to access sensitive data or systems. At the same time, Zero Trust Architecture changes the security model from protecting the edge to continuous validation of trust through an approach in which users are required to authenticate and authorize themselves before accessing a resource, regardless of where they are and the networks they're using. It is based on the belief that both internal and external networks can be compromised and applies a design principle of “never trust, always verify”, so everything is tightly controlled, with access only granted after identity and context are fully assessed. This article examines the advantages as well as the limitations of utilizing AI-driven policies implemented in cloud with Zero Trust guidelines. It investigates how these technologies can work together to form a powerful, flexible and context-sensitive access control system that adapts to threats and to unauthorized access attempts."

Finally, a case study on the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Animals (OMIA) database compares deterministic and LLM-based methods across data acquisition, extraction, change detection, coherence evaluation, and rigor assessment. Deterministic techniques remain optimal for structured tasks, while LLMs add value in summarization and contextual analysis.

KeyBlob uniquely combines support for multiple wrapping standards with the encapsulation of multiple keys in a single, cohesive format. It enhances security through flexible key wrapping, a Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) SignedData structure for origin authenticity, optional padding to obscure key sizes, and per-key MACs for integrity. Practical features include compressed attributes for efficiency, attribute encryption for flexible access control, PKCS\\#8 compliance for private key management, and protocol-specific key wrapping for HSM clusters. An optimized request structure and multi-key support via an ASN. 1 SEQUENCE OF WrappedKey enables efficient offline HSM-to-HSM key exchange. Comparative analysis with standards like TR-31, TR-34, and the Key Management Interoperability Protocol (KMIP) highlights KeyBlob's distinctive advantages: unparalleled flexibility in key type and wrapping support, robust CMS-rooted security, and a design tailored for offline scenarios. Comprehensive evaluation and design objectives comparison demonstrate KeyBlob's practicality as a cutting-edge solution for contemporary HSM key management challenges."

    "abstract": "Predicting translation learner competence development trajectories is crucial for personalized instruction and formative assessment in translation education. However, existing approaches rely heavily on summative evaluations and fail to capture the dynamic, multidimensional nature of competence growth. This paper proposes a translation learner competence development trajectory prediction model based on XGBoost and multimodal feature fusion. We collected comprehensive learning data from 237 translation major students over two semesters on a MOOC platform, including 1,896 translation assignments, 14,220 revision records, 3,554 peer review entries, and over 50,000 learning behavior logs. A three-dimensional competence representation framework was developed, encompassing linguistic competence, bilingual transfer ability, and cultural awareness. From this framework, 92 feature variables were extracted across three categories: translation quality features (lexical diversity, syntactic complexity), learning behavior features (practice frequency, reflection depth), and social interaction features (peer review quality, discussion participation). The XGBoost-based prediction model achieved an accuracy of 85.1%, outperforming traditional machine learning methods including Random Forest (82.3%), SVM (78.6%), and Logistic Regression (74.2%). Feature importance analysis revealed that revision behavior depth (0.18), social interaction quality (0.15), and cultural awareness performance (0.12) are the most critical predictors of competence development. The model successfully identified four distinct development patterns: steady improvement (42.6%), fluctuating development (28.7%), plateau (19.4%), and regression (9.3%). A time-series-based competence development stage recognition algorithm was implemented to track learners' progression through initial adaptation, rapid growth, and stabilization phases. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of multimodal feature fusion and demonstrate that translation competence development is a complex process involving linguistic skills, cognitive strategies, and social interactions. This research provides data-driven support for process-oriented evaluation and personalized learning interventions in translation education, contributing to the intelligent transformation of translation pedagogy."

    "abstract": "The converged terrestrial and Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite networks that have opened tremendous room to connect the world but is creating other security vulnerabilities, especially in the time when the infrastructures of the Internet of Things (IoT) are growing incredibly fast. Customary fixed security measures fare poorly in maintaining with the shifting and high dense telemetry flows that have become typical of web-based satellite-based IoT communication. This study finds such an inspiration inherent in the above challenge which is seen to cluster around need of sturdy and adaptive intrusion defence system able to detect both feature-based and structure attacks which stall grounded models. Though state-of-the-art deep learning and hybrid models are quite effective in normal settings, they fall short in challenging situations relative to advanced adversary strategies that meet satellite communications limitations like restricted bandwidth and long latency. We make proposals to overcome this gap: SCA-VAGAD, a new Satellite Communication Anomaly Detection framework that would simply integrate the following elements synergistically: a Variational Encoder-Decoder to compress features, a Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm to weight the features based on Information Gain and Gini Index, and Adaptive Boosting to optimize the detection boundaries. When assessed against the TON_IoT benchmark with the data reflecting realistic application of IoT network and telemetry settings, the proposed pipeline demonstrates stable high detection accuracy with an overall accuracy of above 95 percent for the primary attack categories and the good performance of precision, recall, and F1-Scores of largely underrepresented threats. The comparative findings confirm that SCA-VAGAD exceeds current deep learning and hybrid baselines by far and is the most robust and effective such tool that promises a scalable anomaly detection solution across next-generation satellite communication ecosystems."

    "abstract": "The Softmax function plays a crucial role in transformer architectures, particularly in the context of multi-head attention. Due to its reliance on exponential functions and normalization, implementing Softmax in hardware is challenging. This paper presents a scalable Softmax approximation optimized for fully local computations on FPGA platforms. The proposed design is derived from the Sparse Transformer Accelerator and employs a first-order Taylor expansion for exponential approximation. An adder tree is used to sum the approximate exponential values, while cascaded divider blocks perform the normalization. The proposed Softmax also uses a pipeline to enable the simultaneous processing of multiple data inputs. The scalable Softmax approximation was tested and evaluated on the ZUCU104 FPGA, where the implementation achieved resource savings of up to 75 % for DSPs and 43 % for LUTs, with output deviations of up to <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\text{1. 2} \\%$</tex>. Furthermore, the experiments demonstrated that increasing the number of input elements reduced the approximation error, and that parallelization strategies enhanced performance. The results indicate that the scalable Softmax approximation offers a viable solution for low-latency deep learning accelerators."

Due to the extremely large number of antennas in ELAA, the impinging wavefront must be characterized by spherical waves, which deviates from the conventional planar-wave assumption in massive MIMO. As a result, near-field MIMO communications cannot be neglected in 6G wireless networks. In this paper, we comprehensively investigate the near-field communication techniques. First, we present the fundamentals of near-field communications and the metric to determine the near-field ranges in typical communication scenarios. Then we investigate recent works in near-field communications, classifying them into three categories: channel estimation, beam training, and CSI feedback schemes developed to address spherical wavefront effects."

Given the increasing number of aging drivers and their heightened vulnerability to fatigue-related accidents, the proposed solution aims to enhance road safety through timely and reliable detection of drowsiness symptoms. The system captures eye states via camera and processes data locally with a lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN), eliminating the need for cloud connectivity. The model was optimized and quantized for the MAX78000 AI microcontroller, leveraging its hardwareaccelerated CNN engine to achieve low-latency processing and ultra-low power consumption suitable for in-vehicle applications. Two models were trained and evaluated: one using a publicly available dataset from Hugging Face, and another using a smaller, custom-collected dataset gathered under controlled conditions with volunteers. Results show that the model trained on the Hugging Face dataset achieved higher accuracy due to the larger size and greater diversity of data. However, the model trained on the smaller, environmentspecific dataset still demonstrated acceptable performance for practical deployment, indicating that even with fewer images, reliable drowsiness detection can be achieved when training data reflects the intended application context."

This study presents a comprehensive performance comparison between RIS-assisted and decode-and-forward (DF) relay-assisted NOMA systems in an urban environment. Complete system models are developed for both configurations, and their performance is evaluated across multiple metrics, including transmission power, decoding strategy, number of RIS elements, and energy efficiency under varying data rate requirements. The results reveal that in RIS-assisted systems, the effective user channel quality, and thus the optimal decoding order, can change with the number of RIS elements, requiring dynamic adaptation to maintain fairness and maximise throughput. Furthermore, while the DF relay-assisted system performs better at low to moderate data rates, the RIS-assisted system outperforms it when the data rate exceeds a certain threshold. Notably, as the target data rate increases, the number of RIS elements required to surpass DF relay performance decreases sharply, with only a single RIS element needed when the rate exceeds 8 bit/s/Hz. Although the DF relay-assisted system achieves higher energy efficiency at moderate data rates, the RIS-assisted system becomes the most energy-efficient option in high-rate scenarios, because of its passive design and low perelement power consumption."

We investigate its ability to detect objects located behind transparent obstacles such as acrylic boards. Experiments were conducted under three scenarios: only the acrylic board, only the target object, and target behind acrylic board. We processed the received signals in MATLAB by applying range FFT, angle FFT, and background subtraction using reference data without objects. The resulting range–angle maps revealed reflections not only from the acrylic board but also from the target placed behind it, confirming that the radar waveform propagated through the transparent material. These findings indicate that mmWave FMCW radar can detect objects beyond transparent obstacles, implying that unintended objects outside the region of interest may also appear in radar images. This effect should be considered in future designs and applications of mmWave radar sensing systems."

We explored what happens when Federated Learning (FL)—a way for machines to learn without sharing raw data— is combined with Digital Twins, which are virtual versions of physical systems that help monitor and predict performance. Together, they form a powerful team: digital twins provide deep insights into how machines behave, while FL ensures each system learns from its own environment and then contributes to a smarter, shared global model. We tested this combo in simulated environments like factories, power grids, and logistics networks. The results Less downtime, more accurate predictions, and dramatically reduced data usage.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in diffusion models have attracted great attention owing to their ability to generate diverse modalities, particularly high-quality images. In practical scenarios, most requests for image generation services originate from wireless devices such as smartphones and robots. However, due to the intensive inference calculations of current diffusion models, such generation services cannot be executed locally on resource-constrained devices. To reduce the computational burden of devices, it is necessary to offload inference calculations to nearby computing servers over wireless fading channels. In this paper, we propose a multi-hop diffusion network that allows devices to complete their image generation tasks by utilizing multiple computing servers. Each server forwards latent outputs of diffusion models to proximity servers. A group of servers along with devices collectively form multi-hop networks. Consequently, the computational cost of individual nodes can be fairly reduced. To further enhance the quality of image generation tasks, we present multi-antenna signal processing techniques at the servers. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed strategy successfully generates high-quality images through multi-hop coordination."

Each method is evaluated under various execution modes (CPU-only, GPU-only, and CPU+GPU hybrid) across multiple input sizes and batch configurations. The key performance metrics including latency, throughput (FPS), hardware utilization (CPU/GPU usage and memory consumption), and energy efficiency (FPS/Watt) are measured to assess practical viability. The results reveal that Direct convolution achieves the lowest latency but scales poorly, GEMM-based convolution offers strong throughput with higher memory demands, and Winograd convolution shows limited latency benefits but excels in energy efficiency under certain conditions. Power consumption analysis using a Monsoon Power Monitor confirms that optimal energy-performance trade-offs vary by platform and execution strategy.

In total, 8,837 unique third-party URLs spanning 5,930 domains (eTLD+1) were captured, with a small subset recurring across multiple domains. Responses varied, with an average reaction time of 75.3 hours.

    "abstract": "While ensemble methods have dominated tabular intrusion detection systems (IDS), recent advances in foundation models present new opportunities for enhanced cybersecurity applications. This paper presents the first comprehensive evaluation of foundation models—specifically TabPFN (a probabilistic transformer for tabular data) and large language models (LLMs) using few-shot in-context learning—against traditional machine learning and deep learning approaches for IoT network intrusion detection. We conduct rigorous experiments on the CIC-IDS2017 and N-BaIoT datasets using a unified evaluation framework that addresses critical methodological issues: methodological rigor through appropriate train/test splits, severe class imbalance via stratified sampling up to 20,000 instances per class, and comprehensive evaluation across four data variants (raw vs. incremental PCA-compressed features with 95% variance retention, original vs. semantically grouped attack classes). Our results demonstrate that TabPFN achieves superior performance on CIC-IDS2017, by being the only model capable of detecting all attack classes including rare ones like Heartbleed, while using only up to 3,000 examples per class and requiring no traditional training or hyperparameter tuning. In contrast, traditional ensemble methods like Random Forest and K-NN, while achieving high overall accuracy (>99%), fail to detect several minority attack classes. TabNet shows competitive performance only when augmented with SMOTE-based synthetic data generation, highlighting the importance of data augmentation strategies for deep learning approaches on imbalanced cybersecurity datasets. LLM-based few-shot classifiers demonstrate surprising effectiveness in identifying rare attack classes like Heartbleed and Infiltration and provide inherent explainability, though they remain limited by context size and inference latency for large-scale deployment. These findings challenge the assumption that tree-based ensembles are optimal for tabular IDS applications and suggest that foundation models, particularly TabPFN, offer a promising paradigm shift toward training-free, generalizable intrusion detection systems capable of handling zero-day threats in IoT environments."

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a circuit design method based on chained connection of generalized parallel counters (GPCs) as an efficient FPGA implementation technique for multi-input adders, which are key components in multipliers, multiplyaccumulate units, and neural networks. Conventional methods construct carry-save adders using GPCs, which are extended full adders, but the most bit-efficient GPC, the GPC(6,0,7;5), has not been effectively utilized. The proposed technique reduces circuit area by fully leveraging this GPC through chained GPC connections. Experimental implementations on a Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA demonstrated an average area reduction of 13.06% for 8 to 32-bit multipliers and 11.08% for multi-input adders compared to the best-known methods, while maintaining a critical path delay comparable to conventional designs."

The time-series data are transformed into static features through various statistical methods, such as rolling mean, variance, IQR, and exponential moving average, and are used as input to an ensemble classification model that combines LightGBM and CatBoost. The input features consist of both time-series sensor statistics and date-derived variables, and the model’s performance is evaluated through 5-fold stratified cross-validation. Experimental results demonstrate that the ensemble model outperforms individual models in prediction accuracy. Furthermore, SHAP-based feature importance analysis provides visual insight into the contribution of each feature to the model’s predictions. This study confirms that traditional static feature engineering can serve as a strong method in multi-target prediction tasks involving lifelog data."

This study focuses on the security protection requirements of intelligent connected systems in automobiles. Through hierarchical architecture analysis and full chain risk identification, a multi-level security protection system integrating protocol simulation, encryption authentication, and intrusion detection is constructed. Firstly, based on the GB17691-2018 standard, design a vehicle remote communication service provider (TSP) communication simulation system to achieve full process simulation of protocol data exchange; Subsequently, the platform and machine learning anomaly detection model are validated through man in the middle attacks to quantitatively evaluate the system's resistance to attacks. The experiment shows that the proposed scheme can reduce the success rate of man in the middle attacks from 92.3 % to 1.6 %, achieve a classification accuracy of 96 % for unknown protocols, and control the data transmission delay within 220 ms, meeting the real-time requirements of vehicle mounted systems. The research results provide a systematic solution for the information security protection of ICV.

The research introduces an advanced power pack through the use of a fuel cell module, which is effective in the provision of power transmission in hydrogen-powered electric automobiles. The proposed system does not demand much time delay of time and a constant source of energy to use to power cars. The uncertain and non linearly energy generation consequently leads to the unstable flow of power to the DC-DC conversion circuit to be smoothened with the help of a bioinspired Moth Flame Optimization (MFO) method. The MFO approach enhances the efficiency of the system, and the advantages of the approach are that it has less complexity in designing the system, greater efficacy of energy transmission, and energy deployment. BY integrating a voltage multiplierbased DC-DC converter, it obtains more voltage to be delivered at the load interface. This power converter is profiled with a single switch design, a large multiplication of high voltage, authenticity of outstanding voltage, minimal pressure on the switching elements, and realization."

In this work, we evaluate an embedded manifold microchannel cooling structure designed for direct heat removal from the backside of a GaN-on-SiC HEMT device. Three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations of the baseline microchannel configuration were performed to quantify thermal resistance, pressure drop, and coolant flow effects. The results show a significant reduction in thermal resistance. In parallel, we present a fabrication concept for integrating a porous metal insert into the microchannel to enhance heat transfer area and uniformity. This approach is broadly applicable to high-power RF components, offering a path toward improved thermal performance, compact packaging, and operational stability."

Timely intervention and management of Alzheimer's disease depend on early and precise detection. It is possible that the complicated heterogeneity of brain alterations is unnoticed by conventional diagnostic approaches since they depend on manual feature extraction or single-modality imaging. The authors of this work provide a solution: the Bio-Evolutionary Sparse Clustering (BESC) method. This approach can improve AD detection by integrating multimodal neuroimaging data, such as MRI and PET scans. Using evolutionary optimization, BESC efficiently clusters patient data, finds unique patterns linked to disease development, and selects sparse yet informative characteristics. In terms of classification accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, experimental results on benchmark datasets show that BESC surpasses traditional clustering and ML approaches. The results show that BESC can help with early AD diagnosis and offer a solid, understandable foundation for physicians to use when creating individualized treatment plans."

Using automation tools like n8n, it uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to generate plain-language summaries and delivers personalized health information and real-time reminders via email, SMS, or in-app notifications. In order to support collaborative care, MedVision AI also makes it easier to track medical histories, store data securely, and grant guardians or physicians rolebased access.

ISO/IEC 27001:2022 provides a structured framework for securing information assets, yet many organizations face challenges in implementing its controls effectively-especially those in Annex 8. This study analyzes 27 major enforcement cases in Singapore from 2022 to 2024 to examine common failures in technology-related controls under the Personal Data Protection Commission's (PDPC) decisions, Singapore's main authority body for administering the Personal Data Protection Act. The most frequently failed controls include 8.16 (Monitoring Activities), 8.3 (Information Access Restriction), 8.11 (Data Masking), 8.15 (Logging), and 8.8 (Technical Vulnerability Management). These failures point to weaknesses in managing vulnerabilities, sensitive data, access rights, and system monitoring. Correlation analysis also revealed that failures in certain controls, such as network security (8.20) and network services (8.21), or malware protection (8.7) and privileged utility programs (8.18), often occur together. This suggests a cascading effect, where the breakdown of one control can lead to others failing. The findings support the need for integrated strategies aligned with ISO/IEC 27001:2022 to strengthen overall information security."

Satellites are modeled as points uniformly distributed on circular orbits, while aircraft positions are uniformly distributed along their GC trajectories. We derive exact analytical expressions for the distribution of distances to the nearest visible satellite, coverage probability, and ergodic capacity under line-of-sight constraints imposed by Earth’s curvature. Our model transcends specific flight scenarios, offering a versatile, generalizable tool for any aircraft navigating worldwide routes. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations confirm the accuracy of our analysis and reveal how orbital parameters and aircraft positioning fundamentally shape communication quality.

    "abstract": "Reservoir prediction is a key link in oil and gas exploration and development, and efficient analysis of well seismic big data is of great significance for improving prediction accuracy. Currently, there are problems with heterogeneous formats, low processing efficiency, insufficient generalization ability of prediction models, and difficulty in quantifying uncertainty in well seismic data, which constrain the accuracy of reservoir prediction. This article constructs a well seismic big data analysis framework for reservoir prediction, which efficiently integrates and standardizes multi-source heterogeneous data through distributed storage technology. Key seismic attributes are selected using feature selection algorithms, and an optimized machine learning model is used to predict reservoir parameters. The prediction uncertainty is quantified by introducing coefficient of variation. This framework forms a complete closed loop of “data fusion feature mining accurate prediction reliability evaluation”, effectively solving the limitations of traditional methods in data processing and model adaptation. Experimental verification shows that the framework improves throughput by 125% in TB level well seismic data processing, significantly reduces root mean square error in reservoir parameter prediction, and the uncertainty assessment results are consistent with geological laws. The research provides technical support for precise exploration of complex oil and gas reservoirs, and enhances the application value of well seismic big data in reservoir prediction."

    "abstract": "Recently, low-bit floating-point (FP) formats have gained popularity in large language models (LLMs), as they better maintain model accuracy than integer formats. However, compute-in-memory (CIM) architectures face two major challenges in efficiently supporting FP operations: 1) the need for alignment of different exponents, which is typically implemented by shifting the mantissa and often results in bit truncation; and 2) complex FP operations inherently consume significant energy. To address these challenges, we propose a bit-preserving analog alignment-based cross-domain FP-CIM (BPA-CIM) architecture tailored for low-bit FP quantized LLMs. Our design decomposes FP operations across two analog domains: 1) a time-domain exponent processor (TD-EP) detects the maximum input exponent through pulse-based comparison; and 2) a charge-domain mantissa processor (CD-MP) performs an analog-based alignment via charge sharing, thereby minimizing precision loss. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed BPA-CIM achieves up to 56.81-TFLOPS/W, with an average accuracy improvement of 2.7% compared to conventional FP-CIM."

    "abstract": "Lattice-based post-quantum cryptography (PQC) algorithms have emerged as a promising solution for secure communication in the post-quantum era, where these algorithms heavily depend on polynomial modular multiplication (PMM). However, the computationally intensive and time-consuming nature of PMM remains a significant bottleneck affecting the overall performance of lattice-based cryptographic algorithms. In this paper, we propose a high-performance PMM accelerator to accelerate PMM by mapping the schoolbook algorithm onto a resistive random access memory (RRAM)-based computing-in-memory (CIM). This accelerator leverages the inherent parallelism and low-latency characteristics of RRAM arrays to perform PMM directly within memory, thereby substantially enhancing throughput per area by minimizing time-consuming data transfers between memory and processors. Experimental results demonstrate a <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$195 \\times$</tex> speedup compared to CPU-based implementations, with <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$1.6 \\times$</tex> and <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$4.4 \\times$</tex> improvements in computational density over state-of-the-art in-memory computing schemes based on convolution and the number-theoretic transform (NTT), respectively. The proposed methodology not only accelerates the PMM in lattice-based PQC algorithms but also provides a scalable and efficient solution for PMM over (fully) homomorphic encryption."

    "abstract": "This work introduces a domain-aware, sequential modelling framework for the characterisation of 2D materials such as graphene, graphene oxide (GO), and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) using impedance spectroscopy. The proposed approach combines a recurrent prediction model with a material classifier, enabling early inference from partial impedance-phase sequences. By forecasting the remainder of the frequency sweep based on initial measurements, the system achieves accurate classification while reducing dependence on full-spectrum acquisition. To enhance efficiency, a domain-informed early stopping mechanism is integrated, which halts inference once classification confidence stabilises and predictive features saturate. The architecture is further optimised through deployment on memristive crossbar arrays, leveraging in-memory computation for energy-efficient matrix-vector operations. The integration of hardware acceleration and real-time inference approaches is particularly suited for scalable, high-throughput applications in materials research and industrial settings. This work has potential for rapid, scalable, and sustainable material characterisation in industrial applications such as composite manufacturing and energy storage."

The spiral and migratory behavior of sooty terns can be modeled using STO-CH, maintaining a fine balance between the exploration and exploitation phases involved in CH selection. A multi-objective fitness function incorporating residual energy, cluster compactness, and proximity to a sink node is used, and K-Means clustering is helpful for initial partitioning. STO-CH is implemented using MATLAB and evaluated on $\\mathrm{1 0 0 m} \\times \\mathrm{1 0 0 m}$ and $\\mathrm{5 0 0 m} \\times \\mathrm{5 0 0 m}$ fields. In comparison with PSO-ECSM, STO-CH has achieved 9.8% higher throughput in the dense network and 24.6% in the sparse network, while maintaining longer stability and consistently higher PDR. In comparison with LEACH, SEP, PSEP, and PSO-ECSM, the superiority of STO-CH in node longevity, throughput, and packet delivery ratio especially in sparse deployments can be seen. STO-CH has thus proved to be robust and scalable in energy-constrained WSNs."

This look at proposes a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based framework for the identity of glaucoma from retinal fundus pictures. The version is designed to classify photographs as both healthy or glaucomatous, providing an efficient and reliable method for clinical screening.

The proposed framework is evaluated across six diagnostic levels, making sure robustness and flexibility. moreover, a dropout mechanism is integrated to reduce overfitting and improve generalization performance. According to the findings of the experiment, CNN-based totally procedures are able to identify the initial signs of glaucoma and help clinicians in decision-making and help to create intelligent, computer-aided diagnostic frameworks."

    "abstract": "Text removal is an important task in processing both scene and document images. However, existing scene text removal (STR) methods are primarily focus on scene text images. The STR models (trained by scene text images) perform poorly on document images with dense, complex textured backgrounds. We discover that the limitations of existing methods can be attributed to the difficuties in background features estimation in the regions to be erased, which is based on the knowledge from neighboring regions in the input images and priors learned from the training data. The background features estimation performance degrades under the cross-domain scenarios, and compromises the quality of STR results. To address these issues, we introduce DiffEraser, a novel text removal framework that leverages prior knowledge from the Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) for removing text in both scene and document images. Our DiffEraser incorporates two key innovations to fully exploit the prior knowledge of LDM. First, we replace the conventional Variational Auto-Encoders (VAE) encoder with a Diffusion-Prior (DP) encoder, aiming to integrate the heterogeneous information from the LDM prior knowledge in latent space with the multi-level encoded features of the input image. Second, we introduce a Latent-Fusion (LF) decoder that integrates the heterogeneous features from both the LDM and DP encoders to generate high-quality text-erased results. To evaluate the generalization performance of our DiffEraser, we focus on the cross-domain protocols and construct a document image dataset, NPID295, which contains 295 types of passports and identity cards. Notably, when trained on a scene text dataset, DiffEraser significantly outperforms existing STR methods in the challenging NPID295 dataset. The resources of this work will be available online upon acceptance."

    "abstract": "Learning control policies from high-dimensional robot demonstrations remains challenging due to the need for large datasets, limited generalization, and high model complexity. These limitations hinder data-efficient learning and reactive deployment from limited demonstrations. This paper introduces LEMON-DS, a compact and data-efficient framework for one shot learning of stable control policies from high-dimensional demonstrations. LEMON-DS proceeds in three stages: (i) a graph Laplacian–based spectral embedding that reveals a quasi linear latent structure from a single trajectory, (ii) defining a globally asymptotically stable dynamical system (DS) in the latent space, and (iii) learning a diffeomorphic mapping that reconstructs the demonstrated behaviour. Collectively, this pipeline yields a lightweight reactive control policy in the form of a dynamical system that is parameter-efficient, globally asymptotically stable, and faithfully reproduces the demonstrated behaviour generalizing across initial conditions. We show empirical performance across diverse robot tasks up to 23 dimensions, outperforming prior approaches in accuracy and model compactness."

For the Medium Resolution Spectral Imager (MERSI) with a 250 m ground sample distance, the attitude and orbit determination system meets sub-pixel geolocation accuracy requirements. However, latitude-related geolocation errors were observed from global GCPs of FY-3D MERSI-Ⅱ, and attitude jitter errors were observed in FY-3F MERSI-Ⅲ. In this study, three time synchronization errors of four dynamic components were investigated for spaceborne integrated sensors, the time delay between Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receivers, Earth time, and navigation system, when the time of the whiskbroom scanner was the reference. The time synchronization calibration method was developed to calibrate MERSI-II and MERSI-III with two orbits. Given the correlation between the time synchronization and spatial parameters, the scanning compensation angles were used to select the optimal parameters. MERSI-Ⅱ exhibits a 0.590 s delay with the GNSS receiver, whereas MERSI-Ⅲ shows 0.27 s and 0.175 s delays with the GNSS receiver and the navigation system, respectively. After correcting the time synchronization of MERSI-II, the median geolocation error in the scan direction at 80° N decreased from 1.5 to 0.5 instantaneous field of view (IFOV). The global root mean square errors (RMSEs) was 0.493 IFOV (109.02 m) in the image plane. After correcting the time synchronization of MERSI-III, the global RMSEs was 0.374 IFOV (93.5 m) in the image plane."

    "abstract": "Despite the growing attention given to applicants' reactions to the utilization of artificial intelligence (AI) within organizational recruitment contexts, scholars have paid little attention to the emotional mechanism between AI decision-making (especially negative) and applicants' procedural justice perception, as well as how the perception affects their subsequent behavior. Drawing on the cognitive–functional model of discrete negative emotions, we propose and empirically test the effect of anger triggered by AI-driven negative hiring decisions on applicants' procedural justice perception and complaint behavior. General support for the model testing is obtained from two studies, namely, a laboratory experiment (N = 97) that uses technology for facial expression analysis (i.e., Face Reader 8.0) and an online scenario-based experiment (N = 270). The rigor of our findings is enhanced by collecting data from multiple participant sources, using FaceReader and self-reports in a complementary manner to measure anger, and by introducing control variables for robustness checks. We find that AI-driven negative decisions, rather than human-driven ones, elicit greater anger from applicants. Notably, this effect is weakened for applicants with extensive prior AI experience. Moreover, anger suppresses applicants' perceptions of procedural justice, thus yielding a distinct effect on their complaint behavior. Our study contributes to the understanding of the effect of AI-driven negative hiring decisions on applicants' emotional, cognitive, and behavioral reactions. It also sheds light on the influence of applicants' prior AI experience in reducing the negative effect of AI-driven negative hiring decisions on applicants' subsequent responses."

    "abstract": "Merging the graphene surface plasmon resonance (GSPR) with the cavity resonance can provide a controllable multifunctional terahertz (THz) metasurface. A reflective metasurface containing a metallic resonator with discontinuities operates with a finite length and short dipoles. The insertion of graphene perturbs the field and can provide the GSPR along with the dipolar resonance of a short metallic dipole. Here, the field enhancement factor in graphene surface plasmons (GSPs) in all the generated GSPs mode indices significantly dominates the field confinement (FE) of metallic short dipolar formation. Consequently, the Fermi energy of graphene can provide the controllable multifunctional operation of the metasurface. The proposed metasurface can provide the conversion from linearly polarized (LP) to left-hand circularly polarized (LHCP) operation in the first band for all the values of Fermi energy of graphene. The operation is as LP to cross-polarization conversion (CPC) for Fermi energy up to 0.4 eV and LP to LHCP for Fermi energy up to 1 eV, in the second band. The metasurface provides the narrow absorption peaks and LP to right-hand circularly polarized (RHCP) operation in the third band for particular values of Fermi energy of graphene."

To this end, a novel game-theoretic framework is proposed. Unlike monolithic game formulations, the framework uniquely disaggregates the control problem by transforming it into a multifaceted game via logarithmic barrier functions (BFs): it models human–machine cooperation as a positive-sum game oriented toward shared objectives, and disturbance rejection as a zero-sum game tailored for robustness enhancement. To capture the nonideal human decision-making, we integrate the level-<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$k$</tex-math> </inline-formula> reasoning framework to model the operator’s bounded cognitive dynamics. The corresponding coupled Hamilton–Jacobi–Isaacs (HJI) equations for this human–machine game are derived, and critically, a rigorous proof of global asymptotic stability (GAS) for the transformed system is provided, establishing a solid theoretical foundation. For online implementation without requiring prior knowledge of the system dynamics, we develop a resource-efficient learning architecture based on the adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) and a novel dynamic event-triggered mechanism (DETM). A key feature of this architecture is a fuzzy logic-based module for dynamic authority allocation, which adaptively adjusts control sharing in real time. Rigorous analysis demonstrates that all signals in the closed-loop system are uniformly ultimately bounded and that Zeno behavior is precluded. Simulation results are presented to validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed control strategy."

    "abstract": "In electric drive systems, common-mode voltage (CMV) fluctuations cause bearing currents that damage the motor, deteriorate stator winding insulation, and generate electromagnetic interference throughout the system. Several methods have been proposed to mitigate this stray voltage, especially in electric vehicles, where reliability requirements are increasingly stringent. At the same time, improving efficiency — by minimizing power losses — is essential to enhance driving range and thermal management. This paper presents a novel two-level three-phase inverter topology combined with hybrid modulation techniques for electric vehicle propulsion systems. The proposed architecture aims to significantly reduce CMV variations while maintaining high overall efficiency. Simulation and experimental results confirm that, depending on the specific operating condition, the proposed solution achieves reductions of more than 80 % in CMV fluctuations compared with standard SV-PWM operation, efficiency improvements between 0.6 % and 1.5 % relative to a conventional VSI, and a redistribution of switching losses that can reduce the power dissipated per main VSI device by more than 25 %. Unlike previously proposed alternatives, the converter preserves full compatibility with standard VSI control schemes and achieves a superior balance between reliability, CMV mitigation, and efficiency. Therefore, it represents a feasible and promising alternative for future electric vehicle drive systems."

A YOLOv3-Tiny object detection model was trained using a publicly available dataset containing 9014 high-resolution images annotated with six common PCB defect types: missing hole, mouse bite, open circuit, short circuit, spur, and spurious copper. The training was conducted using the Hank AI Darknet framework, and the best weights were achieved at iteration 28,819 with a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 99.55%. To enable deployment on resource-limited hardware, the trained model was optimized using the DNNDK toolchain. The model was quantized to 8-bit fixed-point and compiled for execution on the Deep Processing Unit (DPU) integrated into the Xilinx PYNQ-Z2 FPGA board. Both static image inference and real-time inference were successfully executed. The FPGA-based system achieved a real-time frame rate of 2.015 FPS and a post-deployment mAP of 28.17% at IoU threshold of 0.5. Despite a reduction in detection accuracy due to quantization, the system remains suitable for a standalone, power-efficient, and cost-effective PCB defect detection system for real-time industrial applications."

    "abstract": "In ultra-high voltage direct current (UHVDC) transmission systems, the nonlinear characteristics of converters and the integration of new energy sources introduce a large amount of harmonics, which causes measurement errors in traditional FFT algorithms due to spectral leakage and the picket fence effect. To improve the accuracy of energy measurement under harmonic conditions, a three-spectrum line interpolation FFT algorithm based on the four-term fifth-order Nuttall window is proposed. Firstly, the main lobe width, side lobe level and attenuation rate of commonly used window functions are compared, and the four-term fifth-order Nuttall window is selected to suppress spectral leakage. Then, the deviation caused by the picket fence effect is corrected through three-spectrum line interpolation. Finally, a multi-harmonic simulation model is built to verify the performance of the algorithm. Simulation results show that the amplitude error of each harmonic of this algorithm is ≤ 0.0105%, and the phase error is ≤ 0.0389%, which is significantly better than the traditional windowed interpolation algorithm, and can provide a high-precision solution for harmonic measurement in UHVDC systems."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a face recognition system based on grayscale facial images, with the main attention to computational efficiency and classification accuracy. To prepare the data, the dataset is normalized and increased through data augmentation. Dimensionality reduction is done by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and the Eigenface method, selecting 95% of the variance of the dataset. Extracted features are used for training and testing several machine learning models, including Support Vector Ma- chines (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR), and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). Experimental results, validated through crossvalidation, reveal that LDA and LR achieve the best classification performance at $93 \\%$. The obtained results prove that the combination of statistical dimensionality reduction with standard classifiers can be used for reliable face recognition in resource-constrained conditions."

    "abstract": "Interpreting the emotional depth of English poetry presents a unique challenge for ESL (English as a Second Language) students, who often rely on word-for-word translation strategies that obscure nuanced affective meaning. This paper proposes a BERT-based learning framework that integrates affective computing with guided literary interpretation to support ESL learners in developing emotional literacy in poetic texts. The methodology is presented through a set of annotated poetry case studies that illustrate how transformer-based sentiment modeling can scaffold multi-level emotional understanding. Drawing on selected English poems frequently included in undergraduate humanities curricula, the framework shows how BERT can be used to analyze divergences between literal semantic meaning and contextual emotional tone. Students are guided to compare machine-predicted affect (Anger, disgust, fear, joy, neutral, sadness and surprise) with their own interpretations, enabling reflective discussions on emotional subtext, metaphor, and cultural resonance. The approach supports inclusive learning by accommodating linguistic diversity and offering non-native learners affective insights often inaccessible through vocabulary alone. By centering emotion as a critical entry point into literary analysis, this AI-augmented framework promotes deeper engagement with poetry while contributing to digitally empowered humanities education."

    "abstract": "Next-generation wireless systems demand highly efficient power amplifiers (PAs), which introduce complex non-linearities and memory effects. Traditional digital pre-distortion (DPD) methods, such as the Generalized Memory Polynomial (GMP), struggle with these impairments. This paper proposes a Modular Domain-Aware Time-Delay Neural Network (MDA-TDNN), a hybrid physically-inspired architecture that combines established signal processing components into a unified TDNN-based structure. Rather than introducing fundamentally new building blocks, the contribution lies in the systematic integration and evaluation of these components, providing a structured characterization of their individual and joint effects on DPD performance. It includes a Finite Impulse Response (FIR) layer for memory modeling, a phase normalization layer for complex signal behavior, an envelope layer for amplitude non-linearities, and a residual path for stable training. MDA-TDNN was trained on an ideal dataset generated by an Iterative Learning Control scheme and experimentally validated on an RF testbed using a 75 MHz 5G NR signal. The results demonstrate that MDA-TDNN outperforms GMP by 7.95 dB in Adjacent Channel Leakage Ratio (ACLR), achieving performance within 1 dB of ideal DPD. An ablation study highlights the importance of phase normalization and FIR layers. These findings validate the effectiveness of domain-aware neural architectures for PA linearization."

The ongoing intelligent and digital transformation of power grids, however, has exposed them to increasingly severe cybersecurity threats, revealing the inadequacy of conventional defense mechanisms against novel attack paradigms. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel framework for constructing a network threat gene library for power systems that integrates biological immune mechanisms with similarity comparison techniques. The core of our approach involves abstracting network traffic characteristics into “genes”, which are efficiently stored and retrieved using a Prefix Hash Tree. To assess whether a new sample exhibits similarities to known threats, we employ a Radial Basis Function to quantify inter-sample similarity. Furthermore, the proposed scheme incorporates an immune memory mechanism and a dynamic update strategy, enabling continuous refinement of the gene library, ensuring its dynamic adaptability to the evolving threat landscape and facilitating rapid responses to emerging attack patterns. The experimental verification on the CICIDS2018 dataset shows that for the dataset of 1000 to 10000 samples, the system improves the total insertion time of the maximum amount of data by 21.43% while maintaining the query time below 0.05 milliseconds, showing superior scalability and real-time response capabilities."

A particularly effective type of humor for this purpose is content-related humor, which consists of multiple subcategories. To determine whether an LLM can intentionally generate content-related humor, Llama 3.1 was prompted to produce humorous responses across five subcategories, namely: jokes, examples, stories, sarcasm, and creative language. The model was instructed to respond humorously while aligning with the specific humor subcategory prompted. To evaluate this capability, a classifier was trained, linguistic metrics were analyzed, and a human evaluation was conducted on the generated responses. The findings indicate that the LLM successfully adapts to the humor subcategories through targeted prompting, demonstrating its ability to generate a distinct form of content-related humor."

    "abstract": "With the widespread application of large language models, numerous approaches have been proposed to enhance their performance. Most existing works focus on general-purpose tasks. Although some domain-specific approaches have emerged, they typically rely on enriching LLMs’ knowledge through additional training or retrieving external information, without effectively leveraging internal knowledge or balancing it with external sources. To address this, we propose a framework that operates effectively with only a few representative training samples (no more than one order of magnitude) to adapt to specialized tasks. This method is well-suited for scenarios with limited data, where fine-tuning is infeasible. Our method first adopts LLM-generated few-shot examples from training set, involving Chain-of-Thought, to maximize the utilization of internal knowledge. Then, uncertainty-guided retrieval-augmented generation is employed to selectively incorporate external information. This method balances internal and external knowledge, thereby reducing hallucinations arising from knowledge gap and errors caused by inaccurate retrieved context. Our method is compared with several representative, general-purpose methods on domain-specific datasets (law and finance). Experimental results show that our approach outperforms existing training-free, general-purpose methods across most tasks."

Existing research has mostly focused on the scheduling of electrolyzer clusters themselves, addressing the optimal power allocation problem within the clusters, but has not fully explored the potential of energy storage to improve the overall utilization efficiency of electrolyzer clusters. Additionally, there is a lack of research on the coordinated scheduling of energy storage and electrolyzer clusters. This paper proposes a coordinated scheduling method for electrolyzer clusters and energy storage battery packs, which fully considers the dynamic characteristics and start-stop behavior of electrolyzers. The proposed algorithm is validated through a case study involving 18 electrolyzers and 3 energy storage batteries. Research results demonstrate that the proposed scheduling method can be effectively applied to the coordinated operation of large-scale electrolyzer clusters and battery systems. Frequent charging and discharging of batteries can effectively mitigate the volatility of renewable energy sources and enhance the overall utilization efficiency of electrolyzer clusters."

    "abstract": "Robotics education faces challenges due to limited access to physical laboratories and the complexity of teaching abstract concepts. In response, technologies such as Augmented Reality (AR) and gamification have emerged as promising strategies to enhance student engagement and knowledge retention. However, their application in robotics education, particularly for first-year engineering students, remains limited. To address this gap, a Level 2 augmented reality gamified system was developed to introduce essential concepts of mobile and manipulator robots. Results from the implementation indicate that students who engaged with the AR system achieved significantly better learning outcomes, with an average improvement of $17.98 \\%$ in their scores compared to those instructed through traditional methods. Furthermore, an evaluation based on the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) revealed that perceived usefulness and enjoyment significantly influenced students’ intention to continue using the system. These findings highlight the practical value of integrating AR and gamification into robotics education, as they transform conventional engineering education into a more accessible, engaging, and interactive experience.

However, their internal operation process remain black-box as the models increase in size. Therefore, the influence of background knowledge during their operational process is not well explored. In this paper, we propose a novel testing method that evaluates the influence of such background knowledge on VQA tasks through precisely controlled datasets. By isolating visual and textual information, we analyze how background knowledge affects the model’s judgments in each modality. The proposed method enables systematic analysis of this phenomenon and provides insights for enhancing VLM performance."

    "abstract": "The rapid proliferation of distributed edge and fog computing infrastructures has significantly enhanced real-time data processing and service responsiveness. Nevertheless, these environments' decentralized characteristics and heterogeneous architectures make them vulnerable to complex and dynamic cyber attacks, which traditional IDSs can't detect effectively. Problem Statement: traditional IDS models do not adjust well to entropy variance as they shift across multi-layered environments, resulting in a loss of detection accuracy and an increased false alarm rate. Proposed Approach: In this article, we propose an Entropy-Driven Intrusion Detection Algorithm (EDIA) for distributed edge-fog-centers. EDIA utilizes information entropy and temporal correlations of network traffic flows to detect anomalous behaviors. The approach merges information theory with a hybrid detection engine that combines the Shannon Entropy Analysis (SEA) and state-of-theart frameworks, such as the lightweight Deep Residual Network (L-DRN), to support adaptive thresholding. Results: The evaluation of multi-layered real-world edge-fog benchmark data shows that EDIA achieves a 97.4% detection rate, 2.1% false-positive rate, and 21 % compute overhead reduction relative to EdgeIDS and FogGuard. Conclusion: we propose a practical, scalable, lightweight, and low-latency IDS framework for distributed edge-fog environments, improving the security resilience of edge-fog computing ecosystems."

However, reflective surfaces like mirrors pose a challenge for LiDAR, making it difficult to distinguish between objects in front and behind a mirror and their reflected counterparts. In this paper, we propose the Shadow Boxing Method, a technique for effectively classifying reflected points that appear to be behind the mirror. We will differentiate reflected points from points behind the mirror, and further restore these identified points to their original 3D locations by accurately detecting the relative position of the mirror and the angle of reflections. This will overcome the existing limitations of LiDAR sensors, enabling more accurate sensing. We envision that our idea can potentially improve the safety of LiDAR-based autonomous vehicles even when confronted with highly reflective surfaces such as traffic safety mirrors."

    "abstract": "The rapid proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies in today's electronic society has raised pressing concerns about personal data privacy. Existing audit frameworks for traditional IT systems do not adequately address the unique challenges posed by IoT environments, including continuous data collection, device heterogeneity, and limited user interfaces. Moreover, most IoT systems lack auditability by design, and no standardised mechanisms exist to assess compliance with data privacy principles. To address this gap, we developed a privacyaware IoT audit framework using Grounded Theory Analysis. In-depth interviews were conducted with ten professionals from Indonesia, a newly industrialized country that recently enacted a Personal Data Protection Law, comprising IT auditors and cybersecurity experts, to extract insights from real-world practices. Through a structured coding process (open, axial, and selective), we developed a modular framework comprising seven components: Risk Assessment, Governance, Asset Management, Security Controls, Privacy Controls, Incident Management, and Compliance Assessment. Our findings reveal that privacy considerations are frequently overlooked in current IoT audit practices. The proposed framework offers a systematic and empirically grounded approach to evaluating personal data protection in IoT systems. By embedding regulatory compliance and auditability into its design, this paper addresses a key shortcoming in current audit standards and contributes to stronger, more accountable data privacy governance in connected digital ecosystems."

    "source": "IEEE",
    "abstract": "Software defect prediction is an important task in software engineering because it helps identify defective modules early and reduces maintenance costs. However, the imbalanced nature of datasets often causes classification models to be biased toward the majority class while neglecting the minority class. This study aims to address this issue by applying Cluster-Based Resampling (CBR) and evaluating its effectiveness compared to baseline models. Secondary data were obtained from the NASA Metrics Data Program (MDP). Three classification algorithms were employed, namely Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF), and Gradient Boosting (GB), evaluated using Accuracy, Area Under the Curve (AUC), Recall, F1-Score, and G-Mean with the <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{1 0}$</tex>-fold cross-validation technique. The results show that before applying CBR, the models had high accuracy and AUC, for example LR achieved an accuracy of 0.99 on MC1 and GB achieved an AUC of 0.97 on PC5, but the recall and G-Mean values were very low, such as LR recall of only 0.02 and G-Mean of 0.15 on CM1. After applying CBR, although accuracy slightly decreased (e.g., CBR-LR only 0.84 on MC1), model performance significantly improved in other metrics, such as CBR-GB with a recall of 0.74 on PC1, an F1-score of 0.87 on MC1, and a G-Mean of up to 0.91 on PC5, while AUC remained stable in the range of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$0.80-0.94$</tex>. These findings confirm that CBR is effective in reducing class imbalance and producing fairer and more representative evaluation. In practical terms, CBR can be integrated into software development pipelines or continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) workflows to enhance defect prediction models, enabling teams to detect high-risk modules earlier, automate quality checks, and optimize testing efforts in real-world industrial environments."

    "abstract": "A crucial aspect of the employee career ladder is data privacy, which guarantees the secure management of employee personal information in compliance with applicable regulations. Proper data management not only protects employees from potential misuse of information but also maintains the company's reputation. The system used for career ladders currently does not provide transparent information about employee ladders and does not guarantee the privacy of their data. So employees cannot have accurate information to file complaints if their careers are not targeted. The purpose of this research is to develop a hybrid blockchain model that integrates a private blockchain for storing employee privacy data and a public blockchain for the verification process and transaction storage. All nodes on the blockchain network will validate every transaction related to employee career ladders to ensure transparency and validation of information. The research method employs a qualitative approach that includes both a literature review and model simulation. According to the research, employee privacy data can be kept on a private blockchain network, and transactions can be checked by employees using a public blockchain. The conclusion is shown by a proposed model and a prototype built with Hyperledger Fabric."

Instead of using M modulators for an M×M kernel in our earlier approach, a single modulator is required, which greatly simplifies the system implementation. Experimental evaluation using the MNIST and Fashion MNIST datasets demonstrates that for a 2×2 kernel, the proposed simplified MWPCA achieves a twofold speed enhancement, delivering 102.4 giga operations per second (GOPS) processing capability."

Inspired by neuroscience, particularly the role of \"time cells\" in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, we introduce the Temporal Cognitive Notebook (TCN): a novel architecture that integrates adaptive computation, temporally structured memory, and entropy-based metacognitive control. The TCN enables LLMs to dynamically allocate reasoning resources and monitor progress over time, promoting more patient and context-aware reasoning. Theoretical analyses and preliminary evaluations suggest that embedding temporal cognition could bridge a fundamental gap between human and artificial reasoning."

Considering these shortcomings, this paper covers SpyderCrawl a Dark Web Marketplace Intelligence Platform which collects bio-hacking and illicit trade information in bulk, divides and examines the information. The suggested model unveils, with the help of smart crawling of the key-words, organized data mining, and graphical dependency analysis, the latent relationships among different vendors, merchandise, and clusters of threats. To this end, SpyderCrawl is developed on a modular Python, Scrapy, and MongoDB architecture to be able to detect trends continuously and associate activities across several domains.

    "abstract": "With the increasing complexity of wireless communication systems, deep neural network (DNN) based channel estimation has become essential for 5G and beyond networks. However, adapting these models to different environments while maintaining parameter efficiency remains challenging. Due to the practical difficulties of collecting diverse real-world channel data across multiple environments—including cost, reproducibility, and privacy constraints—we utilize 3GPP-compliant channel models to systematically evaluate parameter-efficient transfer learning methods. This paper presents the first comprehensive comparison between Adapter and Low-Rank Adaptation (Lo-RA) methods for DNN-based channel estimation. We evaluate both approaches on Indoor Factory (InF) and Rural Macro (RMa) environments using transformer-based architectures at two parameter scales: initial efficient settings (20k vs 27k parameters) and scaled configurations (131k vs 133k parameters) for fair comparison. Our experimental results demonstrate that LoRA consistently achieves superior performance across both parameter scales, providing up to 1.97 dB NMSE improvement in challenging scenarios. The parameter scaling analysis reveals that while both methods benefit from increased capacity, LoRA maintains better efficiency and demonstrates superior adaptation to rural environments compared to indoor scenarios, likely due to the base model’s comprehensive multi-environment training. Additionally, cross-domain experiments using LoRA show consistent adaptability across diverse environment pairs. The lightweight nature of these methods enables real-time inference and deployment in O-RAN edge computing environments, providing crucial insights for industry practitioners seeking efficient model deployment in resource-constrained wireless systems."

    "source": "IEEE",
    "abstract": "With the ever-growing population of interconnected devices and data traffic over next-generation networks, the need to have communication infrastructures that are sustainable and energy efficient is more than ever before. Green communication networks are a new paradigm of energy consumption with reduced performance and reliability in place of energy consumption. Still, it is a massive task to optimize energy consumption and guarantee adaptability in changing network environments in real-time. To address this issue, this study proposes an Adaptive Fuzzy Logic-Driven Predictive Analytics (AFL-PA) framework that is specially designed to enhance the energy efficiency of green communication networks. The proposed AFL-PA model optimizes routing, regulates transmission power, and dynamically balances network load in a synergy of predictive analytics and decision control based on fuzzy logic. The system is based on effective context-aware learning and real-time monitoring of traffic so as to predict any variation in energy consumption and take proactive measures in a network to minimize the power wastage without affecting the QoS. Simulated large-scale network tests indicate that AFL-PA is more energy efficient than traditional heuristic and static optimization techniques. Energy efficiency ranges from 70.8% to 90.1%, latency from 38.9 ms to 60.1 ms, throughput from 16.8 Mbps to 26.1 Mbps, and packet delivery ratio from 88.5% to 97.0%. The adaptive fuzzy inference process will ensure sound decision-making even in a non-linear and uncertain network environment. Lastly, allowing modern communication systems to be sustainable in the management of energy, the AFL-PA framework offers a smart, scaled, and selfoptimizing solution. This brings in smarter and stronger network infrastructures that are green-friendly."

    "abstract": "Vine robots offer unique capabilities for navigating confined environments through growth via eversion, making them suitable for urban search and rescue operations. Prior research has demonstrated the potential of vine robots to deploy passive payloads or mobile agents for distributed mapping and exploration. However, existing deployment methods rely on passive delivery, pushing payloads toward the robot tip during growth, thus limiting control over deployment timing and location. In this work, we introduce a compact wireless gate mechanism designed to achieve controlled payload deployment within the vine robot. This mechanism operates by selectively constricting the vine’s inner sleeve, securely retaining payloads and releasing them upon receiving a remote command. Fully integrated into the robot’s structure, the gate allows unimpeded vine growth and supports wireless communication with an external mobile controller. Experiments with benchtop and integrated vine robots show that the gate remains co-located with the tip and enables on-command hold and release without impeding eversion. The gate supports sequential delivery of multiple payloads and can deploy irregular payloads by preparing specific accommodations. These results establish timed, location-accurate deployment for USAR scenarios while keeping vine robot hardware composition regular."

To improve the efficiency and resolution of localization, we utilize a digital twin (DT) that mimics the real environment, enabling CSI acquisition on a finer reference position grid without physical constraints. In the proposed localization framework, CSI samples are collected from both the real environment and the DT. We also propose a linear transformation to align the virtual CSI with real measurements. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach improves localization accuracy while reducing the time and effort required for extensive offline data collection, highlighting the effectiveness of combining CSI-based fingerprinting with digital twin technology."

    "abstract": "5G networks provide high-speed data transfer, ultra-low latency, and large-scale connectivity, making them suitable for a wide range of industrial applications. Despite these advantages, 5G networks face new challenges in network management and optimization due to the increasing complexity of heterogeneous network components, massive device connectivity, and dynamic service requirements. LLMs (Large Language Models) offer a promising approach to address these challenges due to their outstanding capabilities in language understanding and data processing. This paper reviews the latest applications of LLMs in 5G networks and specifically focuses on resource allocation, QoS (Quality of Service), anomaly detection, and automated network configuration. It analyzes research studies using models such as GPT-3.5, Llama2, and Mobile LLAMA and evaluates how LLMs contribute to maximizing efficiency and performance in 5G environments."

    "abstract": "For vision tasks, deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are only effective when there are enough data, which may be hard to get or very expensive. Although transfer learning offers some hope through knowledge transfer from similar domains; nevertheless, it is prone to domain adaptation gaps and catastrophic interference while being applied on unrelated data distributions. In this paper, we propose a Coupled End-to-End Transfer Learning (CETL) framework that directly couples source and target CNNs through a shared decoder, enabling bidirectional knowledge transfer while preserving task-specific specialization. A generalization bound that links target error to source performance and coupling strength theoretically justifies the introduction of a novel coupled loss function. We use Generalized Fisher Information (GFI), which dynamically distributes weights among tasks to prevent catastrophic forgetting, to further stabilize optimization. Extensive research on MNIST, USPS, SVHN, CIFAR-10/100, STL-10, and ImageNet subsets are examples of benchmark datasets that show that CETL attains outstanding results in domain adaptation, knowledge distillation, and transfer learning. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness and adaptability of CETL as a framework for practical transfer learning applications."

    "abstract": "The increased need for smart biomediacl wearable sensors. integrated Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) sensors poses increased challenges to System-on-Chip (SoC) architectures within varying temperature gradients. Within these small enclosed systems, thermal variations cause drifts in sensor readings, degrade signal quality, and impair energy utilization. Consequently, systems lose their long-term operational dependability posing a challenge to their incorporation in biomedical wearable sensors. This paper addresses these concerns and proposes a Hybrid Thermal Equilibrium and Predictive Reconfiguration Algorithm (HTEPRA) which is a newly designed SoC aimed at optimized thermal stability within MEMS biomedical wearable sensors. While standard approaches employ static control at each level, HTEPRA innovatively integrates a control dual layered system comprising a predictive-thermal controller based on machine learning algorithms, coupled disposal hardware freedoms, and thermal override control switches. The predictive controller uses real-time readings and historical data to create and adjust thermal profiles. The controller coupled with disposal hardware freedoms dynamically recalibrates and reconfigures the computational loads to maintain thermal equilibrium. HTEPRA performs better than existing thermal-aware SoC methods with 35% lower thermal drift, 25% higher energy efficiency, and 18% higher sensing accuracy on a custom built MEMS-biology platform. This hybrid has operational stability without real time degrade, responsiveness, or miniature volume loss."

    "abstract": "Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a key paradigm for enhancing the capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) in educational applications, such as intelligent tutoring systems and knowledge-based Q&A platforms. However, existing retrieval precision models often fail to adequately account for the ranking of retrieved knowledge, which critically influences the quality and factual consistency of educational content generated by LLMs. To address this gap, this paper proposes a Rank-aware Retrieval Precision Modeling and Calculation Method. We introduce the Weighted Context Precision (WCP) and its computationally efficient variant, Simplified Weighted Context Precision (SWCP), which incorporate rank-sensitive weighting and multi-level relevance scoring to better reflect the impact of retrieval ranking on educational content generation. A multi-agent experimental environment, including a virtual educational data generation system and an LLM-based scoring framework, was designed to systematically evaluate the proposed models while mitigating the influence of LLMs' parametric knowledge. Experimental results demonstrate that SWCP achieves a significantly stronger correlation with LLMs response quality compared to traditional models like IDCP, reducing Mean Squared Error (MSE) by 61.8% and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) by 38.7% on average. The proposed method provides a practical, automated evaluation tool for optimizing retrieval and re-ranking strategies in educational RAG systems, thereby enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of knowledge delivery in digital learning environments."

The CAD Transformer leverages temporal context and attention mechanisms to model compression sequences, outperforming traditional models including Kelvin-Voigt, Maxwell, and CNN baselines. Quantitatively, the model reduced stiffness estimation RMSE by up to 60 % and achieved force prediction errors under 5N.

The system allows operators without robotics expertise to issue natural language voice commands to autonomous UGVs, ensuring their safe and context-aware navigation based on real-time mission data. The proposed ROS 2-based communication architecture integrates UGVs into existing SAR command hierarchies, featuring robust methods for message acknowledgment, prioritization, and operational window synchronization that enable effective coordination between human teams and autonomous robots. During the XIX Workshop on Security, Emergencies, and Catastrophes (Málaga, Spain), over 150 first responders participated in six parallel SAR missions, with some teams providing their real-time positional data via equipment-integrated sensors. The LLM-MAS used this data to make autonomous decisions on the ground, such as determining which SAR team the UGV should assist, and then sent the selected target location to an external path planner through a tool call. The planner generated a route to the target, which the UGV followed while its movements were monitored in real time through a web interface. The system successfully executed material transport tasks across three critical service routes that supported the six parallel missions. Direct feedback from first responders confirmed that our system improved mission efficiency and was praised for its intuitive, responsive performance in coordinated decision-making."

However, the impact of NS has not been systematically explored. In this paper, we investigate how the number of negative triples per positive triple affects the performance of KGC models. Experiments on four state-of-the-art models reveal the following findings: (1) NS consistently improves performance; (2) the performance gain diminishes as more negatives are used, with excessive negatives sometimes degrading model performance; and (3) sensitivity varies across KGC models, indicating that the optimal number of negatives is model-dependent. These insights provide practical guidance for designing more effective negative sampling strategies in KGC."

Although unimodal physiological signals, such as EEG or ECG, are widely used, they often provide limited information, leading to suboptimal classification performance. To address this limitation, we proposed an efficient modality fusion framework that leverages multimodal physiological signals for cognitive load classification. The framework can extract features from EEG and ECG signals using parallel 1D convolutional layers and ResNet-Style blocks, followed by self-attention to refine intramodality dependencies and cross-attention to capture complementary inter-modality interactions. Experiments on the CL-Drive public benchmark dataset evaluated the framework’s performance under both binary and ternary classification settings, using 10-fold cross-validation and leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) protocols. The proposed framework consistently outperformed conventional machine learning models and state-of-the-art deep learning approaches, achieving accuracies of 85.69% (10-fold CV) and 76.26% (LOSO) for binary classification, and 78.79% (10-fold CV) and 63.68% (LOSO) for ternary classification. These results highlight the importance of attention-based multimodal fusion for robust cognitive load estimation, suggesting its strong potential for applications in intelligent transportation systems and brain–computer interface development."

The proposed V-byOne TX-PLL PHY with full-rate <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$6-\\text{GHz}, 1.8 ~\\mathrm{V}$</tex> IO-supply ROVCO was fabricated in 8 nm FinFET technology node and achieves a 50 % lower total jitter compared to its previous generation in presence of multi-lane, multi-PHYs with shared power supply domains. The proposed solution has successfully addressed the power-supply noise at product level."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel approach to mm-W quadrature differentially controlled dual superharmonic injected digitally controlled oscillator (QDCO). Dual-harmonic injection is adopted to reduce phase noise and improve spectral efficiency. The proposed oscillator supports a frequency range from 26.2 GHz to 32.5 GHz. The simulated results show cutting-edge results with phase noise around -125.38 dBc/Hz at 1 MHz and a jitter of 18.23 fs. This is accomplished with each oscillator core consuming only 5.96 mW of power, operating on a 1.2 V supply. These results thus confirm the QDCO has superior phase noise performance and frequency stability, which support its utilization for use in advanced wireless and radar applications with high performance low-jitter RF systems, requiring accurate timing and signal integrity."

Manual annotation is both labor-intensive and error-prone, often leading to inconsistencies in ground truth data. To address this challenge, we present a synthetic depth maps creation mechanism based on procedurally generated RGB images. The proposed approach simulates diverse scenes by varying object placement, illumination, and camera parameters to produce photorealistic RGB data along with corresponding depth and distance maps. All generated outputs are stored in HDF5 format to ensure efficient data handling and large-scale usability. This mechanism enables the automatic generation of high-quality annotations, significantly reducing manual effort. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that models trained on the resulting synthetic dataset achieve strong performance in object detection and distance estimation tasks, highlighting the effectiveness of the proposed method in supporting depth-aware computer vision applications."

    "abstract": "Cybercrime, characterized by anonymity and decentralized operations, presents major challenges in identifying suspects, uncovering hidden accomplice ties, and dismantling organizational structures. Traditional investigative methods often fail when explicit connections are absent, and early analytical approaches based on simple similarity metrics lead to significant information loss. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel unsupervised learning framework centered on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Our approach begins by constructing a 3-layer heterogeneous graph that models entities as distinct node types: persons, cases, and identifiers (e.g., bank accounts, IP addresses), preserving the rich context of investigative data. The GNN then directly learns deep relational patterns from the graph's structure. This enables: (1) latent link prediction to uncover hidden relationships, (2) community detection on learned embeddings to identify criminal organizations, and (3) a comprehensive risk assessment that integrates network centrality with GNN-derived node importance scores. By effectively modeling the intrinsic complexity of the data, our framework provides investigators with objective, quantitative evidence to prioritize targets and enhance strategic decision-making."

In his paper the author mentions very important risk-reduction techniques such as threat intelligence, threat assessment models, encryption and access control systems. It also brings out the importance of machine learning (ML) in enhancing the threat detection and response capabilities. To ensure that their organizations are secure, they must implement a multi-layered security solution that is proactive and incorporates the most current security techniques as well as regulatory compliance and staff awareness of their organizations. In addition, regular security check, incident management and follow-up will help in the reduction of risk and business continuity. Threats on the internet have always been changing and to ensure that the networks are made more secure, organizations must continuously adjust to them with the assistance of the latest cybersecurity technologies. This study provides an understanding of the most effective ways of managing risks, which can be applied by organizations to develop strong security systems in a virtual world that is highly interconnected and risky."

To meet this balance of competing demands, this paper proposed an explainable and Privacy-preserving IDS (PIDs) framework that combines lightGBM classifier optimized with an Optuna based hyperparameter search and SHAP-based feature attribution techniques with differential privacy mechanisms. The performance of this framework has been evaluated on the CICIDS2017 benchmark dataset with over 2.83 million instances and 79 features and has produced an F1 score of 0.894, indicating a good ability to classify multiple classes accurately. The model demonstrates an ability to withstand adversarial perturbations, maintaining its accuracy of 82 % at (ϵ = 0.1 (under the Fast Gradient Sign Method); thus, demonstrating robustness. Finally, this framework achieves a very high degree of trade-off between the privacy and utility of a differential privacy budget (91.2% accuracy at (ϵ = 1.0). The findings presented in this paper support the feasibility of creating robust, explainable, and compliant IDS systems that incorporate the principles of privacy protection and cybersecurity as they relate to modern data protection standards."

We train a denoising neural network offline on simulated realizations from a single baseline channel scenario and evaluate the pre-trained model—without adaptation—across multiple online deployment environments. When the deployment environment aligns with the training scenario, the denoiser provides the strongest gains; however, under distribution shift (e.g., differing delay/Doppler characteristics or signal-to-noise ratio regimes), estimation accuracy degrades, revealing limited cross-scenario generalization. These findings highlight the sensitivity of DL-based denoising to channel mismatch and motivate further investigation into online robustness to sustain performance in dynamic wireless settings."

Two deep learning architectures-Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-are implemented in MATLAB to classify RFID data and support grade-based learning. The models are evaluated based on accuracy and loss function metrics to determine the most effective classification approach. Experimental results indicate that the LSTM model outperforms CNN in classifying RFID data for student performance evaluation. The finding suggest that LSTM is the most suitable choice for student performance classification, offering improved accuracy while reducing the need of extensive data preprocessing."

However, due to its wireless nature, this technology is vulnerable to various security threats, including eavesdropping, message modification, and multiplexing attacks. To address these challenges, Munilla et al. (2020) proposed a 5G-Compliant Authentication Protocol for RFID, which is claimed to be able to withstand passive, active, and replay attacks. However, this claim is based only on informal analysis without formal proof. In this study, a formal analysis of Munilla's protocol was conducted using ProVerif, a symbolic verification tool based on applied pi-calculus used for security protocol analysis. The verification results indicate potential key leaks, message modification, and failure of certain property authentication. To address these weaknesses, an improved scheme is proposed by adding an HMAC function and refining the KSEAF derivation process. The results of the reanalysis using ProVerif indicate that the improved scheme can improve the level of security and resilience to attacks."

    "abstract": "Despite the growing attention given to applicants' reactions to the utilization of artificial intelligence (AI) within organizational recruitment contexts, scholars have paid little attention to the emotional mechanism between AI decision-making (especially negative) and applicants' procedural justice perception, as well as how the perception affects their subsequent behavior. Drawing on the cognitive–functional model of discrete negative emotions, we propose and empirically test the effect of anger triggered by AI-driven negative hiring decisions on applicants' procedural justice perception and complaint behavior. General support for the model testing is obtained from two studies, namely, a laboratory experiment (N = 97) that uses technology for facial expression analysis (i.e., Face Reader 8.0) and an online scenario-based experiment (N = 270). The rigor of our findings is enhanced by collecting data from multiple participant sources, using FaceReader and self-reports in a complementary manner to measure anger, and by introducing control variables for robustness checks. We find that AI-driven negative decisions, rather than human-driven ones, elicit greater anger from applicants. Notably, this effect is weakened for applicants with extensive prior AI experience. Moreover, anger suppresses applicants' perceptions of procedural justice, thus yielding a distinct effect on their complaint behavior. Our study contributes to the understanding of the effect of AI-driven negative hiring decisions on applicants' emotional, cognitive, and behavioral reactions. It also sheds light on the influence of applicants' prior AI experience in reducing the negative effect of AI-driven negative hiring decisions on applicants' subsequent responses."

This technology facet facilitates data and service sharing among devices, creating a scalable network of socially interconnected devices. However, this rapid increase in device numbers and generated data has led to the challenge of data explosion. To address this challenge, service recommendation systems play a crucial role in improving network navigability and service discovery within the SIoT context. However, existing research often overlooks important aspects that could make service selection more pertinent and relevant. Specifically, current service recommendation approaches focus on extracting social relationships between devices while neglecting the contextual presentation of service reviews. In this research, we introduce a service recommendation framework for SIoT context that integrates service-review aggregation and feature learning processes by utilizing the Factorization Machines to capture complex feature interactions unique to each SIoT device-service pair. Empirical results across three benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed CASR-SIoT framework consistently outperforms state of-the-art baselines, achieving up to 14% improvement in Recall, 8%inPrecision, and 15% reduction in RMSE, thereby validating its effectiveness in delivering accurate and context-aware service recommendations in SIoT environments."

    "abstract": "Automated floor plan generation aims to create residential layouts by arranging rooms within a given boundary, balancing topological, geometric, and aesthetic considerations. The existing methods typically use a multi-step pipeline with intermediate representations to decompose the prediction process into several sub-tasks, limiting model flexibility and imposing predefined solution paths. This often results in unreasonable outputs when applied to data unsuitable for these predefined paths, making it challenging for these methods to match human designers, who do not restrict themselves to a specific set of design workflows. To address these limitations, we introduce CE2EPlan, a controllable end-to-end topology- and geometryenhanced diffusion model, that removes restrictions on the generative process of AI design tools. Instead, it enables the model to learn how to design floor plans directly from data, capturing a wide range of solution paths from input boundaries to complete layouts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method surpasses all existing approaches using the multi-step pipeline, delivering higher-quality results with enhanced user control and greater diversity in output, bringing AI design tools closer to the versatility of human designers."

    "abstract": "The performance of coherence analysis system (CAS) is critically dependent on phase accuracy. Most advanced phase unwrapping (PU) algorithms are designed for two-dimensional (2D) problem, but data from various interferometric systems are typically acquired as one-dimensional (1D) time series. The 1D PU problem is more challenging since it suffers more seriously from noise and the available adjacent points are severely restricted compared to the 2D case. To address the prevalent challenge of 1D phase noise with a skewed non-zero-mean distribution, this paper introduces a novel fourier decomposition-based phase-processing technique (FDPT). The FDPT procedure begins with a fast fourier transform (FFT) of the original noisy phase signal. The frequency spectrums of them are then divided into sub-bands, which undergo a flatness evaluation to identify and extract the dominant frequency components. The inverse FFT (IFFT) is applied to each phase component, converting them back for individual processing using the adaptive non-local (NL) filtering algorithm. Finally, the sub-phase components are coherently summed, and followed by PU methods to reconstruct the phase. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed FDPT over conventional methods, confirming improvements in waveform similarity and a reduction in root mean square error."

Most multimodal classification algorithms aggregate information from different modalities into a unified representation to capture the holistic information. However, existing fusion mechanisms overly rely on high-quality data, which compromises the robustness of the model. Meanwhile, the fusion process can cause the loss of modality-specific information due to inherent modality differences. In this work, we propose a trustworthy cyclic progressive fusion method for multimodal classification, named TCPFMC. To enhance robustness and reduce reliance on high-quality data, we designed a modality energy score to evaluate the confidence of each modality, quantifying the informativeness of the modalities. In addition, for efficient integration of modality-specific information, we propose a novel cyclic progressive fusion approach that combines modality information at a fine-grained level, enhancing the overall performance of the model. Extensive experiments on six multimodal datasets show that TCPFMC outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

First, a practical PT velocity observer (PTVO) is designed to estimate unmeasurable velocity information, which is then employed in the design of the guidance law and controller. At the kinematic level, a cooperative guidance law based on aperiodic intermittent communication is developed for synchronized path following, effectively saving communication resources. At the dynamic level, an aperiodic intermittent controller incorporating neural networks (NNs) is designed to approximate unmodeled dynamics and effectively avoid continuous operation of actuators with input saturation. Meanwhile, the intermittent adaptive law is constructed to estimate the optimal weights of the NNs, thereby reducing their complexity. The closed-loop system is verified to converge to a residual set within a PT interval. Finally, we conduct numerical simulations to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms."

While brain–computer interfaces (BCIs) offer alternative control pathways, traditional paradigms (SSVEP/P300) suffer from stimulus dependency, high latency, and cognitive fatigue, limiting real-world deployment. This study presents a novel asynchronous motor imagery-BCI system for hands-free robotic platform navigation, integrating cognitive ergonomics principles to enhance operator experience. We developed an intuitive four-command control paradigm using a cascaded classifier architecture, eliminating dependence on external triggers. Key innovations include: 1) sub-100 ms ultralow-latency pipeline via hybrid feature fusion and ensemble learning; 2) stimulus-independent operation leveraging endogenous sensorimotor cortex activation (μ/β-band); and 3) cognitive load-optimized interaction with ROS-based neurofeedback and NASA-TLX-validated ergonomic design. Evaluated on BCI Competition IV 2a dataset (nine subjects) and self-collected high-resolution electroencephalography data (seven subjects), the system achieved 72.15% offline classification accuracy and 95.36% online command execution success rate with 97ms mean computational latency. NASA-TLX evaluation revealed a 32% reduction in cognitive workload compared to synchronous paradigms. This work establishes a framework for cognitively enhanced mobility assistance, advancing practical brain-controlled assistive technologies."

    "abstract": "Since the emergence of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), researchers have extensively investigated training on large-scale GNN training because of their success and wide usage in various domains including biological networks, finance, and recommendation systems. This work focuses on training large-scale distributed GNNs, where partitioning massive graphs across multiple machines creates remote communication overhead that becomes a major scalability bottleneck. We introduce a policy-driven caching mechanism that prioritizes node features and embeddings based on access frequency and cross-partition fetch cost, significantly minimizing communication overhead without sacrificing accuracy. Our policies are based on analysis of Node Affinities (NAFs) during multi-hop neighborhood sampling that extend substantially beyond the graph partition boundaries. Analyzing NAFs not only alleviates the communication bottleneck but also provides a systematic mechanism to manage in-memory data effectively, prioritizing GPU storage for node features with high fetch latency. We present FLARE, a system designed to handle partitioned feature data while leveraging the NAF-based caching policy. FLARE substantially reduces both communication overhead and training convergence time. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that training FLARE on a three-layer GCN, GAT, and GraphSAGE across eight GPU machines achieves up to 12.04× (8.12× on average) speedup over DistDGLv2, demonstrating substantial performance gains compared to state-of-the-art methods."

    "abstract": "Unsupervised domain adaptive object detection methods enhance model robustness in the target domain without requiring target-domain annotations. Despite notable progress, existing methods face two major challenges: 1) insufficient and inefficient learning of holistic feature consistency due to cumbersome pixel-level style matching and semantic discrepancy elimination between domains as well as the overlooking of their collaborative effect, and 2) unreliable learning of category feature compactness caused by poor-quality target-domain samples, inaccurate pseudo-labels and noisy cross-domain contrast paradigms. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Semantic Consistency and Compactness Learning (SCCL) network. For consistency learning, we introduce a Visual Adaptation-guided Semantic Alignment (VSA) module that achieves style matching through simple feature adaptation and incorporates a novel adversarial-free self-supervised method for feature disentanglement. The collaboration between these two aspects enables sufficient and efficient consistency learning. For reliable compactness learning, we develop a plug-and-play Instance Center-Contrastive (ICC) head that, for the first time, comprehensively addresses all three potential causes of unreliable learning through three integrated innovations, concerning sample pseudo-label quality enhancement, reliable sample storage and updating, and a robust sample contrast paradigm. Besides, the mutual reinforcement effect of VSA and ICC simultaneously enhances feature transferability and discriminability. Extensive experiments across four UDA object detection benchmarks with two baselines show that SCCL achieves superior adaptability and robustness."

This study conducted an exploratory analysis to evaluate the effectiveness of four commonly used online anonymity techniques such as internet browser incognito mode (Chrome incognito mode), proxy, VPN, and TOR in blocking, deceiving, or detecting browser fingerprints. With a sample of 30 devices, the analysis results show that browser fingerprints are still detected by www.deviceinfo.me on Chrome incognito mode (28 devices), KPROXY (16 devices), and SecurityKISS VPN (15 devices). Conversely, TOR is proven to be the most effective online anonymity technique with only 5 devices detected.

The reliability of the pre-test, measured by Cronbach’s $\\alpha$, was 0.942, indicating good reliability. Through a T-test statistical analysis, it was found that there were no significant differences in the ESM of students before and after using MR for virtual hands-on activities, nor were there significant differences in the improvement scores of the ESM and the six dimensions of different genders. However, regression analysis showed that higher pre-test scores in PE, CQ, and BI were associated with better post-test ESM. Conversely, EE, IT, and PI did not significantly impact post-test ESM. It is hoped that the results of this study can provide a reference for the design of future augmented reality-related teaching materials."

A response-caching layer has been introduced in this work that stores model outputs and serves them on future requests when the incoming query matches a past query with a user-driven semantic similarity, for instance: ≥90%. Queries are embedded and normalized (lower-casing, stop-word handling, punctuation and whitespace canonicalization) to produce cache keys; nearest-neighbor search retrieves candidates, which are re-ranked by cosine similarity and lightweight intent features. If the top candidate exceeds the 90% or any set threshold score, and passes validators, its stored answer from the cache repository are returned; otherwise the request falls back to live generation and the cache is updated. We outline an evaluation protocol measuring latency reduction, cost savings, and consistency of cached response (exact cache, semantic and causal matches) versus fresh LLM generations (manual and task metrics), and analyze threshold–precision/recall trade-offs. Mitigation of the flaws of simple semantic matches (cosine similarity) are discussed with the introduction of a causal verification in the response caching layer. This simple architecture yields a practical path to faster, cheaper, and more stable chatbot behavior while preserving answer quality through freshness and safety gates."

It helps in detecting the patients’ conditions and deadly diseases at an early stage and help them to recover at a faster rate. This analysis method includes gathering a large amount of information regarding the patients’ past health records, current symptoms, and the surroundings in which the user lives. In addition to this information, it also collects information from wearable gadgets like smart watches and other medical equipment using tools like decision trees and neural networks. But these tools often struggle with the unstructured and unpredictable nature of the healthcare records and data. Here comes the use of our proposed method that overcomes this problem by using better ways to handle features and AI- powered tools for sorting out that unstructured information. It takes detailed information about the patient, like their surroundings, present condition, whether they are someone who travels a lot, or whether their family has any hereditary issues, that is, genetic issues and all to make much precise prediction. The AI algorithm helps by taking in all these details and cutting down the possibilities of what the patient might be suffering from. On top of that, this method will consistently keep tracking data from wearable gadgets, gives the algorithm more details about view of patient’s health condition. Combining these new features with the existing approaches helps in diagnosing more accurately by using medical history with habits, climate, and DNA. These changes aren’t just improving how we are able to easily detect diseases at an early stage, but they are also providing a way for healthcare professionals to quickly respond and focus on individuals."

These AI-driven prosthetics do require self-adjusting AI functions, as they utilize advances in data analysis and machine learning algorithms to detect the gait, and adjust for specific balance and movement in real-time when transitioning to different surfaces. Further advances in prosthetic knee designs provide the opportunity for the device to be interacted with and learned from, customizing the prosthesis based on the user's preferences and level of comfort. At the minimum, providing individuals with an autonomous opportunity to physically engage in greater amounts of activities can create positive feelings of self-worth. More importantly, these implementations support engagement in activities that physically elevate an individual beyond just physical mobility. This paper will investigate the value of developments in AI and augmented reality and designing more efficient, effective, and rudimentary prostheses that not only have enhanced capabilities of consideration for the end-user experience but may also enhance mobility and everyday living. The goal of the paper is to demonstrate a sustaining paradigm where choice is made readily available to everyone based on quality-of-life improvements related to mobility and autonomy.

However, conventional deep learning models, which operate in Euclidean space, often fail to capture the complex, inherently hierarchical structure of brain anatomy and its aging process. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that leverages the principles of hyperbolic geometry to address this limitation. We introduce a Hyperbolic Embedded Brain Age Estimator (HEBAE), which first extracts high-level features from T1-weighted MRI scans using a deep CNN backbone. It then embeds these features into a hyperbolic latent space (Poincaré ball), which is uniquely suited to representing hierarchical data with low distortion. We hypothesize that this geometry-aware representation allows the model to learn more robust and anatomically meaningful features of brain aging. To validate our approach, we trained our model on the public IXI dataset and compared its performance against an equivalent Euclidean baseline model. Experimental results show that our HE-BAE model achieves improved performance over the baseline in age prediction. This work pioneers the application of non-Euclidean geometry in 3D volumetric medical image analysis, offering a novel framework to discover hierarchical biomarkers and creating more efficient, anatomy-aware predictive models."

First, we use MMSE to estimate the received symbols. Then, we use a DNN to refine these estimates and reduce errors. The DNN takes the MMSE output as input and learns to predict the original signal more accurately. We test our method using both binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) and quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK) modulation in an OFDM system over different signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). Our results show that the MMSE + DNN approach gives lower bit error rates (BER) than using LS or MMSE alone. This shows that deep learning (DL) can help improve signal detection when used with traditional methods."

    "abstract": "Depression is a complex, multidimensional mental health disorder influenced by biological, psychological, and behavioral factors. Traditional diagnostic methods, such as clinical interviews and self-report questionnaires, remain limited by subjectivity and cultural bias. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI), wearable sensing, and immersive technologies have enabled objective, continuous, and multi- modal assessment of depression. This systematic review synthesizes findings from 24 peer-reviewed studies published between 2020 and 2024, examining the integration of physiological signals electroencephalography (EEG), electrocardiography (ECG), heart rate variability (HRV)with behavioral modalities such as speech, text, gaze tracking, and facial analysis, alongside augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR) frameworks for therapeutic engagement. The reviewed studies employed machine learning and deep learning architectures (CNNs, RNNs, transformers) and fusion strategies (early, intermediate, late) for multimodal data integration. Evidence indicates that multimodal fusion improves depression detection accuracy by 8–12% over unimodal systems. However, methodological gaps persist regarding dataset diversity, synchronization, clinical validation, and explainability. By consolidating trends in sensing, modeling, and AR/VR-based feedback, this review provides an evidence-based roadmap for the development of scalable, interpretable, and ethically aligned AI systems for next-generation mental health assessment and intervention."

    "abstract": "In many nations throughout the world, One of the most horrible diseases is lung cancer, and it's still challenging to detect it early. To evaluate the tumors, the oncologists take into account the results of blood tests and CT scans, which takes time and requires additional human labor. Therefore, in order to lower mortality, an automated system that effectively detects lung cancers and evaluates their severity should be created. Even though a number of researchers have put out methods for detecting lung diseases, the current methods still fall far short in terms of early-stage tumor detection accuracy. Therefore, our work proposes Lung-RetinaNet is a new and effective lung tumor detector based on RetinaNet. To simultaneously improve the semantic information from the shallow prediction layer, a multi-scale feature fusion-based module is proposed to merge many network layers. Additionally, by simply and lightweightly integrating contextual information with each network stage layer, the context module improves features and efficiently locates the small tumors. The suggested approach achieved 0.989 Auc, 99.8% accuracy, 99.3% recall, 99.4% precision, and 99.5% F1-score. The performance of our proposed model was compared to the state-of-the-art DL-based techniques. Our strategy produces more significant results than existing approaches, as the results show."

This paper introduces a real-time two-stage clustering method that couples a constraint-based preprocessing step with probabilistic clustering on a reduced feature set. The first stage suppresses noise and prunes features derived from delay, angle, and power-domain observations, yielding compact representations. The second stage conducts lightweight probabilistic assignment that accommodates residual uncertainty without strong prior assumptions. Experimental validation on measurement data indicates that the method further improves stability and suggests that real-time MPC classification can be achieved without sacrificing fidelity."

Detecting such behavior is challenging due to sparse AIS transmissions, noisy measurements, and the lack of labeled datasets. We propose an unsupervised framework that integrates trajectory reconstruction, adaptive segmentation, and anomaly detection to automatically label loitering segments without manual annotation. A Reconstructive Adaptive Extended Kalman Filter (R-AEKF) restores missing AIS points by modeling nonlinear vessel dynamics with adaptive noise estimation. Inter-adaptive sliding windows capture local kinematic and entropy features, which are clustered via HDBSCAN to isolate anomalous segments. Loitering behaviors are further verified using spectral and directional metrics. Experiments on real-world AIS data demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms threshold-based and supervised baselines, offering a scalable solution for Maritime Domain Awareness."

We present cnFlow, a sidecar-free, eBPF-based telemetry framework that provides low-overhead, context-rich observability for Kubernetes clusters. cnFlow attaches in-kernel eBPF programs to Traffic Control ingress/egress hooks on all pod and host interfaces, enabling real-time packet classification and export via lock-free ring buffers. In user space, it reconstructs higher-layer transactions, which are then enriched with Kubernetes metadata (e.g., namespace, service account, security context) and geolocation. Evaluations on a multi-protocol testbed show that cnFlow captures L3–L7 traffic (e.g., HTTP, Redis, DNS, ICMP) with 2% CPU overhead and sub-millisecond latency, outperforming Istio and Kubeshark in both efficiency and observability coverage."

Although password-based authentication remains a standard and cost-effective method, it continues to be vulnerable to malicious attacks. Existing enhancements, such as honey encryption and honeywords, seek to complicate password guessing; however, they still possess vulnerabilities related to genuine passwords. To overcome these limitations, this study proposes Extended Self-Adaptive Honey Encryption (XSHE), an innovative user authentication methodology. XSHE utilizes the PassGAN model to generate highly realistic synthetic passwords, further enhancing adaptability and real-time threat response, thus reducing dependence on actual user passwords and alleviating risks associated with conventional attacks. We have implemented and evaluated XSHE within a Python-based password authentication system. The results demonstrate that the seamless integration of PassGAN on the login interface significantly enhances the security of the password database and improves the detection of password-cracking attempts, thereby contributing to a more resilient authentication framework."

    "abstract": "In multi-agent systems, task decomposition must consider physical constraints, temporal dependencies among tasks, and interactions between agents. Decomposing high-level natural language instructions into executable multi-agent actions is a core component of multi-agent planning systems. In this paper, we propose the multi-agent task decomposition system (MATDS), which leverages the natural language understanding, reasoning, and evaluation capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to perform multi-agent task decomposition. The MATDS takes high-level task instructions provided in natural language as input and decomposes them into executable forms that can be carried out by multiple agents. The MATDS employs LLMs to iteratively decompose high-level tasks through Chain-Of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and evaluates the decomposition results through a critic module to ensure that the generated task plans satisfy feasibility and logical consistency. This enables effective task decomposition that considers multi-agent execution capabilities and parallelism. We conducted experiments on task decomposition using the AI2-THOR simulator and demonstrated that the MATDS can mitigate errors that may occur in few-shot prompting approaches. Overall, MATDS provides a flexible and scalable solution for generating and refining task decompositions for multi-agent systems."

A MIMO-OFDM communication system's performance is significantly impacted by the channel estimation methods. Considering the benefits of MIMO-OFDM technology, there are still a lot of issues with practical applications. Conventional linear channel estimation techniques do not take possible sparsity of the real communication channel; rather they rely on the assumption of multi-path channel densities. To reduce the pilot overhead problems, a sparse channel estimation model for Multi UserMIMO (MU-MIMO) systems has been implemented. In the initial stage, essential signals are gathered from standard sources. These signals then undergo signal modulation using Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK) in the transmitter phase. Pulse Shaping Algorithm (PSA) process the modulated signal to minimize inter-symbol interference and inter-carrier interference. The Inverse Fast Fourier Transform (IFFT) technique is applied in the transmitter phase to map the symbols and the resulting signal is sent to the receiver side. On the receiver side, the semi-blind sparse algorithm is employed to validate the spare channel. The estimated sparse channel values are then used to generate new data and this data is given as input to the proposed Elman Recurrent Neural Network (ERNN) for obtaining sparse channel estimation outcomes. Finally, experimental analysis is carried out to assess the performance of the implemented sparse channel estimation model against various techniques."

AI-vOLT addresses this challenge by translating high-level operator intent into low-level executable commands through a multistage agentic workflow of planning, shaping, and execution. We evaluate the framework across four representative provisioning scenarios and multiple LLM backends under varying contextual inputs. Experimental results show that AI-vOLT achieves near-perfect provisioning success (≈ 99%) in simulated environments and is further validated on a 25G physical PON testbed. These findings confirm the practicality of AI-vOLT for reliable, language-driven automation of optical access networks."

The proposed system utilizes a lightweight convolutional neural network (MoveNet) for real-time human pose estimation from RGB camera input, enabling accurate tracking of upper limb joints—shoulder, elbow, and wrist—without physical markers or sensors. A rule-based engine analyzes joint angles and movement trajectories to evaluate exercise performance and detect compensatory motions. Multimodal feedback, including visual, auditory, and haptic cues, is provided to guide users toward correct movement execution. Furthermore, an adaptive training strategy dynamically adjusts task difficulty based on the user's performance. Experimental results demonstrate that the system achieves a mean pose estimation accuracy of 94.4% with a processing delay below 100 ms. In a four-week training study involving participants with upper limb motor impairments, significant improvements in joint range of motion (32.1% increase) and movement smoothness (34.2% improvement) were observed. User feedback evaluated via the System Usability Scale (SUS) yielded a score of 82.5, indicating high acceptability.

However, most existing text simplification systems produce only a single simplified version, lacking support for controlled progression in vocabulary difficulty. To address this gap, we propose a framework that generates multiple lexically varied yet semantically accurate text variants from a given text and organizes them into structured reading levels. Our method first creates a Pareto front of optimal variants by balancing two competing objectives: improving readability, measured by the Flesch–Kincaid Grade Level (FKGL), and preserving semantic integrity by limiting the number of word substitutions. The generated variants are organized into three progressively challenging levels, Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced, using a clustering process that groups texts with similar vocabulary and complexity. Experimental results across diverse inputs show that our approach consistently produces well-stratified, interpretable text variants, supporting personalized and incremental vocabulary development for language learners."

    "abstract": "The introduction of the Al systems that communicate longitudinally with human participants provokes the need to develop solid models of sustainable digital personality states (SDPS) in socio-technical interactions. The existing models of digital identity design do not implement ethical protection and tend to provide unstable or misaligned personality development. This paper proposes a new model which combines constrained and nonlinear dynamical models with controlled ethical mechanisms which would serve to orient the evolution of digital personalities in the long run. The software real-time models control the state of digital personality as a vector. Moral boundaries are coded as well as sustainability ensured through a Lyapunov stability analysis. Bounded feedback laws that synthesize control inputs have norm-limiting actuation and ethical barrier functions as constraints are met. The use of social reward signals to make behavioral adjustment with the help of an adaptive gain mechanism. The socio-technical architecture is multi-agent and allows response feedback cycles between humans and Al as well as co-simulation of the digital twin. The presented solution makes further progress in the ethical al personality development by creating a tradeoff between responsiveness and adherence to constraints with ethical potential gradients as a measure of resilience."

    "abstract": "Quantum computing is highly sensitive to environmental noise, leading to quantum errors—defined as deviations between measured and expected outcomes. To mitigate these errors, various Quantum Error Mitigation (QEM) methods have been proposed; however, they show limited performance in complex quantum circuits due to error-propagation caused by entanglement. In this paper, we propose a novel entanglement-aware QEM method that simultaneously considers circuit architecture and entanglement information. Our method achieves high QEM performance by encoding entanglement strength as self-attention bias and edge features, thus effectively capturing error-propagation patterns. Experimental results on complex quantum circuits demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing QEM approaches and achieves effective error mitigation across various noise types."

Traditional methods often face challenges related to template renewability and potential exposure of sensitive biometric data. A novel approach is proposed to secure fingerprint templates by focusing on minutiae points, such as bifurcations, ridge endpoints, and the fingerprint's core point. The distances and ridge counts are computed from the core point to each minutiae point. The fingerprint is segmented into different regions, and a region-specific transformation is applied to each, using a distinct key set, <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\{a, \\alpha\\}$</tex>. This regionwise transformation strengthens security by reducing the risk of template reconstruction by unauthorized users. Experiments conducted on the FVC2002 DB1, DB2, and DB3 databases indicate that the proposed approach performs better than existing methods, highlighting its effectiveness in providing robust and secure biometric template protection."

A custom dataset of ripe FFB images was annotated with five key point annotations representing anatomical features to support pose estimation. Comparative analysis shows that YOLOv8s achieved the highest mAP 50 of 90.01%, which is 2.3% higher than YOLOv8n and 0.23% higher than YOLOv8m. For pose estimation, YOLOv8s also led with mAP of 89.20% outperforming YOLOv8s and YOLOv8m. Despite this, YOLOv8n offered the best efficiency, with only 3.5 million parameters and a recall of 99.25%. On the other hand, validation loss analysis further confirms the robustness and efficiency of YOLOv8s-pose, which recorded a total loss value that was almost 4.4% lower than YOLOv8n and 6.8% lower than YOLOv8m. These findings indicate that either YOLOv8n or YOLOv8s poses as a suitable base architecture for future improvements, focusing on refining key point definitions, expanding datasets, and optimizing the backbone with lightweight convolutional blocks. It also highlights the model's efficiency in handling the irregular topology of FFBs and its suitability for real-time applications."

    "abstract": "In this paper, we address the routing problem in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite networks under stringent feeder link (FL) constraints. LEO networks rely on satellites interconnected via inter-satellite links (ISLs) and connected to the ground through feeder links to a limited number of fixed-position ground gateways (GWs). While the large number of satellites provides spatial diversity for user access, the gateway infrastructure remains sparse due to economic and geographical limitations. As a result, FLs often become a bottleneck in the end-to-end (E2E) routing process, where traffic from user terminals (UEs) must traverse a satellite relay path before reaching a ground gateway. The dynamic nature of satellite positions, limited gateway visibility, and link congestion further complicate routing decisions. To address these challenges, we propose a routing strategy that explicitly accounts for FL availability during path construction. Unlike conventional methods that prioritize access or inter-satellite links first, our approach dynamically adapts routing decisions based on link feasibility, availability, and shared congestion."

This study compares the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) with a new method, Residual Sequence to Sequence (Seq2Seq) Model for forecasting. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied to decrease the computational demand of models by reducing dimensions. The Residual Seq2Seq model enhance the Seq2Seq architecture by integrating residual connections, enabling it to more effectively capture dependencies over time and handle the vanishing gradient issue. Test Results shows that this approach gives accurate prediction of time-series EV charging load data. PCA analysis when performed on the input data shows that it leads to some gain in model accuracy. In the study Residual Seq2Seq model stands out, especially when PCA-transformed data is used compared to LSTM and BiLSTM. In-depth comparative analysis was conducted to specify the importance of advanced neural network architectures, and dimensionality reduction techniques for performing accurate EV charging load forecasting.

    "abstract": "Over the years, the Internet of Things (IoT) has transformed numerous industries by facilitating interconnectivity and automation at an unprecedented pace. But the increasing number of connected devices poses major challenges for communication efficiency, cybersecurity, and data transfer reliability. Conventional methods of resource allocation are frequently unable to accommodate changing dynamics within a network, resulting in less-than-optimum performance, security issues, and wasteful bandwidth usage. We focused on the utilization of ML approaches for adaptive resources management to improve the communication, security, and data transmission processes in IoT. The use of machine learning encompasses the adoption of these capabilities through adaptive and intelligent decision making, improving network resource management through the analysis of real-time traffic trends, the prediction of congestion and the dynamic allocation of bandwidth. Reinforcement learning (RL) is a well-established method in the domain of artificial intelligence (AI) that can adapt in real-time when combined with deep neural networks (DNN), allowing IoT devices to allocate processing power and communication resources efficiently, minimizing latency and energy consumption with high throughput. Additionally, even more secure ML-based anomaly detection techniques provide a robust cybersecurity approach through the identification of intrusions, the detection of malware, and the prevention of distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks in IoT environments. The proposed work combines the supervised & unsupervised machine learning models to use supervised models for enhancing efficiency of transmission of data. Decentralized processing techniques, including federated learning and edge AI, decrease reliance on cloud infrastructure and boost privacy. Further, blockchain integration prevents the impossibility of unauthorized in IoT nodes, which can strengthen trust and data integrity in IoT communication. Experiments show that using the proposed ML-based resource allocation model leads to improved network performance through minimizing packet loss, reducing latency, and enhancing QoS. The results illustrate that ML-based dynamic resource allocation clearly outmaneuvers conventional static allocation methodologies to enhance IoT networks' robustness, adaptability, and fortress."

    "abstract": "Phishing scams remain a growing threat to online services, especially on social networks where content can be user-generated, constantly changing and spread amongst many users. These campaigns capitalize on user trust, spreading malicious URLs that steal personal credentials like passwords or banking information. The pattern-based systems and rule based systems which depend on blacklists can be weak defences, because they are often rigid in format and may not be effective in detecting new or unknown method advanced Phishing attack including zero -day phishing attacks. To overcome these issues, in this paper we put forward a real-time phishing detection module for a full web stack model tailor made to social media services. The main part of the system is a random forest classifier developed on a labeled dataset containing both benign and phishing URLs. The detection model is implemented with a Python-based Flask API, which receives URL input from a Node.js-powered frontend. The URL-based classifier measures several features, derived by lexical and domain-related factors including presence of IP addresses, HTTPS usage and number of subdomains. The model is proved highly effective on adequacy (97.33% accuracy, 97.39% precision and 97.93% recall) and fluency (ROC-AUC of 99.70%), with predictions returned in less than 250 ms on average. In general, this method provides a fully strong-robustness, scalable and real-time filtering service to detect phishing attack on UGC, making it feasible for being deployed in today’s social media."

However, analyzing raw video feeds by human operators to detect objects of interest, such as vehicles or victims, becomes increasingly demanding as the mission duration increases. This underscores the need for embedded computer vision to reduce the operator’s cognitive load and enhance mission responsiveness. Towards this goal, we propose a low-latency object detection model based on YOLO, fitted to search-and-rescue missions, and able to process data coming from RGB and event cameras. We also propose a low-latency implementation on FPGA on board drones, achieving accurate detection in less than 20ms.

    "abstract": "AI-driven Digital Twin Networks (DTNs), essential for autonomous network management, face a critical \"cold start\" problem: initial data scarcity hinders AI model training, leading to unreliable simulations and suboptimal resource allocation. We propose a generative framework using diffusion models to synthesize high-fidelity network metrics (e.g., latency, jitter), specifically designed to capture their complex, non-stationary time-series characteristics. Our diffusion-based method overcomes the training instability and mode collapse issues of traditional GANs, generating data that more accurately preserves the statistical properties of real network traffic. We validate our framework's superiority over GANs through rigorous statistical analysis and performance on downstream tasks like anomaly detection. This work solves the DTN cold-start problem, enabling reliable AI-driven network management from day one and advancing the adoption of resilient, intelligent network virtualization."

The analysis produces confusing results because linguistic elements like sarcasm can reverse the polarity of statements with sentiment. The research constructs a sentiment classification framework that unites traditional machine learning models with contemporary sarcasm identification algorithms. A balanced portion of Amazon Reviews underwent advanced text normalization with three techniques: lemmatization and negation solution and sarcasm marking via transformer-based detection methods. A combination of text features extraction by TF-IDF vectorization and sarcasm signals conversion to auxiliary binary features completed the processing. The optimized ensemble model comprised SVM with Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes classifiers through execution of Optuna hyperparameter tuning. The experimental findings on a 45,000 -sample balanced dataset show that the system achieves 80.66% accuracy together with stable macro-F1 scores for sentiment identification. The study illustrates that sentiment performance improvements can be achieved through combining an ensemble model with sarcasm-aware feature enhancement."

Early disease detection is crucial for rapid and effective disease control. This study aimed to develop a digital image-based classification model that achieves high accuracy and can be easily interpreted for the classification of tomato leaf diseases. The method employed combines a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for visual feature extraction and Ridge Classification for classification, along with dimension reduction and visualization techniques, including PCA and t-SNE, as well as model interpretation using SHAP. The training test results showed that the model achieved a 0.97 classification accuracy on the Ridge Classifier, with consistent performance across all disease classes. Feature visualization separates classes, whereas SHAP analysis reveals the contribution of each feature to the model's decision, thereby increasing transparency and user confidence. These findings demonstrate that the combination of CNN, Ridge Classifier, and XAI can yield an accurate, efficient, and comprehensible system for detecting plant diseases. This model has the potential to be applied in innovative farming systems to support automatic disease detection and assist decision-making in the field without requiring direct expert intervention"

This study presents a comparative evaluation of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Darwinian Particle Swarm Optimization (DPSO) for feature extraction and classification in anemia diagnosis. While PSO is simple, easy to implement, and capable of fast approach-making it suitable for basic image processing-it often suffers from premature approach and There is a serious susceptibility to local optima in complex medical image analysis, which can compromise the accuracy of results. D overcomes these limitations by borrowing from Darwinian natural selection, significantly boosting exploration and allowing the extraction of far richer textural features from palm images than conventional methods ever achieve. Experimental results supported by statistical analysis show that DPSO consistently achieves higher mean and complex values compared to PSO, indicating its superior ability to capture discriminative features related to hemoglobin levels. For example, patient P1 with a hemoglobin level of 14 shows an complex of 3.8323 using DPSO, compared to 1.8343 with PSO. Although DPSO demands greater computational resources, it delivers more robust diagnostic performance."

This paper proposes a non-segmentation approach for text recognition based on transformer architecture with bidirectional attention. The model exploits an encoding-decoding transformer on top of a convolutional visual feature extraction module that permits a global contextual understanding across character sequences. This method does not rely on temporal convolutional networks or recurrent units but otherwise incorporates the bidirectional attention mechanisms added to improve alignment in sequences, character prediction, and so forth, without clear segmentation. We evaluate our model on benchmark datasets of synthetic and real-world overlapping words, which exhibit dramatic improvements over previous CNN-CTC and TCN methods in terms of accuracy and robustness. The architecture sets the limits of state of the art on end-to-end text recognition through complex visual distortions and brings to light the promise of transformer-based solutions in the area of fine-Grain character interaction."

This comparative evaluation uses a Logical Regression Framework based on two principal record sources: (1) the server performance logs and (2) the server usage charge. Every one of those datasets is explored intensively to locate correlations between certain capabilities and scalability/mobility overall performance. Using this fact, the most appropriate cloud structure is determined to show higher scalability and mobility characteristics. The hope is that these studies can help cloud computing architects and engineers lie out and implement better architecture for their cloud-based applications."

One classification of these anomalies is attacks on web applications. This problem can be addressed with penetration testing. Penetration testing can be conducted through two approaches: manual and automated. Automated penetration testing has the advantage of speed, but it can be further improved by implementing a distributed system. Previous research has proven that the concept of distributed penetration testing automation can speed up the entire process. However, the penetration testing system still uses a Command Line Interface (CLI). For those new to the world of cybersecurity, who may not be very familiar with CLI, a Graphical User Interface (GUI) provides a more user-friendly solution because it is more interactive and easier to use. This research utilised Axiom as the infrastructure to implement a distributed system, employing an experimental approach to compare the speed of non-distributed and distributed penetration testing automation on websites. The ffuf tool was used for open redirect attacks, fdsploit for path traversal attacks, and ssrf-tools for SSRF attacks. Distributed penetration testing automation resulted in a total time savings of 20.17% compared to non-distributed testing. Additionally, this study also yielded a 96% agreement rate on the Likert scale for the ease of implementing distributed penetration testing automation using a GUI on websites, falling into the “strongly agree” category."

    "abstract": "Side-channel attacks on ICs are a significant issue. In particular, it is widely known that when standardized cryptographic processing circuits such as AES or RSA are implemented within an IC, cryptographic keys can be easily leaked through side channels observed from the IC. This poses a serious threat to encrypted communications over the internet, as it means that an attacker with access to the physical information emitted from the IC can easily eavesdrop on or tamper with confidential communications. This paper proposes a novel logic-level countermeasure against side-channel leakage in flip-flops called Alt-FF, which could not be achieved with previously researched transistor-level approaches. While transistor-level countermeasures cannot be implemented on reconfigurable devices such as FPGAs, our logic-level countermeasure can be easily described in RTL and are applicable to existing Furthermore, by incorporating randomness, which could not be utilized in prior transistor-level techniques, the evaluation presented in this paper demonstrates that strong tamper-resistance can be achieved against power analysis attacks on an actual 128-bit AES implementation using a standard FPGA device."

As a consequence of advanced hidden means of communication and the increased requirements for smart adaptive destruction methods, the convergence of topology, entropy and AI in security is studied. Leveraging core concepts from steganography, steganalysis, and MAS design, we introduce a model formed by special agents-Embedder, Extractor, Detector, and Coordinator-that circulate in centralized, decentralized, and hybrid communication models. These agents are augmented with deep learning models (CNNs, GANs, Transformers) to extract features, predict payloads, and detect anomalies. We use persistent homology to extract topological features from high dimensional stego-object Feature Spaces, manifesting difference in the underlying manifolds of cover vs. stego data. In addition, we use entropic measures (Shannon, Rényi, KL divergence, predictive entropy) of security, agent uncertainty and information loss/gain in communications. Synergy of topological and entropic views enable us to define joint topological-entropic signatures that enhance readability and the steganalysis agents’ performance. Experimental on image and audio steganography data sets (e.g., BOSSBase, ALASKA) demonstrates the proposed method’s superiority of detection accuracy and robustness over baseline methods. Our findings convey that MAS dynamics particularly in adversarial training, largely decide the topological complexity and entropy landscape of learned feature space. The paper finishes with some discussion on these results when designing adaptive AIbased steganalysis systems."

    "abstract": "This exploratory study examined the learning experiences of six students learning in an individual, asynchronous online format. While prior research indicates both benefits and challenges in individual, asynchronous learning, such as flexibility alongside feelings of isolation, there is limited focus on holistic learning experiences in this context. As a representative example of the learning format, a learning unit was designed in Classwork within Microsoft Teams. Based on interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA), semi-structured interviews were conducted to explore participants’ impressions, feelings, engagement, and interactions. The results indicate mixed experiences. Usability issues, mainly concerned with single-window restriction and navigation, impacted students’ impressions and emotions. The emotions ranged from enjoyment to frustration. Regarding interactions, the students expressed a desire for more interaction with the instructor. It can be concluded that this specific format requires clear and unambiguous instructions, as well as enhanced guidance and feedback. Moreover, the results indicate a preference for a blended learning format, combining asynchronous with synchronous learning."

    "abstract": "As satellite communications (SatComs) evolve toward integrated terrestrial and non-terrestrial mobile Internet services for handheld devices, multi-low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite cooperative transmission has emerged as a key technique for breaking single-link capacity limits under current link budget constraints. Focusing on downlink transmission, this paper offers a distinctive and accessible perspective on potential multi-satellite cooperative transmission (MSCT) mechanisms across spatial, temporal, and frequency domains, revealing the unique features they exhibit within the context of mobile SatComs. We begin with an emphasis on spatial-domain cooperation, categorizing it into coherent and non-coherent transmission mechanisms, discussing their gains such as higher channel rank, and comparing their differences and trade-offs, including synchronization requirements. Next, we explore temporal and frequency-domain cooperation via mature schemes such as dual connectivity and carrier aggregation, emphasizing their coordinated resource allocation strategies and unique advantages, including seamless handover. In the hybrid domain, we introduce coordinated multi-point (CoMP) and multi-transmission/reception point (TRP) technologies, outlining their mechanisms and discussing feasibility. We then analyze critical issues such as synchronization, feeder links, exploitation of position-related information, multi-antenna terminal configurations, and satellite swarm architectures that are vital to MSCT. Finally, we provide comparative simulations of multiple MSCT schemes under various key factors with near-practical system configurations, validating the analyses presented in this paper."

This article investigates the use of drones to establish an emergency communication network that supports postcontingency distribution network operation. An end-to-end learning-based, cyber-physical stability-constrained framework is proposed for emergency cyber network formation. In this framework, drones are strategically deployed across the distribution network to enable postcontingency communication and coordinate distributed energy resources. The framework incorporates multidrone connected communication optimization, wireless resource allocation, cyber-physical network modeling, and stability criteria extraction. These processes introduce significant computational complexity, including NP-hard challenges and nonlinearities, which are difficult to solve efficiently using traditional optimization methods. To address these limitations, this article develops an end-to-end deep reinforcement learning algorithm that determines optimal multidrone trajectories from the depot, providing a feasible multidrone deployment solution that ensures a stable emergency energy supply."

    "abstract": "As a pivotal transitional technology in battery energy storage systems, semi-solid-state batteries (SSSBs) are currently undergoing an accelerated deployment phase. While pulse charging technology has been extensively investigated to enhance the charging performance of liquid lithium-ion batteries (LLIBs), its impact on SSSBs remains largely unexplored. This work presents the first comprehensive comparative analysis of pulse charging effects on both LLIBs and SSSBs, systematically evaluating critical parameters including maximum temperature rise, discharge capacity, charging speed, and cycle lifetime. Notably, SSSBs with high-impedance characteristics exhibit heightened sensitivity to charging protocols and current parameters. A novel multi-segment pulse charging (M-SPC) strategy is consequently developed. For both battery types, the M-SPC protocol demonstrates remarkable cycle lifetime extension compared to conventional constant current (CC) charging. After 1000 high-current cycles, capacity retention rates reach 84.7% for LLIBs (ten segments and 1 Hz) and 93.7% for SSSBs (ten segments and 0.004 Hz) under M-SPC operation. In contrast, SSSBs subjected to CC charging exhibit swelling-induced rupture and complete failure after merely 800 cycles. Furthermore, nonlinear correlations between pulse segment number/frequency and capacity retention are quantitatively characterized to identify the optimal parameters. These findings provide technical support for the development of electric vehicles and the accelerated application of SSSBs."

Embedding of MMFs with different core diameter in the NCF enables redistributed optical power from the fundamental core mode to cladding modes, thereby efficiently exciting cladding modes. The experimental results show that in the RI range of 1.33 to 1.42, the sensitivities of Dip A (1450 nm), Dip B (1550 nm), and Dip C (1650 nm) are 568.56 nm/RIU, 851.29 nm/RIU, and 580.91 nm/RIU, respectively. The proposed sensor has the characteristics of high mechanical strength and low temperature crosstalk. It is expected to be used in the fields of environmental monitoring and concentration identification, etc."

The main challenge stems from the detection of low-velocity or quasi-static signal components in the capillaries. To address this, we propose a coherent nonlinear ultrasound imaging method, where a nonlinear coherence operator acted on point spread function is leveraged to improve detection sensitivity of microbubbles. Low-velocity microbubbles can thus be extracted without clutter filtering. Through visualizations of low-velocity microvasculature in rat brain/kidney/testis and early-stage glioma, coherent nonlinear ultrasound imaging paves the way towards capillary-level microangiography."

Testing results: sensitivity 97.4%, accuracy 97.5%, precision 98.3%, and AUC 99.8%. The VGG-12 model beat earlier efforts in some assessment criteria.

Traditional cryptographic methods are often too resource-intensive for devices with limited processing power, memory, and energy capacity. Lightweight cryptography (LWC) addresses this by providing optimized solutions with minimal hardware over-head. One such candidate, the New Lightweight Cryptographic Algorithm (NLCA), a 128-bit symmetric block cipher. This paper introduces a modified version of NLCA, called ModNLCA, which replaces the original F-function with a dynamic S-Box generated from the secret key and round constants. This modification enhances resistance to linear attacks while potentially reducing computational complexity. The algorithm is implemented on ESP32 microcontrollers to simulate real-world IoT scenarios, where encryption and decryption processes are distributed across nodes via Wi-Fi communication. Experimental results show that while ModNLCA is slightly slower than PRESENT at small data sizes (e.g., 32 bits), it outperforms both NLCA and PRESENT significantly at l arger sizes. At 256 bits, ModNLCA a chieves up to <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{5 3 \\%}$</tex> faster encryption and <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{3 8 \\%}$</tex> faster decryption compared to PRESENT, while also using memory more efficiently.

    "abstract": "Low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites have attracted attention as a new navigation system due to their ability to provide stronger signals compared to medium Earth orbit (MEO) satellites. However, severe clock errors in LEO satellites degrade positioning accuracy, as clock biases distort signal propagation time and cause range estimation errors. Therefore, periodic clock correction using existing Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) is required for positioning with LEO satellites. Reliance on GNSS undermines the resilience of LEO satellite positioning systems, since any disruption or manipulation of GNSS signals directly degrades their performance. Consequently, the absence of a trusted timing reference remains a critical vulnerability for LEO-based positioning. To address this issue, we proposed a method to improve positioning accuracy through clock synchronization of LEO satellites using clock information exchange over inter-satellite link (ISL). The proposed method compensate for clock errors between adjacent satellites through distributed average consensus. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method reduces positioning errors regardless of the satellite clock type."

    "abstract": "CICIDS2017 is a well-known benchmark dataset for intrusion detection system (IDS) model creation. However, several studies revealed that the CICIDS2017 dataset still has several weaknesses. This research aims to improve R-CICIDS2017 by removing unrealistic features. After removing unrealistic features, we use a deep neural network (DNN) to predict the R-CICIDS-2017 dataset. We focus our predictions on attacks labeled denial of service (DoS) and distributed DoS (DDoS) in the dataset, as these attacks are the most frequent in the Internet of Things (IoT) world. Because implementation in IoT must be lightweight, we only use 0.1 of the entire dataset. We develop quantization for several data types to determine which model is best suited for running on IoT edge devices. The test results show that the Shannon entropy of the sampled and original datasets for each label is identical. This answer indicates that the DNN model for IDS on IoT with R-CICIDS2017 uses a low-complexity algorithm. The DNN test on CICIDS2017 and R-CICIDS2017 reveals that DNNs using unrealistic datasets exhibit better performance; however, this is not feasible for implementation. DNN with R-CICIDS2017 is optimal because its performance surpasses that of GNB and uses features that can be implemented in the IoT environment. Finally, the test shows that dynamic quantization has better accuracy loss than static int 8 quantization, and its model size is better than static float 16 quantization. We obtain a DNN model that achieves optimum efficiency for IDS deployment on edge devices within IoT networks, utilizing R-CICIDS2017."

    "abstract": "The growing complexity of smart microgrids, characterized by distributed renewable energy resources, dynamic load demands, and decentralized control, necessitates intelligent and adaptive energy management solutions. Traditional centralized optimization approaches often suffer from scalability issues, communication overhead, and vulnerability to single-point failures. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a Resilient Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Algorithm (RMARL) for distributed energy optimization in smart microgrids. The RMARL framework employs autonomous agents representing individual energy units-such as generators, storage systems, and consumers-that collaboratively learn optimal policies through decentralized reinforcement learning. Each agent utilizes local state information and limited peer communication to balance energy generation, consumption, and storage, thereby enhancing overall grid efficiency and resilience. The algorithm integrates a resilience-aware reward function to ensure stability under uncertain conditions such as renewable intermittency, communication loss, and sudden demand surges. Experimental results from simulation studies on IEEE 33-bus and modified microgrid test systems demonstrate that RMARL achieves faster convergence, improved energy efficiency by 12.6%, and enhanced fault tolerance compared to conventional Q-learning and deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG)-based methods. Furthermore, the distributed nature of RMARL ensures reduced communication cost and robust performance under partial observability. In conclusion, the proposed RMARL framework offers a scalable, resilient, and intelligent approach for distributed energy management in future smart microgrids, paving the way for sustainable and autonomous energy ecosystems."

    "abstract": "In conventional narrowband active noise control (NANC), the discrete Fourier coefficients (DFC) based linear combiner (LC) or the first-order FIR filter with two weights, also called magnitude and phase adjuster (MPA), is used as controller to make the system efficient. Modified NANC systems have been proposed to reduce the computational load of the conventional NANC. In this paper, we propose a NANC system that uses a relatively long FIR filter rather than the two-weight MPAs and only includes a single reference signal filtering (x filtering) block. The reference cosine waves are added up to form a new reference signal that is fed to not only the FIR controller but also the x -filtering block. Comparisons are made in detail between the existing modified MPA-based NANC system and the proposed system in terms of computational cost and noise reduction performance (NRP). Extensive simulations have been conducted to reveal that the proposed NANC system can not only outperform the modified MPA-based NANC system but also requires less computational cost if the number of target frequencies is larger than a specific value."

The survey instrument aims to assess teachers’ beliefs about using Personal Learning Devices (PLDs), their techno-pedagogical practices, and their data literacy. We collected responses from 400 teachers who regularly implement $\\mathbf{1: 1}$-mediated lessons. Through Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA), we identified reliable and valid constructs within three domains: beliefs about nurturing participatory, connected, and reflective learning cultures; practices involving creating learning experience of understanding, practice, interaction, and production; and self-evaluated data literacy encompassing “identifying problems”, “interpreting data”, and “making instructional decisions”. This 40-item instrument provides a valuable tool for evaluating teachers’ capabilities to facilitate personalised and collaborative learning in $1: 1$ environments, with potential applicability beyond any specific national context."

In this method, PW is selected from two series of separation signals. In the conventional PW extraction method, the PW is selected from the separation signals using their kurtosis and skewness. In the conventional method, the procedure for selecting PW from the separation signals is as follows. First, block processing is performed for the separation signals. Next, the kurtosis and skewness are calculated from each block of the separation signals. Finally, PW is selected for each block using these values. By using this method, PW selection is performed with high accuracy for the separation signals reproducing the source signals with high accuracy. In this selection, only information from each block is used. Therefore, the conventional method cannot select with high accuracy for separation signals reproducing the source signals with low accuracy. In this paper, we use information of all previous separation signals for PW selection based on adaptive calculation of kurtosis and skewness. Then, we propose PW extraction method to select the PW with high accuracy, even if separation signals reproducing the source signals are low accuracy."

We argue that while LLMs effectively capture general linguistic patterns, they lack explicit logical structure when analyzing learners’ cognitive skills, so LLMs can hardly offer personalized learning experiences. To help EAL learners, we propose a novel approach that integrates Non-Axiomatic Logic (NAL) with LLMs to support more personalized and structured vocabulary learning."

The modular and parameterized structure makes it highly scalable and well-suited for implementation in embedded processors, FPGA-based accelerators with limited resources, and customizable computing platforms.

Our core hypothesis is that domain-specific contextual retrieval can stabilize large language model (LLM) reasoning under adversarial, multi-step challenges. To test this, we construct a bespoke retrieval corpus from scratch—excluding benchmark leakage—covering key CTF domains such as binary exploitation, reverse engineering, cryptography, and web vulnerabilities. Using FAISS indexing and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), our agent integrates this corpus with GPT-4o via a lightweight, tool-agnostic pipeline. Evaluated on NYU CTF benchmark [2], the RAG-enhanced agent achieves a 57.1% improvement in task completion over the vanilla GPT-4o baseline. Unlike prior work, which often depends on fragile tool orchestration, we demonstrate that focused retrieval alone significantly improves reasoning stability, reduces hallucinations, and enhances task-solving accuracy. Our threat model also considers prompt injection and contextual ambiguity, underlining the need for interpretable, corpus-grounded architectures in offensive reasoning."

One must be quick and smart in a changing agricultural environment to overcome these challenges. Existing path-planning methods (based on evolutionary algorithms or generic neural networks) struggle with convergence time, obstacle navigation, and the optimization of when to deviate from the ideal path, leading to operational inefficiencies. This paper proposes Hybrid Neural-Evolutionary Path Planning (HNEPP) to tackle these challenges. It blends evolutionary algorithm optimization with neural network prediction. The neural network's predictive model provides an effective routing using IoT sensor data, which the evolutionary algorithm refines to reduce energy consumption, journey time, and collision risk. Precision crop monitoring and automated harvesting used the HNEPP agricultural robot architecture. Simulations suggest that the strategy is resilient for smart farming applications, with faster convergence, operational performance, and path efficiency than previous methods. The solution targets agricultural robots."

In conventional OTFS-based systems, the accuracy of channel estimation degrades due to ISI and ICI. To address this problem, we design a neural network that restores the time-domain received signal by removing the effects of ISI and ICI while preserving the channel characteristics. The proposed network adopts the U-Net architecture with attention blocks, and it is trained on simulated datasets that cover diverse numbers of targets and a wide range of signal-to-noise ratio values. We evaluate the training process based on the measure of loss convergence to ensure stable learning. The performance improvement is then quantified by the root mean square error (RMSE), which is reduced from 0.42 to 0.30. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by reconstructing the target profile in the OTFS-based sensing system, showing successful restoration even at 0 dB. These findings demonstrate that the proposed method effectively mitigates ISI and ICI and provides robust performance of target detection in OTFS-based sensing systems."

While mesh networks, operating within unlicensed frequencies, extend range through multi-hop connectivity, they face interference, frequency competition, and reduced data rates per hop. Cellular technologies offer a promising alternative by leveraging dedicated frequency bands. However, standard-compliant Integrated Access and Backhaul (IAB) solutions are limited by hardware compatibility restrictions that result in vendor lock-in. This paper introduces LANTERN, an open multi-radio relay system that builds on the established SEAMLESS Multi-Link protocol, enabling interoperability across diverse communication technologies, including cellular and mesh networks. This architecture ensures reliable operation even in complex environments by combining established systems with modern ones without requiring substantial infrastructure changes. Initial validation experiments using a homogeneous 5G over-the-top relay demonstrate seamless transitions between the umbrella and relay networks, enabling uninterrupted immersive robotic teleoperation during mission-critical operations. In addition, a second case study demonstrates the functionality of heterogeneous relaying between a cellular umbrella and a mesh network, while highlighting potential future improvements to enhance handover and link usage when dealing with heterogeneous technologies."

However, the inherently low and variable output voltage of thermoelectric generators (TEGs), compounded by dynamic thermal gradient fluctuations, poses significant challenges for stable and efficient power conditioning. This paper presents a Multi-Index Nonlinear Robust Adaptive Control (MINRAC) scheme for multilevel DC-DC converters in TEH systems. The proposed controller simultaneously addresses multiple performance objectives, including output voltage regulation, conversion efficiency, and component stress minimization. By integrating adaptive parameter estimation, nonlinear compensation, and robust disturbance rejection, MINRAC ensures asymptotic stability and accurate voltage tracking even under severe uncertainties and disturbances. The effectiveness of the approach is validated through MATLAB/Simulink and Python-based simulations, demonstrating superior performance compared to proportional-integral (PI) and sliding mode control (SMC) strategies. Results highlight MINRAC's ability to deliver improved transient response, reduced steady-state error, and enhanced robustness to thermal variations, thereby enabling reliable and high-efficiency energy harvesting for next-generation batteryless electronic systems."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a fire detection and ranging pipeline for autonomous firefighting drones designed to extinguish fires in areas difficult to reach, such as at elevation or in remote forest areas. Specifically, we propose a real-time pipeline for the detection and ranging of fire, including the detection of people for safety. We compare different object detection models for the localization of fire, smoke and humans and show that fusing the Red, Green of RGB images and the thermal image in a context-aware manner results in a more robust fire detection. Finally, we present a method to localize the source of the fire in RGB images through morphological operations in the HSV color space when thermal radiometric data is not available. Our pipeline is trained, tested and validated on public and custom datasets."

These bandwidths are not usually available due to the high losses in current transmission lines and the limited bandwidth of radiofrequency connectors and interconnects. Recently, dielectric waveguide transmission lines have been shown to enable broadband interconnects as well as functional building block structures for signal processing in the electrical domain. This paper presents the potential of a dielectric slab waveguide platform to integrate Terahertz components, having an operating bandwidth that matches with the highest frequency of photonic components."

The study commences by first importing the necessary Python libraries, loading a real estate data set and conducting intensive data cleaning to accommodate missing values and outliers. Exploratory data analysis exposes important understanding of determinants of housing prices. Following the division of the dataset, the different machine learning models are trained and assessed by using the metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). The Stacking Regressor becomes the best performing model with the lowest RMSE, and this is selected as the final model, which secures the correct pricing predictions of the property in the dynamic real estate environment.

    "abstract": "In response to the imbalance between accuracy and real-time performance in meteorological radar data processing, as well as the insufficient efficiency of warning platforms, this paper constructs a deep learning based “algorithm platform” collaborative system. At the algorithm level, a spatiotemporal feature learning model that integrates attention mechanism is proposed, combined with model compression and transfer learning strategies, to achieve highprecision processing of multi band radar data. The prediction accuracy reaches 92.3 %, the generalization error is reduced to 4.2 %, and the single frame inference time is controlled within 42 milliseconds, solving the performance bottleneck of traditional algorithms in complex meteorological scenes. At the platform level, a “edge cloud” distributed architecture is designed to compress multi-source data processing latency to within 5 seconds through task splitting and containerized deployment, supporting 100000 level concurrent access and forming a “data model decision” full process closed loop. The multi-source data fusion and dynamic threshold adjustment mechanism further reduce the missed report rate and false alarm rate, verifying the feasibility of the system in business scenarios. Research has shown that this system effectively balances processing accuracy and real-time performance, providing technical support for accurate early warning of severe convective weather."

    "abstract": "Globally, human skin disease is considered the most contagious dermatological ailment. The dermatological ailments are the only diseases that are analyzed perceptually. Certain skin problems lead to both physiological and psychological stress that affects the patient's health. The application of smart devices in the dermoscopic analysis acquires images of various parts of the skin and face, which facilitates easy diagnosis. In some cases, invasive biopsies are necessary to improve skin disease classification. However, the classification of skin diseases is very challenging as the disease looks different in every case and has many variations in skin tones, and some security issues in maintaining patient information safe are important. Thus, several complications that take place in the classical skin disease classification model are tackled by considering novel deep learning techniques. In the initial phase, required dermatological images are sourced from the benchmark resources. Next, the collected images are provided to the skin disease classification phase. Here, Residual Squeeze-and-Excitation Networks with Hybrid Attention (ResSENet-HA) is employed to execute the skin disease classification. Finally, skin disease classified outcomes are attained from ResSENet-HA, and then different executions are carried out in a developed framework over classical schemes."

    "abstract": "Foundation Models (FMs) have been a major leap in AI, largely due to their massive scale and pre-training on enormous datasets. Incorporating private data at scale into FM pre-training presents a clear opportunity to capture domainspecific knowledge, improve personalization, and unlock proprietary value. Federated Learning emerges as a promising solution to this challenge, offering a privacy-preserving framework to leverage these private data resources for FM pre-training.Although federated pre-training of FMs from scratch is technically viable, there is currently no strategy for calibrating its training. Given that FM pre-training is already a highly resource-intensive task, executing it in a cross-device federated setting compounds the challenge by introducing limited and heterogeneous compute resources, increased communication overhead, and greater noise and variability in the training signal.We study transformer pre-training including hyperparameter tuning in a heterogeneous, cross-device federated environment with limited communication and small client datasets. Comparing simple and advanced federated optimizers, we find that Fed-Pop — a population-based learning algorithm that employs a tuning-while-training paradigm — performs particularly well for this setting."

Their ability to infer goals, decompose intentions into actions, and generate workflows positions them as a new paradigm for robotics, where adaptability to dynamic and unpredictable environments is crucial. In this work, we formalize the intention-to-workflow transformation for robotics as state-machine–like sequences of actions and propose a modular reference architecture that integrates perception, LLM-based reasoning, and execution. To evaluate this paradigm, we introduce a benchmark of 15 pick-and-place challenges across four categories, performed with a simulated robotic gripper arm and three distinct objects. Experiments with diverse LLM families reveal characteristic error modes, including failures in spatial alignment and object manipulation, while larger models demonstrate greater robustness in complex tasks. These results provide design guidelines for workflow generation in embodied AI and establish a reproducible benchmark. Our work lays the foundation for deploying LLMs as high-level controllers in robotic systems."

Researchers primarily focus on enhancing the functional correctness of the generated code while commonly overlooking its energy efficiency and environmental impact. This paper investigates the energy efficiency of the code generated by 20 popular LLMs for 878 programming problems of varying difficulty levels and diverse algorithmic categories selected from the LeetCode platform by comparing them against canonical human-written solutions. Although LLMs can produce functionally correct results in most cases, our findings show that the performance and energy efficiency of LLM-produced solutions are often far below those of human-written solutions. Among the studied LLMs, DeepSeek-v3 and GPT-4o generate the most energy-efficient code, whereas Grok-2 and Gemini-1.5-Pro are among the least energy-efficient models. On average, human-generated canonical solutions are approximately 1.17 times more energy efficient than DeepSeek-v3, 1.21 times more energy efficient than GPT-4o, and over 2 times more energy efficient than Grok-2 and Gemini-1.5-Pro. For specific algorithmic groups such as dynamic programming, backtracking, and bit manipulation, LLM-generated code can consume up to 450 times more energy than human-generated canonical solutions."

Precise and complete information related to cyber attacks can be utilised to create a reliable network security system that is able to adapt automatically, so that the network is better protected from future threats. Based on the Security Landscape of the National Cyber and Crypto Agency in 2023 there are <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$403,990,813$</tex> anomaly traffic which are considered cyber attacks. From the data above, an early detection system is needed using a Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) that always updates its rules to monitor network traffic. Information from Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) results is needed to update NIDS rules. CTI is analysed and relevant information about cyber threats that can be used to understand cyber attacks. The form of CTI results is Indicator of Compromise which contains a list of valid attack attributes. This research implements the AlienVault OTX Indicator of Compromise in MISP Threat Sharing to provide automatic rules updates and improve the performance of Suricata NIDS, Suricata is a NIDS with high detection accuracy because it applies several detection engines or multi-threading. The experimental results show that before the rules update, Suricata was unable to detect the tested attack scenarios, whereas after applying the updated rules from MISP Threat Sharing, Suricata successfully detected 100% of the three attack scenarios. In addition, the average processing time recorded was 347 seconds for fetching IoCs from OTX to MISP and 84 seconds for exporting rules from MISP to Suricata, indicating that the update mechanism can be executed efficiently."

    "abstract": "Electricity generation, transmission, distribution and retail were separated with the liberalization of the electricity market in Japan. An electricity retailer needs to create a procurement plan in order to purchase electricity from a power generation company and sell the procured electricity to subscribing customers. In order to create a reliable procurement plan, it is essential to forecast the amount of electricity demand. The purpose of this study was to accurately and quickly forecast electricity demand over a short period of time using historical supply and demand data for Japan. In order to achieve accurate forecasts, the CNN-Transformer-LSTM model, which is a combination of a Transformer model, a convolutional neural network (CNN) model, and a long short-term memory (LSTM) model is proposed. In this paper, an original dataset is developed using Shikoku Electric Power Company's electricity demand data and weather-related data from Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) within period 2016-2022. Simulation results shows that the proposed model CNN-Transformer-LSTM achieves the best forecasting performance compared to other methods. It was proven by the achievement of lowest score of root mean squared error (RMSE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) in every season data."

    "abstract": "Timely treatment and diagnosis anticipation are made possible by brain image segmentation, which is a decisive factor of modern healthcare. Shielding private patient information during cross-institutional model training is now probable with Federated-Learning(FL). Advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) for healthcare could be substantial with the combination of these technologies. But data imbalances are common in the medical field; some institutions have small datasets of annotated brain images, while others have bigger datasets with more varied cases. Segmentation accuracy and generalizability are negatively impacted by the non-independent distributed properties of such data. In order to tackle these problems, this paper suggests a model for segmenting brain tumor images on the client cross. The approach would use Virtual-Adversarial-Training(VAT) combined with a 3D U-Net to progress its efficacy on small datasets. This would solve the problems of data scarceness and imbalance in the FLenvironment by making the most of the BT-images that each client has. FedHG presents a powerful method for federated model aggregation that makes use of critical parameters, in this case the ‘weights’ obtained from a publicly available authentication dataset. Experiments on real-world data reveal that the suggested algorithm works better than the baseline FLalgorithm for brain tumor segmentation by 2.2%, and it performs slightly worse than centralized training by 3%, demonstrating its usefulness in the real world."

To address this, we propose a reputation-based consensus algorithm that evaluates nodes based on historical and current behavior. By combining behavior-driven reputation scoring with Verifiable Delay Function (VDF)-based leader election, our approach filters out low-reputation nodes while retaining cryptographic fairness, forming a hybrid mechanism atop the Raft protocol. We further enhance Raft’s log replication with reputation-guided strategies, prioritizing efficient replication. Experiments show that our protocol improves throughput by 10% without compromising security, demonstrating both reliability and performance gains."

In response to this problem, this paper designs an examination system based on consortium blockchain, namely Examchain. In this system, legal examinees’ access to the encrypted exam paper is controlled by attribute-based encryption (ABE) before the exam, the examinees’ scores are encrypted and stored in the blockchain after the exam. Through the blockchain, it is guaranteed that examinees’ scores cannot be deleted or tampered with, and the digital signature is used to avoid any dispute on scores. In order to reduce the storage overhead of the exam center, a cloud server is introduced to store the exam paper and examinees’ answers. Analysis and experimental results show that the proposed Examchain meets the design goals of the system."

We present a modular, multi-agent framework that employs Large Language Models (LLMs) to lower the entry barrier to data-driven mobility analysis. The pipeline extracts interpretable, policy-oriented insights from unstructured survey data and outputs structured reports without manual coding. We demonstrate the approach using Malmö’s 2023 travel survey for residents aged 65+, and benchmark its recommendations against those of (i) a single-agent LLM service (Single Agent), representative of current commercial offerings, and (ii) a human expert baseline (Human), both evaluated in a blinded expert review. The system achieves superior reasoning quality compared to the single-agent baseline, while performing slightly lower on interpretability and focus, and approaches expert-level quality overall—at a fraction of the cost and effort. Key constraints are the current lack of real-time data ingestion and dependence on proprietary commercial APIs. The study provides an open-source proof of concept showing how multi-agent LLMs can make urban mobility analytics more accessible, transparent, and timely. All code and evaluation materials are publicly available."

These algorithms are considered to optimize various parameters such as the Contention Window (CW) and number of UAVs, which is required to enhance the drone network throughput.

It features a layered system architecture and multimodal data collection mechanisms –capturing academic scores, behavioral patterns, and informal learning observations to support holistic, process-oriented assessment. Built on DingTalk’s cloud-based Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) infrastructure, the platform integrates real-time behavioral observations, teacher evaluations, and parent-submitted evidence. Key functionalities include AI-generated formative feedback, gamified point-based incentive mechanisms, and dynamic data dashboards, all designed to enhance the objectivity, student engagement, and instructional utility of assessments. Field data indicate the system’s effectiveness in addressing persistent challenges in traditional evaluation approaches-such as narrow performance indicators, limited reliability, and delayed feedback-while promoting well-rounded student development. The study also identifies persistent challenges: difficulties in integrating with legacy platforms, the complexity of interpreting unstructured behavioral data, uneven engagement among stakeholders, and concerns regarding data privacy and algorithmic transparency. These limitations suggest key areas for further investigation, including the responsible adoption of generative AI, development of lightweight and userfriendly evaluation modules, and studies examining crossregional scalability.

Performance was evaluated using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) in potassium ferrocyanide solutions, demonstrating a resolution of up to nanoampere order and stable operation on battery power for over ten consecutive scans. Moreover, we apply some approximations to transform the raw output to the referenced output provided by the commercial potentiostat PalmSens4. Experimental results show that the proposed dual-channel potentiostat achieves up to more than 94% accuracy. The work is potential for practical applications that require parallel and fast measurements using electrochemical method."

    "abstract": "A dual-band radar system using coherent fusion processing can significantly enhance the ranging resolution by exploiting two or more distinct bands. For instance, conventional dual-band radar receivers typically require two independent channels and frontends to perform frequency demultiplexing and modulation de-chirping functions separately, leading to large size, extra power consumption, and high cost. To overcome these limitations, we have developed a novel dual-band radar receiver chip based on the thin-film lithium niobate platform. Such a single integrated chip is designed to have a complementary periodic electro-optical response, which enables to both demultiplexing the bands and de-chirp the linear frequency-modulated (LFM) signal of the two sub-bands in the dual-band signal simultaneously. In the experiment demonstration, a dual-band LFM signal centered at 9.15 GHz and 16.05 GHz is used, where each sub-band has a 1-GHz bandwidth. Correspondingly, the photonic dual-band radar system using an integrated dual-function receiver has achieved a ranging resolution of 1.93 cm, through the coherent fusion processing of the dual-band signal."

    "abstract": "Assessment and feedback activities in higher education are undergoing significant changes. Many universities and institutes still rely on traditional testing and grading methods, which often fall short in supporting meaningful student learning, especially in large classes. Although educational policies, such as those promoted by the Bologna process, encourage more feedback-oriented and student-centered approaches, these practices can be difficult to implement due to time constraints and limited resources. Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), has shown strong potential in addressing these challenges. This review examines 21 research studies published between 2023 and 2025 that explore the use of GenAI in providing feedback and assessing student work in higher education, with some studies also comparing GenAI’s performance with human instructors. Findings show that LLMs can generate personalized and constructive feedback and/or assist with fair and consistent assessment. However, in most studies, teachers still play a key role, as expert oversight is essential to ensure that grading assessments and assignment feedback are accurate, relevant, and aligned with learning objectives. For GenAI to be used effectively, educators need to understand how to work with these tools, such as learning GenAI prompt design and the basic principles behind LLMs. We recommend that academic institutions provide training for educators in AI literacy, prompt engineering, and the development of teaching strategies that combine the strengths of human judgment with AI support. By effectively integrating LLM tools, major assessment challenges, such as limited time and inconsistent feedback quality, can be addressed while also enhancing student learning and engagement."

This study employs phase-resolved photon counting (PRPC) for PD detection due to its exceptional sensitivity and anti-interference capability. Three typical defect models - surface-attached metal, surface scratch, and metallic tip - were prepared. Using a custom-built detection platform, PD tests were conducted under incrementally increased step voltages, with PRPC data acquired based on timephase relationships. To address the challenge of parameter dependency in traditional clustering methods for optical PD pattern recognition, an adaptive K-means clustering algorithm optimized by the second-order difference elbow method was introduced. Experimental results demonstrate that the method automatically and accurately categorizes discharge states. Comparative analysis with conventional clustering methods confirms the superior performance of our approach in processing PRPC data, providing an effective solution for anti-interference intelligent diagnostics of GIS/GIL insulation conditions, and the effectiveness of the algorithm has been verified on field data."

As part of the LDPC coding process, a fixed puncturing strategy is applied to the information bits, which has been shown to improve system performance in eMBB scenarios. However, in URLLC and mMTC services, where transmissions are typically limited to short block lengths, the effect of information-bit puncturing may differ significantly.

    "abstract": "The combination of state-of-the-art deep learning technology which produces deepfakes causes major trust issues that affect people's ability to believe in digital materials. Most established detection methods analyze complete video frames even though they contain considerable useless background information. Such detection techniques perform worse while using more computational resources which makes them unpractical for real-time processing under resource-limited conditions. The proposed framework operates in real-time to detect deepfake changes specifically in facial areas because this is where the most likely fake modifications take place. The first step of the model uses Haar Cascade Classifiers to detect faces and separate them from the video frames. The facial regions undergo processing via MobileNetV2 to accomplish spatial feature extraction. A Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) network serves as part of the model to detect temporal inconsistencies found between video sequences because they act as synthetic content indicators. The model uses an attention mechanism to improve understanding and channel its analysis toward essential temporal video segments. The system assessment on Celeb-DF (v2) yielded 95.55 % accuracy along with 89 % F1-score, 82 % precision and 97 % recall. The system demonstrates high efficiency for differentiating between genuine and fake video footage. The model demonstrates optimized performance with minimal processing requirements which enables its real-time use in digital forensic probes as well as media authentication checks and safeguarding applications during security operations. This study suggests an efficient approach to counter the dangeroud deepfake threats through the combination of facial area extraction and deep learning spatial interpretation and sequence-level time research. The proposed system delivers high precision in detection and maintains sufficient lightness to work effectively in mobile and edge computational platforms."

This study presents a reinforcement learning (RL) framework based on the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm to determine the optimal capacities of chilled water tanks and heat exchangers for a pharmaceutical cleanroom HVAC system. A gym-based simulation environment was developed to model system dynamics and operational constraints, with multiple observation summarization strategies used to enhance temporal state representation. The reward function was designed to ensure cooling load satisfaction, minimize total energy use, and avoid frequent chiller cycling. Preliminary results demonstrate that the proposed RL framework can adaptively balance cooling load compliance and energy savings, and that transformer-based summarization shows potential for capturing complex temporal patterns in operational data."

From published RF circuit implementations, how to implement three-tap RF cancellation for active cancellation is introduced. Experimental validation confirms that 30-dB active RF cancellation meets the analog SIC requirement for advanced duplex operated in in-band full-duplex mode. These results demonstrate the feasibility of employing proven RF front-end techniques to enable advanced duplex in next-generation communications."

    "abstract": "Credit scoring plays a crucial role in financial decision-making but inherently relies on highly sensitive personal and financial data, raising significant privacy concerns. Conventional credit scoring systems expose raw data to centralized servers, creating vulnerabilities to misuse, unauthorized access, or data breaches. To address this gap, we propose a privacypreserving credit scoring framework based on the CKKS scheme of Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE), which enables arithmetic operations to be performed directly on encrypted data without decryption. Our approach allows clients to encrypt their financial attributes before submission, while the credit scoring model executes inference entirely in the encrypted domain, ensuring that sensitive inputs remain confidential throughout the process. The results demonstrate that encrypted inference achieves accuracy comparable to plaintext computation, with negligible loss due to CKKS approximation, while incurring overhead in terms of latency, ciphertext expansion, and memory usage. We further analyze the trade-offs between performance and security levels to identify practical parameter settings. This work represents a novel demonstration of end-to-end encrypted credit scoring using CKKS-based FHE, highlighting its potential for deployment in privacy-sensitive financial applications."

These attacks manipulate LLM inputs, causing models to reveal sensitive information, generate harmful outputs, or perform unauthorized actions, significantly undermining data security and user trust. To counteract these threats, we introduce a real-time, modular detection framework that leverages advanced machine learning and natural language processing techniques. Our approach classifies input prompts as benign or malicious using a lightweight DistilBERT-based model, deployed on AWS SageMaker for scalable, low-latency inference. When malicious prompts are identified with high confidence, they are blocked at the gateway layer before reaching the LLM runtime, and structured telemetry events are forwarded to CloudWatch for alerting and auditing. Extensive evaluations in a realistic AWS environment demonstrate that DistilBERT not only exceeds the precision of larger state-of-the-art transformers (such as BERT-base, RoBERTa-large, and DeBERTa-v3) but also provides significantly lower inference latency and reduced deployment costs compared with traditional machine learning algorithms. The system design ensures extensibility, seamless integration with cloud-native services, and supports explainability, as well as potential future enhancements such as reinforcement learning-based adaptive detection. The proposed framework thus offers a practical and reliable defense mechanism against evolving adversarial threats, thereby strengthening the security posture and fostering trust in cloud-based AI technologies across various industries."

This work introduces a novel bias mitigation strategy that integrates saliency-based attribution with a dynamically learnable neuro-fuzzy logic controller during model training. Unlike traditional fairness-aware models that rely on static constraints or post-hoc corrections, our approach embeds human-interpretable fairness rules directly into the loss function by penalizing models based on their reliance on sensitive features such as race, gender, and disability status. The fuzzy controller learns rule importance and feature saliency thresholds adaptively using differentiable membership functions and rule aggregation. Experimental validation on a synthetic dataset demonstrates that our method significantly reduces the saliency of sensitive features while maintaining classification accuracy. Comparative evaluations with a non-regularized baseline confirm that the proposed technique achieves superior fairness outcomes, validated with statistical significance testing. This approach offers a practical and interpretable pathway for enforcing fairness directly within neural decision-making systems."

Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, in which infected systems band together as a botnet to overwhelm the network and deplete its resources, are among the most serious dangers. This research suggests a machine learning-based method to identify and counter DDoS attacks in VANETs, with the goal of maintaining the uninterrupted operation of vital services and protecting motorists. To reduce data dimensionality and improve detection accuracy, a hybrid feature selection technique combining particle swarm optimization (PSO) and the bat algorithm was created. This method helped identify only the most relevant features, thereby reducing the computational overhead and enhancing model performance. The proposed PSO-BAT + XGBoost model significantly surpassed other models in detecting DDoS attacks, achieving 99.98% accuracy and 99% precision, as well as a low packet loss rate of 0.04 %. The results clearly show that the proposed method offers a highly accurate, efficient, and reliable solution for detecting DDoS attacks in VANETs."

Furthermore, the framework exhibits excellent generalization capability and computational efficiency. Specifically, convergence speed is measured by the number of training steps required for the average episodic reward to reach a stable plateau (within 5% variation over 500 consecutive steps), while final performance refers to the steady-state average return after convergence is achieved."

    "abstract": "CDMA (code division multiple access) is still an attractive multiple access technique and it has been studied by many researchers, especially most of the recent works are for optical (or visible light) communications. In a correlation receiver of CDMA communication systems based on direct-sequence (DS) spread spectrum techniques, the higher output level is more reliable than the lower one, but the information of the output level is not used in normal decoding and only its sign (+ or −) is utilized for recovering the information bit. In this paper, a simple error-correction method using single-parity-check (SPC) codes and correlation receiver output levels in optical SIK (sequence inversion keyed) DS-CDMA communications is proposed. Though the SPC codes are 1-bit error-detecting codes (i.e., they have no error-correction ability), we show by computer simulations that the proposed error-correction method can correct some error bits and finally reduce the bit error rate. A theoretical analysis of bit error probability after the proposed error correction is also given."

    "abstract": "Rapid and stable terahertz (THz) frequency tuning is crucial for emerging applications like 6G communications and integrated sensing and communication (ISAC). This paper demonstrates a novel optoelectronic scheme, employing fixed-wavelength lasers, tunable optical single-sideband modulation (SSBM), and optoelectronic photomixing in a uni-traveling carrier photodiode (UTC-PD) to achieve such agility. The system leverages the capability of SSBM for precise and rapid sideband control, achieving 6.3 GHz frequency sweeps around 300 GHz within 15 ns and supporting diverse modulation waveforms (step, triangular, sine). This approach offers a concise, efficient, and potentially cost-effective solution for advanced THz systems, significantly contributing to the development of flexible and high-performance THz sources."

The scheme aims to ensure data integrity under unstable wireless conditions while reducing communication overhead for short-length messages that are frequently transmitted. To improve upon conventional MAC aggregation techniques, we introduce a modified structure that not only incorporates controlled inter-message dependencies but also minimizes inter-bit dependency overlap by employing randomized bit selection. This design is intended to enhance resilience against message loss while progressively strengthening authentication guarantees with ongoing data reception."

However, existing image quality evaluation methods rely heavily on global metrics, which fail to capture the object-specific quality characteristics that critically influence detection performance in defense scenarios where environmental conditions and operational constraints create unique challenges. To address these fundamental limitations, we present a comprehensive data quality inspection framework that systematically employs 302 quality metrics organized across 14 specialized categories, enabling quantitative assessment of image datasets without requiring expensive computational infrastructure. Throughout extensive evaluation using the PASCAL VOC dataset, our GPGPU-based parallel processing system achieves over 100 images/sec throughput while generating comprehensive quality analysis, demonstrating both technical feasibility and cost-effectiveness for defense organizations with varying computational resources."

    "abstract": "A photonic-assisted scheme to generate broadband linearly frequency-modulated signal based on a Mach–Zehnder modulator (MZM) and a dual parallel Mach–Zehnder modulator (DPMZM) is proposed and simulated. The DPMZM is biased to derive carrier suppression even-order dual-sideband modulation and the MZM is biased between the maximum transmission point (MATP) and minimum transmission point (MITP) via a square wave. The switching of the bias states achieves the switching of the 1st order sideband and 2nd order sideband in the spectrum of MZM. In the simulation, the bandwidth of input linearly frequency-modulated (LFM) signal is expanded by 4 times and the time-bandwidth product (TBWP) is enlarged by 8 times. Meanwhile, the generated broadband LFM signal owns positive and negative dual chirp. The proposed scheme not only meets the requirements of the smaller range resolution and further range but also effectively resists range ambiguities in radar systems."

We formulate and operationalize an excellent ensemble learning model of diabetes prediction with a tuned neural network, a random forest regressor and a gradient boosting regressor in this research. Hyperparameter tuning was done with Keras Tuner to enhance predictive accuracy. The ensemble is also deployed as a function with Google Cloud Functions. We face and write about practical challenges concerning the inference latency of the TensorFlow inference, cold starting and resource constraints of a serverless architecture. Additional Performance benchmarking is done, and cold start and warm start simulation was performed and captured.

    "abstract": "Password managers are a cornerstone of modern digital security, offering features to generate and store strong, unique passwords. Despite their benefits, adoption remains inconsistent. This study investigates the behaviors and perceptions surrounding password manager usage and the adoption of randomly generated passwords (RGPs) among a cohort of 50 Indonesian users. Through a survey, we analyzed user demographics, their frequency of using password managers, trust in these tools, and password creation habits. Our findings reveal a significant gap between the availability of security features and their adoption. A majority of participants (62 %) have never used an RGP, and a significant 66 % prefer always to create their own passwords. Trust in password managers is varied, with a slight majority expressing trust, and it appears to be a factor in usage patterns. While a large number of users (74 %) recall seeing RGP suggestions, the nudge to use them is largely ineffective for this group. These results highlight a challenge in usable security: the mere presence of a feature does not guarantee its use. User trust and entrenched habits of manually creating passwords are significant barriers that need to be addressed to improve the security posture."

To overcome this, we propose a static grading method based on the Parso library, which is able to construct syntax trees for programs containing syntax errors by explicitly marking error nodes. Building on this, we introduce an erroraware grading framework that simulates human evaluation: student programs are analyzed to identify and classify syntax errors, critical errors are minimally corrected with penalties assigned by error category, and the corrected programs are assessed against reference solutions using structural and semantic similarity metrics. Experiments on exam data show that the method effectively handles erroneous programs and yields grading results closely aligned with human assessments."

To handle long input sequences efficiently, we combine a band-splitting strategy with dual-path architecture. Experiments show that our approach outperforms recent state-of-the-art models, achieving a cSDR of 11.03 dB—the best reported to date—and achieving substantial improvements in uSDR. Moreover, the model exhibits stable and consistent performance across varying input lengths and vocal occurrence patterns.

While several studies have attempted to automate handwritten text recognition, accurately transcribing medical prescriptions remains a critical hurdle for real-world deployment. This paper introduces a novel hybrid model that combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) networks, optimized with Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss, to address the complexity of non-printed handwritten prescriptions. The model integrates spatial feature extraction through CNN with sequential dependency learning via Bi-LSTM, thereby reducing misinterpretations and achieving high recognition accuracy on a segmented test dataset. The iterative training plan, which has been specifically developed keeping in mind computational efficiency, allows one to train continuously with minimal overfitting. The suggested solution manages variability in handwriting and prescription-text contextual dependencies well. Having an incredible recognition rate of 98.40, the study adds a powerful solution that makes the workflow of the clinic more efficient and efficient and makes the process of handling healthcare information more effective and efficient."

This study describes the physical design implementation of an RV32I RISC-V processor utilizing a 45 nm open-source PDK, with a focus on the effects of technology scaling and power optimization. The design was implemented using open-source tools like Yosys for synthesis, OpenROAD for placement and routing, KLayout for signoff verification, and OpenTimer for static timing analysis (STA). Clock gating was applied, leading to a 13.84 % reduction in dynamic power consumption, significantly improving power efficiency. A comparative analysis with a 130 nm implementation further demonstrated a 18.9 % reduction in total power, highlighting the benefits of smaller technology nodes. Furthermore, STA results indicated that the design satisfied all timing constraints, allowing for steady operation at 130 MHz with no timing violations."

In this work, we propose a framework that tackles this problem using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) within a Transformer–Graph Neural Network (GNN) hybrid model. The sequential strengths of transformers are combined with the relational learning capacity of GNNs, while GAN-based augmentation generates realistic synthetic protein sequences, enriching underrepresented classes and alleviating imbalance-driven bias. Using three benchmark datasets; DBPred, GraphBind, and UniProtKB the framework achieved state-of-the-art performance, with precision reaching up to 97% in PPI prediction and significant gains in Isozyme classification. This study underscores how GAN-enhanced modeling can overcome limitations of data scarcity and imbalance, and the dual advantage of hybrid deep learning and adversarial data augmentation, offering a scalable and generalizable approach for PPI prediction and Isozyme estimation. Moreover, the proposed model not only improves predictive performance but also enhances interpretability for more reliable applications of computational methods in DD and proteins analyses."

    "abstract": "Identifying at-risk students in English as a Foreign Language (EFL) learning is crucial for timely educational intervention, yet existing approaches often suffer from limited predictive accuracy and lack of interpretability. This paper proposes an interpretable machine learning framework that integrates LightGBM with SMOTE augmentation, feature interaction engineering, and SHAP-based explainability to predict at-risk EFL learners in Chinese higher education. We collected data from 400 university students, capturing psychological factors including language anxiety, self-efficacy, learning motivation, classroom environment perception, and teacher-student relationships. To address class imbalance, SMOTE was applied to augment minority high-risk samples. Feature interaction terms were engineered to capture non-linear relationships between psychological constructs. The LightGBM model was trained using gradient boosting with early stopping regularization. SHAP values were computed to provide both global feature importance ranking and local instance-level explanations. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework achieves superior performance (88.9% accuracy, 85.2% recall, 0.92 AUC) compared to baseline models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, and XGBoost. Ablation studies confirm that SMOTE improves recall by 10.6 percentage points, while feature interactions enhance accuracy by 2.7 percentage points. SHAP analysis reveals that language anxiety is the strongest predictor (SHAP value: 0.31), with interaction features accounting for three of the top ten most important factors. Case studies illustrate how SHAP-based explanations enable personalized interventions such as anxiety reduction strategies and environmental modifications. This work bridges the gap between predictive performance and practical utility, providing educators with a transparent, actionable tool for early identification and targeted support of struggling language learners. The proposed framework demonstrates the potential of interpretable machine learning to transform educational practice from reactive remediation to proactive, evidence-based intervention."

    "abstract": "Converter-fed synchronous machines for variable speed pumped storage hydropower plants are becoming increasingly important as the share of fluctuating renewable energy increases. The inverter connected to the stator terminals causes additional harmonic currents in the stator winding, which induce additional harmonic currents in the field winding. Due to the eddy current effects and the typical form-wound coil design, these additional harmonic currents in the field winding can lead to significant additional losses, even with relatively small amplitudes. The aim of this paper is to calculate these additional losses. Therefore, numerical calculations are used to determine the resistance factor for a frequency band from <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\text{0}\\,\\text{Hz}$</tex-math></inline-formula> to <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\text{15}\\,\\text{kHz}$</tex-math></inline-formula> while also considering saturation. In addition, two measurements are carried out on a research hydro generator at different inverter switching frequencies. Using the measured currents and determined resistance factors, the additional losses due to the switching frequency are calculated and validated using a temperature measurement in the field winding. The results of this work are important for the future design and cooling of large converter-fed synchronous machines with form-wound field coils, as the additional AC losses in the field winding are usually neglected."

    "abstract": "Social networks have become an integral part of our daily lives, providing an effective platform for communication, sharing information, and social interaction.With the explosive growth of social networks, the study of influence maximization (IM) in social networks has gained significant attention. IM refers to the process of identifying a small set of individuals, called influencers, who can initiate a cascade of events leading to the maximum spread of influence in the network. This paper proposes a non-dominated archived multi-objective simulated annealing (NAMSA) algorithm for detecting influencers in social networks. Our proposed algorithm maintains an archive of non-dominated solutions and uses a new mechanism to generate new solutions.We compare the results of the NAMSA algorithm with six other state-of-the-art algorithms and show that the NAMSA algorithm outperforms them. Furthermore, we propose a dynamicNAMSA(DNAMSA) algorithm suited for dynamic social networks and showthat it performs better than four existing algorithms. The time complexities of proposed NAMSA and DNAMSA are comparable with other algorithms considered for comparison, and all the results are statistically significant."

    "abstract": "Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) remote sensing images are characterized by high resolution, complex textures, and multi-scale ground object features, making their compression and reconstruction more challenging compared to natural images. To enhance the compression performance for UAV remote sensing imagery, this paper proposes an end-to-end deep learning-based compression network named UAVRS-CompNet. At its core, the model employs a Multi-scale Residual Bidirectional Pyramid Backbone (MRBPB) to replace traditional Generalized Divisive Normalization (GDN) and its inverse transformation IGDN modules, thereby strengthening feature extraction and reconstruction capabilities. Additionally, a Dual-Branch Synergistic Attention Module (DSAM) is introduced to achieve cooperative feature enhancement in both spatial and frequency domains, improving the model's adaptive feature extraction and representation capacity for complex textures and multi-scale objects. A dedicated UAV remote sensing image dataset containing diverse ground object types is constructed for comprehensive experimental evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms several state-of-the-art learning-based compression methods across various bitrates, achieving the best performance in both PSNR and MS-SSIM metrics. Furthermore, visual comparisons reveal that UAVRS-CompNet more effectively preserves ground object details and texture information, leading to higher-quality image reconstruction.

    "abstract": "Machine learning (ML), driven by prominent paradigms such as centralized and federated learning, has made significant progress in various critical applications. However, its remarkable success has been accompanied by various attacks. Recently, the model hijacking attack has shown that ML models can be hijacked to execute tasks different from their original tasks, which increases both accountability and parasitic computational risks. Nevertheless, thus far, this attack has only focused on centralized learning. In this work, we broaden the scope of this attack to the federated learning domain, where multiple clients collaboratively train a global model without sharing their data. Specifically, we present the first-of-its-kind hijacking attack against the global model in federated learning, namely HijackFL. The adversary aims to force the global model to perform a different task (called hijacking task) from its original task without the server or benign client noticing. To accomplish this, unlike existing methods that use data poisoning to modify the target model’s parameters, HijackFL searches for pixel-level perturbations based on their local model (without modifications) to align hijacking samples with the original ones in the feature space. When performing the hijacking task, the adversary applies these perturbations to the hijacking samples, compelling the global model to identify them as original ones and predict them accordingly. Extensive experiments demonstrate HijackFL significantly outperforms baselines, e.g., 92.75% vs. 10%. We further investigate the factors that affect its performance and discuss possible defenses to mitigate its impact."

    "abstract": "The development of the bolometer camera structural design is especially challenging because of the extreme environmental conditions within the vacuum vessel (VV) during plasma operation. Reliable measurements have to be assured while being subjected to high neutron fluxes as well as plasma radiation resulting in temperatures of the components exceeding <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$200~^{\\circ }$</tex-math> </inline-formula>C. In addition to the thermal loads, the bolometer camera housing is exposed to mechanical loads caused by electromagnetic (EM) forces during transient events of the plasma operation, called disruptions. Due to the fact that the surrounding structure of the diagnostic shield module (DSM) within the upper and equatorial ports was already determined in advance, extensive design adaptation of all bolometer cameras was required. Extensive numerical analyses were carried out with the aim of achieving structural stability of the camera main body on the one hand and thermal requirements on the camera and sensors on the other hand. In a multiphysics analysis loop, several cycles were performed, starting with the EM, followed by a thermomechanical and structural analysis. In addition, the seismic and gravity loads and load scenarios, like inductive and noninductive plasma radiation as well as fatigue cycles, need to be considered. This article gives an overview of such a comprehensive analysis on the example of bolometer cameras mounted in the upper port and presents the results achieved as well as the compromises taken."

    "abstract": "The growing resource demands of large-scale transformer models pose significant challenges for resource-constrained users, particularly in distributed environments. To address this issue, we propose a federated learning framework called Fed-Grow, which enables multiple participants to collaboratively learn a lightweight scaling operation that transfers knowledge from pretrained small models to a large transformer model. In Fed-Grow, we introduce the Dual-LiGO (Dual Linear Growth Operator) architecture, consisting of Local-LiGO and Global-LiGO components. Local-LiGO addresses model heterogeneity by adapting each participant's pre-trained model to a common intermediate form, while Global-LiGO facilitates knowledge sharing across participants without sharing local models or raw data, ensuring privacy preservation. This federated approach offers a scalable solution for growing large transformers in a distributed manner, where only the Global-LiGO is shared, significantly reducing communication overhead while maintaining comparable model performance under the same communication constraints. Experimental results demonstrate that Fed-Grow outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and precision, while reducing the number of trainable parameters by 59.25% and communication costs by 73.01%. These improvements allow for higher efficiency in training large models in distributed environments, without sacrificing performance. To the best of our knowledge, Fed-Grow is the first method that enables cooperative transformer scaling in a distributed setting, making it a practical solution for resource-constrained users."

    "abstract": "Sensor drift severely degrades the long-term reliability of electronic nose (E-nose) systems, as temporal and device-induced variations distort the feature distributions of gas responses. Existing drift compensation approaches often require labeled target-domain or calibration samples, which are difficult to obtain in practical deployments, and conventional pseudolabeling strategies are vulnerable to noisy labels under severe drift. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a robust pseudolabel-based subspace learning (RPSL) method for unsupervised E-nose drift compensation. RPSL employs a dual-stage pseudolabel filtering mechanism that selects high-confidence target samples via support vector machine (SVM) margins and further enforces prediction consistency through prototype learning. On the basis of these reliable samples, a unified subspace learning model is constructed to align source and target distributions by minimizing the mean, covariance, and prototype discrepancies while integrating graph embedding linear discriminant analysis (LDA) to increase discriminability in the projected space. Experiments on two benchmark E-nose drift datasets under multiple transfer settings show that RPSL achieves stable and high classification accuracy without requiring any target-domain labels, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness for practical drift compensation."

To achieve accurate time synchronization under these difficult conditions, New Radio (NR) NTN employs a combination of open-loop and closed-loop timing advances (TAs). However, when both TA mechanisms attempt to compensate for the same delay simultaneously, a phenomenon known as double correction may occur, leading to increased synchronization errors. To address this issue, the NR NTN employs a gradual timing adjustment for open-loop TA. This paper evaluates timing errors caused by double correction through computer simulations, considering various UE velocities and gradual timing adjustment rates."

The Tx front-end comprises a power divider (PD), a power amplifier (PA), and a distributed passive matching network (DPMN). To split the signal generated by the voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) into two amplitude-controlled paths, to Tx front-end and Rx, a power divider circuit based on an equivalent lumped element model is proposed, with optimization performed through EMX simulations. Due to priority of linearity, A Class-A biased gain controllable power amplifier is designed to achieve wide bandwidth while addressing non-linearity concerns, providing stable per-formance across the bandwidth, with a power-added efficiency (PAE) of 21.5%. The whole Tx front-end in a FMCW TWR chip delivers maximum 14dBm output with a drain efficiency of 7.8% (low power input from VCO buffer), occupying 0.704 mm2, The spectrum measurement results of the FMCW input signal and the actual target detection results of the TWR in multiple scenarios prove that the proposed Tx front-end has robust per-formance and stability, balancing linearity, area and band-width."

Here, the input Chest X-ray image is subjected to de-noising using the Kolmogorov–Wiener Filter. Then, lung lobe segmentation is performed by employing LadderNet.

We introduce a Multiagent NLP-based experimental framework, specifically designed to address prompt injection vulnerabilities through layered detection and metadata mechanisms. The framework orchestrates specialized AI agents to generate responses, detect vulnerabilities, and mitigate injection effects. An empirical evaluation of 500 engineered injection prompts was conducted, with ten different prompt injection categories properly generated and shuffled (50 prompts for each injection attack category). The experimental results show a significant reduction in the injection score and an increased detection of prompt injection markers, indicating potential applications for mitigation. Novel metrics—including Injection Success Rate (ISR), Policy Override Frequency (POF), Prompt Sanitization Rate (PSR), and Compliance Consistency Score (CCS)—are proposed to derive a composite Total Injection Vulnerability Score (TIVS). The system utilizes the vendor-independent OFP (Open Floor Protocol) framework for agentic AI communication via structured JSON messages. It encapsulates APIs using natural language while also comparing and extending a previously established multiagent experiment on hallucination mitigation to address the specific challenges of prompt injection."

In this work, we introduce a novel AI assistant system designed to support the planning and execution of such USAR missions by accepting natural language task descriptions and generating grounded task plans for the robotic system. Our copilot system facilitates coactive planning, dynamically adapting between autonomous execution, assisted operation, or teleoperation based on expected costs and operator-provided specifications. We combine the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) and graph optimization, leveraging information from a scene graph-based environment representation to propose a novel, robust framework that translates natural language instructions into a grounded sequence of actions.

This research will be focused on developing and deploying a machine learning predictive model capable of assisting in the identification of patients with the highest risks of developing HAIs within the hospital and take proactive interventions. Our approach used a detailed examination of electronic health records of $\\mathbf{1 5, 0 0 0}$ patients in various hospital units and performed the ensemble learning algorithm of Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost to compute demographic, clinical, laboratory, and procedural variables. Feature selection was performed using recursive feature elimination and importance scoring to identify the most predictive risk factors. The deployed model achieved an accuracy of 87.3%, sensitivity of 84.6%, specificity of 89.1%, and an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.912, significantly outperforming traditional risk assessment methods. Key predictive factors identified include length of stay, invasive device usage, antibiotic exposure history, and specific laboratory markers. As clinical implementation of this predictive model shows, the potential of decreasing the incidence of HAI by early detection and further prevention approaches is enormous, and patient outcomes and the decrease in the healthcare cost in favor of evidence-based infection control measures will ultimately improve patient outcomes and decrease healthcare expenditures, which is also supported by evidencebased infection control measures."

This investigation presents a hybrid machine-learning strategy (Random Forest (RF) and Gradient Boosting (GB)) for predicting and classifying kyphosis illness. In this work, clinical characteristics such as age, the number of affected vertebrae, and the angle of curvature are utilized. The dataset is preprocessed by addressing absent values and separating them into two training and testing sets. On the training dataset, distinct RF and GB classifiers were trained separately. The proposed method combines the predictions from both classifiers using a majority vote strategy to create the hybrid model. For each occurrence, the final prediction depends on the most frequently predicted class. Evaluate the efficacy of the hybrid model using measures of accuracy, precision, Recall, and F1-score. The results demonstrate that the hybrid model outperforms individual classifiers in classification accuracy, attaining 86%. Using the advantages of both algorithms, the hybrid technology provides a more robust and accurate classification model for kyphosis illness by combining their predictive capabilities. This study advances the field of medical diagnostics by demonstrating the effectiveness of combining machine literacy algorithms to improve disease prognosis.

Although SHA-256 offers good cryptographic security, it has to perform many arithmetic and logic operations on resource-limited platforms. As there is increasing concern for security, we need some secure protocols to maintain data confidentiality and integrity. We propose a secure compression hash function where an XOR-based Logic locking is incorporated to enhance security and logical integrity. Since some of the non-critical operations are performed in both software and hardware, we introduce a parallelized cryptographic execution to make sure our design runs with an execution time of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$2 \\mu \\mathrm{s}$</tex> providing a 99.8% reduction in computation time compared to a purely software-based implementation. The design was analyzed by several features, such as the avalanche effect, the entropy, the Hamming distance, the bit frequency distribution and it has satisfied all conditions, proposing a better secure compression hash function in RISC-V based SoC. The design shows an average Hamming distance of around 50% showing a strong avalanche effect and has an average entropy of 5 bits per byte. The timing and the hardware utilization compare a trade-off between hashing speed and the hardware efficiency ensuring a better throughput implementation. Thus, the proposed design is highly suitable for real-time embedded applications."

    "abstract": "Traditionally, Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) have provided navigation services primarily in the L-band. However, with the rapid expansion of global and regional navigation satellite systems such as GPS, Galileo, GLONASS, BeiDou, QZSS, and NavIC, the demand for L-band channels has increased substantially. This surge has led to more inter-system interference, and certain portions of the L-band are now approaching spectral saturation. Consequently, risks of degraded signal quality, reduced positioning accuracy, and impaired system interoperability have become more significant. By contrast, the S-band remains relatively underutilized and is considered a promising candidate for mitigating interference from navigation satellite systems. Nevertheless, it is susceptible to adjacent-channel interference from services such as Wi-Fi, Locata, and other satellite systems. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an interference-robust signal processing technique to improve the reception performance of BOC (Binary Offset Carrier) signals under partial band interference."

    "abstract": "Finding duplicates in large datasets is a challenge in managing data quality. Traditional methods often require a lot of computing power, making them difficult to use for large datasets. This study aims to create a method to find duplicates that is both fast and accurate. This reduces the computing workload while maintaining good performance. The method uses the Smith-Waterman algorithm to calculate similarity accurately and the Sorted Neighborhood Method (SNM) to select candidates efficiently. It also uses a scoring system that considers different attributes, such as names, addresses, phone numbers, and postal codes. To reduce the search, blocking strategies are used as an extra step. An experiment was conducted using real consumer data from a pharmaceutical company. The dataset contained 23,000 records and was kept private. The results show that the method achieves a 98.32% F1-score and reduces the computing complexity from <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$O\\left(n^{2}\\right)$</tex> to <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$O(n \\log n)$</tex>. The method was quick, processing the dataset in less than 100 ms. It reduced the pairwise comparisons by 90%. This demonstrates that the proposed method is effective for handling large duplicate detection tasks in the industry, improving both scalability and accuracy of the process."

    "abstract": "The intelligence of large language models is growing in the world and among the challenges faced are limited access to real-world data, privacy concerns and high manual annotation costs. Therefore, the creation of synthetic data sets using large language models (LLMs) has become an effective approach to overcome these problems. This study investigates the generation of accurate question-and-answer (QA) datasets using a publicly available document, the Malaysian Space Board Act 2022. We have implemented three approaches to create synthetic data: a straightforward approach that generates QA pairs from paragraph-level text, a well-established technique known as Retrieval Augmented Fine Tuning (RAFT), and a new method introduced in this research, Structured Contextual QA Generation (SCQA). The RAFT method slightly improved the accuracy of questions and answers by using question embedding to find the most similar documents in the vector store, while SCQA introduced a structured generation technique that generated questions and answer across different levels of understanding to improve contextual alignment and outperformed both other methods in accuracy. To evaluate the performance of each method, we conducted a comparative analysis focusing on the accuracy, relevance, and usefulness of the generated QA pairs. Among the three methods evaluated, SCQA consistently produced the most coherent and contextually aligned QA pairs, outperforming both the baseline and RAFT methods across semantic and traditional NLP metrics. Specifically, SCQA achieved a BERTScore of 0.655, an LLM coherence rating of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$4.2 / 5$</tex>, and cosine similarity scores of 0.868 (Q-Context), 0.901 (A-Context), and 0.876 (Q-A). These findings suggest that structured generation approaches such as SCQA can significantly improve the quality and reliability of synthetic datasets for LLM-based applications."

To evade such systems, attackers increasingly embed malicious information into images, rendering text-based detection ineffective. To address this challenge, we propose a multimodal spam detection framework based on multi-view complementary hybrid feature fusion (MV-CHiFF). The framework freezes the pretrained backbone to reduce the number of trainable parameters and constructs five complementary fusion paths to align semantic information from multiple perspec-tives-ranging from local to global and intra-modal to intermodal. A meta-classifier dynamically weights the probability outputs from each path, enabling dual-layer collaboration across the feature and decision spaces. Experiments on public multilingual spam datasets demonstrate that MV-CHiFF achieves up to 98.4% accuracy, validating its effectiveness in text-image hybrid spam detection scenarios."

This paper investigates the potential of hybrid quantum-classical neural networks to address this challenge in the context of multi-class brain tumor classification from MRI scans. We introduce a custom hybrid quantum machine learning (QML) model and conduct a rigorous comparative analysis against its purely classical counterpart, as well as established architectures such as ResNet-18 and VGG-16. Our findings demonstrate that the proposed hybrid QML model achieves a state-of-the-art test accuracy of 96.58%, matching the performance of the significantly larger ResNet-18 model. Crucially, the hybrid model outperforms its direct classical counterpart, the Classical Benchmark (96.20%), while utilizing approximately 80% fewer parameters. Although simulating quantum circuits results in longer training times, our findings highlight the remarkable parameter efficiency and competitive accuracy of hybrid quantum models, suggesting a promising direction for developing powerful yet lightweight networks for medical diagnostics."

The concept of knowledge building highlights the importance of sustained, idea-centered interaction among learners, aiming to develop shared community knowledge and reflecting a deeper understanding of knowledge as dynamic and generative. However, most existing implementations focus on computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) environments that are typically small in scale and reliant on complex technical systems, making them difficult to scale for large, open online courses. To address this challenge, we propose an instructional design framework grounded in the principles of knowledge generation. Implemented within a custom-designed online learning platform, our approach incorporates semantic network analysis to systematically track how learners’ ideas are distributed and evolve over time. Through this mixed-methods study, we found that learners generated authentic and varied ideas closely aligned with course content, and that sustained, idea-focused interaction fostered the growth of community knowledge. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of a knowledge generation–oriented online environment and offer practical insights for scaling general education courses in higher education."

The MFC generator is built based on an optoelectronic oscillator (OEO) as the core signal source, with the wideband MFC generated by integrating a coupled recirculating frequency up-conversion (FUC) loop. This unique architecture enables efficient multiplication of the frequency of the OEO signal, producing a stable and wideband MFC. The FUC loop, incorporating a microwave mixer, operates by iteratively up-converting and recycling the OEO signal, thereby extending the bandwidth of the MFC. In addition, by tuning the center frequency of a bandpass filter (BPF) in the OEO loop, the comb spacing can be tuned. The proposed scheme is experimentally evaluated. A wideband MFC with up to 16 comb lines from 2.12 to 34.23 GHz is generated. By tuning the BPF, tunable comb spacing at 2.12, 2.5, and 3.0 GHz is also demonstrated. Thanks to the high phase coherence between the comb lines, a pulse train with a repetition period that is reciprocal to the comb spacing of the MFC is generated."

Empirical validation was performed through longitudinal case studies with a tier-1 EV manufacturer across NA, EMEA, and Asia, where we compared traditional automation, purely autonomous systems, and Human-AI Collaborative approaches. Our analysis reveals a critical fragmentation in agentic toolkits and a significant operational disconnect between AI governance theory and operational deployment. In response, we developed the Integrated Agentic Foundry (IAF) framework, which integrates adaptive learning and multi-agent coordination. This framework showed remarkable improvements, including a 34% reduction in unplanned downtime (p<0.01), a 28% decrease in quality defects, and a 41% improvement in resource utilization. Notably, human-AI collaborative approaches consistently outperformed purely autonomous systems, proving large effect sizes (Cohen's d=0.72−1.14). This study redefines modern manufacturing intelligence by demonstrating that the future of smart manufacturing lies in human augmentation, not replacement.

A key enabling technology for achieving these ambitious goals, especially at millimeter-wave (mmWave) frequencies, is multibeamforming. This paper presents a comprehensive simulation and analysis of multi-beamforming techniques and Reference Signal Received Power (RSRP) measurements in a 5G NR mmWave communication system. Utilizing a MATLAB-based framework, we investigate the quantitative impact of various parameters, including antenna array configurations, carrier frequency, scatterer environments; transmit beamwidths, and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), on the achieved RSRP. The simulation demonstrates the critical role of larger antenna arrays and precise beam alignments in compensating for sever path loss at mmWave frequencies. Results show that RSRP is significantly influenced by antenna array size, experiences a substantial drop in FR2 compared to FR1, and varies with the complexity of the scatterer environment. The study provides valuable insights for optimizing 5G NR system design, beam management strategies, and validating theoretical models in dynamic wireless communication scenarios."

In this paper, we propose an approach to speaker recognition that is based on the use of Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) and Linear Predictive Coding (LPC) for feature extraction and the Gaussian Mixture Modeling (GMM) and Mahalanobis distance for classification criterion. For speech signals, both MFCC and LPC are used widely to extract representative features, for spectral and temporal characteristics. We use Gaussian Mixture Models to model the distribution of these features and the Mahalanobis distance to measure the 'How similar' between test speaker features and those in the model. Results of this research study show that the given method is more accurate, better than computing MFCC or as LPC alone in traditional speaker recognition system. Both feature extraction techniques and advanced statistical modeling are then integrated, producing better separation of speakers in varying acoustic environments."

A convolutional neural network (CNN) is trained on the constellation data to predict the optimal control parameters that maximize interference suppression under varying system conditions. The trained CNN model is deployed onboard MCU to enable adaptive feedback control. Experimental results show significant improvement in error vector magnitude (EVM) in the satellite Ku-band across 14 – 14.5 GHz, achieving values below 14% at trained frequencies and maintaining low EVM of 15.37% even at untrained frequencies. This work demonstrates for the first time, the deep learning-assisted photonic SIC on an embedded MCU platform, offering a cost-effective and energy-efficient solution for dynamic interference mitigation."

    "abstract": "Semiconductor wafer fabrication involves complex scheduling challenges with hundreds of processing steps, reentrant flows, and stringent operational constraints. Traditional dispatching rules lack adaptability to dynamic fab conditions, while optimization methods face computational scalability issues. This paper proposes a reinforcement learning framework that formulates wafer scheduling as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) with comprehensive state representation capturing equipment utilization, queue dynamics, and operational constraints. The multi-objective reward function balances throughput, cycle time, tardiness, and equipment utilization while respecting batching and setup requirements. Experimental evaluation demonstrates significant improvements over traditional methods, achieving 5.3% higher throughput, 21% reduction in tardiness, and superior equipment utilization across multiple performance indicators. The stable learning convergence validates the effectiveness of the proposed approach for dynamic semiconductor manufacturing environments."

In recent years, both learning-based and prior-based dehazing methods have been rigorously developed, yet each has limitations in haze removal performance. In this work, we propose the Adaptive Patch Size Dark Channel Prior Network (APSDCP-Net), a hybrid dehazing network that combines the dark channel prior with a learnable architecture. By reframing the dehazing problem as a patch size selection task, the proposed model combines multiple patch-sizes dark channels using learned soft weights, resulting in more accurate transmission estimation and enhanced dehazing performance. Experiments show that the proposed APSDCP-Net achieves superior performance compared to state-of- the-art dehazing methods."

    "abstract": "The need for precise stock price evaluation and projection is highlighted by the stock market’s increasing importance in the national economy, a topic that has attracted a lot of scholarly attention. Predictive modelling faces a very dynamic and difficult task when it comes to stock price movements, which are impacted by a variety of elements, including macroeconomic policy, industry news, capital flows, market sentiment, and corporate fundamentals. Rising volatility and increasing complexity are making themselves felt on the global stock markets; hence, there is a need for advanced prediction models that may incorporate financial, macroeconomic, and sustainability variables. This paper has therefore suggested a hybrid Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model that combines sentiment analysis of financial news and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) choice of features to predict stock market movements based on the aspect of economic sustainability. Historical stock price data, macroeconomic variables, and ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) scores for several global indexes between 2010 to 2024 are fed into the algorithm. The experimental results prove that in consideration of factors such as directional accuracy and predictive accuracy, the suggested LSTM-Hybrid framework performs better than any traditional LSTM or ARIMA model. Informed investment strategies can thus drive investors and policymakers toward economic sustainability in the long run."

Our system analyzes the internal intent of transactions to minimize conflicts, provides early feedback on likely failures, and considers user fairness during ordering. This approach reduces transaction failure rates and mitigates strategic behaviors, improving both system efficiency and user experience in permissioned blockchain environments."

For a CKM referred to as channel angle-distance map (CADM) proposed for near-field channels, we investigate the sensitivity of the CADM-assisted channel estimation to the number of stored multipath components for a given location. We explore how variations in the number of multipath components in CADM affect the mean squared error (MSE) performance in different signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. Simulation results reveal that a moderate overestimation of multipath components in CADM can improve the MSE performance in high SNR regimes, whereas excessive multipath data degrades the performance in low SNR regimes."

    "abstract": "As we enter the era of “Hybrid Intelligence”, it becomes increasingly important for educators to explore how collaborative learning can become more efficient with the support of Generative AI (GAI). Collaborative learning is a scenario where complex cognitive engagement occurs among group members. Therefore, by analyzing the distribution characteristics and temporal patterns of group cognitive engagement in GAI-enhanced environments, we can gain a deeper understanding of how the intervention of GAI shapes the temporal patterns of cognitive engagement within groups. Furthermore, by comparing high-performing (HP) groups with low-performing (LP) groups, we can gain a clearer understanding of the temporal patterns of cognitive engagement that contribute to better collaboration performances in GAI-enhanced settings. However, current research has yet to address this issue. To bridge this gap, this study primarily employs the process mining method—the first-order Markov model (FOMM)—to examine differences in the distribution characteristics and temporal patterns of cognitive engagement between HP groups and LP groups in a self-designed GAI-enhanced collaborative learning environment. For this purpose, 39 undergraduate students from a key university in China were recruited to participate in an online collaborative writing (OCW) task. The results reveal significant differences between HP and LP groups. Specifically, HP groups engaged in discussions related to specific writing knowledge inspired by the content generated by the GAI. Moreover, HP groups were more actively involved in articulating, elucidating, and analyzing their ideas during collaboration, while LP groups were more inclined to engage in process monitoring intermittently throughout the task. This study not only provides valuable theoretical insights into how GAI’s intervention affects the temporal patterns of group cognitive engagement, but also offers guidance for designing effective scaffolding strategies to promote more efficient collaborative learning outcomes in GAI-enhanced settings."

Researchers have developed a present-time sign language recognition platform which converts hand movements into written text and spoken words to make hearing-impaired users understand people who do not know sign language. Hand features can be extracted through Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in a system that operates with high accuracy to detect hand gestures. The system uses OpenCV-based skin segmentation and fuzzy c-means clustering methods for improving both gesture tracking and classification functionalities. The research investigates the recognition capabilities of American Sign Language (ASL) and Indian Sign Language (ISL) because they are commonly used by signers globally. The established model operates at an 88% success rate for transforming sign language signals into spoken text. The system benefits people with disabilities yet extends its functionality to human-computer interaction interfaces, gesture-controlled automation systems, and assistive technologies. This research combines deep learning approaches to create a solution connecting the deaf and mute community to standard communication through an accessible solution for sign language interpretation across realworld environments."

A total of 23 indicators covering economic, demographic, and spatial dimensions were standardized and reduced using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), retaining over 95% of the total variance. Clustering was performed using K-means, DBSCAN, and agglomerative clustering. Internal validation with the Silhouette Score and Davies-Bouldin Index (DBI) showed that agglomerative clustering with three clusters achieved the best performance, with a Silhouette Score of 0.313 and DBI of 0.871. External evaluation using the Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) indicated that KMeans achieved the highest structural alignment. Spatial mapping revealed that the three-cluster agglomerative model outlined macrozones such as urban cores, transitional interiors, and peripheral islands, whereas the five-cluster KMeans model provided finer distinctions by identifying urban-industrial corridors, highland tourism areas, and emerging servicebased municipalities. DBSCAN exposed structural ambiguity, with a four-cluster configuration mirroring KMeans patterns but highlighting uncertain regions through a 36.4 % noise rate, whereas a three-cluster setting captured broader groupings with lower noise. These results demonstrate that unsupervised learning can produce flexible and interpretable regional classifications to support adaptive and evidence-based spatial planning."

Motion and click inputs are captured in real time, processed on the ESP32, and transmitted via Bluetooth to a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+, which emulates a universal Human Interface Device (HID). The Raspberry Pi converts the received data into standard mouse control signals compatible with laptops, smartphones, projectors, and smart TVs.

As modern IC designs integrate more functionality, the time and resources required for verification continue to escalate. Ensuring accurate functionality at different abstraction levels is crucial in system design. In addition, simulation tools often involve a trade-off between simulation speed and accuracy. This trade-off is too extreme for analog simulation especially, due to non-linear behaviour and the possibility of wide range of values at each node, making these simulations time-consuming. A black-box model leveraging polynomial regression technique has been proposed to address this issue. Charge Pump and Ring Oscillator circuits are selected for the verification of the proposed technique. Although analog simulator takes significant overhead in simulation time, Spectre has been used for benchmarking the circuits due to its high accuracy. The black-box model proposed is developed using the data collected from Spectre with a focus on output parameters without considering the intermediate nodes. The regression technique relates the input and the output parameters using a multi-degree polynomial to obtain average output values. This is implemented in SystemVerilog using Real Number Modeling (RNM). Then the average output values are assigned to EEnet (U ser Defined N ettype) by behavioral modeling. This novel curve fitting polynomial approach reduces the prolonged simulation time thereby meeting the Time-to-Market requirements."

An Attention mechanism improves interpretability and the focus on key parts to raise the model's clinical importance. To enhance model performance, we also propose a custom feature, the Beat-to-Beat Variability Index (BBVI) which is aimed at capturing subtle changes in the patient's heart rate which are linked to arrhythmias. The proposed model was trained and tested on PTB-XL and MIT-BIH Arrhythmia benchmark datasets, obtaining remarkable results with a classification accuracy of 98.8%, an F1-score of 97.9%, and an AUC of 0.992. For evaluating the model's practical applicability, the ECG classification algorithm was integrated into a SimPy-based simulation of a real-time healthcare diagnostics and a semi-automated ECG reading system with model-driven patient flow simulation, edge AI inference delays, and physician feedback loops. An average inference time of 0.49 seconds, a high system throughput of 85 patients per hour, and minimal latency regardless of load conditions. This confirms the model's effectiveness in limited-resource environments such as rural clinics and portable medical devices. This combination model improves accuracy while at the same time providing answers to many important issues of interpretability, efficiency, and deployability, making it a next-generation AI-based diagnostic system for CVD."

    "abstract": "Speech is a vital medium of communication among people. Once the communication medium is abnormal, it enlarges the complexity of communication. Speech Dysarthria is a disease where speech muscles become weak, and it is challenging to convey or else speech verbally. Patients who suffer from speech dysarthria might not comprehend that this disorder is a sign of manifold other illnesses, and it can predict a condition such as stroke. To help the clinical analysis of dysarthria and to evade the problems related to clinical evaluations, automatic dysarthric speech recognition models can be employed. In recent times, deep learning (DL) has been popular and commonly employed in medical treatment. To accurately and objectively analyze patients with dysarthria, many researchers are utilizing DL to progress automatic recognition of dysarthria. This study presents a Dysarthria Speech Recognition Framework Using Optimized Convolutional Recurrent Model with Optimization Algorithm (DSRF-OCROA) model. The aim is to develop a reliable system that can precisely detect and classify dysarthric speech. In the audio pre-processing stage, the DSRF-OCROA approach applies a non-stationary noise reduction technique to improve the quality of audio signals. For the feature representation process, melspectrogram is used to convert raw speech signals into timefrequency representations for improved analysis. The convolutional long short-term memory (C-LSTM) technique is then employed in the accurate dysarthria speech classification process, and the jellyfish search (JS) approach is used for parameter selection. To comparison study of the DSRF-OCROA model illustrated a superior accuracy value of 92.70% over existing approaches under the Dysarthria detection dataset."

However, even slight radial, angular, or axial displacements introduce intermodal crosstalk to the system, which degrades throughput and link reliability. In this paper, we present a decomposition-based configurable multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (CMOEA) that jointly optimizes topological charge spacing, multi-input-multi-output equalizer tap count, and tip-tilt control bandwidth in order to minimize misalignment-induced crosstalk while bounding digital signal processing and servo costs. With the simulation environment, we achieved over 99% capacity recovery and effective crosstalk suppression within 16.4 seconds of processing time, outperforming conventional approaches. Our framework supports adaptive reconfiguration with robustness to maintain optimal performance under varying communication conditions."

Simulation results confirm that the proposed scheme consistently achieves higher classification accuracy than conventional mapping strategies, particularly under low signal-to-noise ratio conditions."

    "abstract": "Dynamic cyber threats are increasingly menacing the agility of cloud computing. Dynamism is required in solutions, given that the conventional methods of security are not dynamically compatible within the changing environment. In order to overcome these limits a hybrid anomaly-based solution is developed which is a kind of enhancement of Software-Defined Perimeter (SDP) with enhanced algorithm in order to make detection more scaled and more accurate. The model proposed will utilise the autoencoders, One-Class SVM, Isolation Forest, and SDP in respect to threats to secure the preprocessing of the data and real-time threat detection. By the combination of these elements, cloud infrastructure efficiency and security are guaranteed along with the detection of anomalies. The objectives of the research are to promote scalability, improve access control, provide more effective anomaly detection and provide efficient data protection in cloud systems. With an accuracy of 96.5, precision of 94.8, recall of 95.2, and a marginally high false positive rate of 2.4 this comparison of the model with the traditional methods shows that better accuracy is achieved by the model. Overall, this composite approach offers scalability, the improved privacy of the data, and the immediate detection of the threat and the improved cloud security."

    "abstract": "Excessive local electric field strength due to pulsed excitations may cause deterioration of electrical insulation in power devices. Although dielectric functionally graded insulations (d-FGIs) can be adopted to relieve this issue, a critical concern arises in the optimal selection of the dielectric parameters (conductivity/permittivity). To solve this problem, this article applies a multiobjective optimization approach based on the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II). Specifically, to self-adapt to the change in the electric field, the dielectric parameters are nonlinearly characterized as exponential functions of the electric field. The nonlinear coefficients of dielectric parameters are essentially determined by a tradeoff among the maximum electric field, the electric field nonuniformity, and the volume/layers of the nonlinear dielectric. A needle–plate and a bushing model are considered as examples, and axisymmetric finite element models are implemented for the evaluation of the distribution of the electric field. For comparison, a double-layer and a multilayer dielectric gradient configuration for the case of the needle-plate are assessed. A multilayer d-FGI bushing model is then investigated for simplicity. The optimization results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach for the homogenization of the electric field under pulsed excitations."

    "abstract": "This study presents a method for reconstructing sparse-view panoramic images using a spectrally tuned Gaussian-notch (STGN) filtering framework to support low-dose dental imaging. The approach consists of three steps: 1) acquiring projection data with reduced angular sampling on a clinical panoramic system, 2) reconstructing images using the shift-and-add (SAA) algorithm, and 3) designing an STGN filter in the Fourier domain to selectively suppress periodic stripe artifacts induced by undersampling. The method was validated using numerical simulations and physical phantom experiments under 75% and 50% sampling conditions, corresponding to estimated dose reductions of 25% and 50%, respectively. Monte Carlo simulations were also performed to estimate absorbed doses in radiosensitive organs such as the thyroid, salivary glands, and eye lens. The results show that the proposed method effectively removes periodic stripe artifacts while preserving anatomical structures, yielding image quality comparable to that of full-view reconstructions. The framework is computationally efficient, requires no hardware modification, and can be readily integrated into clinical workflows, enabling substantial dose reduction without compromising diagnostic performance. Beyond dental imaging, the proposed frequency-domain strategy is also applicable to non-medical imaging and inspection systems—such as security screening, cargo inspection, and nondestructive evaluation—where structured detector artifacts similarly degrade image quality."

Korteweg–de Vries–Zakharov–Kuznetsov (KdV–ZK) equation that governs the evolution of these nonlinear structures is derived. A detailed numerical analysis of the KdV–ZK equation is conducted, utilizing plasma parameters representative of Earth’s inner magnetosphere and considering a low spectral index of <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\kappa = 0.2$</tex-math> </inline-formula> for the hot electron population. The numerical results reveal that the soliton propagates at a velocity exceeding the effective electron acoustic speed of the medium. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that both the electrostatic potential amplitude and the associated electric field strength exhibit a positive correlation with the soliton speed, whereas the soliton’s spatial width shows an inverse relationship. Additionally, the influence of the propagation angle relative to the background magnetic field indicates that larger angles generally lead to the formation of solitons with greater widths and weaker electric fields. The results obtained can provide insight into explaining the observed electrostatic soliton structures in space plasmas."

    "abstract": "Accurate boundary detection between distinct classes is a major challenge in the semantic segmentation of remote sensing images. A widely used strategy involves dividing large images into patches for classification, which requires carefully prepared training, test, and validation datasets. When the resolution of the input image exceeds that of the available labels, upsampling the labels to match the image resolution often leads to suboptimal results. To address this issue, we propose an alternative approach, Adaptive Patch Reshaping (APR), that subdivides both the input image and label patches, then reassigns them to classes according to an information-theoretic criterion. By reshaping patches based on their similarity to representative class characteristics, this method constructs a new training set from the original one. Experimental results using Sentinel-2 imagery demonstrate that the proposed technique, implemented with a lightweight CNN, achieved a classification precision of 89% for the training set, 86% for the test set, and 81% for the validation set. Furthermore, comparative analysis confirms that APR improves the delineation of boundaries between regions, yielding higher F1-scores and Structural Similarity Index values compared to standard patch-based baselines."

The growing adoption of VR/AR applications that aim to transmit digital human avatars over bandwidth-limited video networks has driven the need for VQA algorithms that better account for the kinds of distortions that reduce the quality of rendered and viewed avatars. As we will show, standard VQA models often fail to capture distortions unique to the rendering, transmission, and compression of videos containing human avatars.

We show that HoloQA is able to achieve state-of-the-art performance on the recently introduced LIVE-Meta Rendered Human Avatar VQA database, demonstrating its efficacy in predicting the quality of rendered human avatars in VR.

    "abstract": "Lactate is an important biomarker for assessing metabolic function, diagnosing lactic acidosis, and evaluating tissue hypoxia. It is also crucial for monitoring athletic performance in professional and high-level amateur athletes. This paper presents a novel resonator-based wireless active sensing tag for lactate detection in saline solutions. The proposed system integrates a three-port split-ring resonator (SRR) sensor, a wideband amplifier, and an RF switch within a closed-loop oscillator architecture, generating two distinct oscillation frequencies corresponding to the first and second SRR resonance modes. This dual-mode operation allows the active sensing tag to provide sufficient information to determine the concentrations of individual components in a three-component mixture. A wideband antenna is employed for wireless signal transmission, and a microcontroller with a web-based interface enables remote control of the RF switch for frequency selection. Experimental results show that oscillation frequency shifts correlate reliably with the real permittivity of the material under test (MUT), enabling accurate estimation of lactate concentrations across various salt levels. For lactate concentrations ranging from 0 to 2000 mmol/L, polynomial regression yields a mean absolute error (MAE) of 4.567 mmol/L for lactate and 1.050 mmol/L for salt. For lower lactate concentrations ranging from 0 to 100 mmol/L, the model achieves an MAE of 0.752 mmol/L for lactate and 1.320 mmol/L for salt. The proposed sensing system offers non-invasive, wireless, and real-time detection of three-component mixtures, enabling reliable detection of lactate concentrations in complex saline environments."

Link segmentation uses alternating fibers with a slight shift of the ZDW towards shorter and longer wavelengths respectively. 3.2 Tb/s systems, enabled by 16×200 Gb/s 112 GBd PAM-4 signaling with 400 GHz spacing, are simulated for 2 km and 10 km O-band links. The effects of polarization-mode-dispersion on FWM and the tradeoff between nonlinearities and dispersion are studied in detail. Deviations of fiber characteristics and the resulting fluctuations within standard links are taken into consideration. It is shown that link segmentation successfully reduces the FWM penalty to almost zero. The results can be useful for the implementation of next-generation intra data-center networks."

    "abstract": "Quantum computing has been combined with deep learning, and this has created new opportunities to accelerate dataintensive applications and add more computational intelligence. Quantum-Assisted Deep Learning (QADL) uses the capability of quantum parallelism to address the limits to training and scaling of conventional neural networks. But applied to the high-performance cloud infrastructures (HPCIs), QADL experiences some challenges, including quantum-classical synchronization delays, inefficient resource usage, and weak scalability to dynamic workloads. In the attempt to overcome these issues, it is proposed in this paper (QADROT), Quantum-Assisted Deep Reinforcement Optimization of Intelligent Training, a new optimization model of effective hybrid computing. The Q-ADROIT uses a quantum-controlled reinforcement learning to allocate computational tasks in both quantum and classical computers dynamically. It combines an adaptive entanglement-based scheduler to reduce the data transfer latency and a hyperparameter tuner that is self-optimizing and uses quantum sampling to enhance convergence and accuracy. Empirical investigations using benchmark data demonstrate that Q-ADROIT outperforms the current models by 41 percent improvement in training speed, a 29 percent decrease in latency and predictive accuracy. In general, Q-ADROIT can greatly enhance the efficiency, scalability and energy optimization of the QADL systems in cloud infrastructures."

    "abstract": "As CMOS scaling approaches its physical limits, conventional single-channel amorphous oxide semiconductor (AOS) thin-film transistors (TFT) face critical challenges related to stability and low carrier mobility, limiting their suitability for ultra-low power, beyond-CMOS applications. This work presents coplanar multi-channel InGaZnO/InZnO quantum-effect transistors and investigates how the quantum effect governs electronic conduction, aiming to overcome key performance and reliability barriers in nanoscale devices. From experiment and simulation, we analyze the formation of quantum confinement between oxide semiconductor layers with two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) and its impact on TFT behavior. Technology computer-aided design (TCAD) results show that the observed threefold enhancement in mobility in multi-channel TFTs arises from quantum confinement effects enabled by a significant conduction band offset (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\Delta \\mathbf{E c}$</tex>) at the <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{I n Z n O} / \\mathbf{I n G a Z n O}$</tex> hetero-interface. Furthermore, tuning the carrier concentration in the oxide semiconductor layers allows precise control over TFT characteristics, revealing that the bottom oxide layer plays a more dominant role than the top in governing 2DEG formation and quantum confinement distribution. This study highlights the potential of heterointerface engineering in multi-channel oxide TFTs with quantum confinement effect as a strategy to enable high-mobility, low-power devices suitable for next-generation beyond-CMOS electronics."

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly prevalent in natural language processing applications due to their strong performance on a wide range of language tasks. However, their outputs are still prone to inconsistency and flaws, limiting their reliability. To address these limitations, we explore Mixture-of-Agents (MoA), an existing ensemble method that aggregates responses from multiple LLMs, which has been proven to enhance performance. Building upon this approach, we attempt to evaluate the effectiveness of Self-Mixture-of-Agents (Self-MoA), an innovative ensemble method that aggregates outputs only from a single top-performing LLM. This raises the central question of whether Self-MoA can yield measurable performance improvements. To evaluate the efficacy of Self-MoA, we evaluated Self-MoA across multiple models and datasets to assess its performance. Additionally, we applied supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to assess its impact on performance. Our results show that Self-MoA improves performance only on certain models. We hypothesize that the size of the model, the consistency of the model, and the purpose of the model all contribute to the effectiveness of Self-MoA. However, applying SFT yielded no improvement."

Verilog-A models are commonly used to simulate memristor behavior in circuit designs, enabling designers to test and validate memristive dynamics without physical hardware. A novel conductance mapping mechanism has been developed for finding out the conductance value to be programmed into a memristor based on the ANN weights. The framework is verified by implementing equations of ANN using the Verilog-A model of memristor."

    "abstract": "Against the backdrop of the global energy structure transition towards low-carbon development, the scale of photovoltaic (PV) power generation continues to expand, placing higher demands on the safe and stable operation and system maintenance of PV plants. Traditional detection methods exhibit limitations in efficiency, accuracy, and early fault identification, while deep learning offers novel solutions for PV anomaly detection. This manuscript provides a systematic review of research progress in deep learning-based fault diagnosis methods for PV systems. It begins by analyzing common types of anomalies in PV systems and their characteristics, then elaborates on detection methods based on time-series data and image data: the former utilizes models such as RNN and LSTM to model the relationship between power generation performance and environmental variables for power prediction and early anomaly warning; the latter employs visual models like CNN and YOLO to process infrared and electroluminescence (EL) images for the identification and localization of component defects. The article also summarizes the application of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in data augmentation. Results indicate that deep learning methods significantly outperform traditional approaches in detection accuracy, automation level, and generalization capability. However, challenges remain, including strong data dependency, insufficient model interpretability, and difficulties in engineering implementation. Future research should focus on fewshot learning, multi-modal fusion, lightweight models, and integration with physical mechanisms to promote the practical application and development of intelligent O&M systems for PV power generation."

    "abstract": "Dissolved gases in transformer oil are important diagnostic indicators of transformer operating conditions. To overcome the limitations of traditional single models in fusion of multi-gas signal information and dynamic response capabilities, this paper proposes an integrated modeling method based on a multivariate variable-weighting mechanism. First, based on the time-series characteristics and nonlinear variation of dissolved gas data, autoregressive moving average (ARMA), gray prediction model (GM), and Transformer-based deep time-series modeling methods are constructed as base prediction models. These models build a multivariate prediction structure from the perspectives of linear trend modeling, gray system approximation, and complex time-series feature extraction. Then, a variable-weighting distribution module based on long short-term memory (LSTM) network is designed, which dynamically outputs the optimal combination weight over time by learning the signal features. Finally, the prediction results of each base model are integrated according to the weights, forming a multivariate variable-weighting combination prediction model. Validation using large-scale real-world data covering multiple substations and operating conditions shows that the proposed multivariate variable-weighting combination prediction model delivers high accuracy and stability."

Traditional diagnostic procedures rely heavily on clinical expertise and biopsy techniques, which may be time-consuming, subjective, and hard to get to in remote places. This study looks at how to use improved deep learning (DL) methods to automatically diagnose and classify skin cancer in order to make detection more accurate and reduce the need for human evaluations. The suggested model uses an advanced Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture, together with advanced image preprocessing, data augmentation, and transfer learning, to sort dermoscopic images into two class, such as melanoma and benign lesions. The model is trained and tested using a medical dataset that everyone could access. For measuring performance, accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and the confusion matrix are all important indicators. The new DL technology works better than older CNN models because it can generalise and adapt better to different types of skin lesions. The findings show that DL is a reliable tool for finding skin cancer early."

An evaluative challenge facing FER algorithms is the fall in performance when detecting spontaneous expressions compared to posed expressions. An ethical (and evaluative) challenge facing FER algorithms is that they tend to perform poorly for people of some races and skin colors. These challenges are linked to the data collection practices employed in the creation of FER datasets. In this study, we audit two state-of-the-art FER datasets. We take random samples from each dataset and examine whether images are spontaneous or posed. In doing so, we propose a methodology for identifying spontaneous or posed images. We discover a significant number of images that were posed in the datasets purporting to consist of in-the-wild images. Since performance of FER models vary between spontaneous and posed images, the performance of models trained on these datasets will not represent the true performance if such models were to be deployed in in-the-wild applications. We also observe the skin color of individuals in the samples, and test three models trained on each of the datasets to predict facial expressions of people from various races and skin tones. We find that the FER models audited were more likely to predict people labeled as not white or determined to have dark skin as showing a negative emotion such as anger or sadness even when they were smiling. This bias makes such models prone to perpetuate harm in real life applications."

The benefits of applying AI in education, such as making tasks more efficient and helping students generate ideas when writing, are impressive but also bring some serious challenges. One of the primary concerns is that students may rely too heavily on AI for tasks, which could diminish their critical thinking abilities. The purpose of this study is to examine the impact of elementary school students’ AI literacy on their creative thinking abilities and whether programming duration moderates this impact. It is quantitative research. Participants are one hundred forty-nine public elementary school students in Suzhou, Zhejiang Province of China, one of the most developed provinces in the country. The results show that students who learned programming outperformed significantly those who did not learn programming in both AI literacy and creative thinking abilities. Moreover, children’s AI literacy significantly predicts their creative thinking abilities. The analysis showed that the higher AI literacy scores children have, the stronger their creative thinking abilities are. Last but not least, children’s programming duration significantly moderates the relationship between their AI literacy and creative thinking abilities."

    "abstract": "The problem of exploiting large language models (LLMs) for solving optimization problems is new and existing papers rarely address the enhancement of standard solvers through LLM capabilities. We introduce an approach to augment gradient descent algorithms (GDAs) by adopting an agentic perspective. Indeed, GDAs remain central to optimization and modern machine learning, yet its efficiency often depends on brittle and time-consuming hyperparameter tuning. We investigate whether an LLM can contribute inside a running gradient method for smooth, unconstrained, single-objective standard-form optimization problems (SFOP) with known or estimable gradients. We present Augmented GDA (AGDA), an LLM in-loop controller that monitors progress and adapts learning-rate schedules in real time while keeping the optimizer family fixed within each run. This places the LLM where feedback is most informative, reducing manual trial-and-error without altering the numerical core. Experiments on benchmark functions and two famous deep learning tasks show that in-loop scheduling is competitive with strong static baselines and can yield faster convergence or lower loss."

    "abstract": "Extreme weather significantly increases distribution network failures, impacting power supply reliability and economic efficiency, while traditional prediction models often neglect meteorological factors. To quantify the impact of weather on failures, this study utilizes outage records and meteorological data from a specific region between 2022 and 2024 to construct a “weather-failure” coupled dataset. It proposes an XGBoostbased distribution line failure prediction model. The model extracts features including daily precipitation, temperature and humidity, wind speed, and cumulative rainfall. Separate classification models are trained for four equipment types: overhead lines, cable lines, pole-mounted equipment, and transformers. Hyperparameters are optimized through five-fold cross-validation, with the model outputting fault probabilities and calculating line fault indices. On the test set, the model achieved accuracies of $\\mathbf{0. 8 6}, \\mathbf{0. 9 4}, \\mathbf{0. 8 8}$, and $\\mathbf{0. 8 9}$ for the four equipment types, with F 1 scores of $0.87,0.96,0.91$, and 0.93, respectively. This demonstrates the model’s ability to effectively capture the nonlinear relationship between meteorological variables and failure probability. The high-risk lines identified based on predicted probabilities align with actual outage occurrences. This method provides quantitative evidence for distribution companies to conduct preventive maintenance and formulate meteorological risk control strategies during extreme weather, thereby enhancing the resilience of distribution networks."

    "abstract": "Against the strategic backdrop of China’s “dualcarbon goals”, the installed capacity of new energy has grown rapidly. However, the uncertainty of new energy generation leads to intermittent and fluctuating power output, posing severe challenges to the stability of power systems. Concentrating Solar Power (CSP) is characterized by large capacity, low loss, and fast response and regulation, which is of great significance for accelerating the construction of a new energy system. Based on field investigations of photovoltaic-concentrating solar power (PVCSP) joint projects, this study constructs a mathematical model of the molten salt CSP system. With the goal of maximizing the revenue of the joint system, it establishes a PV-CSP joint optimal operation model that considers medium- and long-term contracts, the day-ahead market, and auxiliary services, and designs a case study to verify its feasibility and economic efficiency. This research provides a reference scheme for the optimal operation of PV-CSP systems."

The proposed ADC achieves robust performance and wide bandwidth by leveraging an open-loop structure and highly digital building blocks. The nonlinearities of the coarse and fine VCO-based quantizers are alleviated by distortion cancellation and voltage swing reduction techniques, respectively. A process and temperature calibration scheme is employed to mitigate the resolution degradation caused by KVCO frequency variation under process and temperature variations, aligning the KVCO closely with the desired gain. Benefiting from the intrinsic dynamic element matching the VCO-based quantizer output, the matching requirement of the DAC cells is greatly relaxed.

The quantizer adopts an over-range tolerant scheme to enhance modulator stability and relax comparator precision requirements, offering improved robustness against device mismatch. A fully differential preamplifier-dynamic latch comparator pair is employed to achieve low decision latency while maintaining high linearity, with careful device sizing and common-centroid layout techniques used to minimize input offset. Post-layout simulation in a 65 nm CMOS process confirm correct operation at 400 Mbps with a decision delay below 400 ps and negligible metastability. The design achieves a peak SNDR of 71 dB over a 6 MHz bandwidth, consuming only 65 uW from a 1.2 V supply, and occupies 0.2025 mm2 active area. These results demonstrate the suitability of the proposed quantizer for compact, energy-efficient CT sigma-delta modulators in medical imaging and bio-signal/cell analysis applications."

Since the invention of LDPC codes, their excellent decoding performance has been favored by researchers. QC-LDPC codes have become the channel coding scheme for the fifth generation new radio (5G NR) data channel, but at the same time, it has also brought challenges to hardware design. We propose the Layered Normalized Offset Minsum and three layer static scheduling (LNOMS-SS) algorithm. On the basis of the traditional Layered Normalized Minsum algorithm (LNMS) and Layered Offset Minsum algorithm (LOMS), the update order of each layer during hierarchical decoding is determined based on the row weight, column weight, and the number of perforated non-zero elements in the BG matrix. We also implemented the algorithm in hardware and designed an 8-levels LDPC decoder. We proposed innovative designs such as a pre-processing based routing network, a segment approximation based Minsum calculation module, and an improved checksum module. The simulation and implementation results show that our proposed LNOMS-SS algorithm has stronger performance than other algorithms, with lower hardware resource consumption and decoding latency."

    "abstract": "Assembling a combination of Artificial Intelligence (AI), teams of drones (UAVs), edge computing, and MIMO technology is practically the state of the art of IoT at the moment. This mixture is transforming the way the various industries operate, more so agriculture. When we marry these technologies, we can obtain data, compute and transmit it in real-time much more easily resulting in smart, automated solutions. As an example, swarms of AI-managed drones can patrol large fields in farming to observe the health of plants, deal with pests, and determine how to optimally water the fields. Simultaneously, the MIMO technology enhances communication and allows it to work more efficiently and even with distant locations. It allows decisions to be made immediately on the spot even with limited resources when you add edge computing resulting in faster speeds and reduced delay. Nevertheless, despite such improvement, we continue to have large blocks in the road such as the repair of network structures, energy savings, and security holes. These are some of the problems we will have to contend with to truly utilize the 6G networks in the future. This paper examines these technologies, their application in agriculture and other fields, and the issues that they cause. It also indicates the direction research should take henceforth in order to render these innovations a success in a 6G IoT world."

A UAM-specific interference model is developed as the system’s foundation, supporting quantitative analysis of mutual interference through various met hodologies. Given UAM’s corridor-based operation, interference scenarios involving base station (BS) and flight corridor locations are emphasized. To address these, a terrain-based radio propagation technique is applied to derive optimal corridor routes, BS placement, and antenna configurations that minimize interference. G IS-based visualization further enhances intuitive understanding of interference impacts, providing insights for effective system planning and deployment."

However, existing SLAM benchmarks do not test whether robots remember the same objects across days, agree on object identities with each other, or measure how much energy their mapping takes. To address these gaps, we introduce VISTA-SLAM, a new benchmark that adds three easy-to-understand metrics: how well robots remember objects (IRR), how well teams agree on object IDs (CAIA), and how efficient mapping is for energy use (SEES). We review 126 recent SLAM papers and find that none cover all these challenges. VISTA-SLAM is designed to set a new standard for testing and comparing robot mapping systems, making it easier to build smarter, more reliable, and energy-aware robot teams for tomorrow’s connected environments."

The architecture includes a Clustering Algorithm to enhance resource distribution and a probabilistic model-checking to improve battery efficiency. Utilizing this metric, the ILHCHU model is compared with the earlier baseline methodologies, and achieved the least number of communication steps at 70000, 20 unassigned tasks, a lower total score of 12000, a running time of 80, a time consumed of 185, a greater energy consumption figure of 750, and a coverage rate and repeated coverage rate of 97 and 33, respectively, as well as communication steps of 5000 and a communication composition of 8 all accomplished by our proposed ILHCHU model.

    "abstract": "Blockchain technology, recognized for its decentralized, immutable, and transparent characteristics, traditionally relies on elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) to secure digital signatures and ensure transaction integrity. However, the emergence of quantum computing poses a fundamental threat to ECC, as algorithms such as Shor's can efficiently solve the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem (ECDLP), rendering ECC-based blockchains insecure. This looming vulnerability necessitates the transition to post-quantum cryptographic (PQC) solutions. Among the various PQC families lattice-based, code-based, hash-based, and isogeny-based multivariate cryptography has emerged as the most suitable for digital signatures in blockchain applications, owing to its strong reliance on the hardness of the Multivariate Quadratic (MQ) problem, which remains intractable for both classical and quantum algorithms. Multivariate schemes provide several advantages, including fast signature generation, efficient verification, and scalability, all of which are essential for high-throughput blockchain networks. Within this family, the Unbalanced Oil and Vinegar (UOV) scheme stands out as the most efficient variant. Efficiency analysis shows that UOV achieves a 99.9% smaller private key than SPHINCS+ and 98.9% smaller than Dilithium 5, a 92.3% reduction in signature size compared to Dilithium 5, and a 99.6% lighter runtime memory requirement than GeMSS, enabling practical deployment even on resource-constrained blockchain nodes. Despite its slightly larger public key than Dilithium, UOV remains significantly more balanced than competing schemes, offering the optimal trade-off between quantum security, storage efficiency, and performance. This research explores the integration of multivariate digital signatures into blockchain, with a focus on UOV, to provide a quantum-resistant framework that ensures long-term transaction security, network scalability, and resilience in the post-quantum era."

Built on Free5GC, Open5GLoS addresses three limitations in current 3GPP architectures: static AMF ID assignment, gNB–AMF connectivity issues from dynamic IPs, and the absence of standardized SCTP/NGAP load balancing. Our design generates unique AMF IDs, provides gateway-based gNB–AMF discovery, and applies UE-aware load balancing at the NGAP layer. Experiments show an average 15–30% reduction in UE registration time for up to 200 UEs, peaking at 36.9% under higher loads, with 100% registration success even at 250 UEs where single-AMF deployments fail. These results highlight architectural gaps in the 3GPP-defined 5G Core, particularly in identity management, service discovery, and transport protocols at scale. By delivering measurable performance gains, Open5GLoS serves as both a practical reference for cloud-native 5G deployments and a critical input for future standardization."

    "abstract": "The Disruptions to trade flows create serious problems for global economies because they can result in supply chain interuptions, increased spending, and inefficiencies in the market. This paper attempts to process these complexities by applying two-phase analytical approach which combines conventional trade flow models with the latest developed Mobiuis Chain Equilibrium Algorithm (MCEA), to understand better, manage, and cope with trade flow disruptions. To begin with, the analysis uses enacting the gravity model algorithm - a popular strategy in trade research - to make the baseline trade flows, and look at existing relations between the economies of the countries. This algorithm captures the core dynamics of international trade using several economically important factors like economic size, distance, and existence of trade barriers, which together form the flow of trade. The results of the first phase serve as a much needed empirical basis further analysis aimed at identifying distortions in the global trade network. Building on the outputs from the gravity model, the paper then uses the Möbius Chain Equilibrium Algorithm (MCEA) to examine the intricacies of trade flows on a deeper level. MCEA broadens the initial conclusions by modeling how cascading effects due to tariff alterations, geopolitical friction, or supply chain disruptions disrupt the global network. The detailed study of how partner-specific distortions modify equilibrium conditions over extremely intricate systems governed by trade relations between numerous countries with trade relationships is possible due to the algorithm's sophisticated multidimensional interaction modeling features. Integrating both the predictive capabilities of the gravity model and the dynamic attributes of MCEA creates a strong understanding of distortions in trade flow. The results indicate the combined implementation of both algorithms enhances the understanding of the ramifications of trade interruptions, resulting in more precise predictions and better policy interventions. This research highlights the need to incorporate advanced computational techniques to assess and manage the repercussions of trade flow distortions in the contemporary global economic environment."

Due to its centralized nature, various countermeasures have been taken to defend against Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks, such as by integrating machine learning models to the controller. Unfortunately, the additional latency and overhead makes it inefficient against large-scale attacks. This paper migrates the machine learning model directly into the switch, increasing detection and mitigation speed on the controller. The network model consists of two hosts (attacker and victim), one switch, one controller and two machine learning models. The experiment compares two scenarios, Random Forest algorithm placed inside the controller and LUCID inside the switch. The detection and mitigation performance is observed through the network traffic captured by sFlow-RT. The result shows the model inside the switch mitigated the attack in 24 % less time after detection than the model inside the controller. This network model provides faster threat response, better performance and greater stability in SDN."

    "abstract": "One of the main challenges in distributed learning arises from the difficulty of handling heterogeneous local models and data. In light of the recent success of generative models, we propose to meet this challenge by building on the idea of exchanging synthetic data instead of sharing model parameters. Local models can then be treated as \"black boxes\" with the ability to learn their parameters from data and to generate data according to these parameters. Moreover, if the local models admit semi-supervised learning, we can extend the approach by enabling local models on different probability spaces. This allows to handle heterogeneous data with different modalities. We formulate the learning of the local models as a cooperative game starting from the principles of game theory. We prove the existence of a unique Nash equilibrium for exponential family local models and show that the proposed learning approach converges to this equilibrium. We demonstrate the advantages of our approach on standard benchmark vision datasets for image classification and conditional generation."

The evaluation results show that the KNN model achieves high predictive performance with balanced precision, recall, and F1-score, confirming its reliability for classification tasks. The findings highlight that combining technical indicators with machine learning can effectively transform complex financial data into useful insights.

    "abstract": "With the ongoing progress of information technology, digital medical images play a major role in medical treatment and provide great help for patients’ diagnosis. At the same time, the copyright protection of medical images has also attracted more and more attention from institutions in the medical industry. However, the drawbacks of existing security mechanism for managing and protecting image copyright often lead authors to be embroiled in wars of infringement. Even though legislation has been enacted besides of various technical methods to resist against copyright abuse, it is little profitable. Therefore, we propose a copyright protection method based on blockchain for medical images. By integrating with existing centralized image copyright protection solutions and leveraging their data to build and enhance its knowledge base, the method can smoothly evolve to be a decentralized scheme. Moreover, the tamper-resistant nature of blockchain ensures that once a transaction is committed to the chain, it remains protected from any unauthorized modifications. Experiment shows that the delay fluctuation is small and the system throughput continues to grow when the transaction transmission rate is less than or equals to 200 tps. The result demonstrates the robustness of the proposed transitional blockchain-based copyright protection method for medical images."

The current rule-based and single-objective learning approaches fail to handle dynamic and uncertain environments because they lack sufficient adaptability and expressiveness. The Dual-Attention Priority Neural Network (DAPNN) functions as a deep learning system which performs dual tasks of priority estimation and delay-overhead-deviation tracking. The DAPNN model uses a residual-gated dual-attention mechanism to overcome limitations while ensuring the robustness that handle both temporal dynamics and feature importance. The model generates stable and fine-grained state representations through temporal and feature attention modules which use residual gating for enhancement. The evaluation of DAPNN takes place on public simulation data through comparisons with wellestablished baselines including MLP, NN, CNN, GRU, and LSTM. The experimental result outperforms all tasks including priority classification, expected delay prediction, urgency fairness, and fairness-violation prediction while maintaining efficient convergence and stable state. The residual-gated mechanism in the dual-attention pathway operates independently. The findings demonstrate DAPNN as an ideal framework for multi-objective scheduling in critical real-time applications."

To mitigate inherent sensor discrepancies, our comprehensive pipeline performs precise co-registration, radiometric calibration, and domain adaptation to bridge the spectral and structural differences between the C-band and X-band inputs. The core of our framework is a multi-scale conditional GAN, inspired by Pix2pixHD, which uses a coarse-to-fine generator and multi-scale discriminators with a composite loss function to reconstruct detailed SAR textures. Our model not only surpasses existing baselines on key image quality metrics (SSIM, PSNR, DISTS) but also demonstrates tangible practical value. When integrated into a downstream water body detection pipeline, the super-resolved images achieved an Intersection-over-Union (IoU) score exceeding 70%, enabling significantly more precise mapping than possible with original low-resolution data.

    "abstract": "Respiratory rate (RR) is a critical vital sign, but its estimation from wearable photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors is often unreliable due to poor signal quality. Conventional methods rely on a single PPG channel, making them highly susceptible to signal corruption. This paper introduces a novel pipeline that leverages multichannel PPG signals (green, red, and infrared) to improve RR estimation robustness. The proposed pipeline integrates a Signal Quality Assessment (SQA) module to dynamically select the highest-quality channel within a sliding window, followed by RR estimation and an exponential moving average (EMA) smoothing filter. To facilitate this research, a new dataset comprising 36 recordings from 12 healthy subjects was collected, featuring synchronized 3-channel PPG and RR reference data. Experiments show the proposed pipeline significantly outperforms a single-channel baseline, reducing the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) by 39.8% (from 3.62 to 2.18 bpm) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) by 37.5% (from 4.99 to 3.12 bpm). The framework's modularity was validated using a different core estimation algorithm (AIIRE), which also showed consistent performance gains. These findings demonstrate that a multichannel SQA approach is an effective strategy for developing more accurate and reliable wearable respiratory monitoring systems."

    "abstract": "With the increasing adoption of AI techniques for automated diagnosis, radiographic imaging has become a crucial component in modern healthcare for detecting chest-related diseases. Conventional centralized training approaches raise significant concerns about data privacy, especially in healthcare environments where sensitive patient information is distributed across multiple institutions. In order to solve this, this paper provide a privacy-conscious framework for classifying chest diseases that combines advanced the DenseNet-121 model, built on convolutional neural networks, ResNet-34, and ResNet-50 with federated learning (FL). Patient confidentiality is maintained by this method, which permits cooperative model training across several healthcare facilities without exchanging raw X-ray pictures. Only the model weights are centrally aggregated; every association train a local model using its own data. Tests on benchmark chest X-ray datasets shows the federated system greatly improve data security and scalability while achieving high classification accuracy on par with centralized learning. The combination of FL with cutting-edge CNNs provides a reliable, valuable, and private clarification for the finding and detection of chest diseases in the real world."

In this context, we have developed a simple architecture based on a simple heterodyne interferometer, enabling vector multiplication. This architecture enables us to process images in the time domain, and perform image classification tasks. More importantly, the building block we propose can be generalized to multi-heterodyne architectures, enabling ultra-high rate matrix computation for neural network layers, and accelerators for convolutional neural networks."

Based on the analysis of primary data (questionnaires and focus groups with teachers and students) and its contrast with transnational evidence, two key dimensions are addressed: the curricular content and pedagogical methods implemented, and the main barriers perceived by teachers. The results show a broad but uneven thematic coverage, with less systematic inclusion of key technical topics such as programming or algorithms. A coexistence is also observed between traditional teaching approaches and emerging active practices, conditioned by teacher training and the availability of resources. Structural barriers include the lack of curricular institutionalization, limited specific training, and territorial inequities. The study concludes with a call for a national strategy to ensure a structured, inclusive, and high-quality approach to informatics education, aligned with current European frameworks."

We leverage controlled clock phase mismatches to induce entropy in flip-flop arrays. These metastable outputs are processed through a pipelined Box-Muller transform to produce scalable, high-throughput noise samples at configurable privacy levels.

    "abstract": "Anti-Malware as a Service (AMaaS) is a cloud-based security system that offers real-time defense against malware attacks. Blockchain can improve AMaaS by offering a safe, decentralized approach to the exchange and authentication of threat intelligence. It guarantees that malware signatures and changes are transparently documented throughout a distributed network and remain immutable. Through the utilization of blockchain AMaaS becomes more reliable and robust because of the reduced probability of data manipulation or single points of failure. In this paper, we propose, a blockchain-envisioned security mechanism for Anti-malware as a Service (AMaaS). It further, strengths the AMaaS by making the use of the consortium blockchain. The use of a blockchain consortium makes it possible to spot and minimize harmful threats very quickly while at the same time encouraging trust and responsibility in verified participants. Smart contracts automate response actions to threats, making the process faster, more dependable, and easier to audit with minimal dependence on humans. In addition, integrating machine learning algorithms into the blockchain system strengthens the predictive powers of the anti-malware service, most notably in identifying obfuscated, polymorphic, and zero-day threats. Experimental analysis shows that the implementation of the proposed scheme improves organization protection and reduces operational expenses compared to signature-based techniques. We also present the architectural design of the proposed scheme, explore challenges related to its deployment, such as consensus management and scalability, and evaluate its broader implications for future cybersecurity infrastructure development."

This research presents an in-depth analysis of three widely used clustering algorithms: K-Means, Spectral, and Leiden. Efficacy is assessed across different vehicle densities and speeds. The study focuses on examining four primary factors: the modularity of cluster formation, silhouette score, throughput, packet delay and cluster head change rate. The results obtained from the tests indicate that K-Means always sends more data & has the quickest packet delivery which generates the best-shaped clusters to elect CH. This is the best choice for networks with a varying number of cars that change speeds. Leiden does well when there are a lot of cars on the road. It stays stable but changes for huge graphs. Spectral clustering always does worse, with longer delays, less data getting through, and cluster heads that change too much. These findings show that selecting the right algorithm matters when building VANETs that can grow and stay reliable. The study concludes that K-Means is the best choice for cluster formation & electing $\\mathbf{C H}$ where there is a need for quick responses and lots of data flow. Leiden works well in packed networks that need balanced performance. Spectral clustering does not work efficiently when keeping the network running in real-life vehicle situations at higher density & speed."

The approach aims to enhance detection performance while maintaining computational efficiency suitable for real-world deployment. The baseline Random Forest model demonstrated strong classification capability, which was further improved through GA-based hyperparameter tuning. The optimized model achieved an accuracy of 97.89%, precision of 96.61%, recall of 99.45%, F1 score of 98.01%, and an AUC of 0.9978, while also reducing prediction time to 0.79 seconds. Compared to the baseline model, the GA-tuned RF improved accuracy by 1.06% and F1 score by 0.97%. These results indicate that the GA-tuned model not only improves detection accuracy but also enhances model efficiency.

Unlike linear recurrent neural network designs such as Mamba, we propose a lightweight MLP-based operator that replaces these components with parallelizable feed-forward blocks, enabling efficient, geometry-aware feature learning in sparse voxel backbones.

The system employs biometric sensors to verify the identity of each voter before allowing access to the voting interface, thereby preventing unauthorized voting. Additionally, a pressure sensor is used to ensure that enough force is applied during the vote casting process, thus minimizing chances of accidental or invalid votes. The voting system works in two modes: voting mode, which captures and validates votes, and counting mode, where votes are tallied and results are displayed. The FPGA architecture allows for efficient real-time processing of biometric data, pressure input, and vote validation. Ensures a very high reliability and security. Testing of the system reveals its efficiency in ensuring that votes are securely captured and counted; hence it's viable to be used in the real-world electoral environments."

This study proposes a neural network–based personalized suit controller trained via deep reinforcement learning with a forward dynamics human–suit simulation. Anthropometric information—height and body weight—was incorporated as inputs, enabling automatic adaptation of assistive forces without post-training adjustments. The controller was trained under randomized anthropometric conditions and evaluated on three representative test cases. Performance was compared with a suit-off condition and a conventional model-based controller without anthropometric adaptation. Results show that the proposed controller consistently reduced hip joint mechanical work across subjects, with decreases of about 7% relative to suit-off and 4% relative to the reference model over the entire gait cycle. The greatest reductions occurred during the swing phase. These findings indicate that the proposed approach generalizes across diverse body types, enhances assistive efficiency, and offers a promising path toward real-world soft exosuit control."

The main challenge stems from the detection of low-velocity or quasi-static signal components in the capillaries. To address this, we propose a coherent nonlinear ultrasound imaging method, where a nonlinear coherence operator acted on point spread function is leveraged to improve detection sensitivity of microbubbles. Low-velocity microbubbles can thus be extracted without clutter filtering. Through visualizations of low-velocity microvasculature in rat brain/kidney/testis and early-stage glioma, coherent nonlinear ultrasound imaging paves the way towards capillary-level microangiography."

A passive visualization approach is adopted, where LF data are rendered as pseudo-video sequences and assessed on calibrated 4K 2D displays under controlled laboratory conditions. Three subjective test protocols, including two rating-based and a pairwise comparison (ranking-based) method, are evaluated through six experimental configurations, incorporating different viewing trajectories and interaction modes. This setup, together with our proposals for deploying inter-rater consistency criteria (e.g., error consistency), enables a comprehensive evaluation of the reliability and suitability of different subjective experiments for LF QA. The results confirm the superior discriminability of the pairwise comparison tests over the rating-based methods. Among the rating-based approaches, the method employing a comparative scale scoring outperformed the one based on an impairment scale. Moreover, the performance of several objective QA metrics was evaluated by comparing their scores against the subjective scores obtained from the three test protocols. The outcomes of this study provide methodological guidance for designing subjective LF quality experiments, highlighting the trade-offs between reliability, sensitivity, and experimental cost, and offer insights relevant to future standardization efforts in LF coding."

    "abstract": "The detection of water ice is crucial for the scientific exploration of Mars, as the water ice could provide energy support for future human missions. Orbital radars provide wide coverage and deeper penetration compared to infrared and optical imaging techniques, making them crucial for detecting water ice, particularly in low-latitude regions where water ice lies buried deep beneath the surface. The main advantages of subsurface water ice detection by the Shallow Radar (SHARAD) are its capability to invert dielectric constants and characterize subsurface composition based on dielectric properties. In this study, we inverted the loss tangent and subsurface dielectric constants by building a three-layer reflection model, considering the interference of the mantling layer. We also proposed a new approach to map the potential distribution of water ice by quantifying its dielectric properties. The results indicate that the permittivity of the subsurface material in southern Utopia Planitia (16°-32°N, 105°-135°E) ranges from 3.14 to 7.53, while the loss tangent varies from 0.0013 to 0.0374. The distribution of the water ice indicator, which quantifies the potential presence of subsurface ice, reveals two localized regions with moderate ice potential (indicator values of 0.3–0.7), whereas the other regions show low ice potential. Further analysis reveals two types of deposits, including a low-loss deposit, while the remaining regions are dominated by lava flows from volcanic activity. Although we have not found high-confidence evidence of water ice presence in the research area, our research provides a feasible approach to detecting water ice on Mars, and the findings could offer a reference for future Mars landing missions."

    "abstract": "Force and tactile sensing play increasingly important roles in robotics hands to complete complex tasks safely and effectively, complementing the last piece of the puzzle of human-level dexterity. Despite the advances in flexible sensors and skins, tactile sensing at the fingertip of robotic hands remains an open question. Exploiting embedded six-axis force/torque (F/T) sensors for external stimuli estimation, namely, intrinsic tactile sensing, seems to be an effective solution. Here, we present OriCube, an origami-inspired, fingertip-size (14.5 × 14.5 × 12.5 mm<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup>), lightweight (4 g), fully integrated, inductive six-axis F/T sensor. It utilizes an origami coil array to achieve self-decoupled six-axis F/T measurements by detecting the displacements and rotations of a metal shell via eddy–current coupling. A modular silicone spring-based elastomer design allows fine-tuning of the stiffness and performance of each axis independently. The calibrated OriCube exhibits a high resolution of 0.01% F.S. (23 N), low crosstalk (2%), high stability (<0.2% drift in 6 h), and insensitivity to strong magnetic field changes. It is capable of detecting light touch by a feather as well as high impact force when hammered. We demonstrate real-time tactile sensing (contact position and force vector) at the curved surface of a robotic fingertip via one embedded OriCube sensor."

    "abstract": "Despite the growing attention given to applicants' reactions to the utilization of artificial intelligence (AI) within organizational recruitment contexts, scholars have paid little attention to the emotional mechanism between AI decision-making (especially negative) and applicants' procedural justice perception, as well as how the perception affects their subsequent behavior. Drawing on the cognitive–functional model of discrete negative emotions, we propose and empirically test the effect of anger triggered by AI-driven negative hiring decisions on applicants' procedural justice perception and complaint behavior. General support for the model testing is obtained from two studies, namely, a laboratory experiment (N = 97) that uses technology for facial expression analysis (i.e., Face Reader 8.0) and an online scenario-based experiment (N = 270). The rigor of our findings is enhanced by collecting data from multiple participant sources, using FaceReader and self-reports in a complementary manner to measure anger, and by introducing control variables for robustness checks. We find that AI-driven negative decisions, rather than human-driven ones, elicit greater anger from applicants. Notably, this effect is weakened for applicants with extensive prior AI experience. Moreover, anger suppresses applicants' perceptions of procedural justice, thus yielding a distinct effect on their complaint behavior. Our study contributes to the understanding of the effect of AI-driven negative hiring decisions on applicants' emotional, cognitive, and behavioral reactions. It also sheds light on the influence of applicants' prior AI experience in reducing the negative effect of AI-driven negative hiring decisions on applicants' subsequent responses."

    "abstract": "Despite ongoing efforts to decarbonize society, climate change continues to result in more extreme events that can reduce the electrical grid’s ability to reliably supply power to end users. At the same time, across the distribution grid, Distributed Energy Resources (DERs), such as renewable generation, energy storage systems, and flexible resources, offer the possibility of operating the grid in novel ways. Distribution System Operator (DSOs) could employ these DERs to improve their ability to mitigate extreme events. This work therefore demonstrates how DERs, in the form of flexible loads, can be controlled by a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agent to minimize Energy Not Supplied (ENS) in the immediate aftermath of an extreme event. To obtain near-optimal performance on unseen scenarios, an enhanced Implicit Q Network (IQN+) architecture is proposed, trained, and evaluated on a modified CIGRE MV benchmark grid. The resulting IQN+ agent can outperform a passive baseline policy, a trained Rainbow DQN policy, and a single-timestep Optimal Power Flow (OPF) based policy on the test set. Sensitivity analysis reveals that the location and quantity of available DERs also impact the efficacy of the IQN+ agent, with the agent preferentially using actions on loads that result in greater average episode durations. These results highlight the potential for RL to rapidly provide decision support to operators by suggesting potential remedial actions to mitigate the impact of extreme events."

    "abstract": "In safety-critical systems, such as vehicles, continuous and adaptive risk assessment is essential for maintaining security throughout the system lifecycle. Traditional Threat Analysis and Risk Assessments (TARAs), confined to the design phase of a system, fail to address unforeseen vulnerabilities during operation. This paper introduces a framework for continuous runtime risk assessment, aligned with the automotive standard ISO/SAE 21434 as a concrete application scenario, combining classical TARA during initialization and an adapted version during runtime. The runtime phase updates a preweighted Attack Tree (AT) based on emerging vulnerabilities and applies an aging function to adjust risk feasibility using the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). The novelty of the framework lies in its runtime adaptation capability to new threats. We evaluate our framework using representative automotive architectures and attack scenarios and further conduct an extensive evaluation by applying it to a generic autonomous vehicular architecture. Results demonstrate that the system delivers timely and adaptive risk assessments, effectively manages evolving cybersecurity threats, and offers a resource-efficient solution suitable for real-world deployment."

The main challenge stems from the detection of low-velocity or quasi-static signal components in the capillaries. To address this, we propose a coherent nonlinear ultrasound imaging method, where a nonlinear coherence operator acted on point spread function is leveraged to improve detection sensitivity of microbubbles. Low-velocity microbubbles can thus be extracted without clutter filtering. Through visualizations of low-velocity microvasculature in rat brain/kidney/testis and early-stage glioma, coherent nonlinear ultrasound imaging paves the way towards capillary-level microangiography."

    "abstract": "In recent years, embedded systems have become indispensable across a wide range of domains, including automotive and IoT applications. The increasing scale and complexity of these systems have intensified the demand in industrial development environments for platforms that ensure reliability, maintainability, and efficiency simultaneously. Conventional programming languages, such as C and C++, offer high performance but suffer from serious issues related to memory safety, resulting in bugs and security vulnerabilities. In contrast, Rust enables safe development by enforcing memory safety at compile time through its ownership and borrowing mechanisms, contributing to improved code quality and maintainability in industrial settings. Component-based development (CBD) supports modularization by units of functionality, enhancing reusability and structural clarity, which facilitates the handling of large-scale and complex industrial systems. Modern embedded applications, which require high processing performance and energy efficiency, increasingly adopt multi-processor architectures to enable parallel execution. This study proposes a Rust-compatible framework that combines the safety features of Rust with the structural advantages of CBD, based on the TOPPERS Embedded Component Systems (TECS) and the multi-processor real-time operating system TOPPERS FMP3. The proposed framework facilitates safe and reusable CBD in practice by designing and automatically generating Rust code that represents the TECS component structure and through optimization of exclusive control while maintaining safety. Evaluation of execution time demonstrates minimal overhead from integration with the multi-processor RTOS, enabling efficient and reliable application development."

    "abstract": "Semantic communication (SemCom) has recently emerged as a promising paradigm for enhancing the efficiency and intelligence of wireless networks. Nevertheless, device het erogeneity, resource constraints, and the vulnerability of deep neural networks in open environments pose significant challenges to its practical deployment. In this paper, we propose a task oriented and lightweight SemCom system with secure aggregation for ensuring efficient and privacy-preserving interactions in distributed networks. First, we design a multi-task SemCom framework that unifies semantic feature extraction from sample based datasets. To accommodate resource-constrained devices, we further introduce a feature distillation mechanism that derives lightweight local models without sacrificing inference accuracy. To preserve the privacy of local datasets while leveraging the generalization capability of distributed devices, we develop a secure model aggregation algorithm based on multiparty homomorphic encryption. Simulation results and comparative experiments validate the effectiveness of our system, which fully utilizes the knowledge embedded in existing high-performance models. Our results demonstrate that the proposed local semantic models outperform the baseline models under limited datasets and reduced parameters. We also analyze the trade-off between computational complexity and security in the proposed aggregation scheme, highlighting its applicability to distributed SemCom scenarios."

    "abstract": "Particle Flow Filters estimate the “a posteriori” probability density function (PDF) by moving an ensemble of particles according to the likelihood. Particles are propagated under the system dynamics until a measurement becomes available, when each particle undergoes an additional stochastic differential equation in a pseudo-time that updates the distribution following a homotopy transformation. This flow of particles can be represented as a recursive update step of the filter. In this work, we leverage the Differential Algebra (DA) representation of the solution flow of dynamics to improve the computational burden of particle flow filters. Thanks to this approximation, both the prediction and the update differential equations are solved in the DA framework, creating two sets of polynomial maps: the first propagates particles forward in time, while the second updates particles, achieving the flow. The final result is a particle flow filter that rapidly propagates and updates PDFs using mathematics based on deviation vectors. Numerical applications show the benefits of the proposed technique, especially in reducing computational time, so that small systems such as CubeSats can run the filter for attitude determination."

The diagnostic techniques most commonly used in classical diagnosis, which are typically invasive blood tests, are often inconvenient, painful, and resource-intensive, and large-scale screening and continued surveillance is virtually impossible, particularly in low-resource settings. The present review looks at the new direction in noninvasive hemoglobin and anemia forecasting based on the ground-breaking potential of machine learning (ML) algorithms. This paper knowledge regarding a variety of 25 academic researches, the types of non-invasive sensing modalities studied, the scope of the diverse ML algorithms that have been applied, and the performance metrics achieved with them.

This work presents an A2C system enhanced by a hardware-friendly Finite State Machine (FSM) based meta-optimizer to improve training efficiency. The system's core is a lightweight FSM that adaptively tunes learning rates based on reward trend analysis. Evaluated on the CartPole-v1 benchmark, the integrated A2C and FSM-based meta-optimizer system enables convergence in 513 episodes, compared to 758 episodes required by a baseline A2C, achieving 32.3 % faster convergence. This accelerated training reduces total energy consumption by 58.6 % (from 915.2 kJ to 378.81 kJ). Post-synthesis results on an Ultra96-V2 FPGA show the FSM controller consumes only 7 % of LUTs, 6 % of DSPs, and 5 % of FFs, confirming its hardware efficiency. This combination of accelerated training and minimal overhead demonstrates a compelling approach for developing low-power, self-improving edge systems capable of learning directly in the field."

    "abstract": "The rapid evolution of smart audio technology has necessitated innovative interaction mechanisms that enhance user experience, accessibility, and efficiency. This research presents an Ultra-Wideband (UWB) Hands-Free Speaker integrated with Machine Learning (ML)-driven Face and Gesture Recognition to enable seamless, intuitive control without the need for voice commands or physical contact. Traditional smart speakers primarily rely on voice-based interactions, which may be ineffective in noisy environments or inaccessible to individuals with speech impairments. Our proposed system leverages UWB-based localization, computer vision, and deep learning models to achieve precise face tracking, dynamic gesture control, and adaptive audio spatialization. The system architecture comprises three core components: (1) UWB Localization Module, which detects user presence and spatial positioning in real-time; (2) Computer Vision-Based Face and Gesture Recognition System, utilizing deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformerbased models to recognize user identity and interpret gestures; and (3) AI-Driven Audio Processing, which dynamically adjusts sound directionality and volume based on user location and preferences. The proposed system employs a hybrid learning approach, combining pre-trained models (such as YOLO for gesture detection and FaceNet for identity recognition) with real-time adaptive learning for enhanced accuracy and personalization. Key innovations of this study include (i) precise gesture-driven speaker control using spatial UWB tracking and ML-based recognition, (ii) multi-user interaction with adaptive response, ensuring personalized settings for different individuals, and (iii) robust performance in challenging conditions, including low-light environments and high-noise surroundings. Performance evaluation across multiple test environments demonstrates superior recognition accuracy, low-latency response, and user adaptability compared to traditional voice-controlled and touch-based interfaces. This research contributes to the field of humancomputer interaction (HCI), smart home automation, and accessible technology, offering a more inclusive, efficient, and intelligent user experience.

    "abstract": "As a core link in the cultivation of innovative talents in the country, the quality of postgraduate education is closely related to the accuracy of the matching between teachers and students. The traditional two-way selection mechanism between postgraduate students and teachers has prominent problems such as information asymmetry, low matching efficiency and insufficient semantic understanding. This paper proposes a hybrid recommendation model for two-way selection between teachers and students in response to these problems and integrates it into the self-developed postgraduate training information platform. This model uses Sentence-BERT to conduct deep semantic encoding on the text of the research direction, effectively overcoming the semantic gap of traditional keyword matching. A three-stage hybrid architecture was designed, including an initial screening layer based on semantics and rules, a core matching layer integrating LightGBM ranking learning and time-aware matrix factorization, and a multi-constraint optimization layer based on the improved Kuhn-Munkres algorithm. In a real-world scenario experiment at a certain university, based on the actual mutual selection data of 327 postgraduate students and 125 supervisors, this model significantly increased the success rate of the first round of two-way matching from 0.56 of the traditional method to 0.88. The satisfaction of teachers and students with the matching results (on a 5-point scale) increased by an average of 0.7 points. Meanwhile, the platform has increased the average management efficiency of the entire process from thesis proposal to defense by 0.67. This study confirmed the advanced nature and effectiveness of the proposed hybrid model integrating deep learning, ranking learning and combinatorial optimization in solving the problem of educational resource allocation."

    "abstract": "To enhance the resilience of public transit systems in mountainous cities under disruptions, this study takes Liandu District of Lishui City, Zhejiang Province, China, as a case study. A bus stop network is constructed based on complex network theory, where bus stops are modeled as nodes and adjacent stops as edges. Network robustness is evaluated using three indicators: average path length, relative size of the largest connected component, and relative network efficiency. Numerical experiments are conducted to simulate network responses under targeted failures and random failures. The results indicate that the bus stop network in Liandu District exhibits scale-free characteristics and shows pronounced vulnerability under targeted attacks, where the failure of 20 % of key nodes reduces network efficiency to approximately 10 % of its original level. In contrast, the transfer network displays small-world properties and demonstrates relatively stronger robustness. Under random failure scenarios, network stability is higher than that under targeted failures; however, the overall resistance to disruptions remains limited. The findings provide theoretical support for the optimization and emergency management of public transit networks in mountainous cities."

As a critical factor influencing learning outcomes, student engagement requires systematic investigation in this evolving context. Based on Fredricks’ three-dimensional theory of learning engagement, this study surveyed 587 undergraduates to examine their learning engagement in AI-supported blended English courses. The research used the questionnaire survey method from the perspective of three dimensions: behavior, emotion and cognition. The findings indicate a generally moderate-to-high engagement level of engagement, with emotional engagement being the strongest. Besides, notable group differences were observed. female students and arts majors reported higher emotional engagement, while students with higher English proficiency demonstrated stronger behavioral persistence and focus. Based on these findings, the study proposes targeted instructional strategies to enhance student learning engagement across all dimensions, offering both theoretical guidance and practical implications for the development of effective AI-enhanced blended learning environments."

    "abstract": "DDoS(Distributed Denial of Services) attack has been one of the most critical cybersecurity threats on the Internet. DDoS attacks send a lot of requests to specific servers, such as DNS (Domain Name System), SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol), Web servers, and so on. Eventually these target servers will be forced to stop their services due to the significant high load caused by the DDoS attacks. Random subdomain attack is one of the DDoS attacks, which aims at the authoritative DNS servers.A huge amount of DNS queries for randomly generated subdomain names will be sent to the target authoritative DNS server via a lot of DNS full-service resolvers in a short time period. Consequently, the process of handling non-existent subdomain names will cause a rapid increase in the resource usage of the authoritative server, such as CPU and memory. Thus, when random subdomain attacks occurred on an authoritative server, the Internet users cannot use the Internet services appropriately.In this paper, we propose a mitigation method for the random subdomain attacks by rate limit and traffic control. The proposed method can mitigate the significant increase in the workload and help the authoritative DNS server keep the name resolution service for the legitimate users. We constructed a local network environment and evaluated the proposed method. The results confirmed that the proposed method could mitigate approximately 3.5 times CPU load under pseudo-random subdomain attacks."

While digital CIM robust to PVT variations, it remains low area and energy efficiencies introduced by adder tree. This paper proposes a digital CIM architecture that employs dynamic logic to perform multiplication. A set of ultra-low-cost compressors composed of only two transistors each (2TC) is designed to form a dual-layer approximate compressor using just 30 transistors in total. This compressor reduces 16 multiplication results to a 3-bit output. Compared to precise compressors, the proposed design reduces transistor count by up to 64.7%, effectively simplifying the downstream adder path. Experimental results show that at an operating frequency of 400 MHz, the architecture achieves an energy efficiency of up to 2492 TOPS/W. Validation using the ResNet-20 model on the CIFAR-10 dataset demonstrates that approximation-aware training can achieve an accuracy of 87.6%, combining accuracy, energy efficiency, and simplified hardware implementation."

Instead of relying on expensive LiDAR or fragile camera-only setups, our approach combines YOLOv5-based object detection with Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication. A key feature of the system is a scene matching method that uses ROI Align to compare feature maps between vehicles and verify visual consistency. This enables a two-stage distance estimation process—starting with an estimate based on V2V velocity and timing data, then refining it using the relative sizes of matched objects. We tested the system in the CARLA simulator under varying fog levels, showing stable performance with over 90% accuracy and real-time processing speeds under 0.3 seconds. The system also includes a fail-safe mechanism that ensures safety in extreme conditions. Our results show that combining camera input with V2V communication can provide reliable cooperative driving even when visibility is severely limited."

In this research, we recommend a low-cost software-based method for recognizing false Indian currency that makes use of machine learning and image processing. The approach uses OpenCVbased preprocessing techniques to extract important security features such as color patterns, bleed lines, serial numbers, and watermarks. The Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) is used to measure the similarity between test and actual images, and ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF) descriptors are applied for feature matching. An experimental analysis of images of Indian currency shows that the suggested method delivers promising outcomes without needing costly hardware. The system can be made available as a mobile or desktop application, making it useful for industries like banking, retail, and others where quick and genuine currency authentication is important."

This paper presents an intelligent urban traffic simulation framework designed in Python and SUMO (Simulation of Urban Mobility) with the precision combining ultra-fast speed and real-time responsiveness. It integrates vehicle dynamic rerouting, accident detection, sound alert systems, and database-driven logging to solve persistent transport problems. The proposed system imitates a real-world traffic network which can automatically detect violations or accidents when they occur within a defined time and area. The rerouting process consists of three separate steps: Dynamic User Assignment (DUA), followed up with Edge Weight Updates, and then Emergency Rerouting. These systems will ensure the impacted vehicles are effectively re-routed with minimal congestion to those vehicles as well as the global traffic supply. A MySQL database is implemented to record all critical events like timestamp, speed violation, accident alert, and rerouting event. The model is able to produce a variety of performance metrics to examine including the time saved for the re-routed vehicles, congestion level at the time, and success rates of routing. But finding the right balance between modularity and performance optimization is not easy but fundamental in enabling it to be re-programmed for real-time scalability and understanding the behaviors of the driver in disrupted situations. The paper represents an intelligent traffic system that prioritizes meaningful changes to improve the safety, efficiency, and adaptability of traffic systems."

Digital multipliers that use a standard design face rising costs in terms of their computational complexity when operand sizes increase. This paper illustrates a hybrid design of multipliers based on the Karatsuba and Toom-Cook algorithms, which mitigates the complexity of multiplication. The present design takes advantage of Karatsuba's divide-and-conquer principle with the partitioning power of Toom-Cook to decrease the number of partial products and arithmetic operations. The proposed architecture was designed, tested, and implemented in practice on Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA (model xc7al00tcsg324-3) using Verilog HDL design language. Results of synthesis and power analysis show that the proposed implementation is viable: achieve a critical path delay of 10.045 ns and a total of 295 LUTs (0%) and 128 bonded lOBs (60%). Although 5 DSP48El slices (2%) are employed, the proposed implementation consumes 0.082 W of power, largely due to standby power in the quiescent domain. Through hybrid design and minimizing latency while keeping power and area usage to a minimum, proposed implementation has shown substantial resource saving in relation to traditional multipliers. The research demonstrates the Slicing of Power of Hybrid Design."

Despite maintaining comparable performance to the previous Flexible OTAs, this design exhibits a very low power consumption of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$9.2 \\mu \\mathrm{W}$</tex>, accompanied by a high slew rate of 535 V/ms.

The OTA performance is compared to that of state-of-the-art flexible TFT-based amplifiers, with a focus on power consumption, GBW, and drive capability. It achieves remarkable performance with a figure of merit (603 MHz.pF/mW) that ranges from 2X to 826X compared to others."

To raise awareness and assess susceptibility to these threats, we developed SocialCyber, a cyber threat awareness simulation game tailored for Thai adults. The game uses interactive gameplay with realistic scenarios to educate users. Our study examined the relationship between deception rates, susceptibility to scams, and financial literacy within this game. Findings revealed a significant correlation between deception rates and susceptibility to scams $(r=0.39, p=0.03)$, a negative relationship between deception rates and financial behavior ($r=-$ 0.37, $p=0.04$), and between susceptibility to scams and financial knowledge ($r=-0.37, p=0.05$). These results demonstrate the effectiveness of SocialCyber simulation game in assessing cyber threat susceptibility and highlight the vital role of financial literacy in mitigating scam victimization among Thai adults."

    "abstract": "Autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) deployed in mobile access environments encounter challenges arising from dense and irregular obstacles as well as stringent energy constraints. Reliable trajectory planning in such a context is critical, since UAVs must maintain connectivity and coverage while navigating through cluttered spaces. Existing diffusion-based reinforcement learning approaches have been explored, but they are generally trained on entire trajectories, which limits their generalization and leads to high re-planning latency in safety-critical scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a sub-path decomposition framework that generates candidate segments with a diffusion model and applies reinforcement learning to select among them. This design enables finer-grained decision-making, improved safety, and low-latency trajectory updates. Simulations in procedurally generated mobile access environments demonstrate higher success rates and lower collision risks compared to heuristic baselines, while maintaining comparable energy efficiency. Furthermore, the diffusion model trained with sub-paths exhibits lower collision rates and shorter trajectories than the model trained on full paths. This combination of generative modeling and reinforcement learning provides a scalable approach to safe UAV navigation in mobile access scenarios."

    "abstract": "Brand perception is increasingly pertinent in defining consumer engagement, and subsequent experiential and digital content communications and decisions. Recently, advancements in Natural Language Processing has opened a pathway to study consumer perceptions, brand associations, and sentiment at scale. However, most studies examining brand perception are conducted with simple sentiment classification approaches, and mostly keyword approaches and methods, which limits the ability to uncover complex semantic relationships at the level of consumers' brand attribute perceptions or expressions. This also limits any insights gleaned from these studies to be partial limitations, as well as relying on the reliability and accuracy of the marketing intelligence software to some extent. To address these limitations, we present the Contextualized Brand Sentiment Embedding Framework (CBSEF), and the proposed CBSEF encompasses sentimentweighted semantic analysis via Glove word embeddings for mapping brand perceptions in a refined way. The attributes of the framework allows for the extraction of consumer sentiments relating to deeper associations connected to the mention of brands, while allowing for the classification related to their themes of sentiment, such as quality, trust, and innovation, providing marketers for improved interpretability. The experimental analysis in this paper demonstrates that CBSEF performs better than conventional approaches to sentiment in terms of accuracy as well as relevance thematic clustering, and conforms to context. The discussion highlights how this approach can be leveraged to unveil changing consumer attitudes and support dynamic brand perception monitoring. With this approach, marketers can now draw upon actionable insights to refine their digital campaigns, strengthen brand positioning, and manage consumer perceptions."

Medical imaging technologies such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) provide detailed images of brain structures, enabling more comprehensive observation of brain conditions. MRI-based brain tumor detection can be improved by integrating GLCM, shape, and color features, which are then classified using machine learning algorithms. This study compares the performance of KNearest Neighbor (KNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) in four feature scenarios. Evaluation was conducted using accuracy, precision, and recall metrics for the Tumor and No Tumor classes. The results show that KNN provides more balanced performance in almost all scenarios, especially the complete combination scenario. SVM shows significant superiority in recall for the Tumor class, but with low precision and recall for the No Tumor class. Overall, the combination of GLCM, shape, and color features yielded the best performance, with KNN being the most consistent and balanced method. At the same time, SVM was superior when sensitivity to tumor detection was the top priority. The results of the classification test using KNN showed the best accuracy of 83.33% with the Euclidean distance and a K value of 17."

However, existing models still have limitations in handling the high dispersion and dynamic preferences in consumer decision data. To address this issue, this paper proposes a dynamic consumer decision modeling framework based on deep collaborative embedding and temporal attention mechanism. The framework aims to decouple and robustly reconstruct consumers' long-term latent trends and short-term dynamic interest termination features through deep learning mechanisms, thereby achieving fine-grained characterization and prediction of dynamic consumer decision-making processes. Experimental results on the real-world datasets MovieLens-1M and Amazon Beauty show that DCE-TAM significantly outperforms mainstream benchmark models such as MF, NeuMF, and SASRec across all evaluation metrics. Ablation experiments further confirm the key contributions of the DCE and TAM core modules in enhancing the model's robustness and dynamic feature-capturing capability. This study provides a solution that combines theoretical innovation and practical applicability for consumer prediction under intelligent marketing scenarios."

LSTM stores previous data as well as takes new data, such as news, social media posts, and market hype. Social media is a platform where positive and negative sentiment occur frequently, and its effect on market trends, positive sentiment creates a market up while markets go down with negative sentiment. The model generates deep insight of stock-price behaviour by considering long-term trends/trading as well as short-term.

    "abstract": "A distribution network with high penetration of distributed generation faces significant risk exposure under uncertainties, concurrent multi-fault conditions, and frequent operational mode switching. However, existing assessment methods are typically limited to static power-flow analysis or a small number of scenarios, making it difficult to simultaneously account for normal operating conditions and N-k contingency scenarios, objective data and subjective preferences, as well as low-probability high-impact tail risks. To address these challenges, this paper develops a risk situational assessment method for distribution networks under complex scenarios. First, multidimensional risk indicators are constructed and uniformly mapped onto a evaluation method. Then, a combined objective-subjective weighting scheme is established to derive a comprehensive risk situational index for the distribution network. Finally, comparative analyses are conducted for representative scenarios under different load levels and DG penetration ratios. The results show that, compared with traditional methods, the proposed combined-weighting model exhibits higher sensitivity in identifying localized high-risk areas under heavy-loading and high-penetration renewable resources conditions. It effectively reveals low-probability high-consequence risks in N-k contingency scenarios and enables a refined characterization of the multi-level risk situation of distribution networks, ranging from “secure” to “warning” to “dangerous”. This provides quantitative support for operational optimization and weak-point mitigation in distribution networks."

    "abstract": "The cryptocurrency market is very volatile, non-linear and its behaviour changes frequently, for this very reason it is a challenge for traditional predictive models to perform accurate forecasting. Conventional statistical and machine learning techniques often fail because they are time sensitive and they are not able to capture the sequential dependencies completely. To address these limitations, a framework is proposed which combines the temporal learning capabilities of Spiking Neural Networks (SNN), the sequence modelling strength of Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) and the interpretability of symbolic reasoning followed by the sentimental analysis. SNNs, which are inspired from biological neurons, model the temporal patterns efficiently through spike-based data encoding and neuron firing dynamics, while LSTMs complement them by capturing long term dependencies and by mitigating the gradient issues in sequential forecasting tasks. Both of them combine together to provide a robust mechanism to learn the complex temporal fluctuations in cryptocurrency price and volume data. Interpretability, which is a major limitation of deep learning models, has been enhanced by integrating a symbolic reasoning engine which applies on the neural outputs. Human readable explanations of model selections are provided by using domain specific logical rules. This dual-layered neuro-symbolic integration ensures not just accuracy, but also transparency and traceability which are the key requirements of financial forecasting applications. And this result is more accurate providing transparent, interpretable explanation for financial decision-making."

    "abstract": "As technology develops that makes it easy to produce extremely realistic digital information such as text, graphics, and video like ChatGPT and similar tools, learning how to distinguish between what is created by a human and what is generated by a machine, is becoming more and more critical. Furthermore, with generative AI continuing to grow at a breakneck pace and allowing anyone who has access to the Internet to easily and quickly produce high quality, convincing text, images, and video, there is an urgent need to develop appropriate methods for detecting machine generated versus human produced content. Thus, regarding the methods of text detection, It will focus on techniques that aggregate many of the different techniques currently being utilized. This will involve examining the performance of pre trained language models, extracting a variety of statistical features from text files, and incorporating several types of machine learning based classification methods into the overall text detection process, such as Classifiers based on Transformer models, to improve both accuracy and understandability of the results produced by the final classification model. With respect to the detection of whether an image is machine generated, this explanation will provide a brief explanation of the most common available detection tools today, which will include those that examine internal details of images, meta information from an image’s electronic file, such as 2915, and a complete digital history of an image to find out whether it is authentic or not. Similar to determining whether or not an image is machine generated, detecting whether a video is machine generated is also one of the biggest challenges. Realistic fakes will often be comprised of actual faces and voices mixed together. By incorporating these new concepts into existing practice, It is more likely to create stronger, clearer, and more reliable methods of detecting machinegenerated content, methods that can build truth and trust in the technology age."

    "abstract": "Network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) are critical for identifying malicious activities. However, the severe class imbalance in network traffic data and the subtle differences between various attack types pose significant challenges for traditional single-stage classifiers. This paper proposes a novel two-stage deep learning framework that decouples the detection of anomalies from the classification of specific attack types. The first stage employs a binary classifier with focal loss to accurately distinguish anomalous traffic from a large volume of normal traffic. The second stage utilizes a multi-class classifier that focuses exclusively on identifying the specific category of attack from the data flagged as anomalous. Both stages leverage the same CNN 1D-LSTM-based architecture, ensuring feature consistency and simplifying the operational pipeline. We evaluate our model on the CIC-IDS 2017 dataset, demonstrating that our two-stage approach achieves a state-of-the-art accuracy of 99.5%, outperforming several single-stage baseline models."

These time-varying distortions disrupt subcarrier orthogonality and smear the range–Doppler response, causing conventional FFT-based estimation to fail. This work investigates a robust Doppler compensation framework for LEO-OFDM radar sensing. To address this, a hierarchical two-dimensional grid search is introduced to jointly estimate the dominant Doppler frequency and Doppler rate, maximizing a coherence-based metric across OFDM symbols. The results confirm that the proposed 2-D Doppler compensation effectively improves detection reliability."

Real-world datasets are constrained by safety limitations and rarely capture the visual complexity, structural variability, and sensor artifacts characteristic of disaster scenarios. This work introduces a reproducible methodology for generating high-fidelity RGB datasets using NVIDIA IsaacSim, enabling the photorealistic simulation of post-disaster environments with controllable terrain textures, occlusions, and dynamic sensor effects. The pipeline incorporates automatic pixel-wise semantic labeling and is used to train a brain-like neural network model called Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network (BCPNN) that first learns representations in an unsupervised manner and then classifies terrain textures once the labels are made available. The proposed framework is validated through extensive experiments in both simulated environments and physical testbeds that recreate representative SAR conditions under controlled settings. Results show that BCPNN models trained exclusively on synthetic data can generalize effectively to real-world RGB inputs, capturing terrain semantics with sufficient fidelity to support autonomous mobility decisions. This contribution provides a scalable data generation and learning pipeline for perception in extreme environments and establishes a practical foundation for deploying probabilistic terrain understanding in field-ready SAR robotics. The datasets of this development are available in the Zenodo repository. and code in the GitHub repository."

Indium tin oxide (ITO) framework (ITO/ITO:indium gallium zinc oxide (IGZO):O) thin-film transistors (TFTs) were fabricated by depositing a Sn-doped IGZO layer on ITO, followed by low-power oxygen treatment. Compared with ITO-based devices, superior performance was shown by the ITO framework TFTs, achieving a high mobility (<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\boldsymbol {\\mu }_{\\text {FE}}\\text {)}$</tex-math> </inline-formula> of 52.3cm<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>/Vs, a low threshold voltage (<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\mathrm{V}_{\\text {TH}}\\text {)}$</tex-math> </inline-formula> of −0.52V, and a steep subthreshold swing (SS) of 0.49V/dec.

Notably, this work used the ITO framework structure fabricated by the cosputtering process, which effectively alleviated the interface stress and reduced the interface state density. Combined with the low-power oxygen treatment strategy, defect passivation was achieved, effectively suppressing oxygen vacancies. The synergistic mechanism of the framework structure and oxygen treatment in balancing performance and stability was clarified. These methods provided a simple and effective approach for optimizing oxide thin-film transistors."

    "abstract": "In this work, we propose a method for multiple mobile robot motion planning that efficiently plans for robot teams up to 128 robots (an order of magnitude larger than existing state-of-the-art methods) in congested settings with narrow passages in the environment. We achieve this improvement in scalability by extending the state-of-the-art Decomposable State Space Hypergraph (DaSH)multi-robot planning framework to support mobile robot motion planning in congested environments. This is a problem that DaSH cannot be directly applied to because it lacks a highly structured, easily discretizable task space and features kinodynamic constraints. We accomplish this by exploiting knowledge about the workspace topology to limit exploration of the planning space and through modifying DaSH's conflict resolution scheme. This guidance captures when coordination between robots is necessary, allowing us to decompose the intractably large multi-robot search space while limiting risk of inter-robot conflicts by composing relevant robot groups together while planning."

A mixed-method approach was employed, utilizing quantitative data from a pilot study of 30 government employees to test the instrument, analyzed through Pearson correlation (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{r}&gt;0.361,5 \\%$</tex> significance) and Cronbach's Alpha (0.920 for knowledge, 0.903 for attitude, 0.853 for behavior), complemented by qualitative insights from expert interviews to validate the inclusion of security culture and data protection focus areas. The adapted HAIS-Q, with 54 items across knowledge, attitude, and behavior dimensions, enhances relevance for Indonesia's public sector. The results provide a reliable, context-specific tool for assessing and improving employee awareness, enabling targeted training and policies to strengthen cybersecurity and safeguard sensitive data."

The study adopts a mixed-methods approach, combining quantitative measurement of alert delivery times with qualitative analysis of system features and security protocols. A simulated environment, using VirtualBox, was set up to evaluate each system's performance under controlled conditions. The results indicate that Prometheus and Grafana excel in alert notification speed and dashboard flexibility, while PRTG offers simpler management but faces scalability and integration challenges.

In response to the growing research interest in this area, this paper presents a comprehensive survey of MIAs applied to image data. We propose a systematic taxonomy that categorizes attacks by threat models, technical attributes, and core methodologies. Additionally, we discuss widely used evaluation metrics and outline the landscape of existing defenses against MIAs."

In this context, the present study examines the impact of a customized conversational model, Alma de Tezontle, on raising awareness among university students about the water crisis. Using a quasi-experimental design, we compared the waterrelated perceptions of an experimental group, which interacted with the conversational model, and a control group, which received traditional instruction. The results show that the experimental group achieved a higher overall mean score compared to the control group, with a statistically significant difference according to Student’s t-test. Furthermore, the effect size calculation (Cohen’s $d=0.40$) indicated a moderate impact of the AI-based intervention. These findings suggest that interacting with Alma de Tezontle contributed to a greater awareness of the water crisis, highlighting the potential of conversational models in environmental education. In conclusion, integrating artificial intelligence into environmental education represents a promising tool for strengthening ecological awareness and fostering reflection on water sustainability."

    "abstract": "Microscaling (MX) quantization has recently garnered significant attention due to its ability to achieve high compression ratios while preserving critical information across various deep learning tasks. It has been officially adopted and deployed across diverse hardware platforms. However, the blockwise processing required during MX quantization introduces considerable overhead, resulting in substantial latency when executed on conventional hardware. Consequently, it becomes challenging to realize actual computational acceleration using standard architectures. This highlights the necessity for a dedicated hardware design tailored to MX quantization, capable of mitigating such overhead and enabling practical speedups. In this paper, we present a hardware quantizer module specifically designed for the MX format and propose the MX quantizer with dynamic sparsity detection (MQDS), which identifies activation sparsity during the quantization process. Furthermore, we introduce a sparse computation flow that leverages the outputs of MQDS to address the area overhead and latency compatibility issues inherent in conventional MX quantization approaches. Experimental results demonstrate that MQDS achieves an average activation skip detection ratio of 66.49 % on vision transformer models while occupying only 12.2 % of the area compared to traditional integer quantization designs."

However, electric motors may have a range of problems due to variables including extended use, environmental concerns, and lack of proper maintenance. In order to diagnose and detect electric motor faults using DL and ML approaches, this research study intends to examine the bearing dataset from Case Western Reserve University (CWRU). The experimental outcomes show that the proposed model has an excellent performance with 99.99% accuracy, 99.34% precision, 99% recall and 99.12% F1score, and the loss is remarkably low at 0.001. The comparative testing with this model against existing models like RNN, Xception, Kernel Naive Bayes and SVM shows that the proposed CNN is the most accurate and robust. The manual feature engineering removal ability and the capacity to acquire complex patterns in real time directly out of spectrograms is a major benefit of the model when deployed in real-time. The results show that the suggested approach works well for smart issue detection and has potential for use in large-scale industrial environments. The main objectives of the future endeavors will be improvements in real-time integration and the possibility of generalizing to unfamiliar forms of faults in varying conditions of operation."

    "abstract": "The levels of blur and noise play a crucial role in guiding adaptive image restoration and enhancement. This is particularly important due to the inherent trade-off between denoising and deblurring: denoising may oversmooth fine details in sharp regions, while deblurring can introduce artifacts in smooth or noisy areas. To address this challenge, we propose a two-stage method for jointly estimating the noise level and the blur extent of an image. In the first stage, we estimate the noise level and perform denoising to reduce its interference with subsequent processing. In the second stage, we assess the global blur extent from the denoised image. In this work, an efficient and content-invariant noise estimation technique enhanced by sparsity-based compensation and a reliable blur quantification strategy that utilizes difference of peaks (DoP) are proposed. With these techniques, both the noise level and the blur extent can be estimated in an accurate way."

    "abstract": "Against the backdrop of the ever-growing consequences of climate change, granular predictions of agricultural yields are irreplaceable in maintaining the global food security and evidence-based farm planning. However, availability of conventional statistical problems often lacks the nonlinear and time-varying relationships among climatic, soil, and agronomic factors specifically temperature variations, use of pesticides, and rainfall by necessitating misrepresentation and hence destruction of predictive efficacy. The framework uses Gradient Boosting as the meta learner in calibrating final predictions by using Random Forest, Support Vector Regression and the Gradient Boosting Regressor as base learners. To enhance the ability of the model to detect complex interactions as well as linear trends, feature engineering is used in the model using feature scaling and polynomial transformation. Extensive data covering yield history, weather impacts (temperature and rain), and farm inputs (pesticides, fertilizers, and state-to-state data) were utilized both during the training and during the validation of the model. With a weighted F1-score of 0.86, a coefficient determination (R2) of 0.9397, and a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 297, performance evaluation produced exceptional results that outperformed traditional and previously suggested hybrid models. The outcomes show how well such a sophisticated stacking-based ensemble method can generalise across a range of agro-ecological settings and understand complex data distributions."

However, if the illumination is not correct, it may significantly reduce egg production. Additionally, controlling temperature and humidity in the area is crucial for maximizing productivity and maintaining the birds' health. This article discusses the development of a smart light management system that integrates with the Internet of Things (IoT) to enhance the efficiency of laying quail farming. A smartphone dashboard lets you monitor and operate the system from anywhere. The experiment utilised LED lights of various colours and photoperiods in different containers. We maintained the temperature at 30°C and the humidity at 65%. When necessary, a sprinkler system was used to lower the temperature. When there was excessive humidity, ventilation fans were used to regulate the level. The results showed that the LED light spectrum had a significant influence on how eggs were made. A 14:2 hour red-to-green light cycle gave the best results. The results indicate that utilizing LED lights with specific spectral qualities is an effective method for enhancing egg production, improving bird health, and increasing egg yield."

However, fact-checking datasets and models remain scarce in low-resource languages (LRLs) such as Amharic, Burmese, Chechen, Farsi (Persian), Maguindanao, Pashto, and Uighur. Creating large, manually curated datasets in these languages is often prohibitively expensive. This paper proposes a resource-efficient method for building fact-checking datasets in LRLs using machine translation. Specifically, we introduce FNC-1F, a Farsi dataset created by translating the widely used Fake News Challenge dataset (FNC-1) from English to Farsi with the No Language Left Behind model. Using FNC-1F, we fine-tuned and evaluated three transformer-based models ParsBERT-FA, RoBERTa-fa-ZWNJ, and mDeBERTa-v3. We also validated their performance on real-world, manually curated Farsi test data. Results show that models trained on the translated dataset generalize effectively to native Farsi with only minor performance loss. Beyond presenting a practical approach for building fact-checking datasets in LRLs, this work also establishes the first benchmark for evidence-based fact-checking in Farsi."

    "abstract": "The deployment of Large Language Model (LLM) agents is shifting from centralized cloud infrastructures to decentralized edge computing environments to achieve reduced latency and enhanced data privacy. This transition is driven by the emergence of edge AI applications such as autonomous vehicle command recognition, industrial process monitoring with natural language interfaces, and conversational AI on resource-constrained IoT devices. However, this shift introduces significant challenges due to edge devices’ limited computational resources, storage capacity, and network bandwidth, which severely magnify the performance bottlenecks observed in well-resourced data centers. This paper addresses these challenges by extending cloud-based LLM optimization techniques to the unique constraints of edge computing. We present a comprehensive experimental analysis of federated LLM agent workloads deployed on a Kubernetes (K3s) cluster that simulates a realistic heterogeneous edge environment. Through a systematic ablation study, we evaluate the effectiveness of multiple optimization strategies, including advanced model quantization, distributed caching, and network-aware orchestration, measuring their impact on critical performance metrics such as time-to-first-token (TTFT), model synchronization overhead, and energy consumption. Our results demonstrate that while traditional storage and memory optimizations remain important, network-aware scheduling and adaptive model loading strategies are crucial for achieving practical edge deployment. The proposed optimization framework delivers substantial improvements over naive deployment approaches: a 75% reduction in network bandwidth consumption, a 45% improvement in end-to-end inference latency, and a 61% decrease in energy usage per inference, while maintaining acceptable model quality as measured by perplexity."

    "abstract": "Satellite images provide a precise view of continuous changes, enabling thorough monitoring of ecosystem dynamics over time. This capability is essential for identifying issues such as deforestation, and natural disasters. Additionally, satellite imagery includes vast geographical regions, making it particularly suitable for observing extensive ecosystems. However, a significant challenge in utilizing satellite images is the occurrence of clouds and varying atmospheric conditions that affect the detection accuracy. Furthermore, variations in lighting conditions and sudden changes in seasons also complicate the identification of genuine changes. To address this research gap, an advanced deep learning-based change detection method is implemented for detecting and monitoring changes in ecosystems, including deforestation, desertification, and land degradation. Here, the satellite images are analyzed using deep learning networks for tracking climate-related phenomena such as glacier retreats, rising sea levels, and temperature anomalies. The Multiscale Residual Attention Unet++ (MRA-UNet++) model is developed in this work for the detection of changes that analyze the satellite images very effectively to aid disaster preparedness, early warnings, and recovery planning. The proposed MRA-UNet++-based change detection model is helpful in precision agriculture based on the analysis of crop health, soil quality, and vegetation indices from satellite imagery. The resultant outcomes are validated with the conventional models to show the effectiveness."

This study utilizes 3 employed working models to investigate detecting faces in a provided dataset, with further evaluation based on the results of each model. The three models used in this study include Support Vector Machine (SVM), custom-built Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and ResNet50, with transfer learning. All these models are trained and structured to obtain output that is precise and accurate for the preprocessed data for the task of facial recognition. The performance for each model will also be viewed individually to see which model is best adapted to work under and provide an understanding of the strengths and limitations of each model. The result obtained shows that the accuracy of a Convolutional Neural Network model is up to 83% and that of the Support Vector Machine model is up to 79 %, whilst the accuracy of the ResNet50 is up to 88 %. Based on these results, we conclude that the ResNet50 with transfer learning model yields more efficient and scalable results compared to other models, with better effectiveness in its given task."

    "abstract": "The advancement of technology and interconnectivity has led to an increased adoption of sophisticated applications such as real-time facial recognition and object detection, which heavily rely on digital image processing. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have changed the way images are processed by making it possible to classify, detect, and recognize objects with great accuracy. However, as CNNs increase in layers and parameters to enhance accuracy, they also require the ability to process data efficiently and consume less power. Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) hardware accelerators present a viable solution owing to their adaptability in extensive parallel processing. This study proposed a hardware accelerator for CNNs by integrating the Depthwise Separable Convolution (DSC) technique with Operand Isolation (OI) across multiple multiplier architectures. An 8-bit fixed-point quantization technique was used to optimize data representation, enabling more straightforward computation and reduced memory requirements. The ASIC hardware accelerator was implemented on the Xilinx Kria KV260 Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) platform. The experimental results, implemented with the DSC, reduced model parameters and computational complexity by 23 % as compared to the conventional Digital Signal Processor (DSP)based architecture, while maintaining 90 % accuracy on the MNIST dataset with 8-bit data representation. FPGA synthesis results indicated significant reductions in LUTs, flip-flops, and DSPs, along with LUT RAM, with approximately 2.847 W of power consumption. Further optimization with Operand Isolation and the Dadda Multiplier (DSC-OI+Dadda) removed DSP dependency and achieved comparable efficiency, while the DSC-OI+Shift-and-Add design produced the best resource saving."

    "abstract": "The detection of elliptical shapes in images plays a vital role in numerous computer vision applications, including medical imaging, industrial inspection and remote sensing. While traditional methods primarily focus on thin, well-defined elliptical contours using edge detection or curve fitting, real-world images often present thick, blurred, or partially occluded elliptical structures that challenge these techniques. In this work, we tackle the problem of detecting multiple thick elliptical regions by introducing a novel probabilistic approach based on Finite Mixture Models, where a new distribution, called Ellipse-Anchored Gaussian Distribution (EllAGD) is defined and which models the intensity distribution around elliptical shapes and incorporates a spatial thickness parameter that effectively captures thick contours. An Expectation-Maximization algorithm is used to estimate all the multiple ellipse parameters including spatial occupancy rate, center, axes, orientation angle and thickness. The proposed method is applied on synthetic and real images containing single or multiple thick elliptical structures where, it shows its ability to recover accurately all the structures parameters even with challenging image conditions."

We evaluate our approach against standard (emotion-agnostic) prompting using a benchmark emotion-labeled datasets. Our results show that emotion-aware prompting enhances response empathy, alignment, and context sensitivity, making LLMs more suitable for emotionally rich applications such as mental health support, education, and customer service."

This paper presents an enhanced precision agriculture framework that integrates Internet of Things (IoT) sensing technologies with advanced machine learning models to optimize irrigation scheduling and soil nutrient management. Real-time environmental data, including soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and NPK nutrient levels, are collected through a NodeMCU ESP8266-based wireless sensor network. A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network is employed to forecast future soil moisture trends, enabling proactive irrigation decisions, while an Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) classifier predicts nutrient status categories (Deficient, Optimal, Excess) for nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. By combining sequential pattern learning and highaccuracy classification, the proposed system dynamically controls irrigation and fertilizer application through automated actuators. Experimental validation demonstrates that the hybrid LSTM-XGBoost model achieves significant improvements, attaining 89.5% irrigation prediction accuracy and 88.2 % nutrient classification F1-score, resulting in approximately 47 % water savings and optimized fertilizer utilization. This integrated approach enhances agricultural sustainability by minimizing resource wastage, maintaining soil health, and improving crop productivity. Future work will explore multi-sensor fusion and deep reinforcement learning for further system robustness under diverse agricultural conditions."

    "abstract": "Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) is associated with several complications. Previous research has classified the prognosis of T2DM for complications using a patient dataset at Panti Rapih Hospital, Yogyakarta. The dataset was taken from six years of patient medical records. The data set had missing value of 29%. Previous studies compared several imputation methods for missing values. The results demonstrated that the Linear Regression method provided the best imputation performance compared with other imputation methods, including MEAN and KNN. However, the Linear Regression imputation method cannot impute all the missing values in the dataset. The results obtained 598 instances with non-missing values out of the 700 instances in the dataset. Therefore, this study proposes the development of an ensemble method to impute missing values optimally. The proposed Ensemble Majority Voting method uses the imputation results from three base learner methods-MEAN, KNN, and Linear Regression-to vote by calculating the MODE value. The voting results are used as imputation values to build a new imputation dataset. The results show that Ensemble Majority Voting can impute all the missing values. Furthermore, this method improved the performance of the decision tree and Support Vector Machine classification methods when the imputed dataset was applied to classify the prognosis of T2DM patients with their complications. The best accuracy increased by 1.2%."

Additionally, this research implements a Large Language Model (LLM) using the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) method with the Pentest-AI model to assist users in the penetration testing process. With the implementation of RAG, the LLM model is expected to generate context-based recommendations and reduce the risk of hallucinations in model outputs. Evaluation results show that the developed application can detect various vulnerabilities on a web dummy, the implementation of RAG on the Pentest-AI model successfully improves answer accuracy and STS scores compared to before RAG implementation, and SUS testing yields an average SUS score of 83, categorised as Acceptable.

In contrast to the commonly used Random Waypoint Model, this work provides a thorough performance evaluation of video transmission over MANETs utilizing the Gauss-Markov mobility model. The NS-3.4.2 network simulator, which incorporates the M-AODV routing protocol, is used to carry out the analysis. The simulation environment is made up of more than fifty mobile nodes that can communicate over a 250-meter range while using a Wi-Fi channel for 100 seconds. Constant Bit Rate (CBR) video traffic is sent at 2.048 Kbps while node mobility is kept at 10 m / s. The goal of the study is to ascertain how mobility patterns affect video streaming performance by examining important QoS parameters such as Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR), end-to-end delay, jitter, and throughput. A comparison of the Random Waypoint and Gauss- Markov mobility models sheds light on how well-suited each is for real-time multimedia applications in dynamic network environments. The results aid in the improvement of adaptive video transmission techniques and mobility-aware protocols in MANET settings."

This technique is gaining attention as an access method for mobile communication systems between base station (BS) and user equipment (UE). Self-interference (SI) which occurs between the transmitter (TX) and receiver (RX) of BS must be eliminated to achieve full-duplex mobile communication. We have been investigating a transmission performance of QAM-OFDM signals when applying an adaptive self-interference canceller (SIC) based on channel estimation using demodulation reference signal (DMRS) in full-duplex mobile communication environments. This paper investigates BER performances of QAM-OFDM signals under full-duplex environments where SI channel fluctuates over time. Specifically, the BERs are demonstrated as parameters of number of DMRS symbols per resource block. The simulation results verify that increasing the number of DMRS symbols can achieve the better BER performance under the time-varying self-interference conditions."

    "abstract": "The development of EVs and their interaction with SBMSs contribute considerably to energy efficiency, grid responsiveness and environmental friendliness. Yet, this unification process raises essential cybersecurity issues related, e.g., to battery management systems (BMS) that, connected to digital infrastructures, are becoming dynamic. However, as EVs grow into key nodes of smart grids and building systems, the battery systems of EVs are confronted with various cyber threats including data intoxication, denial- of-service (DoS) attacks, and intrusion attacking the communication protocols or energy optimization algorithms. This study introduces a secure and adaptive cybersecurity framework for EV battery systems embedded in SBMS systems with an emphasis on realtime intrusion detection and response mechanisms. The proposed approach combines anomaly-based detection and machine learning methods to discover anomaly patterns in vehicular and building energy networks. It taps into distributed sensors, edge intelligence and secure communication technology to track battery state-of-health <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$(\\text{SoH})$</tex>, energy consumption patterns and control signals.

In order to detect and identify the compromised nodes, reconfigure BMS control layers, and keep energy supply to critical building functions running, a hybrid response mechanism is proposed. Performance is evaluated on an SBMS-EV integration testbed and results indicate that the framework has a high accuracy in detecting cyber intrusions, achieves low latency and a low false-alarm rate. The findings confirm notable resistance to APTs, and malicious firmware updates being directed more and more towards IoT-oriented energy devices. This work not only improves the cyber security of EV battery operations in smart buildings, but also has a broader impact in CPS security by providing a scalable, intelligent, and autonomous protection model. The findings signal that it will be possible to safely and securely integrate e-mobility into smart infrastructures of the future in a way that is easy to sustain."

To this end, we propose a lightweight model that integrates Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) and Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks (QCNNs), referred to as Quantum Graph-based Object Detection (QGOD), which exhibits a clear trade-off between detection accuracy and processing latency. Furthermore, the model incorporates a Lyapunov optimization-based control mechanism to dynamically adjust the model architecture according to traffic conditions, thereby maximizing the time-average performance."

    "abstract": "Bond investment is the process of purchasing and owning debt securities issued by the government or companies in the hope of obtaining returns in the form of coupons and potential capital gains. The bond investment mechanism involves several stages from issuance to trading in the secondary market. Bond issuance occurs in the primary market, where the issuer (the party issuing the bonds) offers bonds to investors through specific mechanisms. Although bonds are considered a relatively stable investment instrument, several transparency issues can impact investors, such as the risk of financial statement manipulation, which can cause investors to misjudge the credit risk of bonds. Rating agencies sometimes have a conflict of interest because the bond issuer pays them. The ratings given may not fully reflect the actual financial conditions. This research offers a solution to the problem of low transparency in transaction information for bond investments with blockchain technology. By applying blockchain technology to bond investments, each transaction will be validated by all stakeholders, ensuring the information produced is transparent and valid. This research uses a blockchain hybrid model to improve data privacy in government bond investments. The research uses a qualitative approach through literature review and prototype testing. The simulation results with Hyperledger show that blockchain technology can produce transparent and valid information for investors and bond investment stakeholders."

    "abstract": "Anomaly detection in surveillance videos remains challenging because of dynamic backgrounds, dense pedestrian flows, and the instability of conventional reconstruction-based models. This study presents an unsupervised framework that integrates object detection-driven Region of Interest (ROI) cropping, motion enhancement using Background Subtraction MOG2 (BSMOG2), and a lightweight Convolutional Autoencoder (CAE) for frame-level anomaly detection. The pipeline focuses on motion-relevant pedestrian regions through ROI cropping and suppresses background clutter using BSMOG2, while reconstruction is performed on compact <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$32 \\times 32$</tex> grayscale patches. An adaptive threshold computed from the mean and standard deviation of the validation reconstruction losses was employed to classify frames as normal or anomalous. Experimental results on three public benchmarks, UCSD Ped1, UCSD Ped2, and CUHK Avenue, demonstrate that the proposed method achieves promising performance, with the highest precision of 0.9305 and F1score of 0.6449 on UCSD Ped2, and competitive AUC-ROC values across datasets (0.5324 on Ped1, 0.5476 on Ped2, and 0.5391 on Avenue). Despite limited recall of complex scenes, the results confirm that ROI-based preprocessing and adaptive thresholding significantly improve anomaly localization and decision stability. This framework offers a lightweight, interpretable, and datasetagnostic solution suitable for real-time video surveillance, paving the way for future extensions using optimization-driven thresholding and attention-based architecture."

In this paper, we propose Multi-Task Hyperband with Deep Power Laws (MT-HyperDPL), an HPO algorithm augmented with budget allocation across multiple tasks to maximize average performance. Experiments show that the proposed algorithm achieves higher average performance than the baseline algorithm with equal budget allocation."

The task could be performed through a decentralised model training at different hospitals without the exchange of personal patient records, making it compliant with data governance policies and at the same time benefiting from diverse datasets to improve the diagnosis performance. FedAvg with a ResNet-based architecture was employed, which enabled real-time updates and stable generalisation among institutions. The system was tested in various deployment scenarios, including unseen hospital rooms and adversarial conditions. Experiments show that our federated learning training can obtain similar accuracy as centralised training and protect user’ private data so well. This framework shows exciting potential for AI-based secure, scalable and collaborative healthcare diagnostics, especially when targeting low-prevalence conditions."

Vehicles with four-wheel independent drive and steering (4WIDS) are ideal for such applications owing to their agile mobility. This paper proposes a hierarchical control strategy for trajectory tracking of 4WIDS vehicles in these complex environments. The strategy combines a feedforward controller, which rapidly computes reference wheel angles and driving forces based on kinematics and dynamics, with a feedback model predictive controller. The MPC layer leverages a vehicle dynamics model to optimize control inputs online, minimizing overshoot and steady-state error. Furthermore, an actuator effectiveness matrix is introduced, enabling dynamic control reallocation to maintain performance in the event of actuator failures. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method ensures stable and agile trajectory tracking within a simulated open-pit mine scenario."

Iron Fish is a privacy-oriented cryptocurrency that applies zk-SNARKs to ensure transaction confidentiality. Nonetheless, concerns persist regarding its reliance on a trusted setup, which may undermine user anonymity. This paper offers an empirical evaluation of Iron Fish's privacy guarantees by validating key blockchain components, including hash integrity, cryptographic commitments, and zk-SNARK proofs, using a dataset of 1,521 blocks. The results indicate that hash validation fails due to the proprietary and undisclosed Fish-Hash algorithm. In contrast, other components, such as blockchain structure, Merkle commitments, and zk-SNARKs, successfully pass all tests and operate as intended. These findings demonstrate both the strengths and the limitations of Iron Fish's privacy model, emphasizing the importance of greater transparency in hashing mechanisms. This paper contributes to ongoing discussions on verifiable privacy in blockchain systems and reinforces the role of empirical scrutiny in assessing emerging cryptocurrencies."

    "abstract": "Deformable Attention Transformers (DAT) have shown remarkable performance in computer vision tasks by adaptively focusing on informative image regions. However, their data-dependent sampling mechanism introduces irregular memory access patterns, posing significant challenges for efficient hardware deployment. Existing acceleration methods either incur high hardware overhead or compromise model accuracy. To address these issues, this paper proposes a hardware-friendly optimization framework for DAT. First, a neural architecture search (NAS)-based method with a new slicing strategy is proposed to automatically divide the input feature into uniform patches during the inference process, avoiding memory conflicts without modifying model architecture. The method explores the optimal slice configuration by jointly optimizing hardware cost and inference accuracy. Secondly, an FPGA-based verification system is designed to test the performance of this framework on edge-side hardware. Algorithm experiments on the ImageNet-1K dataset demonstrate that our hardware-friendly framework can maintain have only 0.2% accuracy drop compared to the baseline DAT. Hardware experiments on Xilinx FPGA show the proposed method reduces DRAM access times to 18% compared with existing DAT acceleration methods."

While conventional YOLO models achieve high detection accuracy, they require high-resolution input images and substantial computational resources, making them unsuitable for real-time deployment on embedded or mobile devices. To address this, the proposed model adopts MobileNet v2 as a lightweight backbone and introduces a connector module to integrate it with YOLO v8’s neck and head. We also apply channel-reduction techniques to further minimize the model’s complexity. The model is trained and evaluated using the COCO dataset, with a single-class setup focusing on the person class and an input resolution of 352×352 pixels. Experimental results show that the proposed model reduces the number of parameters by approximately 17% compared to the original YOLO v8, while achieving slightly improved detection accuracy. These results demonstrate that the proposed architecture achieves a favorable trade-off between computational efficiency and detection performance, making it suitable for real-time object detection on devices with limited resources."

By restoring High Resolution (HR) images while retaining fine texture features from Low Resolution (LR) inputs, the suggested method aims to improve image quality. Unlike traditional SR methods that focus solely on minimizing Mean Squared Error (MSE), our approach incorporates a perceptual loss function combining both content loss and adversarial loss. Deep residual architecture and skip connections are used by the generator. The discriminator distinguishes the real and generated HR images. We employ VGG19 network to capture high-level perceptual features for the content loss calculation. The SRGAN is trained and evaluated using the MIR Flickr dataset, with experiments performed on <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$4 \\times$</tex> downscaled images.

    "abstract": "Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols are essential for ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and authentication of data communications. Mutual authentication between client and server is crucial in high-security scenarios such as finance and government. However, existing TLS protocols typically rely on certificate-based public key infrastructures (PKI) for client authentication, which increases deployment complexity and introduces risks associated with third-party trust. In contrast, password-authenticated TLS protocols use memorable passwords for client authentication, offering advantages in simplicity and usability. Nonetheless, such protocols remain vulnerable to server compromise and fail to provide sufficient security against quantum adversaries.To address these challenges, we propose a novel TLS protocol based on asymmetric password-authenticated key exchange (PAKE). The protocol employs an asymmetric PAKE mechanism wherein only password-derived information is stored on the server, while the client derives its private key from the password. This design effectively mitigates the risk of server leakage attacks. The protocol further integrates two types of post-quantum secure key encapsulation mechanisms (KEMs): an OW-ChCCA (One-Way Checkable against Chosen-Ciphertext Attacks) secure KEM for server key exchange and authentication, and an OW-PCA (One-Way Plaintext-Checkable Attacks) secure KEM for binding the client’s password-derived private key to enable client authentication. Both KEMs support multi-user, multi-challenge settings and admit tight, post-quantum secure instantiations.Furthermore, this paper provides a formal security analysis of the proposed protocol within an optimized multi-stage key exchange model. By combining the random oracle and ideal cipher models with a game-based proof methodology, we demonstrate that the protocol achieves mutual authentication and forward secrecy, while also providing tight security bounds and post-quantum resilience. This work thus presents a promising solution for constructing post-quantum password-authenticated TLS protocols."

To this end, we extend the DCKD framework, previously used for RGB image super-resolution, to the IRSR domain and introduce new loss functions designed to maximize the preservation of key structural characteristics in infrared images, namely edge and spectral(Contourlet-domain) information. Through the proposed methodology, a lightweight student model trained with distilled knowledge from a high-performance, complex teacher model consistently achieved superior performance compared to the same architecture trained via standard supervised learning. This study demonstrates that Knowledge Distillation based methodology is effective for developing lightweight IRSR models and is expected to contribute to fields where high-efficiency IRSR is essential, such as real-time military surveillance, disaster response, and nocturnal reconnaissance."

By replacing the backbone network of YOLOv5s with MobileNetV3, the model's parameter count and computational complexity are significantly reduced. Experimental results on a self-built dataset containing 2867 images of electrical equipment defects show that the proposed model maintains high detection accuracy (mAP@0.5 reaches 87.0%) while reducing parameters by 72.3% and computation (FLOPs) by 68.1% compared to the original YOLOv5s, achieving an inference speed of 415 FPS on an RTX 3090 platform. Furthermore, deploying the model on an NVIDIA Jetson Nano edge device and optimizing it with TensorRT enables real-time detection performance of 22 FPS. To comprehensively evaluate edge deployment capability, we tested the model on multiple Jetson series devices (Jetson Nano, TX2, and Xavier NX), with FPS reaching 22,45, and 78 respectively. Additionally, we analyzed the model's detection performance for defects of different sizes, shapes, and locations, finding that the recall rate for small-sized defects (less than <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$32 \\times 32$</tex> pixels) needs improvement.

Early indications are that the FPGA system minimizes data acquisition latency by as much as 601 % and maximizes throughput by almost 501 % over microcontroller-based DAS. In addition, the parallel processing ability of the FPGA system enables it to process multiple sensors in parallel without sacrificing performance, with scalability gains of more than 40 %. Information from various sensors is collected and sent to a host PC via FTDI-based UART, where the information is presented on a customized Python Graphic User Interface (GUI).

The proposed ML-Pump, a bidirectional predictive model, tackles these challenges by functioning in both forward and reverse directions. It predicts performance metrics (including output voltage, efficiency, and power) from design parameters (including width, length, capacitance, input voltage, load, etc.), and conversely, determines the optimal design parameters needed to achieve the desired performance characteristics. A single-stage cross-coupled charge pump implemented in 90nm CMOS technology was utilized for training and evaluating several machine learning models (Random Forest, Multi-layer Perceptron regressor (MLPRegressor) and Gradient Boosting) on a comprehensive dataset of approximately 65,000 samples generated from Cadence simulations. The MLP Regressor demonstrated superior performance with mean MSE of 2.09e-02 and MAE of 5.00e-02, outperforming Random Forest and Gradient Boosting algorithms. This bidirectional prediction capability enables designers to instantly evaluate performance impacts of parameter changes without time-consuming EDA tool simulations, significantly accelerating the design optimization process. This framework significantly speeds up the design process by enabling early prediction of performance metrics and design parameters, thereby improving efficiency and circuit performance."

    "abstract": "Federated Machine Learning enables collaborative training across multiple participating clients without need to share private data. Data heterogeneity among participants poses a significant challenge in federated learning. It can cause divergence in client updates and hinder convergence of the global model. Traditional approaches like FedAvg aggregate updates by equally weighting all clients. This may lead to performance degradation under data heterogeneity. RobFedAvg identifies extreme client updates as outliers and discard node-specific outlier updates prior to aggregation. ResFedAvg considers that extreme client updates may represent significant learning. Therefore, it restricts their contribution rather than discarding them during model averaging. However, ResFedAvg does not consider limiting extreme updates in proportion to their divergence from the mean. All the extreme updates are treated equally for aggregation. This paper proposes Distance-Guided Proportional Aggregation (DistFedAvg), a novel aggregation algorithm that incorporates extreme client updates by weighting them in proportion to their distance from the mean. All other updates are aggregated without modification. Experimental evaluations are carried out on MNIST with IID and non-IID datasets. Distance-Guided Proportional Aggregation performs better compared to RobFedAvg and ResFedAvg in terms of convergence and accuracy on IID and non-IID data."

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a glaucoma-detecting model, which requires retinal fundus images and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The suggested method provides a convenient and effective method of detecting the early signs of glaucoma through proper classification of fundus images as healthy or glaucomatous. One of the diseases that can be studied using different deep learning (DL) models in order to accurately localize is glaucoma as an irreversible disease that causes loss of vision. Based on these developments, this study proposes a CNNbased method of dependable glaucoma diagnosis. CNN allows to distinguish between glaucomatous and non-glaucomatous samples well with its layered, differentiable architecture of image segmentation. The framework is tested at six levels, and dropout mechanisms are adopted to improve its performance and to obtain some better representation within glaucomatous areas."

    "abstract": "This paper investigates spatial practices in immersive virtual classrooms using the example of a university lecture conducted in social virtual reality (VR). Drawing on spatial sociology, the study examines how students position and reposition themselves after the shift from interactive to frontal teaching units in social VR. Using videography, spatial patterns were recorded, observed, and compared across four semesters. Findings reveal that students consistently enact classroom-like formations such as plenary configurations and spatial distancing from the lecturer even in a gamified, open virtual environment without seating arrangements or explicit instructions. These patterns suggest a transfer of spatial practices from physical to virtual learning contexts. The study highlights how spatial positioning in VR reflects and produces both didactic settings and social dynamics, offering a qualitative perspective on the role of spatiality for learning in social VR."

    "abstract": "Epilepsy is a prevalent neurological disorder that is typically diagnosed by interpreting electroencephalography (EEG) recordings that reveal patterns of epileptic seizures. However, EEG analysis is complex and requires expertise because of variations in seizures and potential artifacts mimicking epileptiform activity. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are a prominent approach for addressing these challenges and effectively classifying epilepsy-related EEG signals. This paper provides an overview of classification techniques for detecting epilepsy symptoms using EEG data, focusing on both traditional machine learning and recent advancements in deep learning. An automated method was introduced to detect epilepsy through feature extraction and selection from EEG signals. Key features, such as Approximate Entropy, Fuzzy Entropy, and Standard Deviation, are derived using Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT). A Random Forest algorithm selects relevant features, followed by a CNN for classification. This study also reviews studies comparing machine learning and neural network techniques, showing that CNN-based methods generally outperform traditional approaches, including Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forests, in terms of accuracy. In conclusion, the integration of AI into EEG analysis improves diagnostic accuracy and enables early seizure warnings, offering timely alerts for patients and enhancing their quality of life through more personalized treatment options."

Road accidents are an unfortunate event that occurs frequently on the roads and these accidents cause property damage, injuries and deaths. Every year about 480000 accidents occur in India in which 188000 people aged 18 to 45 years die, due to which the following are the main causes of accidents, speeding, careless driving, drunk driving, distraction and violation of traffic rules. Apart from this, bad road conditions, increasing population and weather-related problems are also contributing to road accidents. Keeping all these road accidents in mind, IOT based system has been proposed in this paper so that it can effectively help in preventing any kind of accidents and if such a situation arises, how does it detect and inform the concerned authorities and people so that such a situation can be immediately attended to and timely treatment can be done. This system can detect the condition of accidents with the help of gyroscope sensor, IR sensor, alcohol sensor, sleeping sensor. It detects the accident and uses the GPS module to find the location of the accident so that the correct location of the accident can be known and timely arrival can be made. Accordingly, the loved ones of the person and the nearest hospitals are informed through an alert message, using which the problems of road accidents can be reduced, and this system can prove to be helpful in saving the lives of people."

However, the performance of predictive models is highly dependent on hyperparameter configuration, which is often tuned manually and may lead to suboptimal results. To address this challenge, this study applies AutoML-based hyperparameter optimization to five widely used classification algorithms: Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting (GB), and Neural Network (NN). Ten benchmark datasets from the NASA Metrics Data Program (MDP) were employed, and evaluation was conducted using 10-fold cross-validation with comprehensive metrics, including Accuracy, AUC, F1-score, and G-Mean. The experimental results demonstrate that AutoML significantly improves the model performance, particularly for metrics sensitive to class imbalance. The neural Network (NN) achieved the highest F1-score improvement from 0.53 to 0.63 and the highest accuracy of 0.99, while ensemble models (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{R F}$</tex> and GB) reached the best AUC values up to 0.98 and G-Mean up to 0.70 on larger datasets such as PC4 and PC5. Conversely, linear models (LR and SVM) showed limited or inconsistent improvements, suggesting that AutoML is more effective for complex algorithm development. Overall, these findings highlight the potential of AutoML to automate hyperparameter optimization and enhance the predictive accuracy of SDP tasks."

The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has helped resolve this task to a good extent. Recent literature have demonstrated that LLMs alone remain insufficient. We introduce a multi-agent portfolio construction architecture that integrates LLMs with an agentic orchestration architecture to enhance financial asset allocation workflows. With LangGraph, the system orchestrates interactions between LLM-based agents and functional nodes, enabling adaptive decision-making. The pipeline begins with parsing natural language investment objectives, followed by real-time data retrieval, financial metric computation, and portfolio generation tailored to the user’s risk profile and constraints. The results not only addresses risk-aware investing but also that the final output includes validation and a human-readable commentary. This approach addresses key deficiencies in standalone LLMs, such as lack of real-time awareness, by coordinating modular agents that specialize in tasks like data retrieval, analysis, and reporting. The architecture demonstrates how multi-agent LLM systems can perform complex, high-stakes financial tasks with adaptability, transparency, and robustness, marking a promising direction for AI-driven portfolio management.<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sup>"

However, existing work still falls short in the end-to-end formal verification of industrial-grade complex protocols. This paper proposes the BIPSec framework, which applies the Behavior-Interaction-Priority (BIP) architecture to collaborative verification of IPSec protocols. The framework employs a three-layer design: 1) Establishing atomic components to model AH/ESP protocol entities, using connectors to constrain transport/tunnel mode data flow paths, and handling resource contention through priority rules; 2) Introducing a bidirectional mapping mechanism between BIP models and strongSwan/XFRM implementations, adopting Netlink message flow control plane verification and Tracepoints data plane evidence collection methods to achieve semantic alignment between formal models and actual code; 3) Employing hierarchical component design and state optimization strategies to effectively manage verification complexity. Experimental results show that BIPSec efficiently verifies the three core properties of AH/ESP, achieving high consistency between protocol layer and implementation layer in test cases, providing an effective verification solution for industrial-grade IPSec protocol stacks."

ProvAuditChain utilizes lightweight smart contracts to securely anchor cryptographically signed audit report hashes on-chain, while storing the complete reports on decentralized IPFS storage. We deploy the system on the Arbitrum Sepolia testnet and benchmark gas consumption, latency, and throughput across 600 audit cycles. Our results demonstrate a stable average gas cost of approximately 173,000 per audit, equivalent to roughly $0.05 USD, alongside a throughput of nearly six audits per minute. These findings confirm the practical viability of ProvAuditChain for integration into automated CI/CD pipelines, providing a scalable foundation for trustworthy AI accountability in decentralized ecosystems."

To address this challenge, we propose a hybrid quantum-classical generative adversarial network for patch-based image generation. Our method employs dual PQC-based generators that decompose images into structured patches, while local and global classical discriminators jointly capture local details and preserve global structural coherence. This design addresses scalability limitations of existing QGANs and mitigates patch-boundary artifacts, thereby enabling high-resolution image generation on hardware with restricted qubit counts. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, demonstrating improvements in image fidelity over existing baselines, and providing insights into the influence of qubit count on generative performance."

    "abstract": "The development of deep language models (DLMs) has made them more widely used. This has led to a growing need for tools that can help understand how these models work, especially when it comes to understanding the reasoning behind their outputs. This explainability is emerging as a key factor in building trust between users and technologies. Achieving meaningful interpretability remains a significant challenge, especially when DLMs are considered black-box systems, where internal details like parameters and gradients are inaccessible. Although many techniques have been proposed, most struggle to meet two critical goals simultaneously: (i) maintaining efficiency during inference, and (ii) remaining compatible with black-box models without causing out-of-distribution behaviors. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a method that explains model predictions by selecting a concise and informative subset of input words. Our approach involves training a lightweight selection network to identify a minimal yet informative subset of input tokens. Once trained, this network operates with high efficiency, directly identifying a salient subset of words as the explanation for new samples at inference time. For training, we leverage policy gradients for optimization, which critically allows our method to operate without requiring gradient information from the target DLM, thus making it inherently applicable to black-box systems by directly interacting with the target DLM solely through its input-output predictions without requiring any gradient information."

However, employee performance datasets generally lack reliable labels. Therefore, we present a semi-supervised learning framework that combines a small set of expert-labeled records with a large pool of unlabeled data. In addition, group-based features are incorporated to ensure fair workload allocation among working groups. Also, statistical smoothing is used to stabilize small groups and weights deviations according to task complexity. Lastly, an iterative high-confidence pseudo-labeling procedure is employed to expand the labeled set, while distributional stability is monitored to prevent imbalance. In numerical studies, the framework enlarged the labeled portion from 4% to 92% without destabilizing the core feature distributions. After semi-supervised learning, the main features had stable means and lower standard deviations. This shows that the framework reduces the burden of expert labeling, enables fairer comparisons through group-based features and statistical smoothing, and can be smoothly integrated into employee performance analytics pipelines."

    "abstract": "Modern wireless systems, such as UAV-based spectrum monitoring platforms, increasingly require simultaneous signal classification and reconstruction to operate under constrained resources and real-time demands. Multitask learning (MTL) offers a unified model to optimize both tasks jointly, reducing computational cost and deployment complexity; however, the inherent conflict between task objectives-discriminative feature extraction for classification versus signal fidelity preservation for reconstruction-raises concerns about the effectiveness of end-to-end joint optimization. This paper presents a comparative study between two training paradigms: simultaneous multitask learning, where tasks are trained jointly, and sequential multitask learning, where tasks are trained independently before integration. We design a multitask architecture comprising a convolutional encoder, a variational autoencoder (VAE) decoder, and a CNN classifier, employing KL annealing to stabilize the latent space during training.

These findings highlight the limitations of joint training under conflicting objectives and advocate for sequential optimization when high task-specific performance is critical."

Wireless smart ubiquitous network, based on the IEEE 802.15.4g standard, provides low-power long-range communication, but performance degrades in corridors due to periodic ripples in the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) caused by multi-path. Existing propagation models often fail to capture these fluctuations, leading to a large prediction error. This paper presents RSSI measurements at 917.1 MHz under frequency-shift keying (FSK) and orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) schemes and proposes reflection-aware path loss models whose coefficients are optimized via the soft actor-critic learning algorithm. The results show a significantly lower error in RSSI predictions, supporting more reliable indoor Internet of Things (IoT) planning."

    "abstract": "With the growing level of information technology in college physical education, many people now try to use data-driven methods to improve teaching quality and management. This topic has become very important in education management. Today, physical education courses often face several problems, such as scattered data, a single way of evaluation, and slow teaching feedback. These issues make it hard to support students' personal learning needs and teachers' precise teaching goals. To deal with these challenges, this study builds a physical education course analysis and management system based on a decision tree algorithm. The system uses many types of data, such as students' physical fitness indicators, classroom performance, course participation, and teacher evaluations. After data preprocessing, feature selection, and decision tree modeling, the system can predict student performance, find key factors, and evaluate course quality in a smart way. At the same time, the system shows clear rules through visual tools and provides modular functions. These functions help teachers improve teaching strategies, give students personalized learning feedback, and support managers in making better decisions about course resources. Experimental results show that the decision tree achieves up to 0.87 accuracy and 0.85 F1score, outperforming classical baselines such as logistic regression and SVM, confirming its suitability for physical education course analysis. The system also improves the speed of teaching feedback, the efficiency of course evaluation, and the quality of management decisions. This study offers a useful way to make physical education course management more smart and accurate. It also prepares the ground for future work on multi-model systems, cross-school data sharing, and the use of wearable devices."

To overcome this, we propose a novel multi-task learning (MTL)-based feature extraction model designed to enhance both the efficiency and accuracy of duplicate image detection. Our model utilizes a MobileNetV2 backbone augmented with two task-specific branches: a low-dimensional embedding branch for efficient similarity retrieval and a classification branch that leverages content-type cues to reduce false positives. Furthermore, we incorporate a contrastive learning strategy with cross-batch negative samples to significantly boost the discriminative power of the learned features. Experimental results confirm that our proposed architecture yields compact and semantically rich representations, evidenced by improved clustering in t-SNE visualizations and stable convergence during training. This approach not only reduces GPU memory requirements but also enhances robustness to various image transformations."

    "abstract": "Humans naturally develop preferences for how manipulation tasks should be performed, which are often subtle, personal, and difficult to articulate. Although it is important for robots to account for these preferences to increase personalization and user satisfaction, they remain largely underexplored in robotic manipulation, particularly in the context of deformable objects like garments and fabrics. In this work, we study how to adapt pretrained visuomotor diffusion policies to reflect preferred behaviors using limited demonstrations. We introduce RKO, a novel preference-alignment method that combines the benefits of two recent frameworks: RPO and KTO. We evaluate RKO against common preference learning frameworks, including these two, as well as a baseline vanilla diffusion policy, on real-world cloth-folding tasks spanning multiple garments and preference settings. We show that preference-aligned policies (particularly RKO) achieve superior performance and sample efficiency compared to standard diffusion policy fine-tuning. These results highlight the importance and feasibility of structured preference learning for scaling personalized robot behavior in complex deformable object manipulation tasks."

The exceptional sensitivity and fast response characteristics are achieved through the utilization of a unique bilayer design and a synaptic conductive layer with rapid recovery capability.

    "abstract": "Unsupervised human motion segmentation (HMS) can be effectively achieved using subspace clustering techniques. However, traditional methods overlook the role of temporal semantic exploration in HMS. This paper explores the use of temporal vision semantics (TVS) derived from human motion sequences, leveraging the image-to-text capabilities of a large language model (LLM) to enhance subspace clustering performance. The core idea is to extract textual motion information from consecutive frames via LLM and incorporate this learned information into the subspace clustering framework. The primary challenge lies in learning TVS from human motion sequences using LLM and incorporating this information into subspace clustering. To address this, we determine whether consecutive frames depict the same motion by querying the LLM and subsequently learn temporal neighboring information based on its response. We then develop a TVS-integrated subspace clustering approach, incorporating subspace embedding with a temporal regularizer that induces each frame to share similar subspace embeddings with its temporal neighbors. Additionally, segmentation is performed based on subspace embedding with a temporal constraint that induces the grouping of each frame with its temporal neighbors. We also introduce a feedback-enabled framework that continuously optimizes subspace embedding based on the segmentation output. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches on four benchmark human motion datasets."

Despite the advances in flexible sensors and skins, tactile sensing at the fingertip of robotic hands remains an open question. Exploiting embedded six-axis force/torque (F/T) sensors for external stimuli estimation, namely, intrinsic tactile sensing, seems to be an effective solution. Here, we present OriCube, an origami-inspired, fingertip-size (14.5 × 14.5 × 12.5 mm<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup>), lightweight (4 g), fully integrated, inductive six-axis F/T sensor. It utilizes an origami coil array to achieve self-decoupled six-axis F/T measurements by detecting the displacements and rotations of a metal shell via eddy–current coupling. A modular silicone spring-based elastomer design allows fine-tuning of the stiffness and performance of each axis independently. The calibrated OriCube exhibits a high resolution of 0.01% F.S. (23 N), low crosstalk (2%), high stability (<0.2% drift in 6 h), and insensitivity to strong magnetic field changes. It is capable of detecting light touch by a feather as well as high impact force when hammered.

    "abstract": "Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) models are the foundation of contemporary point cloud processing. However, their complex network architectures obscure the source of their strength and limit the application of these models. In this article, we develop a two-stage abstraction and refinement (ABS-REF) view for modular feature extraction in point cloud processing. This view elucidates that whereas the early models focused on ABS stages, the more recent techniques devise sophisticated REF stages to attain performance advantages. Then, we propose a High-dimensional Positional Encoding (HPE) module to explicitly utilize intrinsic positional information, extending the “positional encoding” concept from Transformer literature. HPE can be readily deployed in MLP-based architectures and is compatible with transformer-based methods. Within our ABS-REF view, we rethink local aggregation in MLP-based methods and propose replacing time-consuming local MLP operations, which are used to capture local relationships among neighbors. Instead, we use non-local MLPs for efficient non-local information updates, combined with the proposed HPE for effective local information representation. We leverage our modules to develop HPENets, a suite of MLP networks that follow the ABS-REF paradigm, incorporating a scalable HPE-based REF stage. Extensive experiments on seven public datasets across four different tasks show that HPENets deliver a strong balance between efficiency and effectiveness. Notably, HPENet surpasses PointNeXt, a strong MLP-based counterpart, by 1.1% mAcc, 4.0% mIoU, 1.8% mIoU and 0.2% Cls. mIoU, with only 50.0%, 21.5%, 23.1%, 44.4% of FLOPs on ScanObjectNN, S3DIS, ScanNet, and ShapeNetPart, respectively.

    "abstract": "In wafer scanners, synchronization accuracy between the wafer stage and reticle stage (RS) directly determines exposure quality. Existing main–secondary control methods face three challenges. First, the measured synchronization error inherently couples the RS tracking error and main–secondary error, making precise compensation difficult. Second, existing methods based on model inversion or iterative feedforward approaches exhibit limited capability in suppressing inevitable external disturbances. Third, directly modifying existing servo control loops is often impractical due to proprietary control architectures. To address these challenges, this article proposes iterative and real-time synchronization trajectory modification control (IRSTMC), achieving high-precision synchronization tracking and disturbance rejection without altering the original servo control loop. The method features three key innovations. First, a time-frequency analysis-based decoupling technique is developed to predict RS position and extract the dominant main-secondary error, establishing the foundation for precise compensation. Second, a unified dual-module scheme integrating iterative synchronization trajectory modification (ISTM) and real-time synchronization trajectory modification (RSTM) is proposed, where ISTM compensates tracking errors through iterative learning and RSTM suppresses stochastic disturbances through real-time correction via external synchronization feedback. Third, unlike existing trajectory compensation methods requiring predefined references, IRSTMC enables trajectory modification for real-time generated references. Experimental validation demonstrates that IRSTMC achieves 65% improvement over the baseline method and significantly outperforms existing approaches in synchronization accuracy."

    "abstract": "In recent years, with the increasing number of individuals suspected of having diabetes, the importance of continuous blood glucose monitoring has grown. However, currently widespread household blood glucose measurement methods are invasive. This not only imposes physical and psychological burdens on users but also poses a risk of infectious diseases. Therefore, there is a strong demand for the development of safe and non-invasive blood glucose measurement devices. A noninvasive and non-destructive method of measuring sugar content of fruits using optical sensors has been established. Focusing on the near-infrared spectroscopy used in this method, the aim is to construct a non-invasive blood glucose measurement method. This paper examines a non-invasive blood glucose estimation method using near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy measured by an optical sensor, combined with machine-learning models. First, a glucose concentration prediction model is constructed based on a multilayer perceptron (MLP) trained on absorbance data over the full wavelength range of 680-2500 nm, obtained using near-infrared spectroscopy, which is considered harmless to the human body. Next, considering practical application, Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping) is used to identify the wavelengths emphasized by the machine learning model during prediction. Finally, this paper examines a method for estimating glucose concentration using an MLP model trained on absorbance data of the selected wavelengths. The prediction accuracy is evaluated using MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error). The target error is set at 0.1% or less to discriminate between pre- and postprandial glucose variations. As a result, the model using all wavelengths achieves a MAPE of 0.0593%. In the models using eight and seven selected wavelengths, MAPE values of 0.0773% and 0.0658% are confirmed, respectively, both satisfying the target of MAPE below 0.1%. Additionally, it is confirmed that even with 6 to 4 wavelengths, glucose concentration can be estimated with MAPE below 0.2%."

    "abstract": "In 6G networks, providing ultra-space, ultra-connectivity, and ultra-precision services is a key objective, driving active research and standardization efforts. Among these, non-terrestrial networks (NTNs), particularly those using low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites, have gained significant attention. However, the high mobility of satellites and the harsh space environment pose challenges to seamless service for terrestrial user equipment (UE), especially mobile UE (MUE). This paper proposes a reinforcement learning-based handover optimization method for multi-layer satellite networks. The scheme utilizes long short-term memory (LSTM) networks to predict the time-series mobility of satellites and MUEs, and applies a multi-agent deep Q-network (MADQN) to optimize handover decisions. Simulation results show that the proposed method improves the quality of service (QoS) for MUEs and enhances overall system throughput."

    "abstract": "Workplace stress is a serious issue nowadays. Most managers and entrepreneurs face numerous problems at work and in their personal lives. Stress is ordinary portion of life but extreme stress can influence employee’s capableness, fitness, and sentiments. When an employee is stressed, he loses his confidence, he won’t want to take responsibility, he gets irritated easily, he is not satisfied with his job, and his performance is low which ultimately is a danger to the organization in which he is working. Stress affects organizational welfare as well as the personal behavior of employees. Every employee has different factors of stress. Working in a bank is one of the most stressful jobs due to the consistent pressure of delivering services and the best to their customers. Occupational stress has become a major hazard for many employees due to increasing workload, unrealistic time pressure, inflexible time, less support from colleagues, lesser empowerment, less respect at the workplace, and many more. The study aims to determine the prevalence of employment anxiety in the banking industry and to identify the anxiety factor relationship with the productivity of employees in banks. The study seeks to offer useful insights and suggestions for building a healthier and more effective work environment in the banking industry by identifying stress factors and their impact."

    "abstract": "In Transformer-based models such as BERT, Layer Normalization (LayerNorm) accounts for a significant portion of total computations, and its efficiency directly impacts model performance. Among LayerNorm components, the reciprocal square root operation is particularly challenging due to its non-linear operations such as division and square root. These operations result in significant accuracy degradation, increased latency and high area overhead. To address these challenges, this paper proposes Compressed Reciprocal Newton's method for efficient Layer Normalization (CoRN-LN) which is a novel approximation architecture that improves accuracy and hardware area. CoRN-LN introduces three key contributions: a 16 bit compression method to reduce computational complexity, the Leading-One-Detector (LOD)-aware initial guess that dynamically adapts to input value to improve accuracy and latency, and the reciprocal-form Newton Approximation to eliminate the divider. The CoRN-LN architecture and the baseline were implemented in Verilog HDL and synthesized using the Samsung 28nm CMOS process for fair comparison. We demonstrate that the CoRN-LN reduces Mean Square Error (MSE) from <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$5.50 \\times 10^{-2}$</tex> to <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$8.85 \\times 10^{-6}$</tex>, and <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$7 \\times$</tex> area reduction over baseline, using only 2-cycle."

    "abstract": "As Large Language Models (LLMs) gain traction across critical domains, ensuring secure and trustworthy training processes has become a major concern. Backdoor attacks, among various threats—where malicious actors inject hidden triggers into training data—are particularly insidious and difficult to detect. Existing post-training verification solutions like Proof-of-Learning are impractical for LLMs due to their requirement for full retraining, lack robustness against stealthy manipulations, and inability to provide early detection during training—a property that would significantly reduce computational costs. To address these limitations, we introduce Proof-of-Training Steps, a verification protocol that enables an independent auditor (Alice) to confirm that an LLM developer (Bob) has followed the declared training recipe, including data batches, architecture, and hyperparameters. By analyzing the sensitivity of the LLMs’ language modeling head (LM-Head) to input perturbations, our method can expose subtle backdoor injections or deviations in training. Even with backdoor triggers in up to 10% of the training data, our protocol significantly reduces the attacker’s ability to achieve a high attack success rate (ASR). Our method enables early detection of the attack (at the step the attack is injected), with verification step being 3× faster than a training step. Our results highlight the protocol’s potential to enhance the accountability and security of LLM development, especially against insider threats."

Crowdsourced testing has emerged as an effective approach for vulnerability discovery in ICS environments, but faces significant challenges in privacy preservation, multi-objective optimization, and adversarial robustness. This paper proposes a novel Federated Matching Learning (FML) framework for privacy-preserving task allocation in ICS crowdsourced testing. Our method consists of three key components: (1) a FML module that employs knowledge graph-enhanced representations to estimate tasktester affinity without centralizing sensitive data; (2) a hybrid metaheuristic scheduling algorithm that efficiently solves the multi-objective allocation problem on reduced candidate graphs; and (3) a dynamic reputation and adversary detection subsystem that ensures system robustness against malicious participants. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves significant improvements in task completion efficiency while maintaining high vulnerability discovery rates and system robustness, even under high proportions of malicious testers. The proposed framework provides a comprehensive solution for secure, efficient, and reliable crowdsourced testing in ICS."

However, the lack of p-type devices breaks the symmetry of conventional CMOS logic, and the technology requires a double-gate structure with bias voltage to adjust the I-V characteristics. While previous studies have primarily focused on fabrication and application aspects, the electronic design automation (EDA) perspective remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose the first standard cell synthesis framework for a-IGZO TFTs. The framework features a cell layout architecture that integrates bias voltage into power rail planning and adopts multirow transistor placement to address logic asymmetry. Transistor placement is modeled as an exact cover with colors (XCC) problem and solved using the dancing cells algorithm, while intra-cell routing is formulated with satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) to account for double-gate and multi-rail structures. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed architecture and methodologies."

The Transformer extracts temporal features, while the LSTM captures sequential dependencies for improved classification. Tested on a clinical EEG dataset (14 SZ, 14 HC), the model achieves 99.07% accuracy-outperforming CNN, LSTM, and CNN-LSTM baselines.

Accurate prediction of student achievement is crucial for enabling these systems to deliver timely interventions and offer data-driven support. This paper presents the application of machine learning models to predict final exam grades in a university-level programming course. It investigates the use of multi-modal student data to enhance prediction accuracy. In particular, a recent raw dataset of students enrolled in a programming course across ten different class sections, collected one month prior to the final exam, was initially processed. From this data, a comprehensive set of features was engineered, including assessment grades and completion durations, digital learning interactions, and engagement metrics. These features were then used to train and evaluate six machine learning prediction models, where Random Forest has achieved the highest predictive accuracy (above $90 \\%$). Feature importance analysis has revealed that the midterm grade and the average completion duration of lab assessments are the most influential predictors. The results highlight the significant potential of early grade prediction as a practical and efficient tool for programming educational recommender systems. This data-driven approach allows instructors to identify and support atrisk students, paving the way for adaptive learning environments that offer personalized feedback, targeted resources, and timely interventions. Ultimately, such systems promote deeper student engagement, enhance academic performance, and improve retention rates within computing disciplines."

By modulating a dual-tone signal and employing a double optical mixing architecture, this approach simultaneously achieves wide-range and high-precision delay measurements. Experimental results demonstrate an ultra-high precision of ±12 fs in measuring the motorized optical delay line. Furthermore, we validate the capability of the system for wide-range delay measurement through a 10 km fiber test. The delay measurement accuracy of the system under low signal power conditions is also validated.

    "abstract": "Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have performance advantages in neuromorphic computing owing to their low power consumption and event-driven characteristics. During SNNs computation, data encoding plays a decisive role. The mainstream encoding methods include direct encoding and time encoding. Direct encoding offers high accuracy but incurs heavy floatingpoint computation, while time encoding reduces computational load through sparsity but suffers from severe information loss and long latency. To address the bottlenecks in single encoding schemes, hybrid encoding is proposed, but it still incurs significant floating-point computation in the input layer. This paper proposes an optimized hybrid sparse encoding strategy that applies threshold-based direct encoding in the first timestep to reduce floating-point computation, followed by time encoding to ensure spike sparsity. A single-spike neuron circuit and a multiplication-free, hardware-friendly encoder are introduced to further reduce power consumption. Experiments show 90.65% and 65.23% accuracy on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, with a 2% drop in input-layer floating-point operations and up to <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{2 5 \\%}$</tex> lower spike firing rates.

    "abstract": "The convergence of Cyber-Physical Industrial Systems (CPIS) with intelligent automation has enhanced operational efficiency but simultaneously introduced complex security and interpretability challenges. Conventional Artificial Intelligence (AI) models employed in industrial cybersecurity often lack transparency, making their decisions difficult to justify in critical control environments. Additionally, centralized data management mechanisms remain vulnerable to tampering and single-point failures. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a novel Blockchain-Integrated Explainable Federated Intelligence Framework (B-XFIF) for secure and transparent CPIS operations. The B-XFIF integrates federated learning with blockchain and Explainable AI (XAI) principles to achieve three core objectives: (1) decentralized and privacy-preserving model training across distributed industrial nodes, (2) immutable blockchain-based logging of model updates and security events, and (3) interpretable decision support through explainable reasoning layers. This hybrid approach eliminates the need for centralized data aggregation, ensures data authenticity, and provides human-understandable justifications for AI-driven security decisions. Experimental evaluations on benchmark CPIS datasets demonstrate that B-XFIF enhances detection accuracy by 12%, reduces latency in anomaly response by 18%, and significantly improves operator trust through interpretable insights. The proposed model establishes a foundation for resilient, transparent, and trustworthy industrial ecosystems that align with emerging standards of Industry 5.0. The proposed B-XFIF achieved key parameter values: detection accuracy 94.8%, model update latency 130ms, blockchain throughput 75 TPS, and interpretability score 90%, confirming superior secure and explainable performance."

Measurement data from six regions were synthesized to simulate realistic electromagnetic noise conditions, including sporadic and non-specific anomalous received power events. The preprocessing step reduced the high- dimensional feature space to two principal components while preserving more than 97% of the total variance, thereby enabling efficient visualization and robust feature extraction for subsequent learning algorithms. For radio noise monitoring and interference management across various urban areas in South Korea, this study conducted a comparison and simulation of the performance of well–known unsupervised machine learning algorithms. Although the analysis was limited in terms of the measurement data and the applied unsupervised learning methods, the results indicated that the DBSCAN method was more effective than the Isolation Forest in detecting and capturing anomalies, suggesting its potential applicability in future related research."

    "abstract": "Providing effective, personalized feedback on student writing remains a significant challenge in English academic writing instruction, particularly for non-native speakers. Traditional manual feedback is labor-intensive and difficult to scale, while existing automated writing evaluation systems often generate generic suggestions that fail to address individual learners' diverse proficiency levels and error patterns. This paper presents a novel AI-assisted writing feedback system that integrates GPT-4 with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) reinforcement learning to deliver personalized, pedagogically sound guidance. Our system constructs detailed student profiles capturing proficiency levels, error patterns, and learning preferences, which are injected into carefully engineered multidimensional prompts covering content, structure, language, and logic dimensions. The PPO algorithm continuously optimizes feedback quality by learning from human expert evaluations and student revision outcomes through a reward function balancing specificity, constructiveness, and actionability. We conducted a randomized controlled trial with 300 undergraduate students from three universities, comparing our approach against human instructor feedback and vanilla GPT-4 baselines. Experimental results demonstrate that our system achieves 32.5% improvement in essay quality, significantly outperforming human feedback (18.9%) and generic GPT-4 (17.1%), with p<0.001 statistical significance. Student satisfaction ratings reached 4.3/5.0, with particular strengths in feedback specificity (4.5/5.0) and actionability (4.1/5.0). Additionally, the system reduced instructor workload by 65% while maintaining high-quality oversight. Ablation studies confirm that both personalization and reinforcement learning components contribute substantially to overall performance, with their combination yielding synergistic effects. This work establishes a generalizable framework for applying large language models to educational contexts through personalization and continuous learning, offering a scalable solution to individualized writing instruction in resourceconstrained settings."

Detection systems are typically centralized, opaque, and cannot scale with changing tactics. On the other hand, machine learning-based approaches are powerful but opaque and resource-intensive. This paper presents a novel hybrid framework that applies graph theory and blockchain technology to overcome these challenges. The framework models telecom interactions as a graph and uses deterministic graph-theoretic algorithms to detect fraudulent patterns such as call spamming, fraud rings, and anomalous behaviors. For transparency and tamper-proof accountability, detected frauds are immutably logged onto a Layer 2 blockchain, allowing for scalability and cost-efficiency. A private blockchain layer enables secure data sharing among telecom providers without compromising subscriber privacy. Experiments show how such a framework can effectively detect fraud, maintaining high accuracy while being interpretable and scalable. Such a lightweight, transparent, collaborative alternative can emerge as a solution against the ever-evolving problem of telecom fraud in comparison to other solutions."

The current solution standardized by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) introduces IKE_INTERMEDIATE exchanges with fragmentation. However, its inherent reliance on a full-message retransmission model causes a severe performance issue in lossy networks. While previous research has quantified this exponential overhead, it has not resolved the underlying conflict between fragmented transmission and full-message retransmission. To address this inefficiency, this paper proposes a lightweight, cache-based selective retransmission mechanism using bitmap acknowledgments. We construct a theoretical model to reveal the root cause of the standard scheme’s overhead and design our backward-compatible solution. A prototype is then implemented and validated on the strongSwan platform. Results demonstrate that our mechanism reduces additional transmission overhead by over 60% under lossy conditions. This work provides a critical optimization for deploying post-quantum protocols in realworld environments, enabling the practical application of large-payload PQC algorithms."

Since ECC was introduced to address increasing DRAM error rates caused by technology scaling, RS codes have been widely employed in various chipkill ECC solutions because of their robust burst error correction capability. Due to the limited codeword length of 4-bit symbol RS codes and mismatches with DDR4 DIMM configurations, 8-bit symbol RS codes have traditionally been preferred. However, the sub-channel configuration of DDR5 DIMMs is well-suited for 4-bit symbol RS codes, offering advantages such as reduced computational complexity and smaller lookup table (LUT) sizes owing to the decreased Galois field size. We propose a DRAM ECC scheme based on (10,8) 4-bit symbol RS codes and present comparative results evaluating its error correction and detection capabilities against existing ECC methods."

The research compares three BERT based models, namely IndoBERT, IndoSBERT, and IndoBERTweet, by evaluating their performance through accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score metrics. To improve interpretability and transparency, Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is applied using the Local Interpretable Model Agnostic Explanations (LIME) method. LIME identifies influential words in text classification and provides insight into the model's decision-making process, which increases user trust. The system is implemented with a Flask based REST API that allows integration into Agency X operational systems for automatic content monitoring and information management. Experimental results show that the IndoBERT model achieves the highest performance with a micro accuracy of 97.04 percent and a micro F1 score of 96.91 percent, surpassing traditional machine learning models and previous BERT studies. LIME also visualizes key features that influence prediction results, making the model more interpretable for end users. The deployed API significantly improves classification efficiency compared to manual labeling. Overall, this research contributes to creating transparent, reliable, and efficient AI based solutions for automated news classification and national information security."

    "abstract": "This paper proposes two adaptive Chase decoding algorithms for turbo product codes (TPCs) in order to improve the trade-off between error-correcting performance and decoding complexity. The key idea is to reduce the number of test sequences (TSs) in the Chase algorithm by analyzing the soft information for each row or column codeword. The first proposed algorithm utilizes the entropy of the soft decoder input vector: if the entropy of a row or column vector is below a predefined threshold, it is assumed that the decoder input vector is sufficiently reliable, and the number of least reliable bit (LRB) positions used in the Chase algorithm is reduced. The second algorithm uses a confidence-ratio metric, defined as the proportion of decoder input values whose absolute magnitude is below a certain threshold. If the confidence ratio is sufficiently low, the number of LRB positions is similarly reduced. Both algorithms can be combined with the existing syndrome-based decoding algorithm, where error-free hard-decision vectors are detected and excluded from Chase decoding. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithms achieve comparable bit error rate (BER) performance to conventional Chase-based TPCs while fairly reducing decoding complexity. In particular, when combined with the syndrome-based decoding algorithm, the total number of decoding attempts is further reduced by approximately 10% beyond what is achieved by the syndrome-based decoder alone, without any performance degradation."

WMSM features a novel word-level recognition model combined with a sentence-level prediction mechanism, offering an efficient alternative to traditional sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) frameworks. Sign language recognition presents significant challenges, including limited dataset diversity, overfitting, and the difficulty of generalizing across different signers with varying signing styles. These issues are compounded by computational constraints, particularly when deploying models on mobile devices. To address these challenges, the paper details an augmentation pipeline that artificially expands the dataset, enhancing variability and enabling the model to generalize more effectively. Additionally, computational challenges such as packet loss and processing delays were mitigated through optimized model efficiency and the use of CPU-based workflows. The system demonstrates robust translation capabilities, producing coherent sentence-level outputs even under challenging conditions. This approach sets a new benchmark for efficient, high-performance real-time sign language recognition, addressing key challenges in dataset limitations, generalization, and mobile deployment."

While pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs) are computationally efficient, their deterministic nature introduces potential security vulnerabilities. Recent research has explored chaotic systems as entropy sources due to their sensitivity to initial conditions-a key property for randomness generation. An emerging direction involves leveraging chaos in quantum systems. This paper proposes a quantum-inspired PRNG based on the Quantum Kicked Rotor (QKR), a well-known model in quantum chaos exhibiting complex dynamics such as dynamical localization. The method simulates the QKR and extracts pseudo-random sequences through momentum basis measurements. The generated sequences are evaluated for statistical quality, including the NIST 800-22 standard, which passed all 15 test. The sequences exhibit strong non-periodicity, a critical property for secure cryptographic applications. The proposed approach combines the unpredictability of quantum chaos with the scalability of classical simulation, offering a practical and efficient alternative for secure random number generation."

    "abstract": "As urbanization intensifies and lifestyles evolve, the volume of municipal solid waste continues to increase annually, placing a heavy burden on the environment. Effective waste classification not only facilitates resource recycling and reduces pressure on landfills but also constitutes a critical element in achieving sustainable development and building smart cities. Traditional automatic waste-sorting methods primarily rely on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image feature extraction; however, CNNs are limited in modeling long-range dependencies (LRD) and are sensitive to data shifts and image degradation, often leading to decreased classification accuracy. To address these issues, this study proposes an automatic waste classification model that integrates the GroupMamba architecture with an auxiliary Fourier augmentation (AFA) technique. Leveraging a state-space model (SSM) and grouped channel attention, the proposed model effectively captures LRD features and cross-channel contextual information, thereby enhancing its representational capacity. In addition, AFA introduces stochastic perturbations in the frequency domain to emulate real-world noise and blur, improving the model's robustness to image variations and unseen samples. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves a classification accuracy of 96.88 % on the public TrashNet dataset, outperforming existing approaches and highlighting its potential for applications in smart environments and automated waste-management systems."

Traditionally, interviewers manually craft question-answer pairs, a process that is time-consuming, inconsistent, and prone to bias. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer an opportunity to automate and enhance this process by generating high-quality, structured question-answer pairs. This study presents a systematic approach to generating interview questions using LLMs, ensuring comprehensive coverage of software engineering domains and difficulty levels. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we compare the generated dataset with an existing manually curated dataset using BLEU scores, semantic similarity analysis, and t-SNE visualization. Our results indicate that the proposed dataset maintains domain relevance while significantly improving the semantic coherence and consistency of question-answer pairs across all categories and difficulty levels. We assess the impact of the dataset on classification tasks: training a category classification model on our dataset improves accuracy from 14.95% to 53.21%, while training a difficulty level classifier increases accuracy from 31.02% to 58.64%, demonstrating the enhanced structure and quality of the generated questions. By leveraging AI-driven methodologies, this study contributes to the evolution of structured, scalable, and unbiased software engineering assessments, ultimately enhancing the hiring process for both candidates and organizations."

The model integrates Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to capture spatial correlations across districts and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) to model temporal progression. Unlike traditional Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (T-GCN) architectures with static spatial graphs, SGCN-TGRU employs dynamic edge weighting based on mobility patterns and incorporates demographic and density features to enhance spatial sensitivity. Using real-world outbreak data from India (2019-2025) enriched with census and mobility information, the framework outperforms non-spatial baselines. Evaluation using MAE, RMSE, and hotspotdetection metrics shows significant gains in predictive accuracy. The results demonstrate that fusing mobility-driven spatial connectivity with temporal learning improves forecasting reliability and provides actionable insights for proactive epidemic control."

Crop diseases reduce not only the quality of the crops but also their amount of production, thus, detection and identification of the specific diseases is of great importance. Diseases like the Mosaic virus, Bacterial Spot, and Yellow Leaf Curl Virus infect the tomato plant. The advanced detection and classification techniques are mainly employed in the diagnosis of these diseases. This helps in informing the farmers about the types of diseases that attack their crops. In this study, independent CNN and SVM classifiers built to classify the diseases. The CNN model extracts feature such as color and leaf edges from input images- then, it proceeds to classification. For SVM, PCA is applied for feature reduction in order to enhance performance and accuracy before classification. A dataset sourced from plant village has been utilized to train the network CNN and SVM. The proposed neural network model has been applied to categorize 4 types of tomato leaf conditions: one healthy and three diseased types of tomato leaves. The results show that the SVM approach achieves a classification accuracy of 94.33%, whereas the CNN model has slightly higher accuracy of 95.17%."

We have developed a specialized dataset, which includes a large collection of multiple-choice questions and corresponding contexts, based on the new textbooks authorized by the Ministry of Education and Training. Currently, very few models can generate accurate and educationally meaningful questions, especially for Vietnamese-a less commonly used language with a complex structure. To address this challenge, we concentrate on methods tailored to the specific problem: the training dataset is meticulously designed to align with both the thematic scope and the depth of knowledge in the educational curriculum, while training focuses on appropriate layers within the language model. Our results show that the proposed model achieves over 70% performance in generating questions at the comprehension and basic application levels on the test set. This result not only highlights the significant potential of this approach in supporting education but also provides a valuable resource for future research. Moreover, the dataset we introduce will make a substantial contribution to the development of learning and assessment tools, helping both learners and teachers access tests that closely align with textbook content."

The system supports additional core DICOM operations, enriches captured data with external threat intelligence, and integrates a decoy PACS server to emulate production-like environments. Deployed in a controlled virtual environment, the honeypot combined simulated attacks with exposure to real-world traffic.

The paper puts forth the Bipolar Prediction Multimodal Network (BPMNet), which is an efficient Machine Learning (ML) framework that employs clinical, physiological, and behavioral data for the exact BD prediction. BPM-Net merges a Clinical Encoder for structured health records with a Time-Series Encoder for behavioral patterns, along with a Fusion Layer that brings together multimodal features for final classification. BPM-Net, after being trained on a wide-ranging dataset made up of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) and survey responses, attained 98.7% accuracy, and thus surpassed traditional models like Logistic Regression (LR), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). The results reveal that BPM-Net can be beneficial in the early BD diagnosis, offer support to personalized treatment, and make continuous monitoring easier. This study highlights the importance of multimodal ML in the psychiatric diagnostics and clinical decision-making area transformation."

    "abstract": "Power-line interference can cause electronic devices to malfunction or exhibit degraded performance, particularly in communication and precision measurement systems. In force estimation using surface electromyography (sEMG), such interference should be removed because its 50/60 Hz components and their harmonics overlap with the sEMG spectrum and deteriorate estimation accuracy. Conventional studies have typically employed notch filters or comb filters to eliminate this interference. However, notch filters suppress only the fundamental frequency and its neighboring components, while comb filters can remove harmonic components but provide insufficient harmonic attenuation and require careful adjustment of notch widths due to frequency drift. Moreover, the influence of notch width on force estimation has not been discussed in prior studies. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a force estimation method that removes power line interference with a wide notch width. In particular, a periodic/aperiodic separation filterwas applied to remove a PLI with the wide notch width. It enables flexible notch width adjustment based on the separation of quasi-periodic and quasi-aperiodic components, making it suitable for suppressing power line interference and its harmonics. In this study, thumb-tip force was estimated using interference removal, a preprocessing to an sEMG, and a deep neural network. The preprocessing consisted of band-pass filtering, full-wave rectification, and low-pass filtering. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed force estimation method suppresses power line interference and improves force estimation accuracy. The suitable notch width was 24.0 Hz in this experiment."

FUGC provides a dataset of 890 TVS images, including 500 training images, 90 validation images, and 300 test images. Methods were evaluated using the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), Hausdorff Distance (HD), and runtime (RT), with a weighted combination of 0.4/0.4/0.2. The challenge attracted 10 teams with 82 participants submitting innovative solutions. The best-performing methods for each individual metric achieved 90.26% mDSC, 38.88 mHD, and 32.85 ms RT, respectively. FUGC establishes a standardized benchmark for cervical segmentation, demonstrates the efficacy of semi-supervised methods with limited labeled data, and provides a foundation for AI-assisted clinical PTB risk assessment."

    "abstract": "Temporal Action Segmentation (TAS) is fundamental to video understanding, aiming to recognize and segment actions within untrimmed videos. While over-segmentation errors have received considerable attention, the equally critical issue of out of-context errors stemming from the neglect of implicit causal relationships between actions remains under-explored. However, constraining these unknown causal relationships at the frame level—including identifying causal links and strengths—presents a significant challenge, leading to notable research gaps. To tackle these challenges, we define a Temporal Action Causal Model (TACM) for the TAS task as declarative guidance, which efficiently injects the causal relationship between actions into frame variables in a generated manner. To this end, we propose the Causal Action Segmentation Refiner (CaASR), a refinement framework designed to mitigate out-of-context errors in segmentation results of backbone models. By reconstructing the causal generation process of post-segmentation frame variables, CaASR constrains causal relationships between actions and ensures the reliability of generated causal relationships. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CaASR significantly enhances both segmentation performance and interpretability across various backbone models, including state-of-the-art methods."

    "abstract": "Broadcast distribution of updates (e.g., security patches, machine learning models) from a server to end devices (EDs) is a critical requirement in the Internet of Things (IoT). In this article, we consider the problem of reliable over-the-air broadcast of updates in Long Range Wide Area Networks (LoRaWANs). Existing broadcast techniques for LoRaWANs suffer from long delivery delays due to low data rates and duty-cycle constraints. We address this problem by proposing a device-level cooperative mechanism, in which updated EDs broadcast a few update fragments to accelerate delivery to their neighbors. We demonstrate large reductions in the delivery time compared with conventional methods. For instance, in a 400-node network spanning 1 km radius and operating at 1% duty-cycle, the proposed scheme reduces the time required to deliver a 10 kB update to an ED at the network’s edge from 42 h to 45 min. The proposed solution thus provides a pathway toward improved security and efficient realization of edge intelligence in LoRaWAN IoT."

    "abstract": "Web 3.0-enabled edge computing provides a promising foundation for decentralized application (DApp) deployment. However, optimizing execution modes for interdependent task patterns remains challenging due to high computational overhead and blockchain consensus latency. This paper proposes an elastic hybrid architecture for Web 3.0-Enabled Edge Computing Systems (EDGEWEB3.0) that integrates on-chain and off-chain execution. DApp contracts are modeled as Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and partitioned into dependent task patterns, enabling a structured decomposition of execution. We formulate a DApp task scheduling problem and introduce the Decision Transformer-based Dependent Scheduling (DTDS) algorithm. DTDS employs masked self-attention to capture DAG dependencies and incorporates regularization terms to enforce constraints on service delays, gas costs, and computing capacity. We implement a real-world Web 3.0 testbed based on Ethereum, Goerli, and zkSync. Experimental results demonstrate that DTDS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in gas costs and service delays, providing a scalable solution for DApp execution in environments."

This paper proposes a framework for constructing HD indoor maps from a Human-Computer-Machine Interaction (HCMI) perspective, emphasizing machine-centric data integration, real-time processing, and multi-layer spatial representation. By leveraging a spatial data cube, the proposed approach enables sensor fusion and autonomous computation-optimized mapping, improving decision-making efficiency compared to human-centric maps. Reviewing domestic and international HD indoor mapping trends and policies shows that an HCMI-based approach provides scalable and real-time responsive mapping solutions for South Korean indoor autonomous navigation environments."

This paper investigates the impact of three distinct search strategies, random walk, systematic flower pattern search, and spiral outward search, on the effectiveness of a hierarchically decentralized heterogeneous MRTA system developed in our previous works. Using pyrobosim, a 2D simulation environment, modeled after NASA’s Space Robotics Challenge Phase 2, we evaluated how each search strategy affects key performance metrics including time to resource discovery, auction open times, task completion time, and total travel distance. Our findings show that the choice of search strategy substantially influences the coordination dynamics and mission efficiency.

This work develops an AI-driven crop yield prediction model incorporating regional parameters such as seasonal rainfall, evapotranspiration, and soil texture. To enhance predictive accuracy, missing values were imputed using the ARIMA model, and categorical features were encoded using Label Encoding. Various machine learning models were tested, including XGBoost, Random Forest, Extra Trees, and a stacked ensemble of XGBoost and Extra Trees. Out of all the models tested, the Extra Trees algorithm came out on top in terms of prediction accuracy. When checking which features mattered most, it be- came clear that Extra Trees leaned heavily towards the crop type, while the stacked model seemed to spread the importance across more variables. This kind of difference suggests that ensemble models might offer a more rounded view of the factors involved, even if sometimes a single model performs better on its own. These findings show how the choice of model and how much weight each feature carries can really affect the prediction results. With better preprocessing and smarter model selection, this work helps improve how we estimate crop yields — a small but meaningful step toward better agricultural planning and food security."

However, the system's vulnerability to sophisticated attacks, including brute force attacks and configuration anomalies, is a matter of concern. The timely identification of these sources of danger is hindered by the abundance of log data and existing class imbalances. In this study, the performance of three sequential deep learning models—Long Short-Term Memory, Gated Recurrent Unit, and 1-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network—for detecting anomalies in SSH logs is evaluated and compared. A synthetic log dataset was created to encompass both normal behavior and various types of attacks. This was preprocessed using temporal feature engineering and examined for class imbalances using class weighting. The evaluation process, which utilizes a dedicated test set, has revealed that all models exhibit a high degree of precision in detecting brute force attacks. The GRU model had the highest F1 score and accuracy. The 1D CNN had the best recall rate for regular traffic but the lowest precision. This study thoroughly compared three deep learning models: LSTM, GRU, and 1D CNN. This benchmarking used a new synthetic SSH log dataset to simulate real-world challenges, like extreme class imbalance and rare configuration anomalies. The analysis shows each model's strengths and weaknesses in this context. This study highlights the challenge of detecting brute-force attacks while minimizing false positives. Current anomaly detection methods are limited when it comes to extremely rare patterns."

This flexibility introduces capabilities that are inherently unavailable in conventional fixed-position antenna (FPA) systems. In FPA setups, adverse channel conditions such as deep fading are often unavoidable, leading to sporadic performance degradation. Although multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technology alleviates these effects to some extent using multiple antennas distributed over the space, it still falls short of fully exploiting the spatial diversity available in a continuous domain. In contrast, MA systems can actively avoid unfavorable channel conditions by repositioning antennas to locations with improved channel conditions. From a channel estimation standpoint, the ability to observe diverse channels across different positions enhances the reliability of the estimation process. Consequently, MA systems exhibit stronger channel hardening effects compared to their FPA counterparts. Numerical results confirm that MA architectures significantly improve channel hardening performance."

    "abstract": "Early detection is essential for successful treatment and management of diseases, especially for lifethreatening and chronic diseases like cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and neurodegenerative diseases. Artificial intelligence (AI), and high-resolution medical imaging are changing the way we approach healthcare diagnostics. This study introduces a new intelligent testing framework where multimodal medical imaging data and deep learning algorithms are integrated to support a reliable and early prediction of disease. The proposed framework utilizes CNNs, RNNs and attention mechanisms to learn and analyze multiple medical images including MRI, CT, PET and ultrasound images. In this integrated setting, advanced data pre-processing, segmentation, feature extraction and classification techniques are exploited to (i) identify anomalies, (ii) predict disease progression, and (iii) provide decision support to clinicians. An essential characteristic of the framework is its capability to integrate disparate imaging information and temporal medical records for a more global and individualized diagnosis. The AI models are developed by transfer learning and fine-tuning techniques to increase performance in the prediction accuracy over diverse patients. Furthermore, the system integrates explainable AI (XAI) principles to increase interpretability as well as the trust of clinicians by showing visual and textual explanations corresponding to each diagnosis decision. Intuitive design to visualize the detected biomarkers, anatomical abnormalities and MI conforming AI generated insights in real-time, enhancing the synergism between the reviewers and the machine intelligence. The SDN system also connects with EHRs to learn from past cases and become increasingly more accurate over time. Performance analysis of the framework with benchmark datasets of lung cancer, brain Tumors, and diabetic retinopathy demonstrates the superior performance in terms of sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic speed compared to the traditional diagnostic methods. The method was flexible to new imaging formats, and robust to noise, variations in intensity and artefacts. These findings illustrate the transformative potential of the integration of imaging and clinical data using deep learning for early disease prediction, to help reduce diagnostic latencies, and tailor treatment strategies. In the end, it is a giant step towards AIdriven preventive and precision healthcare systems."

By spectrally slicing the amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) source using a chirp function, the in-band chirp within the pass-band of the microwave photonic (MWP) filter—induced by the fiber’s third-order dispersion (TOD)—is effectively eliminated. When a 25 km fiber is incorporated, this technique achieves a more than 7-fold reduction in filter bandwidth, along with an amplitude enhancement of 9.3 dB. As a result, once the feedback loop is closed, the sidemode suppression ratio (SMSR) improves by 10.7 dB, the phase noise is reduced by 13 dB at a 4 kHz offset at 7.2 GHz, and the output power is increased by 11.7 dB."

Smart Learning Environments (SLEs) address these challenges by leveraging context-aware technologies that sense and adapt to learners’ needs. While prior frameworks address content adaptation and pedagogical feedback, they often lack a systematic account of how real-time multimodal learner data shape the timing and form of interventions. This paper introduces a conceptual classification framework developed inductively during a systematic literature review of 50 SLE systems. The framework organizes interventions based on the types of data collected—physiological, behavioral, performance-related, and environmental—and characterizes them along five dimensions: modality, intrusiveness, task adaptation, task support, and task regulation. By providing a systematic approach to linking sensed contexts with intervention strategies, the framework enables the analysis, comparison, and design of context-aware interventions in self-directed learning settings."

Buffers are incorporated at major points of the design to guarantee signal integrity and signal voltage. The unique full adder circuit, consisting of Gate Diffusion Input (GDI) XOR gates and Pass Transistor Logic (PTL) XOR and MUX cells has low dynamic and quiescent power consumption and an improved performance. The proposed multiplier compares favorably to current designs with smaller power dissipations, critical path delay and a smaller number of transistors thus it is very efficient in terms of low power and high-speed computer applications. This work establishes a robust framework for designing compact and energy-efficient multipliers, providing valuable insights for advanced digital signal processing and portable device implementations."

    "abstract": "Obtaining accurate CSI in frequency division duplexing (FDD) systems is a challenging problem due to the extensive feedback overhead. Applying a precoder to the CSI reference signal (CSI-RS) reduces feedback overhead and improves the reception of the CSI-RS. However, fully digital precoding dedicates RF chains for each antenna, which makes massive MIMO with a large antenna array expensive. Hybrid precoding has attracted increasing interest as a practical solution that reduces the number of RF chains. Operating in analog and digital domains introduces additional constraints on the design of the precoder. In this paper, we propose a codebook design for wideband FDD massive MIMO hybrid precoding systems. We formulate the precoding design problem as a sparsity-constrained matrix reconstruction problem. Using orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP), we develop a wideband precoding algorithm that approximates unconstrained partial channel reciprocity precoding using a smaller number of RF chains than the total number of antennas. We present simulation results that exhibit the hybrid precoding shows a slight performance gap compared to unconstrained precoding."

Full-image candidate masks are generated and refined through geometric constraints, including bounding box containment, relative size thresholds, and spatial alignment. We evaluate candidate masks using Intersection over Union (IoU) metrics and apply domain-aware filtering heuristics to select the most accurate masks.

NVIDIA FLARE, an open-source SDK for federated learning, addresses these challenges by introducing advanced communication capabilities. Building upon existing solutions for large object streaming, we enhance FL workflows for LLMs through two key techniques: message quantization and container/file streaming. Quantization reduces message size, while streaming enables efficient memory management, improving scalability and integration with existing workflows. These advancements significantly enhance the robustness and efficiency of FL with LLMs, ensuring better performance in real-world federated learning scenarios."

By measuring the distances between multiple Wi-Fi APs and STAs, the indoor position of the STA can be estimated. In this paper, we collected FTM and RSSI measurements in an indoor environment using FTM-enabled Wi-Fi APs and STAs, and evaluated indoor positioning accuracy through geometric calculations based on FTM data as well as a machine learning approach using both FTM and RSSI data as inputs. Furthermore, for the machine learning approach, we also assessed the impact of varying the number of Wi-Fi AP data elements supplied to the model in increments of AP count. The results demonstrated that positioning accuracy achieved by the machine learning approach surpassed that of geometric calculations. Moreover, even when the number of input data elements to the machine learning model was limited, utilizing FTM data obtained from at least one AP mitigated the degradation in positioning accuracy within the machine learning framework."

    "abstract": "The increasing volume of applications per job posting has made manual resume screening inefficient, error-prone, and susceptible to unconscious bias. This paper presents a scalable, bias-aware resume screening framework powered by the ChatGPT-4o Large Language Model. The proposed system automatically extracts and weights key skills and qualifications from job descriptions, analyzes candidate resumes in conjunction with publicly available online profiles (e.g., GitHub, LinkedIn), and ranks applicants based on semantic alignment with job requirements. To ensure fairness, the system anonymizes bias-sensitive attributes such as gender, age, race, and disability prior to analysis. A prompt-engineered pipeline guides the model through structured evaluation steps, providing interpretable ranking rationales. The approach improves the consistency, transparency, and equity of candidate selection, while reducing the overall time to screen resumes and offering a practical solution for modern recruitment challenges."

Manual classification methods have several limitations, particularly in terms of consistency and accuracy when applied over extended periods. Therefore, deep learning-based approaches provide a more suitable alternative for addressing this task. One of the most widely used algorithms for image classification is the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which can extract various visual features from images, including patterns, colors, and object structures. In this study, two CNN architectures, VGG16 and InceptionV3, were employed to classify flower species. Furthermore, a performance comparison was conducted using several popular optimization methods: Adam, AdamW, NAdam, RMSProp, and SGD. The experimental results demonstrate that the highest accuracy was achieved by the VGG16 model with the AdamW optimizer, reaching an accuracy of 94.29 % and F 1 -Score of 92.53 %. For the InceptionV3 model, the best performance was obtained with the SGD optimizer, achieving an accuracy of 95.24 % and an F1-Score of 93.50 %. These findings indicate that the models, combined with the applied optimization approaches, can effectively capture the distinctive visual characteristics of each flower species, making them highly effective for image-based classification systems in the botanical domain."

Intra-cluster solutions are optimized with QAOA, and are classically stitched to construct the global tour. Our results clearly validate the effectiveness of the hierarchical design of the algorithm, highlighting its feasibility for mid-scale quantum optimizations."

A user study with 24 participants of varying visual abilities evaluated its usability and effectiveness through structured questionnaires and statistical analysis. Results show that the multimodal feedback significantly improved users’ ability to interpret image content and navigate visual information non-visually. While promising, limitations such as reliance on the native gallery suggest the need for an integrated accessible gallery, real-time scene understanding, and richer image descriptions in future work.

    "abstract": "Efficient management and classification of educational administrative documents is crucial for modern higher education institutions, yet manual archiving remains time-consuming and error-prone. This paper proposes a novel BERT-TextCNN fusion model that integrates global semantic understanding with local n-gram feature extraction for intelligent document classification. The model employs a dual-branch architecture where the BERT branch captures contextual semantics through pre-trained transformers, while the TextCNN branch extracts discriminative local patterns through multi-scale convolutional networks. Two key innovations are introduced: (1) a multi-granularity semantic fusion layer utilizing attention mechanisms to adaptively combine features from both branches, and (2) a dynamic weight adjustment mechanism that automatically balances branch contributions based on document characteristics. Extensive experiments on a real-world dataset of 80,000 Chinese educational documents across 12 categories demonstrate that our model achieves 94.7% classification accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines including BERT-base (88.5%) and BERT + BiLSTM (90.1%) by 6.2% and 4.6% respectively, while maintaining 26% faster inference speed (38.6 ms/doc). Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of each component, with the attention-based fusion contributing 3.4% and dynamic weighting contributing 1.9% performance gain. The model exhibits exceptional robustness across varying document lengths (93.8%-95.1% accuracy) through adaptive weight adjustment. A 3-month pilot deployment at a major Chinese university processed 12,547 documents with 94.2% accuracy, reducing manual archiving time by 86-89% and achieving 92% user satisfaction. These results demonstrate the practical value of our approach for intelligent educational document management systems."

Our system integrates Google Gemma3 4b for query optimization, with Google Gemini 2.5 Flash Preview serving as the primary judgment model. The retrieval mechanism combines two complementary knowledge sources: embeddings from the comprehensive Mafindo h oax <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$n$</tex> ews d ataset processed through IndoBERT and stored in a Milvus vector database, and real-time web content retrieved via the Tavily Web API from verified Dewan Pers Indonesia member websites. The system was rigorously evaluated against standalone large language models using a test dataset of 500 LLM-augmented news queries, demon-strating substantial improvements in hoax detection accuracy. Our RAG implementation achieved 79.5% accuracy, 84.9% precision, 72.8% recall, and an F1-score of 78.4%, significantly outperforming comparable plain LLM baselines. This finding proves that RAG systems and LLMs are capable of effective hoax detection, especially in low-resource languages like Indonesian, by determining the truthfulness of a text based on factual evidence and linguistic aspects. This finding also suggests the potential for more advanced RAG systems to further enhance hoax detection in the Indonesian language."

Each matrix contains rows and columns of numbers for needs or responses at epicentre-, micro-, meso-, exo-, and macro-levels, representing the typicalness of the needs and significance of responses. This method is expected to be used to further analyze relationships among content in a matrix, with the expanded multilevel coding method potentially informing smart algorithm development for unstructured qualitative data mining and processing, while its shortcoming is that the method's validity highly depends on researchers' capacity for data collection and inference from the numbers in one matrix to those in another.

    "abstract": "Cycling is a widely-practiced, eco-friendly mode of transportation essential for sustainable urban mobility. Determining routes that optimize for environmental factors, such as better air quality (AQ) and high vegetation (NDVI) as opposed to just faster routes is an important first step in incentivizing bike riding as a form of transportation. However, existing navigation systems often fall short and fail to facilitate this multi-objective, environment aware routing. To address this, we introduce a scalable eco-routing framework Geohash-Based Multi-Objective Bike Routing (GB-MOBR), that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to interpret natural language prompts for route preferences. The challenge lies in the prohibitive computational cost of multi-objective algorithms with large scale graph-based networks. Therefore, we first construct a fine-grained, multi-criteria graph by associating environmental data (AQ, NDVI, Congestion, Green Roofs, Meteorological) with a street network using KD-Trees for efficient spatial matching. Then, to enable scalable optimization, we apply a Geohash-based graph aggregation technique to create a smaller, topologically equivalent graph. We compare the performance and solution quality of these algorithms: Genetic Algorithm (GA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Dijkstra and Yen's K-Shortest Paths on both graphs and examine their performance. Results demonstrate that our aggregation method reduces computation time by up to 90% and therefore making the algorithms more viable for real-time use."

    "abstract": "The possibilities of flexible nanoelectronics in lightweight, elastic, and high-performance electronics have made interest in the manufacturing of elastic wearable gadgets of next-generation technologies. Nevertheless, quantum dot (QD) films on flexible substrates have not been studied in detail regarding the charge transport. Interdot disorder variability, energy-strain loss, and dissimilar morphology of substrates are variabilities that lead to poor charge transport and are unsightly bottlenecks to the possible betterment of devices and to the quantum dots and films device manufacture. To overcome the abovementioned metrology and fabrication issues, our proposal of a new Quantum-Dot Mobility Estimation through Topological Adaptive Network (QD-METAN) is provided. Using adaptive physics-informed mobility rules in the graph modeling of QD networks offers a new viewpoint. QD-METAN, unlike the other topological-network-driven noisy QD mobility estimates, is a dynamic topological network, binds up single QD energy states, and the edges are threads of strain and charge propagation. QD-METAN gets around the constraints of passive models of network constriction and rigidity by modulating frictional limits via mechanosynthesis. The comparison with experimental data demonstrates that QDMETAN is capable of predicting electron and hole mobilities with over 94 percent accuracy and outperforms not only the conventional machine-learning but also the continuum simulation methods. Besides this, the technique also provides information on the optimal patterns of deposition of QD masses, substrate selection, as well as processing conditions to eliminate trial and error in experiments. Experimental data collected on flexible QD thin-film transistors confirm that the trends in mobility of the device on bending and stretching are identical to those of QD-METAN, which proves the practical usefulness of the model. This establishes new paths in predictive design in flexible nanoelectronics since it incorporates topological network analysis and adaptive physics and gives more credibility, scale, or capability to the wearables."

For both, LLMs have to demonstrate factual knowledge as well as a deep understanding of drug mechanisms, so they can recall and reason about relevant knowledge in novel situations. Drug mechanisms of action are described as a series of interactions between biomedical entities, which interlink into one or more chains directed from the drug to the targeted disease. Composing the effects of the interactions in a candidate chain leads to an inference about whether the drug might be useful or not for that disease. We introduce a dataset that evaluates LLMs on both factual knowledge of known mechanisms, and their ability to reason about them under novel situations, presented as counterfactuals that the models are unlikely to have seen during training. Using this dataset, we show that o4-mini outperforms the 4o, o3, and o3-mini models from OpenAI. We demonstrate that the open world setting for reasoning tasks, which requires the model to recall relevant knowledge, is more challenging than the closed world setting where the needed factual knowledge is provided. We also show that counterfactuals affecting internal links in the reasoning chain present a much harder task than those affecting a link from the drug mentioned in the prompt."

Still, the variability in learning behaviors and data inconsistency makes the major challenges to accurate classification and performance profiling. To address the issue, the proposed model based on ensemble framework is designed for performance analysis of IT professionals into three categories like High, Medium, and Low by considering the interaction data within e-learning systems. The proposed model comprises four integral stages like data gathering from user activity logs, pre-processing to remove duplicates, feature selection using Information Gain to retain the most significant attributes and the proposed ensemble classifier. The ensemble integrates Xception, ShuffleNet, SRU, and Hybrid ShuffleSRU for spatiotemporal learning. Majority voting is used to take the decision making on the outputs that ensures the reliable classification. The proposed approach demonstrates enhanced classification performance across multiple evaluation metrics such as accuracy, F1-score, Cohen's Kappa, and MCC."

    "abstract": "In modern cellular networks, the handover (HO) of selecting the optimal base station according to the user equipment (UE) mobility is indispensable. However, conventional HO mechanisms primarily rely on reactive methods, which face inherent limitations in dealing with network uncertainties and real-time adaptability. To overcome these challenges, recent studies have introduced proactive HO schemes that leverage deep learning-based time-series forecasting models. Nevertheless, these approaches still suffer from degraded prediction performance under diverse UE speed environments due to global distribution shift, and naively constructing separate models for each mobility speed is highly inefficient. In this study, we address this inefficiency by proposing a speed-agnostic unified model. Specifically, we incorporate the existing Reversible Instance Normalization (RevIN) technique and introduce our newly proposed method, Residual Normalization (RN). We apply these normalization schemes to deep learning-based time-series forecasting models (DLinear, NLinear, and TCN), and through training and evaluation on datasets collected at varying mobility speeds, we demonstrate improved generalization capability of the forecasting models."

    "abstract": "The Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) provide large-scale discussion forums where students express opinions and seek support. However, the rapidly increasing volume of forum posts imposes severe information overload on instructors, making it difficult to promptly identify truly urgent posts that require immediate intervention. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a Course-Aware Gated Representation and Multi-Task Learning framework for distinguishing urgent posts in MOOC forums. The proposed model integrates a course-aware gating mechanism that adaptively modulates BERT-based text representations using course embeddings, enabling course-conditioned feature modulation. In addition, a multi-task learning framework jointly optimizes urgency classification with sentiment polarity classification and question detection, providing complementary semantic supervision. Experimental results on the Stanford MOOC forum dataset show that the proposed model achieves a weighted F1score of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$93.4\\%$</tex> on Group A and urgent-posts precision of 81.5% and 83.2% on Groups B and C, respectively, outperforming state-of-the-art methods (AT-CX-LGF in Group A, BERT-CNN in Group B, and CWHNN in Group C) by <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$0.2 \\%, 0.5 \\%$</tex>, and 2.5%.

Our system uses detection, tracking modules to locate a person in the video and Re-ID to identify people in a variety of scenarios. Person description module utilizes vision language model(VLM) to describe target person.

To address this, this paper proposes a Dynamic Channel Decoupling Module, which first decouples channels and then calculates the difference sensitivity scores for corresponding channels, thereby capturing key channels closely associated with image differences. Furthermore, to generate feature representations from the most relevant differential features, we design a Cross-modal Contrastive Module for the explicit establishment of channel-level semantic associations. This module enhances caption quality by maximizing the similarity between each channel and its corresponding linguistic tokens. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art approaches on two public datasets."

This paper introduces the Trust Degradation Mode Effect Analysis (TDMEA), a novel methodology adapted from Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA), designed to proactively identify, analyze, and prioritize potential trust failures in edge AI. We highlight that inherent edge limitations (e.g., computational power, memory, energy) exacerbate complex trade-offs among critical trust dimensions such as accuracy, privacy, and explainability. TDMEA provides a structured approach to dissecting these challenges, emphasizing the critical role of detectability in prioritizing risks given edge monitoring limitations. The framework underscores that trust degradation is an evolving problem, driven by dynamic environments and necessary edge optimizations. TDMEA time dependency can provide real time index which can be explored further as an AI measure index. We conclude that building resilient trust in edge AI requires a holistic design philosophy, integrating resource-efficient robustness, lightweight adaptive learning, privacy-preserving solutions, and on-device self-healing, all guided by continuous governance and monitoring."

Traditional methods often rely on constant human vigilance, which is resource-intensive and prone to error. With advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT), virtual monitoring offers a robust solution for real-time threat detection and proactive intervention. This project proposes the development of an integrated AI/IoT-powered system designed for the autonomous detection of specific animal threats or intruders within designated areas, coupled with an automated warning or elimination mechanism. The system will employ an array of interconnected sensors, including advanced computer vision (e.g., YOLOv8-based object detection) and potentially radar, to continuously monitor the environment for unauthorized animal presence or predatory threats. Upon detection and identification of a designated threat, the system's core processing unit, like a Raspberry Pi, will precisely calculate the target's coordinates. This data will be transmitted to an Arduino-controlled, multi-axis turret system. This turret, equipped with a calibrated laser or other specified non-lethal deterrent/elimination mechanism, will then accurately track and engage the identified threat, providing an immediate and localized response. Furthermore, anomaly detection algorithms will enhance reliability by cross-referencing sensor inputs, while a GSM module will provide real-time alerts to stakeholders upon engagement or significant events. The integration of YOLOv8 with sensor fusion has achieved high detection F1-score of over <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{9 0 \\%}$</tex>.

This paper presents a knowledge management system of curated Greek governmental data, accessible via a conversational agent, designed to assist internal civil servants in navigating public services, legal frameworks, and administrative procedures. The conversational agent is implemented using a hybrid approach combining a Retrieval-And-augmented-generation (RAG) approach and a fine-tuned LLM, which combines an external document retrieval system, enabling real-time access to up-to-date governmental sources while mitigating the risks of outdated or hallucinated responses. This knowledge management system captures Greek governmental processes from two sources: (a) data available in the Greek MITOS central database, and (b) the Government Gazette, which is the official publication of the Hellenic Republic. The documents from the second source are used on the RAG approach to enhance its knowledge and reliability, while the data from the first source were used for the preparation of a synthetic dataset for the answer generation part of the agent to fine-tune a pre-trained language model, ensuring a deep understanding of policy documents, official guidelines, and public administration protocols. This paper explores both implementations’ architectural differences, performance benchmarks, and practical implications. We analyze their strengths and limitations regarding accuracy, scalability, and adaptability to evolving governmental policies.

Conventional MAC units fail to exploit this sparsity, resulting in unnecessary switching activity, increased dynamic power consumption, and area inefficiency. This paper introduces a Sparsity-Gated MAC (SG-MAC) pipeline optimized for low-power eDRAM-based inference systems. The proposed architecture supports multiple operations-including dot product, MAC, and fused activation functions, while integrating lightweight SKIP logic at three pipeline stages: multiplier gating, register write gating, and accumulation bypass. This multi-level gating dynamically eliminates redundant floating-point computations, significantly reducing logic utilization (up to 61% reduction LUTs) and power consumption compared to standard FP16 MAC designs. Experimental results on FPGA demonstrate that SG-MAC achieves substantial hardware efficiency and energy savings, all while providing extended functionality for modern neural workloads. The design offers a scalable and hardware-friendly solution for energy-constrained AI inference platforms, maintaining compatibility with diverse neural network operations."

The paper provides empirical research on the M-machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models as performance optimization methods of mobile applications with respect to crash prediction, energy management, and real time responsiveness. Some classic ML algorithms, such as the Random Forest and Support Vector Machine, obtained the moderate level of accuracy yet failed to work well with sequential use data. Convolutional Neural Networks and Long Short-Term Memory enhanced more accuracy, but both did not work well when utilized independently. Therefore, a hybrid CNN-LSTM model was designed, a model that used spatial features extraction by the CNN and temporal sequence learning by the LSTM. It was shown through experimental results the framework outperformed all baselines having attained the highest accuracy (94.8%), the lowest RMSE (0.11) and the lowest execution latency, hence offering a more reliable and responsive user experience. The conclusions indicate the possibility of hybrid DL models as modern optimization techniques of mobile applications. Future research to be conducted is massive validation, real-time implementation, integration with edge computing, and user-centred personalization without compromising data privacy."

However, the common random string (CRS) model introduced in existing schemes to optimize efficiency poses significant security risks, constituting a potential threat in open networks. To address this, a NGS-based HE without CRS is innovatively proposed in this paper. By constructing a three-layer security conversion mechanism for ciphertexts and relying on the reduction of underlying lattice hard problems, the scheme eliminates CRS dependency while ensuring security. Analysis indicates that this scheme significantly reduces the size of ciphertexts and evaluation keys. The expanded ciphertext generation requires no additional auxiliary information as well as avoids introducing new noise, thereby avoiding cumulative noise effects. Moreover, the extended ciphertext generation only requires processing an $n(n \\times 1)$-dimensional vector, substantially reducing the system’s memory overhead."

Simulation results show that the proposed circuit can maintain a stable voltage of 5.7 V DC when supplying a <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$20 \\mu \\mathrm{A}$</tex> load, with 33% power conversion efficiency. This proof of concept demonstrates the potential of nanomechanical circuits for power management in low-power harsh environment IoT applications where Si transistors struggle to operate."

Although existing detection methods have achieved certain progress in textual semantics and social network structure, they generally suffer from coarse-grained user semantic representations, insufficient capability in discerning semantic consistency, and inadequate integration of content and structural information. To address these challenges, we propose a novel multimodal detection framework, HCGBot, which performs hierarchical semantic consistency modeling in conjunction with social network structure for Twitter bot detection. We evaluate HCGBot on two widely used benchmark datasets for Twitter bot detection, and the experimental results demonstrate that HCGBot outperforms existing methods across multiple metrics, validating the effectiveness of hierarchical semantic consistency modeling combined with graph-based detection."

In the concept, there is one master satellite and one or more transponder satellites. The master transmits a radar signal and the function of the multi-wavelength microwave photonic transponder is to relay multiple antenna array channels, which are fed by the radar echos, back to the master. This is achieved leveraging a phase-preserving modulation, wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) and freespace optics (FSO). The modulation format used allows the system to avoid synchronizing the clocks of the platforms with each other. Preliminary results for gain, noise performance, and dynamic range are calculated and the delay knowledge achievable for the system is discussed. Finally, there is a discussion on future research and some concluding remarks."

A structured questionnaire was administered to 22 FRs across eight countries, capturing their demographic profiles, general attitudes toward robots, and experiences with semantics-enhanced SA. Results show that most FRs expressed positive attitudes toward robots, and rated the usefulness of semantic information for building SA at an average of 3.6 out of 5. Semantic information was also valued for its role in predicting unforeseen emergencies (mean 3.9). Participants reported requiring an average of 74.6% accuracy to trust semantic outputs and 67.8% for them to be considered useful, revealing a willingness to use imperfect but informative AI support tools.To the best of our knowledge, this study offers novel insights by being one of the first to directly survey FRs on semantic-based SA in a cross-national context. It reveals the types of semantic information most valued in the field—such as object identity, spatial relationships, and risk context—and connects these preferences to the respondents’ roles, experience, and education levels. The findings also expose a critical gap between lab-based robotics capabilities and the realities of field deployment, highlighting the need for more meaningful collaboration between FRs and robotics researchers. These insights contribute to the development of more user-aligned and situationally aware robotic systems for emergency response."

The entire crucial data is logged into a shared computer via a serial data communication port found in a shared digital signal controller, even if all of the power converters can be controlled by local micro controllers. The entire system can be managed locally, and if needed, the cloud can be used to monitor vital information and send override commands to the relevant system from the cloud control dashboard. The creation of innovative control schemes for the individual power electronic converters is another area of research attention.

    "abstract": "Wireless Body Sensor Networks (WBSNs) are integral to modern healthcare applications, enabling continuous health monitoring and personalized care. However, these systems face critical challenges due to limited battery life, unpredictable energy availability, and dynamic body-centric communication environments. Energy inefficiency can lead to frequent maintenance, reduced reliability, and compromised patient monitoring. To address these challenges, this study proposes an Eco-Adaptive RF Harvesting Algorithm (EARHA) designed for energy-efficient cognitive WBSN platforms. EARHA intelligently integrates ambient radio frequency (RF) energy harvesting with adaptive power management, dynamically adjusting sensor transmission power and duty cycles based on energy availability and network conditions. The algorithm employs cognitive sensing to detect optimal RF sources while minimizing interference and ensuring reliable data transmission. Simulation results demonstrate that EARHA improves energy harvesting efficiency by up to 35% compared to conventional WBSN approaches, reduces energy consumption per transmission by 28%, and prolongs network lifetime by approximately 40%. Furthermore, the algorithm maintains a packet delivery ratio above 95% under varying RF environments, highlighting its robustness and adaptability. The findings indicate that integrating eco-adaptive RF harvesting with cognitive power management can significantly enhance the sustainability and operational efficiency of WBSNs, offering a practical solution for continuous health monitoring without frequent battery replacement. This study lays the foundation for future research on self-sustainable body sensor networks and provides a roadmap for designing energy-aware protocols for wearable healthcare devices."

    "abstract": "Joint sensing and communication channel estimation (JSCCE) is a critical problem in integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems, where two types of channels inherently share similar physical propagation mechanisms while exhibit distinct task-specific characteristics. Leveraging this property, this work proposes a multi-objective unified framework that combines the feature extraction capacity of deep learning with the principled exploitation of ISAC channel commonalities and differences. Specifically, we design a novel dual-task unified estimation Transformer network (DUET-Net) comprising a shared encoder backbone for capturing correlated sparse channel features, alongside dual-head decoders with task-specific branches for accommodating the individual statistical characteristics and structural properties of the two channels. To further address the limited angular resolution in communication channels, we incorporate an angle-aware attention (AAA) module that selectively emphasizes informative angular components. Moreover, an uncertainty-weighted multi-task loss is introduced to adaptively balance the training process of both tasks in accordance to their different learning dynamics, thereby improving convergence stability. Extensive numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed DUET-Net consistently outperforms existing methods over a wide range of transmit power levels and across various scenarios, with an efficient performance-complexity trade-off. The effectiveness of the designed modules is further confirmed by ablation studies."

    "abstract": "Serverless workflows have emerged in Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) platforms to represent the operational structure of traditional applications. With latency propagation effects becoming increasingly prominent, step-wise resource tuning is required to address Service-Level-Objectives (SLOs). Modern processors’ allowance for fine-grained Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS), coupled with serverless workflows’ intermittent nature, presents a unique opportunity to reduce power while meeting SLOs. We introduce Ωkypous, an SLOdriven DVFS framework for serverless workflows. Ωkypous employs a grey-box model that predicts functions’ execution latency and power under different Core and Uncore frequency combinations. Based on these predictions and the timing slacks between workflow functions, Ωkypous uses a closed-loop control mechanism to dynamically adjust Core and Uncore frequencies, reducing power consumption without compromising predefined end-to-end latency constraints. Our evaluation on real-world traces from Azure demonstrates an average power consumption reduction of 16% compared to state-of-the-art power management frameworks, while consistently maintaining low SLO violation rates (1.8%), even when operating under power caps."

The critical point is that the flag and the return region are half-planes. Our goal is to address the problem of determining the game winner and computing the pursuit winning strategies. By decomposing the complex multiplayer game into many manageable subgames involving multiple pursuers and one evader, we present the strategies under which the pursuers guarantee to win against the evader, regardless of the evader’s strategy, with the necessary and sufficient conditions to determine the game winner. We then extend the results to the cases of the flag-staying time and the minimum safe flag position. To reduce the computational burdens, we prove that if multiple pursuers can ensure the pursuit winning against an evader, then at most two pursuers in this coalition are required. Finally, we solve the multiplayer game by evaluating pairwise subgame outcomes for pursuer–evader matchings. Numerical and experimental results are presented to illustrate the theoretical conclusions."

Traditional CFAR methods struggle at detection boundaries: they either miss targets with high thresholds or cause too many false alarms with low thresholds. To solve this, we propose a new CFAR method that uses historical radar data to predict the current frame. It combines an AR(Autoregressive) model for prediction and information entropy for weighting. The processed sea clutter data shows over 70% variance reduction, enabling effective false alarm control even with lower CFAR detection thresholds. Experimental results using actual large grazing angle data demonstrate that the proposed method achieves 1.2° grazing angle advancement, 5.8% detection probability improvement and 3.3dB threshold reduction for time-domain CFAR under the same False Alarm (PFA), while for frequency-domain CFAR it achieves 0.5° grazing angle advancement, 2.6% detection probability improvement and 4dB threshold reduction."

A two-degree-of-freedom (2DOF) controller employs a robust, model-based linear approach to ensure real-time control for the compound split, utilizing a method to obtain optimal performance while adhering to system constraints. Additionally, an augmented linear quadratic regulator (LQR) is designed to accurately track reference speeds and to attenuate coupled powertrain/rotor vibrations. The design method allows the designer to specify a constraint matrix to effectively integrate various inputs and control strategies, including load management and energy optimization. Simulation results illustrate the efficiency of the proposed control strategy in various flight maneuvers.

We propose two different approaches that exploit the maneuverability of the measurement platform to recover three dimensional angle of arrival information from limited input data. The first approach employs a non-convex optimization framework that directly utilizes time-varying azimuth measurements and platform orientation. The second approach reformulates the estimation problem as an image segmentation task, where azimuth measurements are transformed into 2D representations in which target angles correspond to curve intersections. Convolutional and transformer based deep segmentation models are then used to infer the target's spatial angles. Experimental results demonstrate that deep segmentation significantly outperforms the optimization based method in terms of estimation accuracy and robustness under varying noise and maneuver conditions."

    "abstract": "In case of an emergency power supply or short-term overload, a rapid load change can generate temperature fluctuations across the insulation of the power equipment. Failures are possible in conditions where temperature fluctuations are affecting HVDC equipment. In this study, the space charge characteristics and dynamics in LDPE under DC voltage that is subjected to temperature fluctuation are tested and analyzed. The results show that space charge packets form inside LDPE under high electric fields when a temperature fluctuation is applied. The speed of the charge packet decreases with time and the higher the temperature fluctuation, the more pronounced the resulting charge packet is, and the faster it can move through the insulation. The experimental results verify that the temperature fluctuation under constant DC voltage can form and drive the movement of space charge packets. The Bipolar Charge Transport Model was used to simulate space charge packets due to temperature fluctuation with consideration of the transient temperature distribution. Simulation results indicate that the temperature fluctuation forms a new temperature gradient and forces the space charge re-distribute: the charge mobility decreases with the decreased temperature across the sample; the re-distributed space charge distorts the electric field, generating a step-like electric field distribution. The mobility and the step-like electric field generate peaks of the charge velocity, which is the direct cause for the formation and migration of space charge packets. The temperature fluctuation can force the existing charge to redistribute and can drives space charge packet movement."

    "abstract": "The multi-arm series capacitor buck converter (SCBC) improves output current and reduces ripple through interleaving control, making it ideal for power conversion applications. However, conventional control methods cause current imbalance between arms when the duty cycle exceeds 50 %. This paper proposes a simple interleaved control strategy that fixes one arm's duty cycle while adjusting the others to maintain balance. A three-arm SCBC with an interleaved controller is designed and implemented, achieving balanced inductor currents without additional current sampling. SIMPLIS-based simulations verify the effectiveness of the proposed strategy, demonstrating current balance and robust performance under dynamic conditions."

    "abstract": "Crude oil futures price prediction is an essential tool for risk management, energy planning, and financial market analysis. The volatile, non-linear nature of crude oil prices poses significant challenges for traditional models, which often fail to capture the complex temporal dependencies and noise inherent in commodity markets. This research proposes a robust ensemble framework to improve the precision and stability of crude oil price prediction. This approach integrates three distinct architectures-CNN, LSTM, and GRU-using a blending strategy with a linear regression-based meta-learner. To improve signal quality and model efficiency, the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) is employed for denoising, and Pearson correlation coefficient is used to select the most informative technical indicators. Model performance is evaluated using RMSE, MAE, <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$R^{2}$</tex> score, Max Error, and Directional Accuracy Ratio (DAR). Experimental results show the ensemble consistently outperforms individual models across all metrics. Statistical validation using the DieboldMariano test confirms the ensemble's superiority. The framework improves predictive accuracy while enhancing robustness and generalization, offering a scalable solution for real-world financial forecasting."

Nevertheless, there is no comprehensive strategy that combines the necessary data optimization with green finance (GF) measures. This investigation offers a comprehensive technique that combines data optimization with GF measures. Using a sample of thirty companies registered on the Saudi Share Trade (SST), the investigation employs factor analysis approaches. This study develops a GF model that maintains sustainability in a sample of enterprises selected using a potent ensemble approach called XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting). An approach known as the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) is used to resolve the database’s group unbalance. This study employs various ML methods in Python for GF. The experimental results indicate that the XGBoost method functioned better than the other ML methods. Next, this study optimizes the XGBoost technique to achieve the optimal outcome, resulting in an overall GF accuracy of 96.1%. Shareholders and governments will both benefit from the research’s conclusions. These prediction algorithms can be used by regulators to create well-balanced policy programs that promote GFs and ensure financial development. Simultaneously, the analytically profitable system features identified in this investigation will enable traders and users to easily adjust to rapid shifts in the marketplace and generate income."

    "abstract": "In recent years, burnout has emerged as a critical issue in higher education, particularly in engineering programs where cognitive overload and emotional neglect are often normalized. Despite growing awareness, few empirical studies focus on how psychological factors such as emotional regulation and self-esteem influence academic burnout in technical students. This paper presents a pilot study investigating the relationship between emotional regulation, self-esteem, and academic burnout among students in engineering education, within the framework of the so-called “engineering stress culture.” Conducted at the National University of Science and Technology Politehnica Bucharest, the study involved 49 students from technical programs and a survey as research instrument designed for the study. By multiple linear regression and Pearson/Spearman correlation analyses using R, both global and dimensional relationships across psychological variables were examined. Key findings show statistically significant correlations between burnout and emotional clarity ($r s=-0.47, p=0.004$), awareness ($r s=-0.34$, $p=0.044)$, impulsivity ($r s=0.47, p \\lt 0.001$), and the use of emotion regulation strategies ($r s=-0.38, p=0.005$). Although regression models did not identify any single variable as a significant predictor of overall burnout, the correlation analyses provided partial support for the hypothesis that self-esteem and emotion regulation difficulties influence the risk of academic burnout. These results suggest that burnout in engineering students is closely linked to deficits in emotional regulation rather than to self-perception alone."

    "abstract": "The integration of multimodal data, such as medical images and structured clinical records, is crucial for enhancing diagnostic accuracy. However, effectively fusing these heterogeneous data types poses significant challenges, primarily the semantic gap between modalities and the risk of feature degradation in joint training. To address these issues, we propose MEDIATOR (Mutual-information Enhanced DIstillation and gAting for Two-phase Orchestrated Representation), a novel learning framework that fundamentally decouples the learning process into two distinct phases: Phase 1 focuses exclusively on learning a powerful, unified vision representation from heterogeneous imaging data. It employs a Mutual information Gating and Distillation (MGD) mechanism to effectively bridge the modality gap and generate fusion-optimized features. In Phase 2, the entire vision module remains frozen, and a lightweight classifier is trained to integrate these high-quality visual features with auxiliary tabular data. This decoupled strategy boosts diagnostic performance by augmenting the rich visual representations with supplementary clinical information from tabular data, providing a holistic view of the diagnosis while preserving the integrity of visual features. Our experiments show that this paradigm significantly enhances diagnostic performance, establishing a robust and effective approach for multimodal medical diagnosis."

However, computational resource constraints present a critical performance bottleneck for Satellite. To solve the problem, a high speed decoding architecture with low hardware complexity and resource consumption based on Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) to improve the processing speed of physical layer on the Satellite has been proposed in this paper.

The complex interplay of multiple factors that hinder effective cyber crisis management has intensified the need to identify and address the critical sociotechnical barriers to CII cyber crisis management. Focusing on a public sector CII in Indonesia, this study aims to analyze the critical sociotechnical barriers to cyber crisis management. Employing a qualitative research design, this study integrates the use of interpretive structural modelling (ISM) and Delphi techniques to examine the critical sociotechnical barriers in the studied CII sector and formulate the solutions to address them. The findings highlight the urgent need for strong, comprehensive, and legally binding regulations to address these complex barriers. Specifically, a national cybersecurity law is required to provide clarity for inter-stakeholder cooperation and to mandate adequate budget provision for cyber crisis management. This must also be paralleled by the establishment of a continuous personnel competence development program supported by a appropriate career development policy. These findings, therefore, warrant further studies to develop robust regulations, budgeting approaches, and personnel development frameworks for cyber crisis management."

While smaller LLMs can operate in low-resource environments, these models are often prone to hallucination and inaccurate responses, representing tradeoffs between model compute and knowledge. This work presents Finetune-Then-Merge, a novel approach to improving models’ compute-knowledge efficiency, which finetunes multiple specialized expert LLMs and merges them, maintaining specialized knowledge without significantly increasing computational requirements. To validate this approach, Omni, a model merged from four expert models specialized in all subdomains of STEM, was created. Omni achieves state-of-the-art performance in domain knowledge and model efficiency compared to alternative optimization approaches, outperforming its base model by 31.70% in MMLU (Measuring Massive Multitask Language Understanding) STEM and 25.32% across all tested STEM benchmarks. It additionally runs on 4GB of RAM with considerable throughput and achieves optimal compute-knowledge efficiency across alternative models ranging from sizes of 1 billion to 8 billion parameters. Finetune-Then-Merge can also scale across different model architectures and domains, offering a new direction in LLM research towards models available to anyone, anywhere."

    "abstract": "AI-generated feedback is becoming increasingly common in education, but not all responses are trustworthy. Some responses are linguistically fluent but semantically irrelevant, some are manipulated by adversarial prompts, and others evade answering altogether. These issues—semantic drift, prompt injection, and evasiveness—are rarely detected before reaching students. This paper explores whether such risks can be predicted in advance. We introduce EduTrustSim, a controlled simulation that produces these failure types using GPT-3.5 and systematically records system-level signals such as semantic divergence, response time, and linguistic uncertainty. From 900 generated cases, we retain 850 high-quality labeled instances for modeling. We train and interpret three classifiers to flag trust risks, leveraging explainable AI techniques such as SHAP and LIME to analyze their decisions. Our findings show that subtle behavioral and linguistic traces—beyond content itself—often reveal when AI feedback may fail. Rather than filtering after the fact, this approach enables proactive detection before feedback reaches learners, offering a reproducible method for anticipating trust failures in generative educational systems."

To address this limitation, thermal imaging was utilized to capture pixel-level temperature variations, which were then processed and labeled into four representative classes: fire, reaction, leak, and vaporization. The labeled datasets were used to train a YOLOv8 model, achieving classification accuracies of 100% for reaction and vaporization, 73% for fire, and 50% for leak, with an overall average accuracy of 80.75%. These results demonstrate that the proposed visual–thermal data labeling method enhances detection reliability, providing a foundation for more effective AI-based chemical disaster response systems."

To provide empirical data, two functionally identical web applications were developed and tested within a CI/CD pipeline orchestrated by Jenkins. The pipeline integrated SonarQube for Static Application Security Testing (SAST) and OWASP ZAP for Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) to automate security evaluations. The primary research goals were to measure pipeline execution time, compare resource consumption (CPU and memory), and analyze the detection effectiveness of the security tools on both frameworks. The results show that CodeIgniter is more efficient (execution time of 152 seconds vs. 167 seconds). However, both automated SAST and DAST tools failed to detect critical vulnerabilities without deep configuration, emphasizing the trade-off between efficiency and implementation effort. The main contribution of this study is empirical evidence demonstrating how a framework's architecture directly influences the trade-off between pipeline efficiency and the implementation effort required for meaningful security analysis, underscoring that automated tools are a baseline that requires intelligent human configuration to be truly effective."

    "abstract": "In recent years, the rapid advancement of autonomous driving technology has driven the widespread development and application of LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging). LiDAR provides highly accurate three-dimensional environmental perception data and is widely used in fields such as object detection, scene reconstruction, and path planning. However, as the use of LiDAR increases, so does the volume of point cloud data it generates. This significant growth in data imposes considerable pressure on both storage and transmission, highlighting the importance and urgency of effective point cloud compression techniques. This study takes the Velodyne HDL-64E LiDAR sensor as an example. Each point in the generated point cloud requires approximately 6 to 12 bytes of storage. At a rotation speed of 600 revolutions per minute (RPM), the data produced per full rotation ranges from 0.8 MB to 1.6 MB. With the continuous improvement of LiDAR resolution, the data volume increases accordingly, making efficient compression techniques crucial for reducing storage and transmission costs. This paper proposes a compression method for raw point cloud data. First, the point cloud is converted from Cartesian coordinates to spherical coordinates and then mapped into a range image. The range image is subsequently compressed using an autoencoder. To minimize information loss during the compression process, we incorporate an error compensation technique, followed by quantization and entropy coding to further reduce the number of bits required. Experimental results show that under a reconstruction error of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$0.48 ~\\text{cm} /$</tex> point, the proposed compression algorithm achieves a compression efficiency of 8.87 bits/point on the KITTI dataset, which includes the Residential, Road, and City scenarios. These results demonstrate that the proposed method is capable of maintaining excellent compression performance even when high reconstruction accuracy is required."
