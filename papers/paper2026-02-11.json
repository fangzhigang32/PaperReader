    "abstract": "The convergence of self-consistent field equations in mean-field nuclear-electronic orbital methods strongly depends on the choice of initial guesses for quantum nuclei. Although several such guesses have been proposed in the literature, a systematic comparison of their performance as well as attempts of constructing novel approximations based on model tasks of quantum mechanics were not reported to date. In this work, we address both issues by introducing novel nuclear initial guesses derived from the analytical solutions of the three-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator and benchmarking them against existing approaches. We demonstrate that the isotropic variant of our guess outperforms existing approximations in nuclear-electronic orbital density functional theory calculations employing a simultaneous self-consistent field convergence protocol. Although our guess requires the computation of partial Hessians, we demonstrate that these can be evaluated with low-cost methods without affecting the accuracy of resulting protonic density matrices. Our results demonstrate that the proposed guess is robust and efficient and could provide a route to improved convergence in mean-field nuclear-electronic orbital computations."

    "abstract": "We present ROCKET, a training-free model compression method that achieves state-of-the-art performance in comparison with factorization, structured-sparsification and dynamic compression baselines. Operating under a global compression budget, ROCKET comprises two key innovations: First, it formulates layer-wise compression allocation as a multi-choice knapsack problem, selecting the optimal compression level for each layer to minimize total reconstruction error while adhering to a target model size. Second, it introduces a single-step sparse matrix factorization inspired by dictionary learning: using only a small calibration set, it sparsifies weight coefficients based on activation-weights sensitivity and then updates the dictionary in closed form via least squares bypassing iterative optimization, sparse coding, or backpropagation entirely. ROCKET consistently outperforms existing compression approaches across different model architectures at 20-50\\% compression rates. Notably, it retains over 90\\% of the original model's performance at 30\\% compression without any fine-tuning. Moreover, when applying a light fine-tuning phase, recovery is substantially enhanced: for instance, compressing Qwen3-14B to an 8B-parameter model and healing it with just 30 million tokens yields performance nearly on par with the original Qwen3-8B. The code for ROCKET is at github.com/mts-ai/ROCKET/tree/main."

    "abstract": "Autonomous vehicles (AVs) rely on sensors and deep neural networks (DNNs) to perceive their surrounding environment and make maneuver decisions in real time. However, achieving real-time DNN inference in the AV's perception pipeline is challenging due to the large gap between the computation requirement and the AV's limited resources. Most, if not all, of existing studies focus on optimizing the DNN inference time to achieve faster perception by compressing the DNN model with pruning and quantization. In contrast, we present a Predictable Perception system with DNNs (PP-DNN) that reduce the amount of image data to be processed while maintaining the same level of accuracy for multi-tenant DNNs by dynamically selecting critical frames and regions of interest (ROIs). PP-DNN is based on our key insight that critical frames and ROIs for AVs vary with the AV's surrounding environment. However, it is challenging to identify and use critical frames and ROIs in multi-tenant DNNs for predictable inference. Given image-frame streams, PP-DNN leverages an ROI generator to identify critical frames and ROIs based on the similarities of consecutive frames and traffic scenarios. PP-DNN then leverages a FLOPs predictor to predict multiply-accumulate operations (MACs) from the dynamic critical frames and ROIs. The ROI scheduler coordinates the processing of critical frames and ROIs with multiple DNN models. Finally, we design a detection predictor for the perception of non-critical frames. We have implemented PP-DNN in an ROS-based AV pipeline and evaluated it with the BDD100K and the nuScenes dataset. PP-DNN is observed to significantly enhance perception predictability, increasing the number of fusion frames by up to 7.3x, reducing the fusion delay by >2.6x and fusion-delay variations by >2.3x, improving detection completeness by 75.4% and the cost-effectiveness by up to 98% over the baseline."

    "abstract": "Despite the great success Kohn-Sham density functional theory (KS-DFT) has achieved, the delocalization error remains a major challenge for commonly used density functional approximations (DFAs), resulting in systematic errors in ionization energies, electron affinities, band structures, and charge distributions. A recently developed localized orbital scaling correction (LOSC) method, namely linear response LOSC (lrLOSC), addresses these challenges by incorporating a functional correction that includes the screening effect and orbital localization within the LOSC framework. The method has been shown to provide accurate descriptions of bulk systems and core-level binding energies in small molecular systems. In this work, we extend the applicability of lrLOSC to a broader range of molecular systems, spanning various sizes, with a focus on the corrections to valence orbital energies and total energies. To enable the calculation of large chemical systems, we developed an efficient implementation of lrLOSC with computational costs comparable to standard KS-DFT calculations. Numerical results show that, while screening provides modest improvements for small molecules, it becomes critical for achieving high accuracy in larger molecules, from linear to three-dimensional systems. With the screening effect well captured in a unified way, lrLOSC provides accurate descriptions for a wide range of chemical systems, including organic molecular systems of varying sizes and transition-metal oxide complexes, establishing it as a powerful tool for enhancing the reliability of computational simulations of chemical systems."

    "abstract": "Developing efficient GPU kernels is essential for scaling modern AI systems, yet it remains a complex task due to intricate hardware architectures and the need for specialized optimization expertise. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong capabilities in general sequential code generation, they face significant challenges in GPU code generation because of the scarcity of high-quality labeled training data, compiler biases when generating synthetic solutions, and limited generalization across hardware generations. This precludes supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a scalable methodology for improving current LLMs. In contrast, reinforcement learning (RL) offers a data-efficient and adaptive alternative but requires access to relevant tools, careful selection of training problems, and a robust evaluation environment. We present Makora's environment and tools for reinforcement learning finetuning of frontier models and report our results from fine-tuning GPT-5 for Triton code generation. In the single-attempt setting, our fine-tuned model improves kernel correctness from 43.7% to 77.0% (+33.3 percentage points) and increases the fraction of problems outperforming TorchInductor from 14.8% to 21.8% (+7 percentage points) compared to baseline GPT-5, while exceeding prior state-of-the-art models on KernelBench. When integrated into a full coding agent, it is able to solve up to 97.4% of problems in an expanded KernelBench suite, outperforming the PyTorch TorchInductor compiler on 72.9% of problems with a geometric mean speedup of 2.12x. Our work demonstrates that targeted post-training with reinforcement learning can unlock LLM capabilities in highly specialized technical domains where traditional supervised learning is limited by data availability, opening new pathways for AI-assisted accelerator programming."

Forthcoming facilities will be able to check whether these tensions result from systematic effects or indeed with the $Λ$CDM model itself. However, these new data will primarily probe gravitational interactions and provide only limited information about non-gravitational interactions. Distinguishing between competing models that make similar predictions yet rely on fundamentally different principles, therefore requires suitably diverse physical tests. Observational constraints on spacetime variations of fundamental constants fill this need. The fine-structure constant, $α= e^2/\\hbar c$, can be measured using absorption systems towards bright quasars using the Many Multiplet method, and using atomic doublets from line emitting gas in galaxies. A spectroscopic facility such as the WST could produce more than 100,000 new measurements of $α$ from quasars together with a million measurements from galaxies. When combined with other probes, such a large and homogeneous dataset of $α$ measurements would provide unprecedented constraints on physics beyond $Λ$CDM."

This paper introduces the DFIC dataset, a novel comprehensive facial image dataset comprising around 58,000 annotated images and 2706 videos of more than 1000 subjects, that cover a broad range of non-compliant conditions, in addition to compliant portraits. Our dataset provides a more balanced demographic distribution than the existing public datasets, with one partition that is nearly uniformly distributed, facilitating the development of automated ICAO compliance verification methods. Using DFIC, we fine-tuned a novel method that heavily relies on spatial attention mechanisms for the automatic validation of ICAO compliance requirements, and we have compared it with the state-of-the-art aimed at ICAO compliance verification, demonstrating improved results. DFIC dataset is now made public (https://github.com/visteam-isr-uc/DFIC) for the training and validation of new models, offering an unprecedented diversity of faces, that will improve both robustness and adaptability to the intrinsically diverse combinations of faces and props that can be presented to the validation system. These results emphasize the potential of DFIC to enhance automated ICAO compliance methods but it can also be used in many other applications that aim to improve the security, privacy, and fairness of facial recognition systems."

    "abstract": "Graphs are ubiquitous, and learning on graphs has become a cornerstone in artificial intelligence and data mining communities. Unlike pixel grids in images or sequential structures in language, graphs exhibit a typical non-Euclidean structure with complex interactions among the objects. This paper argues that Riemannian geometry provides a principled and necessary foundation for graph representation learning, and that Riemannian graph learning should be viewed as a unifying paradigm rather than a collection of isolated techniques. While recent studies have explored the integration of graph learning and Riemannian geometry, most existing approaches are limited to a narrow class of manifolds, particularly hyperbolic spaces, and often adopt extrinsic manifold formulations. We contend that the central mission of Riemannian graph learning is to endow graph neural networks with intrinsic manifold structures, which remains underexplored. To advance this perspective, we identify key conceptual and methodological gaps in existing approaches and outline a structured research agenda along three dimensions: manifold type, neural architecture, and learning paradigm. We further discuss open challenges, theoretical foundations, and promising directions that are critical for unlocking the full potential of Riemannian graph learning. This paper aims to provide a coherent viewpoint and to stimulate broader exploration of Riemannian geometry as a foundational framework for future graph learning research."

The integrated X-ray luminosity ($L_X$) from high-mass X-ray binaries in star-forming galaxies scales with both the star formation rate (SFR) and host-galaxy metallicity $Z$. Due to the inverse correlation between $L_X/\\mathrm{SFR}$ and $Z$, the contribution of X-ray binaries to the ionizing photon budget is enhanced in metal-poor systems and may ionize He II in the surrounding interstellar medium, powering nebular He II $\\lambda4686$ emission. The blue compact dwarf galaxy ESO 338-IG04 (ESO 338-4) provides a nearby laboratory for studying stellar feedback in a low-metallicity starburst, combining vigorous recent star formation, low metallicity ($12+\\log(\\mathrm{O/H})\\approx7.9$), and a rich population of massive stellar clusters. We characterize the X-ray emission of ESO 338-4 and its halo using new deep Chandra and XMM-Newton observations. We analyze X-ray spectra, light curves, and images to constrain the nature of its X-ray sources. We identify five ultra-luminous X-ray sources (ULXs) and diffuse hot gas surrounding the galaxy. Two ULXs are spatially associated with stellar clusters. The total X-ray luminosity exceeds $10^{41}\\,\\mathrm{erg\\,s^{-1}}$. The brightest source, ULX1, shows variability on day timescales and lacks a stellar-cluster counterpart. Photoionization modeling shows that X-ray sources significantly impact the ionizing photon budget; models with ULX1 as the ionizing source predict nebular He II $\\lambda4686$ luminosities of $\\sim10^{39}\\,\\mathrm{erg\\,s^{-1}}$."

    "abstract": "Accurate retinal vessel segmentation is a critical prerequisite for quantitative analysis of retinal images and computer-aided diagnosis of vascular diseases such as diabetic retinopathy. However, the elongated morphology, wide scale variation, and low contrast of retinal vessels pose significant challenges for existing methods, making it difficult to simultaneously preserve fine capillaries and maintain global topological continuity. To address these challenges, we propose the Vessel-aware Frequency-domain and Global Spatial modeling Network (VFGS-Net), an end-to-end segmentation framework that seamlessly integrates frequency-aware feature enhancement, dual-path convolutional representation learning, and bidirectional asymmetric spatial state-space modeling within a unified architecture. Specifically, VFGS-Net employs a dual-path feature convolution module to jointly capture fine-grained local textures and multi-scale contextual semantics. A novel vessel-aware frequency-domain channel attention mechanism is introduced to adaptively reweight spectral components, thereby enhancing vessel-relevant responses in high-level features. Furthermore, at the network bottleneck, we propose a bidirectional asymmetric Mamba2-based spatial modeling block to efficiently capture long-range spatial dependencies and strengthen the global continuity of vascular structures. Extensive experiments on four publicly available retinal vessel datasets demonstrate that VFGS-Net achieves competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. Notably, our model consistently improves segmentation accuracy for fine vessels, complex branching patterns, and low-contrast regions, highlighting its robustness and clinical potential."

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to generate and shape cultural content, ranging from narrative writing to artistic production. While these models demonstrate impressive fluency and generative capacity, prior work has shown that they also exhibit systematic cultural biases, raising concerns about stereotyping, homogenization, and the erasure of culturally specific forms of expression. Understanding whether LLMs can meaningfully align with diverse cultures beyond the dominant ones remains a critical challenge. In this paper, we study cultural adaptation in LLMs through the lens of cooking recipes, a domain in which culture, tradition, and creativity are tightly intertwined. We build on the \\textit{GlobalFusion} dataset, which pairs human recipes from different countries according to established measures of cultural distance. Using the same country pairs, we generate culturally adapted recipes with multiple LLMs, enabling a direct comparison between human and LLM behavior in cross-cultural content creation. Our analysis shows that LLMs fail to produce culturally representative adaptations. Unlike humans, the divergence of their generated recipes does not correlate with cultural distance. We further provide explanations for this gap. We show that cultural information is weakly preserved in internal model representations, that models inflate novelty in their production by misunderstanding notions such as creativity and tradition, and that they fail to identify adaptation with its associated countries and to ground it in culturally salient elements such as ingredients. These findings highlight fundamental limitations of current LLMs for culturally oriented generation and have important implications for their use in culturally sensitive applications."

The resulting discrete model possesses several desirable features: it ensures volume conservation of the discrete elements by considering cross-sectional deformation through a local dilatation factor, it demonstrates the beneficial properties associated with the variational integrator technique, such as the preservation of the rotational configuration, and energy conservation with a bounded error. An exhaustive set of numerical results under various initial conditions of the rod demonstrates the efficacy of the model in replicating the physics of the system."

A multi-antenna base station (BS) with transmitting fluid antennas serves downlink users, energizes passive tags, and illuminates radar targets, while a spatially separated multi-antenna reader decodes tag backscatter and processes radar echoes to avoid the strong self-interference that would otherwise obscure weak returns at the BS. The coexistence of tags and targets, however, induces severe near--far disparities and multi-signal interference, which can be mitigated by fluid antennas through additional spatial degrees of freedom that reshape the multi-hop channels. We formulate a transmit-power minimization problem that jointly optimizes the BS information beamformers, sensing covariance matrix, reader receive beamformers, tag reflection coefficients, and fluid-antenna (FA) positions under heterogeneous quality of service constraints for communication, backscatter, and sensing, as well as energy-harvesting and FA geometry requirements. To tackle the resulting non-convex problem, we develop an alternating-optimization block-coordinate framework that solves four tractable subproblems using semidefinite relaxation, majorization--minimization, and successive convex approximation. Numerical results show consistent transmit-power savings over fixed-position antennas and zero-forcing baselines, achieving about 13.7% and 54.5% reductions, respectively."

We present SOAR, a training-free decoding algorithm that adapts its behavior to the model's uncertainty. When confidence is low, SOAR briefly widens the search over alternative unmasking decisions to avoid premature commitments; when confidence is high, it collapses the search and decodes many positions in parallel to reduce the number of denoising iterations. Across mathematical reasoning and code generation benchmarks (GSM8K, MBPP, HumanEval) on Dream-7B and LLaDA-8B, SOAR improves generation quality while maintaining competitive inference speed, offering a practical way to balance quality and efficiency in DLM decoding."

Initial efforts were devoted to enhancing the robot's facial expression recognition accuracy, achieving a 98% accuracy through deep neural networks. Two subsequent preliminary exploratory experiments were designed to advance the study's objectives. The first experiment aimed to compare pain levels experienced by children during the injection process, with and without the presence of the Maya robot. Twenty-five children, aged 4 to 9, undergoing cancer treatment participated in this counterbalanced study. The paired T-test results revealed a significant reduction in perceived pain when the robot was actively present in the injection room. The second experiment sought to assess perspectives of hospitalized children and their mothers during engagement with Maya through a game. Forty participants, including 20 children aged 4 to 9 and their mothers, were involved. Post Human-Maya Interactions, UTAUT questionnaire results indicated that children experienced significantly less anxiety than their parents during the interaction and game play. Notably, children exhibited higher trust levels in both the robot and the games, presenting a statistically significant difference in trust levels compared to their parents (P-value < 0.05). This preliminary exploratory study highlights the positive impact of utilizing Maya as an assistant for therapy/education in a clinical setting, particularly benefiting children undergoing cancer treatment. The findings underscore the potential of social robots in pediatric healthcare contexts, emphasizing improved pain management and emotional well-being among young patients."

Here, we report a membrane-enabled integration platform based on transferable single-crystalline beta-Ga2O3 that overcomes these constraints at the system level. By exploiting the weak interplanar bonding of beta-Ga2O3 (100) plane, we obtain wafer-scale freestanding single-crystalline membranes that enable vertically integrated photodiodes with sub-microsecond, non-persistent photoresponse and high UV-visible rejection. Crucially, we introduce a stitching-based membrane assembly strategy that decouples array resolution from the size of the source single-crystalline substrate, allowing high-resolution photodetector arrays to be integrated onto silicon thin-film-transistor backplanes. The modular assembled active-matrix UV imaging arrays exhibit uniform solar-blind response without image lag, in stark contrast to arrays based on amorphous or polycrystalline films. Beyond beta-Ga2O3, this membrane-enabled and stitching-based modular integration strategy provides a general route toward high-speed, high-resolution electronic imaging systems using transferable single-crystalline semiconductors."

    "abstract": "Large-scale diffusion models such as FLUX (12B parameters) and Stable Diffusion 3 (8B parameters) require multi-GPU parallelism for efficient inference. Unified Sequence Parallelism (USP), which combines Ulysses and Ring attention mechanisms, has emerged as the state-of-the-art approach for distributed attention computation. However, existing USP implementations suffer from significant inefficiencies including excessive kernel launch overhead and suboptimal computation-communication scheduling. In this paper, we propose \\textbf{FastUSP}, a multi-level optimization framework that integrates compile-level optimization (graph compilation with CUDA Graphs and computation-communication reordering), communication-level optimization (FP8 quantized collective communication), and operator-level optimization (pipelined Ring attention with double buffering). We evaluate FastUSP on FLUX (12B) and Qwen-Image models across 2, 4, and 8 NVIDIA RTX 5090 GPUs. On FLUX, FastUSP achieves consistent \\textbf{1.12$\\times$--1.16$\\times$} end-to-end speedup over baseline USP, with compile-level optimization contributing the dominant improvement. On Qwen-Image, FastUSP achieves \\textbf{1.09$\\times$} speedup on 2 GPUs; on 4--8 GPUs, we identify a PyTorch Inductor compatibility limitation with Ring attention that prevents compile optimization, while baseline USP scales to 1.30$\\times$--1.46$\\times$ of 2-GPU performance. We further provide a detailed analysis of the performance characteristics of distributed diffusion inference, revealing that kernel launch overhead -- rather than communication latency -- is the primary bottleneck on modern high-bandwidth GPU interconnects."

Fitting this individual-level data requires inference on individuals' unobserved disease statuses over time, which form a high-dimensional and highly correlated state space. We introduce a novel Bayesian (data-augmentation Markov chain Monte Carlo) algorithm for jointly estimating the model parameters and unobserved disease statuses, which we call the Rippler algorithm. This is a non-centred method that can be applied to any individual-based state-transition model. We compare the Rippler algorithm to the state-of-the-art inference methods for individual-based stochastic epidemic models and find that it performs better than these methods as the number of disease states in the model increases."

Long-term N-body integrations show that most orbits with the retrograde configuration remain dynamically stable for at least 10 Myr, while orbits with the prograde motion might rapidly evolve into chaos or lead to ejection. The retrograde architecture points to a violent dynamical history, possibly involving von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai cycles or three-body scattering, while the prograde scenario might be consistent with coplanar and mild disk migration.

Existing primal-dual methods that achieve sublinear strong reward regret inevitably incur growing strong constraint violation or are restricted to average-iterate convergence due to inherent oscillations. To address these limitations, we propose the Flexible safety Domain Optimization via Margin-regularized Exploration (FlexDOME) algorithm, the first to provably achieve near-constant $\\tilde{O}(1)$ strong constraint violation alongside sublinear strong regret and non-asymptotic last-iterate convergence. FlexDOME incorporates time-varying safety margins and regularization terms into the primal-dual framework. Our theoretical analysis relies on a novel term-wise asymptotic dominance strategy, where the safety margin is rigorously scheduled to asymptotically majorize the functional decay rates of the optimization and statistical errors, thereby clamping cumulative violations to a near-constant level. Furthermore, we establish non-asymptotic last-iterate convergence guarantees via a policy-dual Lyapunov argument. Experiments corroborate our theoretical findings."

The observed detection rate of transient lensed stars -- individual, massive, thus luminous stars in strongly lensed galaxies that are temporarily detectable upon stellar microlensing -- can serve as a probe to break the IMF-star formation history degeneracy in studies utilizing spectral energy distribution fitting, hence providing a window to look at the IMF at a subsample of gravitationally lensed galaxies.

This design enables a parallel optimize-and-approximate framework in which the Hessian-inverse approximation is updated synchronously with the stochastic inner optimization, reusing gradient information at negligible additional cost. Our main theoretical contribution establishes high-probability error bounds and sample complexity guarantees for NHGD that match those of state-of-the-art optimize-then-approximate methods, while significantly reducing computational time overhead. Empirical evaluations on representative bilevel learning tasks further demonstrate the practical advantages of NHGD, highlighting its scalability and effectiveness in large-scale machine learning settings."

This necessitates the development of new track finding algorithms to mitigate detector performance degradation. Building on our previous success with an end-to-end multi-track reconstruction algorithm for the Belle II experiment at the SuperKEKB collider (arXiv:2411.13596), we have extended the algorithm to incorporate inputs from both the drift chamber and the silicon vertex tracking detector, creating a multi-modal network. We employ graph neural networks to handle the irregular detector structure and object condensation to address the unknown, varying number of particles in each event. This approach simultaneously identifies all tracks in an event and determines their respective parameters. We demonstrate the algorithm's effectiveness using a realistic full detector simulation, which incorporates beam-induced backgrounds and noise modelled from actual collision data. The simultaneous reconstruction of the information from the two detectors yields a track efficiency improvement from 48.0 % to 74.7 % for uniformly displaced particles up to 100 cm, while increasing the track purity by 5.5 percentage points. We provide a detailed comparison of its track-finding performance against the current Belle II baseline across various event topologies."

Starting from a general metric characterized by an arbitrary lapse function and areal radius, we derive curvature invariants, establish regularity conditions at the wormhole throat, and reduce the Klein-Gordon equation to a Helmholtz-type radial wave equation. This formulation naturally leads to a position- and frequency-dependent effective refractive index determined by the underlying spacetime geometry and Lorentz-violating structure, resulting in effective frequency-dependent wave-optical behavior. We show that divergences of the refractive index coincide with Killing horizons, while curvature-induced turning points control reflection, transmission, and confinement of scalar waves. By analyzing constant, linear, and quadratic lapse profiles, we identify horizonless transmission regimes, asymmetric wave propagation, and multi-horizon trapping structures. Our results reveal that Lorentz violation can significantly modify wave-optical properties of curved spacetime, generating graded-index analogues and geometric confinement of modes without curvature singularities. This unified optical perspective provides a robust framework for investigating wave scattering, resonances, and potential observational signatures in Lorentz-violating gravitational backgrounds."

    "abstract": "Despite the extensive body of work on backstepping for one-dimensional PDEs, results in higher dimensions remain comparatively limited. Most available methods either exploit particular symmetries of the PDE or address problems posed on parallelepiped domains. To the best of our knowledge, the only approach that enables the design of backstepping controllers on non-parallelepiped regions without symmetry assumptions is the domain extension technique. This method, however, presents several drawbacks. In particular, the control input at each time instant is obtained by simulating a PDE on an extended domain, from which the actual input on the original domain is approximated. By contrast, in the one-dimensional setting, once the time-independent backstepping gain kernel is known, the control input can be computed in closed form as a feedback depending solely on the state at that same instant. Moreover, problems such as output-feedback design or adaptive and robust control do not appear straightforward to address with the domain extension method, at least to the best of our knowledge. These considerations motivate the search, whenever possible, for alternatives that preserve the main advantages of one-dimensional backstepping. A motivating example for the domain extension method is the control of the heat equation on a piano-shaped domain, with actuation applied at the tail of the piano. In this extended abstract, we show through a simple calculation that the domain extension method is not required in this setting. Instead, a strategy akin to that used for parallelepiped domains can be adopted. This result constitutes a first instance of a broader framework for backstepping control of asymmetric PDEs posed on non-parallelepiped regions, which we refer to as domains with graph-monotone boundaries. The general framework is developed in a forthcoming paper."

To train semantic segmentation models, labeled point cloud segmentation datasets are essential. Meanwhile, point cloud labeling is time-consuming for annotators, which typically involves tuning the camera viewpoint and selecting points by lasso. To reduce the time cost of point cloud labeling, we propose a viewpoint recommendation approach to reduce annotators' labeling time costs. We adapt Fitts' law to model the time cost of lasso selection in point clouds. Using the modeled time cost, the viewpoint that minimizes the lasso selection time cost is recommended to the annotator. We build a data labeling system for semantic segmentation of 3D point clouds that integrates our viewpoint recommendation approach. The system enables users to navigate to recommended viewpoints for efficient annotation. Through an ablation study, we observed that our approach effectively reduced the data labeling time cost. We also qualitatively compare our approach with previous viewpoint selection approaches on different datasets."

We propose a visual-native search framework that represents webpages as visual snapshots, allowing agents to leverage layout cues to quickly localize salient evidence and suppress distractors. To learn effectively from these high-dimensional observations, we introduce Information-Aware Credit Assignment (ICA), a post-hoc method that estimates each retrieved snapshot's contribution to the final outcome via posterior analysis and propagates dense learning signals back to key search turns. Integrated with a GRPO-based training pipeline, our approach consistently outperforms text-based baselines on diverse information-seeking benchmarks, providing evidence that visual snapshot grounding with information-level credit assignment alleviates the credit-assignment bottleneck in open-ended web environments.

At first glance, the apparently passive nature of the port-Hamiltonian system seems incompatible with the active power injection required to sustain this non-equilibrium condition. However, we demonstrate that the discontinuity inherent in the vector field provides the additional energy needed to maintain this operating point, indicating that the system is not globally passive. Moreover, when the discontinuity is replaced by a continuous approximation, the resulting system becomes cyclo-dissipative while still capable of supplying the required power."

Here we use low-field magnetotransport (B < 1 T) to reconstruct the dispersions of the two spin-orbit-split heavy-hole branches (HH-, HH+) in undoped (100) GaAs/AlGaAs single heterojunction 2DHGs operated in an accumulation-mode field-effect geometry. The dopant-free devices sustain out-of-plane electric fields up to 26 kV/cm while maintaining mobilities up to 84 m$^2$/Vs and exhibiting a spin-orbit polarization as large as 36%. Fourier analysis of Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillations resolves the individual HH-/HH+ subband densities; fitting the temperature dependence of the corresponding Fourier amplitudes yields both branch-resolved SdH effective masses over the same magnetic field window. SdH regimes in which reliable subband parameters can be extracted are delineated. Over 2DHG densities (0.76-1.9) $\\times$ 10$^{15}$ /m$^2$, the HH- mass is nearly density independent ($\\approx 0.34m_e$), implying a near-parabolic HH- dispersion below the first LH+/HH- anticrossing, whereas HH+ exhibits strong non-parabolicity with an effective mass that increases with density. Combining the extracted dispersions yields a transport-based determination of the spin-orbit splitting energy $Δ_\\text{HH}$ between HH and HH+ as a function of in-plane wave vector. Parameter-free Luttinger-model calculations reproduce the qualitative trends but underestimate both masses by a common factor $\\approx$ 2, suggesting a many-body renormalization of the heavy-hole mass in this strongly asymmetric regime."

We characterize the chemical composition and isotopic ratios of the CSE of AFGL2233 and investigate chemical peculiarities, including the presence of N- and O-bearing species in a C-rich environment. We carried out a complete line survey at 3 mm and 1 mm using the IRAM 30m telescope, complemented by Herschel/HIFI FIR observations and interferometric maps of SiO, C2H, and HCN. Molecular emission was analyzed using rotational diagrams and radiative transfer modeling under the LVG approximation. Column densities and fractional abundances were derived for more than 30 molecular species, including isotopologues, and compared with other evolved stars. The Gaia DR3 distance of 1.236 kpc implies a luminosity of ~2 Lsun, consistent with an initial mass of 4.5-9 Msun. The molecular inventory confirms C-rich chemistry but reveals unusually high abundances of NH3, H2O, and SiN. The isotopic ratios vary among species, with 12C/13C ranging from 7 to 55. The C2H/C4H ratio is abnormally high compared with C-rich AGB stars. The presence of SiN and high NH3 may indicate N-enrichment or the influence of a companion. AFGL2233 is likely a high-mass AGB or super-AGB star with a complex evolutionary history involving nucleosynthesis, shocks, and possible binary interaction."

We study the time complexity of estimating $π(s,t)$ with constant relative error and constant failure probability, whenever $π(s,t)$ is above a given threshold parameter $δ\\in(0,1)$. We consider common graph-access models and furthermore study the single source, single target, and single node (PageRank centrality) variants of the problem. We provide a complete characterization of PPR estimation in undirected graphs by giving tight bounds (up to logarithmic factors) for all problems and model variants in both the worst-case and average-case setting. This includes both new upper and lower bounds. Tight bounds were recently obtained by Bertram, Jensen, Thorup, Wang, and Yan for directed graphs. However, their lower bound constructions rely on asymmetry and therefore do not carry over to undirected graphs. At the same time, undirected graphs exhibit additional structure that can be exploited algorithmically. Our results resolve the undirected case by developing new techniques that capture both aspects, yielding tight bounds."

This enables a careful balance between accuracy and hardware resource utilization. Guided by this trade-off analysis, online sketch processing elements (SPEs) are implemented on an FPGA to directly process time-stamp streams from the SPAD sensor. The implementation is validated using a customized LiDAR setup with a 192 x 128-pixel SPAD array. This work demonstrates histogram-free online depth reconstruction with high fidelity, effectively alleviating the time-stamp transfer bottleneck of SPAD arrays and offering scalability as pixel counts continue to increase for future SPADs."

The formation of the cosmological compact objects intuitively is explained in terms of the topological line defects - the string like tubes. The strings can get an energetically preferable configuration corresponding to the magnetic flux quantum inside an area defined by the mass of dark vector field."

Path analysis results indicate that the four Design Thinking Skills, Problem-driven Design (beta = 0.198, p < 0.01), Information-driven Design (beta = 0.241, p < 0.001), Solution-driven Design (beta = 0.227, p < 0.001), and Knowledge-driven Design (beta = 0.263, p < 0.001) all significantly and positively influence Design Thinking. Furthermore, Design Thinking has a significant positive predictive effect on Design Creativity & Innovation (beta = 0.286, p < 0.001). Mediation analysis confirms three significant mediation paths: the CSE mediation path (beta = 0.128, p < 0.001), the CCE mediation path (beta = 0.073, p < 0.01), and the \"CSE to CCE\" chain mediation path (beta = 0.025, p < 0.01). Multi-group comparison results reveal significant differences between the student and professional groups under the full equivalence model. After relaxing specific constraints, there were no significant differences between the nested models of the baseline model, partial measurement invariance, structural weight invariance, and structural covariance invariance. These findings elucidate the multi-dimensional pathways of Design Creativity & Innovation, providing a robust empirical basis for optimizing differentiated pedagogical models and professional practice guidelines."

Specifically, by converting point clouds into a fixed set of realistic depth images, our method leverages a frozen CLIP visual encoder to extract multi-view representations and performs anomaly detection via weighted feature similarity, which does not require any fine-tuning or category-dependent adaptation. Extensive experiments on the ShapeNetPart dataset demonstrate that DMP-3DAD achieves state-of-the-art performance under few-shot setting.

In this work, we present RSHallu, a systematic study with three deliverables: (1) we formalize RS hallucinations with an RS-oriented taxonomy and introduce image-level hallucination to capture RS-specific inconsistencies beyond object-centric errors (e.g., modality, resolution, and scene-level semantics); (2) we build a hallucination benchmark RSHalluEval (2,023 QA pairs) and enable dual-mode checking, supporting high-precision cloud auditing and low-cost reproducible local checking via a compact checker fine-tuned on RSHalluCheck dataset (15,396 QA pairs); and (3) we introduce a domain-tailored dataset RSHalluShield (30k QA pairs) for training-friendly mitigation and further propose training-free plug-and-play strategies, including decoding-time logit correction and RS-aware prompting. Across representative RS-MLLMs, our mitigation improves the hallucination-free rate by up to 21.63 percentage points under a unified protocol, while maintaining competitive performance on downstream RS tasks (RSVQA/RSVG).

We propose VulReaD, a knowledge-graph-guided approach for vulnerability reasoning and detection that moves beyond binary classification toward CWE-level reasoning. VulReaD leverages a security knowledge graph (KG) as a semantic backbone and uses a strong teacher LLM to generate CWE-consistent contrastive reasoning supervision, enabling student model training without manual annotations. Students are fine-tuned with Odds Ratio Preference Optimization (ORPO) to encourage taxonomy-aligned reasoning while suppressing unsupported explanations. Across three real-world datasets, VulReaD improves binary F1 by 8-10% and multi-class classification by 30% Macro-F1 and 18% Micro-F1 compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Results show that LLMs outperform deep learning baselines in binary detection and that KG-guided reasoning enhances CWE coverage and interpretability."

While this problem has been extensively studied on graphs, we focus on its strong extension to hypergraphs, where edges may connect any number of vertices. A set of vertices in a hypergraph is strongly independent if there is at most one vertex per edge in the set. One application for this problem is to find perfect minimal hash functions. We propose nine new data reduction rules specifically designed for this problem. Our reduction routine can serve as a preprocessing step for any solver. We analyze the impact on the size of the reduced instances and the performance of several subsequent solvers when combined with this preprocessing. Our results demonstrate a significant reduction in instance size and improvements in running time for subsequent solvers. The preprocessing routine reduces instances, on average, to 22% of their original size in 6.76 seconds. When combining our reduction preprocessing with the best-performing exact solver, we observe an average speedup of 3.84x over not using the reduction rules. In some cases, we can achieve speedups of up to 53x. Additionally, one more instance becomes solvable by a method when combined with our preprocessing."

We tackle the high-impulse contact dynamics of this task under a decentralized setting, achieving synchronization without explicit communication or pre-specified motion primitives. Our framework leverages Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO) enhanced by a progressive curriculum strategy, which effectively overcomes the sparse-reward exploration challenges inherent in mechanically coupled systems. We demonstrate robust performance in simulation and successful transfer to physical hardware, executing multi-directional jumps onto platforms up to 1.5 m in height. Specifically, one of the robots achieves a foot-end elevation of 1.1 m, which represents a 144% improvement over the 0.45 m jump height of a standalone quadrupedal robot, demonstrating superior vertical performance. Notably, this precise coordination is achieved solely through proprioceptive feedback, establishing a foundation for communication-free collaborative locomotion in constrained environments."

    "abstract": "When sensitive information is encoded in data, it is important to ensure the privacy of information when attempting to learn useful information from the data. There is a natural tradeoff whereby increasing privacy requirements may decrease the utility of a learning protocol. In the quantum setting of differential privacy, such tradeoffs between privacy and utility have so far remained largely unexplored. In this work, we study optimal privacy-utility tradeoffs for both generic and application-specific utility metrics when privacy is quantified by $(\\varepsilon,δ)$-quantum local differential privacy. In the generic setting, we focus on optimizing fidelity and trace distance between the original state and the privatized state. We show that the depolarizing mechanism achieves the optimal utility for given privacy requirements. We then study the specific application of learning the expectation of an observable with respect to an input state when only given access to privatized states. We derive a lower bound on the number of samples of privatized data required to achieve a fixed accuracy guarantee with high probability. To prove this result, we employ existing lower bounds on private quantum hypothesis testing, thus showcasing the first operational use of them. We also devise private mechanisms that achieve optimal sample complexity with respect to the privacy parameters and accuracy parameters, demonstrating that utility can be significantly improved for specific tasks in contrast to the generic setting. In addition, we show that the number of samples required to privately learn observable expectation values scales as $Θ((\\varepsilon β)^{-2})$, where $\\varepsilon \\in (0,1)$ is the privacy parameter and $β$ is the accuracy tolerance. We conclude by initiating the study of private classical shadows, which promise useful applications for private learning tasks."

However, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), which serves as the primary mechanism for adapting VLAs to downstream domains, requires substantial amounts of task-specific data and is prone to catastrophic forgetting. To address these limitations, we propose LifeLong-RFT, a simple yet effective Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) strategy for VLA models independent of online environmental feedback and pre-trained reward models. By integrating chunking-level on-policy reinforcement learning with the proposed Multi-Dimensional Process Reward (MDPR) mechanism, LifeLong-RFT quantifies the heterogeneous contributions of intermediate action chunks across three dimensions to facilitate policy optimization. Specifically, (1) the Quantized Action Consistency Reward (QACR) ensures accurate action prediction within the discrete action space; (2) the Continuous Trajectory Alignment Reward (CTAR) aligns decoded continuous action chunks with reference trajectories to ensure precise control; (3) the Format Compliance Reward (FCR) guarantees the structural validity of outputs. Comprehensive experiments across SimplerEnv, LIBERO, and real-world tasks demonstrate that LifeLong-RFT exhibits strong performance in multi-task learning. Furthermore, for continual learning on the LIBERO benchmark, our method achieves a 22% gain in average success rate over SFT, while effectively adapting to new tasks using only 20% of the training data. Overall, our method provides a promising post-training paradigm for VLAs."

The dataset comprises 13,348 labeled images collected through multiple methods, including DWaste mobile app and curated web sources. Methods included rigorous validation through checksums and outlier detection, analysis of class imbalance and visual separability via PCA/t-SNE, and assessment of background complexity using entropy and saliency measures. The dataset was benchmarked using state-of-the-art deep learning models (EfficientNetV2M, EfficientNetV2S, MobileNet, ResNet50, ResNet101) evaluated on performance metrics and operational carbon emissions. Experiment results indicate EfficientNetV2S achieved the highest performance with 96.19% accuracy and a 0.96 F1-score, though with a moderate carbon cost. Analysis revealed inherent dataset characteristics including class imbalance, a skew toward high-outlier classes (plastic, cardboard, paper), and brightness variations that require consideration. The main conclusion is that GD provides a valuable, real-world benchmark for waste classification research while highlighting important challenges such as class imbalance, background complexity, and environmental trade-offs in model selection that must be addressed for practical deployment.

    "abstract": "We investigate the geometric structure of learning dynamics in overparameterized transformer models through carefully controlled modular arithmetic tasks. Our primary finding is that despite operating in high-dimensional parameter spaces ($d=128$), transformer training trajectories rapidly collapse onto low-dimensional execution manifolds of dimension $3$--$4$. This dimensional collapse is robust across random seeds and moderate task difficulties, though the orientation of the manifold in parameter space varies between runs. We demonstrate that this geometric structure underlies several empirically observed phenomena: (1) sharp attention concentration emerges as saturation along routing coordinates within the execution manifold, (2) stochastic gradient descent (SGD) exhibits approximately integrable dynamics when projected onto the execution subspace, with non-integrability confined to orthogonal staging directions, and (3) sparse autoencoders capture auxiliary routing structure but fail to isolate execution itself, which remains distributed across the low-dimensional manifold. Our results suggest a unifying geometric framework for understanding transformer learning, where the vast majority of parameters serve to absorb optimization interference while core computation occurs in a dramatically reduced subspace. These findings have implications for interpretability, training curriculum design, and understanding the role of overparameterization in neural network learning."

We observe that even when auxiliary visual elements are interleaved, they are often treated as static snapshots within a one-dimensional, unstructured reasoning chain. We argue that such approaches treat reasoning history as an immutable stream: correcting a local error necessitates either generating verbose downstream corrections or regenerating the entire context. This forces the model to implicitly maintain and track state updates, significantly increasing token consumption and cognitive load. This limitation is particularly acute in high-dimensional domains, such as geometry and SVG design, where the textual expression of CoT lacks explicit visual guidance, further constraining the model's reasoning precision. To bridge this gap, we introduce \\textbf{Canvas-of-Thought (Canvas-CoT)}. By leveraging a HTML Canvas as an external reasoning substrate, Canvas-CoT empowers the model to perform atomic, DOM-based CRUD operations. This architecture enables in-place state revisions without disrupting the surrounding context, allowing the model to explicitly maintain the \"ground truth\". Furthermore, we integrate a rendering-based critique loop that serves as a hard constraint validator, providing explicit visual feedback to resolve complex tasks that are difficult to articulate through text alone. Extensive experiments on VCode, RBench-V, and MathVista demonstrate that Canvas-CoT significantly outperforms existing baselines, establishing a new paradigm for context-efficient multimodal reasoning."

This raises a natural family-level question: does the same phenomenon persist inside one-parameter families, where the local structure varies in a highly constrained way? In this paper we answer this in the negative for the pure fields $K_m=\\mathbb Q(α)$ with $α^n=m$ ($n\\ge 4$) and $m$ square-free. Writing $g(m)=[\\mathcal O_{K_m}:\\mathbb Z[α]]$, we prove that the set of square-free $m$ for which $g(m)>1$ but $K_m$ has no ABS local obstruction has natural density $0$.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) exhibit strong general-purpose reasoning capabilities, yet they frequently hallucinate when used as world models (WMs), where strict compliance with deterministic transition rules--particularly in corner cases--is essential. In contrast, Symbolic WMs provide logical consistency but lack semantic expressivity. To bridge this gap, we propose Neuro-Symbolic Synergy (NeSyS), a framework that integrates the probabilistic semantic priors of LLMs with executable symbolic rules to achieve both expressivity and robustness. NeSyS alternates training between the two models using trajectories inadequately explained by the other. Unlike rule-based prompting, the symbolic WM directly constrains the LLM by modifying its output probability distribution. The neural WM is fine-tuned only on trajectories not covered by symbolic rules, reducing training data by 50% without loss of accuracy. Extensive experiments on three distinct interactive environments, i.e., ScienceWorld, Webshop, and Plancraft, demonstrate NeSyS's consistent advantages over baselines in both WM prediction accuracy and data efficiency."

    "abstract": "We introduce a novel numerical method for direct simulation of front propagation in the Fisher-KPP equation with a time-dependent parameter on an infinite domain. The method computes a time-dependent boundary condition that accurately captures the leading-edge dynamics by coupling the nonlinear simulation region to a linear approximation region in which the dynamics can be solved exactly via the Green's function of the linearized equation. This approach enables precise front velocity measurements on relatively small computational domains for a variety of nonautonomous regimes and initial conditions for which existing numerical methods break down. We apply the method to pulled and pushed fronts in the Fisher-KPP equation with quadratic and quadratic-cubic nonlinearities, finding that it improves the accuracy of the simulated front velocity even for constant parameters and a fixed domain size. For pulled fronts with a diffusion coefficient that increases algebraically in time, our results reveal a deviation from the natural asymptotic velocity predicted by linear theory, whose explanation requires nonlinear theory. For pushed fronts with constant parameters, the method reproduces the exponential convergence to the theoretical asymptotic front speed and profile with improved precision. For a slowly time-varying linear growth parameter, we find that the pushed front velocity follows the changing parameter adiabatically if the asymptotic pushed velocity remains faster than the natural asymptotic pulled velocity. As the growth parameter moves toward the pushed--pulled transition point, the competition between the pushed and pulled fronts can result in both delayed and even premature onset of the pushed--pulled transition, depending on the form of parameter growth. The numerical method presented here proves to be an effective tool for analyzing front propagation in nonautonomous systems."

The interaction can be enhanced by increasing the resonator's impedance, while approaching the quantum impedance ($h/e^2$) remains challenging. Edge plasmons emergent as chiral bosonic modes in the quantum Hall channels provide high quantized impedance of $h/ νe^2$ that can exceed 10 k$Ω$ for the Landau-level filling factor $ν\\leq 2$, well beyond the impedance of free space. Here, we apply such a high-impedance plasmon mode in a quantum-Hall plasmon resonator to demonstrate dispersive detection of a nearby charge qubit formed in a double quantum dot. The phase shift in microwave transmission through the plasmon resonator follows the dispersive shift associated with the qubit state in agreement with the cQED theory. The high impedance allows us to perform dispersive detection of qubit spectroscopy with a plasmon resonator having a broad bandwidth. Leveraging these topological edge modes, our results establish two-dimensional topological insulators as a new platform of cQED."

Our contributions are: (i) AgoraBench, a new benchmark spanning nine challenging settings (e.g., deception, monopoly) that supports diverse strategy modeling; (ii) human-aligned, economically grounded metrics derived from utility theory. This is operationalized via agent utility, negotiation power, and acquisition ratio that implicitly measure how well the negotiation aligns with human preference and (iii) a human preference grounded dataset with learning pipeline that strengthens LLMs' bargaining ability through both prompting and finetuning. Empirical results indicate that baseline LLM strategies often diverge from human preferences, while our mechanism substantially improves negotiation performance, yielding deeper strategic behavior and stronger opponent awareness."

    "abstract": "Informal and privatized transit services, such as minibuses and shared auto-rickshaws, are integral to daily travel in large urban metropolises, providing affordable commutes where a formal public transport system is inadequate and other options are unaffordable. Despite the crucial role that these services play in meeting mobility needs, governments often do not account for these services or their underlying incentives when planning transit systems, which can significantly compromise system efficiency. Against this backdrop, we develop a framework to analyze the incentives underlying informal and privatized transit systems, while proposing mechanisms to guide public transit operation and incentive design when a substantial share of mobility is provided by such profit-driven private operators. We introduce a novel, analytically tractable game-theoretic model of a fully privatized informal transit system with a fixed menu of routes, in which profit-maximizing informal operators (drivers) decide where to provide service and cost-minimizing commuters (riders) decide whether to use these services. Within this framework, we establish tight price of anarchy bounds which demonstrate that decentralized, profit-maximizing driver behavior can lead to bounded yet substantial losses in cumulative driver profit and rider demand served. We further show that these performance losses can be mitigated through targeted interventions, including Stackelberg routing mechanisms in which a modest share of drivers are centrally controlled, reflecting environments where informal operators coexist with public transit, and cross-subsidization schemes that use route-specific tolls or subsidies to incentivize drivers to operate on particular routes. Finally, we reinforce these findings through numerical experiments based on a real-world informal transit system in Nalasopara, India."

    "abstract": "Driven by scaling laws, recommender systems increasingly rely on large-scale models to capture complex feature interactions and user behaviors, but this trend also leads to prohibitive training and inference costs. While long-sequence models(e.g., LONGER) can reuse user-side computation through KV caching, such reuse is difficult in dense feature interaction architectures(e.g., RankMixer), where user and group (candidate item) features are deeply entangled across layers. In this work, we propose User-Group Separation (UG-Sep), a novel framework that enables reusable user-side computation in dense interaction models for the first time. UG-Sep introduces a masking mechanism that explicitly disentangles user-side and item-side information flows within token-mixing layers, ensuring that a subset of tokens to preserve purely user-side representations across layers. This design enables corresponding token computations to be reused across multiple samples, significantly reducing redundant inference cost. To compensate for potential expressiveness loss induced by masking, we further propose an Information Compensation strategy that adaptively reconstructs suppressed user-item interactions. Moreover, as UG-Sep substantially reduces user-side FLOPs and exposes memory-bound components, we incorporate W8A16 (8-bit weight, 16-bit activation) weight-only quantization to alleviate memory bandwidth bottlenecks and achieve additional acceleration. We conduct extensive offline evaluations and large-scale online A/B experiments at ByteDance, demonstrating that UG-Sep reduces inference latency by up to 20 percent without degrading online user experience or commercial metrics across multiple business scenarios, including feed recommendation and advertising systems."

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) demand substantial computational and memory resources, posing challenges for efficient deployment. Two complementary approaches have emerged to address these issues: token-adaptive layer execution, which reduces floating-point operations (FLOPs) by selectively bypassing layers, and quantization, which lowers memory footprint by reducing weight precision. However, naively integrating these techniques leads to additional accuracy degradation due to reduced redundancy in token-adaptive models. We propose QTALE (Quantization-Robust Token-Adaptive Layer Execution for LLMs), a novel framework that enables seamless integration of token-adaptive execution with quantization while preserving accuracy. Conventional token-adaptive methods reduce redundancy in two ways: (1) by limiting the diversity of training paths explored during fine-tuning, and (2) by lowering the number of parameters actively involved in inference. To overcome these limitations, QTALE introduces two key components: (1) a training strategy that ensures diverse execution paths are actively explored during fine-tuning, and (2) a post-training mechanism that allows flexible adjustment of the execution ratio at inference to reintroduce redundancy when needed. Experimental results show that QTALE enables seamless integration of token-adaptive layer execution with quantization, showing no noticeable accuracy difference, with the gap to quantization-only models kept below 0.5% on CommonsenseQA benchmarks. By combining token-adaptive execution for FLOPs reduction and quantization for memory savings, QTALE provides an effective solution for efficient LLM deployment."

    "abstract": "Policy-based Reinforcement Learning (RL) has established itself as the dominant paradigm in generative recommendation for optimizing sequential user interactions. However, when applied to offline historical logs, these methods suffer a critical failure: the dominance of low-quality data induces severe model collapse. We first establish the Divergence Theory of Repulsive Optimization, revealing that negative gradient updates inherently trigger exponential intensity explosion during off-policy training. This theory elucidates the inherent dilemma of existing methods, exposing their inability to reconcile variance reduction and noise imitation. To break this curse, we argue that the solution lies in rigorously identifying the latent high-quality distribution entangled within the noisy behavior policy. Accordingly, we reformulate the objective as an Optimistic Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) problem. Guided by this formulation, we propose Distributionally Robust Policy Optimization (DRPO). We prove that hard filtering is the exact solution to this DRO objective, enabling DRPO to optimally recover high-quality behaviors while strictly discarding divergence-inducing noise. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DRPO achieves state-of-the-art performance on mixed-quality recommendation benchmarks."

Protein sequences, in particular, exemplify this structure, yet most generative artificial intelligence models implicitly assume a homogeneous data distribution. We show that this assumption fundamentally breaks down in heterogeneous biological sequence spaces: fixed global noise levels impose a destructive trade-off, either oversmoothing dense functional clusters or fragmenting sparse regions and producing non-functional hallucinations. To address this limitation, we introduce \\emph{Density-Dependent Smoothing} (DDS), a geometry-aware generative framework that adapts stochastic smoothing to the local density of the underlying sequence landscape. By inversely coupling diffusion noise to estimated sequence density, DDS enables gentle refinement in high-density functional regions while promoting controlled exploration across sparse regions. Implemented as a plug-in mechanism for discrete molecular sampling, DDS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion and autoregressive models across antibody repertoires, therapeutic antibody design, antimicrobial peptide generation and coronavirus antibody design. Together, these results show that fixed global smoothing assumptions fundamentally limit generative modeling in sparse biological sequence spaces, and that geometry-aware smoothing removes this constraint, enabling reliable exploration and design previously unattainable with fixed-noise generative models."

    "abstract": "Large Language Models are rapidly becoming core components of modern software development workflows, yet ensuring code security remains challenging. Existing vulnerability detection pipelines either rely on static analyzers or use LLM/GNN-based detectors trained with coarse program-level supervision. Both families often require complete context, provide sparse end-of-completion feedback, and can degrade as code length grows, making them ill-suited for real-time, prefix-level assessment during interactive coding and streaming generation. We propose SecCodePRM, a security-oriented process reward model that assigns a context-aware, step-level security score along a code trajectory. To train the model, we derive step-level supervision labels from static analyzers and expert annotations, allowing the model to attend more precisely to fine-grained regions associated with inter-procedural vulnerabilities. SecCodePRM has three applications: full-code vulnerability detection (VD), partial-code VD, and secure code generation (CG). For VD, SecCodePRM uses risk-sensitive aggregation that emphasizes high-risk steps; for CG, SecCodePRM supports inference-time scaling by ranking candidate continuations and favoring higher cumulative reward. This design yields dense, real-time feedback that scales to long-horizon generation. Empirically, SecCodePRM outperforms prior approaches in all three settings, while preserving code functional correctness, suggesting improved security without a safety-utility tradeoff."

To this end, we propose GeoGR, a geographic generative recommendation framework tailored for navigation-based LBS like AMAP, which perceives users' contextual state changes and enables intent-aware POI recommendation. GeoGR features a two-stage design: (i) a geo-aware SID tokenization pipeline that explicitly learns spatio-temporal collaborative semantic representations via geographically constrained co-visited POI pairs, contrastive learning, and iterative refinement; and (ii) a multi-stage LLM training strategy that aligns non-native SID tokens through multiple template-based continued pre-training(CPT) and enables autoregressive POI generation via supervised fine-tuning(SFT). Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate GeoGR's superiority over state-of-the-art baselines.

We present the first mechanistic analysis of language-switching backdoors, studying the GAPperon model family (1B, 8B, 24B parameters) which contains triggers injected during pretraining that cause output language switching. Using activation patching, we localize trigger formation to early layers (7.5-25% of model depth) and identify which attention heads process trigger information. Our central finding is that trigger-activated heads substantially overlap with heads naturally encoding output language across model scales, with Jaccard indices between 0.18 and 0.66 over the top heads identified. This suggests that backdoor triggers do not form isolated circuits but instead co-opt the model's existing language components. These findings have implications for backdoor defense: detection methods may benefit from monitoring known functional components rather than searching for hidden circuits, and mitigation strategies could potentially leverage this entanglement between injected and natural behaviors."

We validate triboFoam using Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) of a fully developed turbulent channel flow at a friction Reynolds number of $Re_τ= 180$. The results demonstrate good agreement with DNS data for particle concentration profiles and charge distributions. Then, we investigate the influence of Reynolds number on particle distribution and charging behaviour using Large-Eddy Simulations (LES) at varying friction Reynolds numbers up to $Re_τ= 550$. Our findings reveal that higher Reynolds numbers lead to increased near-wall particle concentrations and enhanced charging rates, attributed to intensified turbulent fluctuations and elevated impact velocities. Finally, an empirical correlation is proposed to predict the average particle charging rate as a function of Reynolds number and particle diameter. With this work, we provide a tool for simulating triboelectric charging in complex geometries and turbulent flows, advancing the understanding of electrostatic phenomena in particle-laden systems. The empirical correlation offers practical insights for predicting charging behaviour in industrial applications and thus can contribute to improved safety and efficiency in processes involving particulate matter."

It allows us to drastically simplify and strengthen existing impossibility results by proving that any near-linear-time shortcut-based algorithm cannot reduce a graph's diameter below $n^{1/4-o(1)}$. This greatly improves over the $n^{2/9-o(1)}$ lower bound of [HXX25] and seems to be the best bound one can hope for with current techniques. Our structural criterion also precisely captures the constructiveness of all known shortcut constructions: we show that existing constructions satisfy the criterion if and only if they have known efficient algorithms. We believe our new criterion and perspective of looking for certified shortcuts can provide crucial guidance for designing efficient shortcut constructions in the future."

However, there is still a shortage in studies targeting regression tasks, and more specifically applications on hyperspectral data. In this paper, we propose a spectral-spatial contrastive learning framework for regression tasks for hyperspectral data, in a model-agnostic design allowing to enhance backbones such as 3D convolutional and transformer-based networks. Moreover, we provide a collection of transformations relevant for augmenting hyperspectral data. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets show that the proposed framework and transformations significantly improve the performance of all studied backbone models."

    "abstract": "Super-resolution (SR) applied to real-world low-resolution (LR) images often results in complex, irregular degradations that stem from the inherent complexity of natural scene acquisition. In contrast to SR artifacts arising from synthetic LR images created under well-defined scenarios, those distortions are highly unpredictable and vary significantly across different real-life contexts. Consequently, assessing the quality of SR images (SR-IQA) obtained from realistic LR, remains a challenging and underexplored problem. In this work, we introduce a no-reference SR-IQA approach tailored for such highly ill-posed realistic settings. The proposed method enables domain-adaptive IQA for real-world SR applications, particularly in data-scarce domains. We hypothesize that degradations in super-resolved images are strongly dependent on the underlying SR algorithms, rather than being solely determined by image content. To this end, we introduce a self-supervised learning (SSL) strategy that first pretrains multiple SR model oriented representations in a pretext stage. Our contrastive learning framework forms positive pairs from images produced by the same SR model and negative pairs from those generated by different methods, independent of image content. The proposed approach S3 RIQA, further incorporates targeted preprocessing to extract complementary quality information and an auxiliary task to better handle the various degradation profiles associated with different SR scaling factors. To this end, we constructed a new dataset, SRMORSS, to support unsupervised pretext training; it includes a wide range of SR algorithms applied to numerous real LR images, which addresses a gap in existing datasets. Experiments on real SR-IQA benchmarks demonstrate that S3 RIQA consistently outperforms most state-of-the-art relevant metrics."

    "abstract": "State-space language models such as Mamba and gated linear attention (GLA) offer efficient alternatives to transformers due to their linear complexity and parallel training, but often lack the expressivity and robust state-tracking needed for complex reasoning. We address these limitations by reframing sequence modelling through a probabilistic lens, using Bayesian filters as a core primitive. While classical filters such as Kalman filters provide principled state estimation and uncertainty tracking, they are typically viewed as inherently sequential. We show that reparameterising the Kalman filter in information form enables its updates to be computed via an associative scan, allowing efficient parallel training. Building on this insight, we introduce the Kalman Linear Attention (KLA) layer, a neural sequence-modelling primitive that performs time-parallel probabilistic inference while maintaining explicit belief-state uncertainty. KLA offers strictly more expressive nonlinear updates and gating than GLA variants while retaining their computational advantages. On language modelling tasks, KLA matches or outperforms modern SSMs and GLAs across representative discrete token-manipulation and state-tracking benchmarks."

    "abstract": "Active reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) can mitigate the double-fading loss of passive reflection in satellite downlinks. However, their gains are limited by random co-channel interference, gain-dependent amplifier noise, and regulatory emission constraints. This paper develops a stochastic reliability framework for active RIS-assisted satellite downlinks by modeling the desired and interfering channels, receiver noise, and RIS amplifier noise as random variables. The resulting instantaneous signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) model explicitly captures folded cascaded amplifier noise and reveals a finite high-gain SINR ceiling. To guarantee a target outage level, we formulate a chance-constrained max-SINR design that jointly optimizes the binary RIS configuration and a common amplification gain. The chance constraint is handled using a sample-average approximation (SAA) with a violation budget. The resulting feasibility problem is solved as a mixed-integer second-order cone program (MISOCP) within a bisection search over the SINR threshold. Practical implementation is enforced by restricting the gain to an admissible range determined by small-signal stability and effective isotropic radiated power (EIRP) limits. We also derive realization-wise SINR envelopes based on eigenvalue and l1-norm bounds, which provide interpretable performance limits and fast diagnostics. Monte Carlo results show that these envelopes tightly bound the simulated SINR, reproduce the predicted saturation behavior, and quantify performance degradation as interference increases. Overall, the paper provides a solver-ready, reliability-targeting design methodology whose achieved reliability is validated through out-of-sample Monte Carlo testing under realistic randomness and hardware constraints."

A historical and conceptual analysis of Einstein's use of Boltzmann's principle in those years reveals his evolving stance on its meaning and the role of probability, as well as his persistent doubts about the nature of radiation. We use our analysis to examine the limitations of extending the notion of Einstein's lightquanta across the electromagnetic spectrum: the relevant parameter is not the frequency, but the occupancy number."

Furthermore, we provide a unified hybrid-objective QSD framework that continuously interpolates between minimum-error discrimination (MED) and FitQSD, allowing flexible trade-offs among competing objectives. The associated optimization problems are formulated as convex programs and efficiently solved via disciplined convex programming or, in many cases, semidefinite programming.

    "abstract": "The rapid growth of large language model (LLM) deployments has made cost-efficient serving systems essential. Recent efforts to enhance system cost-efficiency adopt two main perspectives: (i) An algorithmic perspective that exploits heterogeneous model capabilities to route simpler queries to lower-cost models and complex queries to higher-cost models (i.e., heterogeneous query routing); and (ii) a systems perspective that utilizes heterogeneous GPU resources as cost-effective alternatives to homogeneous high-end GPUs (i.e., heterogeneous model deployment). However, algorithm-system co-design for cost-efficient LLM serving necessitates sophisticated management: (i) Determining optimal query routing strategies under latency and quality requirements, (ii) configuring model deployment across heterogeneous GPUs with appropriate resource allocation and parallelism strategies, and (iii) co-optimizing routing and deployment decisions to maximize overall system performance. To address these challenges, we present BOute, a quality-aware scheduling system that jointly exploits heterogeneous model and GPU capabilities for cost-efficient LLM serving. BOute employs a multi-objective Bayesian optimization (MOBO) framework to co-optimize the routing strategy and model deployment, thereby maximizing the cost-efficiency of the serving system while guaranteeing response quality. Evaluation results demonstrate that BOute outperforms state-of-the-art LLM serving systems by up to 157% and 59% on average under identical cost budgets and quality requirements, or reducing serving costs by 15%-61% (38% on average) while maintaining the same performance targets, validating its effectiveness in achieving cost-efficient LLM serving."

The lack of data typically results in artifacts in the reconstructed image and may even lead to object distortions. For this reason, the use of deep generative models in this context has great interest and potential success. In the Deep Generative Prior (DGP) framework, the use of diffusion-based generative models is combined with an iterative optimization algorithm for the reconstruction of CT images from sinograms acquired under sparse geometries, to maintain the explainability of a model-based approach while introducing the generative power of a neural network. There are therefore several aspects that can be further investigated within these frameworks to improve reconstruction quality, such as image generation, the model, and the iterative algorithm used to solve the minimization problem, for which we propose modifications with respect to existing approaches. The results obtained even under highly sparse geometries are very promising, although further research is clearly needed in this direction."

By employing techniques from Littlewood-Paley theory, range truncation analysis, refined Nash-Moser and De Giorgi iteration methods, we derive positive upper and lower bounds for the density. As a consequence, we are able to treat the whole-space case with strictly positive far-field density. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result that establishes global strong solutions for physically relevant compressible Navier-Stokes equations in the whole space, without imposing any symmetry or special geometric assumptions on the initial data."

    "abstract": "Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently achieved remarkable progress in robotic perception and control, yet most existing approaches primarily rely on VLM trained using 2D images, which limits their spatial understanding and action grounding in complex 3D environments. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework that integrates depth estimation into VLA models to enrich 3D feature representations. Specifically, we employ a depth estimation baseline called VGGT to extract geometry-aware 3D cues from standard RGB inputs, enabling efficient utilization of existing large-scale 2D datasets while implicitly recovering 3D structural information. To further enhance the reliability of these depth-derived features, we introduce a new module called action assistant, which constrains the learned 3D representations with action priors and ensures their consistency with downstream control tasks. By fusing the enhanced 3D features with conventional 2D visual tokens, our approach significantly improves the generalization ability and robustness of VLA models. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method not only strengthens perception in geometrically ambiguous scenarios but also leads to superior action prediction accuracy. This work highlights the potential of depth-driven data augmentation and auxiliary expert supervision for bridging the gap between 2D observations and 3D-aware decision-making in robotic systems."

Policy staleness, asynchronous training, and mismatches between training and inference engines all cause the behavior policy to diverge from the current policy, risking training collapse. Importance sampling provides a principled correction for this distribution shift but suffers from high variance; existing remedies such as token-level clipping and sequence-level normalization lack a unified theoretical foundation. We propose Variational sEquence-level Soft Policy Optimization (VESPO). By incorporating variance reduction into a variational formulation over proposal distributions, VESPO derives a closed-form reshaping kernel that operates directly on sequence-level importance weights without length normalization. Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that VESPO maintains stable training under staleness ratios up to 64x and fully asynchronous execution, and delivers consistent gains across both dense and Mixture-of-Experts models.

Another major difficulty with the projection method in this field is the lack of rigorous theoretical guarantees regarding its stability of the projection step.

The compliant silicone-magnetic composite also improves swallowability, even with a slightly larger capsule size. Magnetostatic simulations and experiments confirm that programmed NSSN/SNNS pole distributions provide strong anisotropy and reliable torque generation, enabling stable bidirectional rolling, omnidirectional steering, climbing on 7.5 degree inclines, and traversal of 5 mm protrusions. Rolling motion is sustained when the magnetic field at the capsule reaches at least 0.3 mT, corresponding to an effective actuation depth of 30 mm in our setup. Future work will optimize material composition, coating thickness, and magnetic layouts to enhance force output and durability, while next-generation robotic-arm-based field generators with closed-loop feedback will address nonlinearities and expand maneuverability.

However, the unique challenges of underwater environments pose difficulties for deep learning models, which often rely on labeled data that is scarce and noisy. This may undermine the trustworthiness of AUR software that relies on perception modules. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer promising solutions for AUR software as they generalize to unseen objects and remain robust in noisy conditions by inferring information from contextual cues. Despite this potential, their performance and uncertainty in underwater environments remain understudied from a software engineering perspective. Motivated by the needs of an industrial partner in assurance and risk management for maritime systems to assess the potential use of VLMs in this context, we present an empirical evaluation of VLM-based perception modules within the AUR software. We assess their ability to detect underwater trash by computing performance, uncertainty, and their relationship, to enable software engineers to select appropriate VLMs for their AUR software."

    "abstract": "The concept of quantum tokens dates back alongside quantum cryptography to Stephen Wiesner's seminal work in 1983[1]. Already this initial work proposes society-relevant applications such as secure quantum banknotes, which can be exchanged between a bank and a customer. This quantum currency is based on various physical states that can be easily verified but is protected from being copied by the fundamental quantum laws. Four decades later, these ideas have flourished in the field of quantum information, and the concept of quantum banknotes has not only adopted many varying names, such as quantum money, quantum coins, quantum-digital payments, and quantum tokens, but also reached its first experimental demonstrations. In this perspective article, we discuss the current state-of-the-art of quantum tokens in the field of quantum information, as well as their future perspectives. We present a number of physical realizations of quantum tokens with integrated quantum memories and their applicability scenarios in detail. Finally, we discuss how quantum tokens fit into the information security ecosystem and consider their relationship to post-quantum cryptography."

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning for large language models suffers from high-variance token-level importance sampling (IS) ratios, which would destabilize policy optimization at scale. To improve stability, recent methods typically use a fixed sequence-level IS ratio for all tokens in a sequence or adjust each token's IS ratio separately, thereby neglecting temporal off-policy derivation across tokens in a sequence. In this paper, we first empirically identify that local off-policy deviation is structurally inconsistent at the token level, which may distort policy-gradient updates across adjacent tokens and lead to training collapse. To address the issue, we propose Online Causal Kalman Filtering for stable and effective Policy Optimization (KPO). Concretely, we model the desired IS ratio as a latent state that evolves across tokens and apply a Kalman filter to update this state online and autoregressively based on the states of past tokens, regardless of future tokens. The resulting filtered IS ratios preserve token-wise local structure-aware variation while strongly smoothing noise spikes, yielding more stable and effective policy updates. Experimentally, KPO achieves superior results on challenging math reasoning datasets compared with state-of-the-art counterparts."

This picture can break down for multivalent electrolytes, where strong ion-urface correlations and charge inversion modify transport behavior. Here, we study NaCl and CaCl$_2$ conduction through negatively charged silica nanopores using atomistic molecular dynamics simulations with scaled-charge ion models. By separating concentration and velocity contributions to the radial particle current density, we connect static adsorption to dynamic perm-selectivity. While NaCl exhibits conventional cation selectivity, CaCl$_2$ shows nearly bulk-like or even anion-favored transport due to Ca$^{2+}$ immobilization near the surface and dominant Cl$^-$ conduction in the pore interior following charge inversion. Although this qualitative mechanism is robust, its detailed manifestation depends sensitively on the balance of ion-surface and ion-water interactions encoded in the force field."

The idea comes from the wide literature concerning exponential polynomials that preserve exponential functions: here, the exponential weights are replaced by logarithmic ones and the corresponding operators preserve the logarithmic functions. The pointwise, the uniform and the $L^p$ convergence are first established. Then, a Voronovskaja-type asymptotic formula is derived: from it, a second-order differential operator naturally arises, allowing the characterization of the corresponding saturation class. Finally, quantitative estimates for the order of approximation are provided in the continuous case, in terms of the modulus of continuity, and, in the $L^p$ case, by means of suitable $K$-functionals."

    "abstract": "Imitation Learning (IL) enables robots to learn complex skills from demonstrations without explicit task modeling, but it typically requires large amounts of demonstrations, creating significant collection costs. Prior work has investigated using flow as an intermediate representation to enable the use of human videos as a substitute, thereby reducing the amount of required robot demonstrations. However, most prior work has focused on the flow, either on the object or on specific points of the robot/hand, which cannot describe the motion of interaction. Meanwhile, relying on flow to achieve generalization to scenarios observed only in human videos remains limited, as flow alone cannot capture precise motion details. Furthermore, conditioning on scene observation to produce precise actions may cause the flow-conditioned policy to overfit to training tasks and weaken the generalization indicated by the flow. To address these gaps, we propose SFCrP, which includes a Scene Flow prediction model for Cross-embodiment learning (SFCr) and a Flow and Cropped point cloud conditioned Policy (FCrP). SFCr learns from both robot and human videos and predicts any point trajectories. FCrP follows the general flow motion and adjusts the action based on observations for precision tasks. Our method outperforms SOTA baselines across various real-world task settings, while also exhibiting strong spatial and instance generalization to scenarios seen only in human videos."

Building upon the efficient YOLOv11n architecture, we propose a deployment-ready pipeline that improves detection under challenging conditions including occlusion, small object size, low resolution, motion blur, and poor lighting commonly found in existing CCTV infrastructures. Our approach introduces a domain-specific augmentation strategy that synthesizes realistic child placements using spatial perturbations such as partial visibility, truncation, and overlaps, combined with photometric degradations including lighting variation and noise. To improve recall of small and partially occluded instances, we integrate Slicing Aided Hyper Inference (SAHI) at inference time. All components are trained and evaluated on a filtered, child-only subset of the Roboflow Daycare dataset. Compared to the baseline YOLOv11n, our enhanced system achieves a mean Average Precision at 0.5 IoU (mAP@0.5) of 0.967 and a mean Average Precision averaged over IoU thresholds from 0.5 to 0.95 (mAP@0.5:0.95) of 0.783, yielding absolute improvements of 0.7 percent and 2.3 percent, respectively, without architectural changes. Importantly, the entire pipeline maintains compatibility with low-power edge devices and supports real-time performance, making it particularly well suited for low-cost or resource-constrained industrial surveillance deployments.

The effective Hamiltonian for microwave-optical (MO) squeezing is formulated via strong interactions in the microwave-intermediary-optical hybrid system, and based on which rigorous solutions for the dynamics of MO entanglement and quantum steering are derived analytically. Remarkably, it is found that stable MO quantum resources can survive in the unsteady evolution beyond the steady one, and the unsteady evolution can exhibit the enhanced quality over the limit of quantum resources in the steady-state case. Furthermore, the stable MO entanglement as well as one-way and two-way quantum steerings are efficiently controllable by modulating the effective coupling strength. The validity of our theory is demonstrated by applying it to the typical models of electro-optomechanical and cavity optomagnomechanical hybrid systems."

    "abstract": "Astrophysical black holes are embedded in surrounding dark and baryonic matter that can measurably perturb the spacetime. We construct a self-consistent spacetime describing a slowly rotating black hole embedded in an external matter distribution, modeling the surrounding dark matter halo as an anisotropic fluid. Working within the slow-rotation approximation, we capture leading-order spin and frame-dragging effects while retaining analytic transparency. We show that the presence and rotation of the halo induce distinct deviations from the vacuum black hole geometry, modifying inertial frame dragging, equatorial circular geodesics, the light ring, the innermost stable circular orbit, and radial and vertical epicyclic frequencies. These effects produce systematic shifts in orbital constants of motion and the locations of epicyclic resonances. In particular, the epicyclic frequency ratios develop nonmonotonic behavior, such as local minima. We further demonstrate that these features depend on the angular velocity of the surrounding fluid, reflecting the interplay between environmental gravity and frame dragging. Our results demonstrate that environmental and rotational effects can leave observable imprints on precision strong-field probes, particularly extreme mass-ratio inspirals, where small corrections accumulate over many orbital cycles. This work provides a minimal and extensible framework for incorporating realistic astrophysical environments into strong-field tests of gravity with future space-based gravitational-wave detectors."

However, generating these labels is challenging because campaigns use creative, thematic language that does not directly map to product purchases. Without clear product-level attribution, supervised learning for campaign optimization remains limited. We present \\textbf{Campaign-2-PT-RAG}, a scalable label generation framework that constructs user--campaign purchase labels by inferring which product types (PTs) each campaign promotes. The framework first interprets campaign content using large language models (LLMs) to capture implicit intent, then retrieves candidate PTs through semantic search over the platform taxonomy. A structured LLM-based classifier evaluates each PT's relevance, producing a campaign-specific product coverage set. User purchases matching these PTs generate positive training labels for downstream ranking models. This approach reframes the ambiguous attribution problem into a tractable semantic alignment task, enabling scalable and consistent supervision for downstream tasks such as campaign ranking optimization in production e-commerce environments. Experiments on internal and synthetic datasets, validated against expert-annotated campaign--PT mappings, show that our LLM-assisted approach generates high-quality labels with 78--90% precision while maintaining over 99% recall."

    "abstract": "Federated fine-tuning of on-device large language models (LLMs) mitigates privacy concerns by preventing raw data sharing. However, the intensive computational and memory demands pose significant challenges for resource-constrained edge devices. To overcome these limitations, split federated learning (SFL) emerges as a promising solution that partitions the model into lightweight client-side and compute-intensive server-side sub-models, thus offloading the primary training workload to a powerful server. Nevertheless, high-dimensional activation exchanges in SFL lead to excessive communication overhead. To overcome this, we propose SplitCom, a communication-efficient SFL framework for LLMs that exploits temporal redundancy in activations across consecutive training epochs. Inspired by video compression, the core innovation of our framework lies in selective activation uploading only when a noticeable deviation from previous epochs occurs. To balance communication efficiency and learning performance, we introduce two adaptive threshold control schemes based on 1) bang-bang control or 2) deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG)-based reinforcement learning. Moreover, we implement dimensionality reduction techniques to alleviate client-side memory requirements. Furthermore, we extend SplitCom to the U-shape architecture, ensuring the server never accesses clients' labels. Extensive simulations and laboratory experiments demonstrate that SplitCom reduces uplink communication costs by up to 98.6\\,\\% in its standard configuration and total communication costs by up to 95.8\\,\\% in its U-shape variant without noticeably compromising model performance."

    "abstract": "Recent advances in 3D Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) built on Large Language Models (LLMs) have established the alignment of 3D visual features with LLM representations as the dominant paradigm. However, the inherited Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) introduces limitations for multimodal processing. Specifically, applying 1D temporal positional indices disrupts the continuity of visual features along the column dimension, resulting in spatial locality loss. Moreover, RoPE follows the prior that temporally closer image tokens are more causally related, leading to long-term decay in attention allocation and causing the model to progressively neglect earlier visual tokens as the sequence length increases. To address these issues, we propose C^2RoPE, an improved RoPE that explicitly models local spatial Continuity and spatial Causal relationships for visual processing. C^2RoPE introduces a spatio-temporal continuous positional embedding mechanism for visual tokens. It first integrates 1D temporal positions with Cartesian-based spatial coordinates to construct a triplet hybrid positional index, and then employs a frequency allocation strategy to encode spatio-temporal positional information across the three index components. Additionally, we introduce Chebyshev Causal Masking, which determines causal dependencies by computing the Chebyshev distance of image tokens in 2D space. Evaluation results across various benchmarks, including 3D scene reasoning and 3D visual question answering, demonstrate C^2RoPE's effectiveness.

Clinical EEG recordings exceed LLM context windows, requiring extreme compression (400:1+ ratios) that destroys fine-grained temporal precision. A 0.5 Hz error distinguishes absence epilepsy from Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. LLMs lack inherent time-series comprehension and rely on statistical associations from compressed representations. This dual limitation causes systems to hallucinate clinically incorrect measurement values. We separate measurement extraction from text generation. Our hybrid architecture computes exact clinical values via signal processing before compression, employs a cross-modal bridge for EEG-to-language translation, and uses parameter-efficient fine-tuning with constrained decoding around frozen slots. Multirate sampling maintains long-range context while preserving event-level precision. Evaluation on TUH and CHB-MIT datasets achieves 60% fewer false alarms, 50% faster detection, and sub-clinical measurement precision. This is the first system guaranteeing clinical measurement accuracy in automated EEG reports."

    "abstract": "Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) can substantially improve spectral, hardware, and energy efficiency by unifying radar sensing and data communications. In wideband and scattering-rich environments, clutter often dominates weak target reflections and becomes a fundamental bottleneck for reliable sensing. Practical ISAC clutter includes \"cold\" clutter arising from environmental backscatter of the probing waveform, and \"hot\" clutter induced by external interference and reflections from the environment whose statistics can vary rapidly over time. In this article, we develop a unified wideband multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) signal model that captures both clutter types across the space, time, and frequency domains. Building on this model, we review clutter characterization at multiple levels, including amplitude statistics, robust spherically invariant random vector (SIRV) modeling, and structured covariance representations suitable for limited-snapshot regimes. We then summarize receiver-side suppression methods in the temporal and spatial domains, together with extensions to space-time adaptive processing (STAP) and space-frequency-time adaptive processing (SFTAP), and we provide guidance on selecting techniques under different waveform and interference conditions. To move beyond reactive suppression, we discuss clutter-aware transceiver co-design that couples beamforming and waveform optimization with practical communication quality-of-service (QoS) constraints to enable proactive clutter avoidance. We conclude with open challenges and research directions toward environment-adaptive and clutter-resilient ISAC for next-generation networks."

Standard machine learning intuition suggests that training with more unique training samples yields better generalization. Counterintuitively, we show that SFT benefits from repetition: under a fixed update budget, training for more epochs on smaller datasets outperforms single-epoch training on larger datasets. On AIME'24/25 and GPQA benchmarks, Olmo3-7B trained for 128 epochs on 400 samples outperforms the equivalent 1 epoch on 51200 samples by 12-26 percentage points, with no additional catastrophic forgetting. We find that training token accuracy reliably signals when repetition has saturated; improvements from additional epochs plateau at full memorization, a pattern consistent across all settings. These findings provide a practical approach for reasoning SFT, where scaling epochs with token accuracy as a stopping criterion can replace expensive undirected data scaling. We pose the repetition advantage, where full memorization coincides with improved generalization, as a new open problem for the community in understanding the training dynamics of large language models."

We demonstrate a novel spectroscopy method for fixed-frequency transmons based on multilevel relaxation: repeated preparation of the second excited state and simultaneous $T_1$ extraction of the first and second excited states reveals characteristic correlations in the decay rates of adjacent transitions. From these correlations we identify one or more dominant TLSs and reconstruct their frequency drift over time. Remarkably, we find that TLSs detuned by $\\gtrsim 100\\,\\mathrm{MHz}$ from the qubit transition can still significantly influence relaxation. The proposed method provides a powerful tool for TLS spectroscopy without the need to tune the transmon frequency, either via a flux-tunable inductor or AC-Stark shifts."

    "abstract": "We study the \\textit{min-sum uniform coverage} problem for a swarm of $n$ mobile robots on a given finite line segment and on a circle having finite positive radius, where the circle is given as an input. The robots must coordinate their movements to reach a uniformly spaced configuration that minimizes the total distance traveled by all robots. The robots are autonomous, anonymous, identical, and homogeneous, and operate under the \\textit{Look-Compute-Move} (LCM) model with \\textit{non-rigid} motion controlled by a fair asynchronous scheduler. They are oblivious and silent, possessing neither persistent memory nor a means of explicit communication. In the \\textbf{line-segment setting}, the \\textit{min-sum uniform coverage} problem requires placing the robots at uniformly spaced points along the segment so as to minimize the total distance traveled by all robots. In the \\textbf{circle setting} for this problem, the robots have to arrange themselves uniformly around the given circle to form a regular $n$-gon. There is no fixed orientation or designated starting vertex, and the goal is to minimize the total distance traveled by all the robots. We present a deterministic distributed algorithm that achieves uniform coverage in the line-segment setting with minimum total movement cost. For the circle setting, we characterize all initial configurations for which the \\textit{min-sum uniform coverage} problem is deterministically unsolvable under the considered robot model. For all the other remaining configurations, we provide a deterministic distributed algorithm that achieves uniform coverage while minimizing the total distance traveled. These results characterize the deterministic solvability of min-sum coverage for oblivious robots and achieve optimal cost whenever solvable."

However, existing critics are primarily trained in general visual domains such as captioning or image question answering, leaving physical AI tasks involving perception, causal reasoning, and planning largely underexplored. We introduce PhyCritic, a multimodal critic model optimized for physical AI through a two-stage RLVR pipeline: a physical skill warmup stage that enhances physically oriented perception and reasoning, followed by self-referential critic finetuning, where the critic generates its own prediction as an internal reference before judging candidate responses, improving judgment stability and physical correctness. Across both physical and general-purpose multimodal judge benchmarks, PhyCritic achieves strong performance gains over open-source baselines and, when applied as a policy model, further improves perception and reasoning in physically grounded tasks."

    "abstract": "This work investigates the Floquet dynamics of electrons and excitons (particle-hole pairs) in a Dirac material referred to as Kekulé-distorted graphene. Specifically, we examine the role played by a high frequency driving electromagnetic field on the tunneling and blocking by a potential barrier on both the charged single particles as well as the neutral composite particles. We demonstrate that the small effective masses of the electron and hole for the energy spectrum of this Kekulé distorted graphene leads to practically almost perfect transmission across a symmetric potential barrier for any angle of incidence of impinging excitons. However, this unexpected Klein paradox for excitons does not hold for the single-particle electrons. The reduced total transmission of electron due to Kekulé distortion is more suppressed due to irradiation. Additionally, we calculate and investigate the exciton binding energy since the quantum tunneling of a bound electron-hole pair across a potential barrier is governed by its mass measured in the center of mass and binding energy of the composite pair. Thus, irradiation with circularly polarized light fundamentally modifies exciton formation, coherence and transport properties, thereby producing unusual topological behaviors. These behaviors are unlike conventional Dirac materials. Possible technical applications of the results arising from our investigation include valleytronics due to the folding of the valleys, thereby making intervalley coupling feasible. Other practical applications include optoelectronics due to Floquet tuning of energy spectrum and transport properties."

Distinct situations where this symmetry is broken are typically grouped under the umbrella term \"nonreciprocity\", colloquially defined by: the action of A on B $\\neq$ the action of B on A. In this review, we elucidate what nonreciprocity is by providing an introduction to its most salient classes: nonvariational dynamics, violations of Newton's third law, broken detailed balance, nonreciprocal responses and nonreciprocity of arbitrary linear operators. Next, we point out where to find these manifestations of non-reciprocity, from ensembles of particles with field mediated interactions to synthetic neural networks and open quantum systems. Given this breadth of contexts and the lack of an all-encompassing definition, it makes it all the more intriguing that some general conclusions can be gathered, when distinct definitions of nonreciprocity overlap. We explore what these universal consequences are with a special emphasis on collective phenomena that arise in nonreciprocal many-body systems. The topics covered include nonreciprocal phase transitions and non-normal amplification of noise and perturbations. We conclude with some open questions."

A key challenge is the scarcity of evaluation testbeds that combine the complexity of software development with the need for deep multimodal understanding. Game development provides such a testbed as agents must navigate large, dense codebases while manipulating intrinsically multimodal assets such as shaders, sprites, and animations within a visual game scene. We present GameDevBench, the first benchmark for evaluating agents on game development tasks. GameDevBench consists of 132 tasks derived from web and video tutorials. Tasks require significant multimodal understanding and are complex -- the average solution requires over three times the amount of lines of code and file changes compared to prior software development benchmarks. Agents still struggle with game development, with the best agent solving only 54.5% of tasks. We find a strong correlation between perceived task difficulty and multimodal complexity, with success rates dropping from 46.9% on gameplay-oriented tasks to 31.6% on 2D graphics tasks. To improve multimodal capability, we introduce two simple image and video-based feedback mechanisms for agents. Despite their simplicity, these methods consistently improve performance, with the largest change being an increase in Claude Sonnet 4.5's performance from 33.3% to 47.7%. We release GameDevBench publicly to support further research into agentic game development."

MerLin integrates optimized strong simulation of linear optical circuits into standard PyTorch and scikit learn workflows, enabling end to end differentiable training of quantum layers. MerLin is designed around systematic benchmarking and reproducibility. As an initial contribution, we reproduce eighteen state of the art photonic and hybrid QML works spanning kernel methods, reservoir computing, convolutional and recurrent architectures, generative models, and modern training paradigms. These reproductions are released as reusable, modular experiments that can be directly extended and adapted, establishing a shared experimental baseline consistent with empirical benchmarking methodologies widely adopted in modern artificial intelligence. By embedding photonic quantum models within established machine learning ecosystems, MerLin allows practitioners to leverage existing tooling for ablation studies, cross modality comparisons, and hybrid classical quantum workflows. The framework already implements hardware aware features, allowing tests on available quantum hardware while enabling exploration beyond its current capabilities, positioning MerLin as a future proof co design tool linking algorithms, benchmarks, and hardware."

However, practical offline datasets often contain examples with little diversity or limited exploration of the environment, and from multiple behavior policies with diverse expertise levels. Limited exploration can impair the offline RL algorithm's ability to estimate \\textit{Q} or \\textit{V} values, while constraining towards diverse behavior policies can be overly conservative. Such datasets call for a balance between the RL objective and behavior policy constraints. We first identify the connection between $f$-divergence and optimization constraint on the Bellman residual through a more general Linear Programming form for RL and the convex conjugate. Following this, we introduce the general flexible function formulation for the $f$-divergence to incorporate an adaptive constraint on algorithms' learning objectives based on the offline training dataset. Results from experiments on the MuJoCo, Fetch, and AdroitHand environments show the correctness of the proposed LP form and the potential of the flexible $f$-divergence in improving performance for learning from a challenging dataset when applied to a compatible constrained optimization algorithm."

However, there is still no general prescription on how long-range physical effects should be incorporated into the model while preserving well-established locality principles underlying most transferable ML representations. Here, we provide a physical perspective on the problem, by discussing how distinct contributions to the system's electrostatics can be captured through the adoption of different learning paradigms. Specifically, we discern between local charge models, which rely either on explicit charge-density decompositions or implicit auxiliary variables, and models where a notion of nonlocality is deliberately introduced, either via self-consistent procedures or by using nonlocal descriptors and learning architectures. We further address the related aspect of incorporating finite-field effects through the coupling with the system's polarization, relevant for the application of an external electric bias. We conclude by discussing the implications for the simulation of electrochemical interfaces, where long-range electrostatics are essential to capture the interplay between charge redistribution, interfacial dynamics, and ionic screening, and for ionic transport phenomena, which, although less explored, appear far less sensitive to their inclusion."

    "abstract": "The quantum Mpemba effect is a counterintuitive phenomenon in which a state initially farther from equilibrium relaxes more rapidly than one that starts nearer to equilibrium. In the context of finite-dimensional quantum batteries interacting with an environment, we introduce the notion of an ergotropic Mpemba crossing (EMC), defined by the intersection of ergotropy trajectories during the dynamics. For qubit batteries subjected to amplitude damping noise, we derive a condition for the occurrence of EMC in terms of the relative coherence of the initial states and fully characterize the region of state space that exhibits EMC with respect to a fixed reference state. Interestingly, our analysis reveals that under anisotropic Pauli noise, the emergence of EMC is jointly governed by the coherence and the energy of the initial states. To elucidate the physical origin of EMC, we decompose ergotropy into coherent and incoherent contributions and show that, in qubit systems, the coherent component plays a crucial role for EMC, an observation that strikingly does not extend to three-level batteries. Further, by extending our analysis to non-Markovian environments, we demonstrate that, unlike the Markovian case, non-Markovian dynamics can give rise to multiple Mpemba crossings, with the total number of crossings always being odd. Moreover, analyzing the connection between the EMC and the conventional state Mpemba effect reveals that, for qubits, an EMC necessarily entails a state Mpemba crossing while this correspondence breaks down for qutrits, where EMCs may arise without any state Mpemba crossing."

    "abstract": "Ensuring safe robot operation in cluttered and dynamic environments remains a fundamental challenge. While control barrier functions provide an effective framework for real-time safety filtering, their performance critically depends on the underlying geometric representation, which is often simplified, leading to either overly conservative behavior or insufficient collision coverage. Superquadrics offer an expressive way to model complex shapes using a few primitives and are increasingly used for robot safety. To integrate this representation into collision avoidance, most existing approaches directly use their implicit functions as barrier candidates. However, we identify a critical but overlooked issue in this practice: the gradients of the implicit SQ function can become severely ill-conditioned, potentially rendering the optimization infeasible and undermining reliable real-time safety filtering. To address this issue, we formulate an SQ-based safety filtering framework that uses signed distance functions as barrier candidates. Since analytical SDFs are unavailable for general SQs, we compute distances using the efficient Gilbert-Johnson-Keerthi algorithm and obtain gradients via randomized smoothing. Extensive simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate consistent collision-free manipulation in cluttered and unstructured scenes, showing robustness to challenging geometries, sensing noise, and dynamic disturbances, while improving task efficiency in teleoperation tasks. These results highlight a pathway toward safety filters that remain precise and reliable under the geometric complexity of real-world environments."

We find that in the strong-field regime the posterior uncertainties are smaller, indicating a stronger constraining capability on the tidal heating. Using two-year signals with an optimal signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of $ρ=50$, EMRIs can put bounds on $|\\mathcal{R}|^2$ at the level of $10^{-3}$--$ 10^{-4}$ for a rapidly spinning central object. Moreover, we show that neglecting the tidal heating can induce clear systematic biases in the intrinsic parameters of the EMRI system.

Starting from a microscopic scalar-mediator theory in flat spacetime, we integrate out the massive mediator to obtain a quadratic but nonlocal effective kernel that determines the ground-state wavefunctional. The reduced density matrix for a single Rindler wedge is constructed explicitly by tracing over the complementary wedge, allowing the entanglement entropy to be evaluated directly from the kernel without replica or geometric methods. Exploiting translational invariance parallel to the horizon, the problem decomposes into independent transverse momentum sectors that reduce effectively to one-dimensional nonlocal systems and can be diagonalized analytically in the weak-coupling regime. The interaction-induced entropy obeys an area law, with leading corrections controlled by the Yukawa screening mass and logarithmically sensitive to the transverse ultraviolet cutoff, reflecting the localization of correlations near the horizon. Although the modular Hamiltonian depends on the Rindler acceleration, the entanglement spectrum and entropy are independent of this choice, demonstrating the observer-independent nature of vacuum entanglement. Our framework provides a direct and microscopically transparent approach to computing interaction-induced corrections to horizon entanglement using nonlocal effective kernels."

This opens new opportunities to gain insight into the formation channels and evolutionary pathways of compact binary systems using eccentricity.

We are now entering an era where both of these limitations are being addressed, allowing for a more comprehensive investigation of eccentric binary populations. In this work, we perform the first population inference analysis that simultaneously fits the mass, spin, redshift, and eccentricity distribution. Specifically, we use source-parameter estimation provided by the Rapid Iterative FiTting (RIFT) framework using the SEOBNRv5EHM waveform model, and a default O4a population model extended to include eccentricity. We find population properties broadly consistent with conclusions obtained in previous analyses assuming quasi-circular binaries. Consistent with our conclusions about each event, we bound the branching ratio for eccentric events to be below $0.0239$ at $90\\%$ confidence with our fiducial eccentricity mixture models. Using four different parametric population models for eccentricity, we point out that the rate of eccentric events is weakly constrained by observations and highly model-dependent."

    "abstract": "The move structure represents permutations with long contiguously permuted intervals in compressed space with optimal query time. They have become an important feature of compressed text indexes using space proportional to the number of Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT) runs, often applied in genomics. This is in thanks not only to theoretical improvements over past approaches, but great cache efficiency and average case query time in practice. This is true even without using the worst case guarantees provided by the interval splitting balancing of the original result. In this paper, we show that an even simpler type of splitting, length capping by truncating long intervals, bounds the average move structure query time to optimal whilst obtaining a superior construction time than the traditional approach. This also proves constant query time when amortized over a full traversal of a single cycle permutation from an arbitrary starting position. Such a scheme has surprising benefits both in theory and practice. We leverage the approach to improve the representation of any move structure with $r$ runs over a domain $n$ to $O(r \\log r + r \\log \\frac{n}{r})$-bits of space. The worst case query time is also improved to $O(\\log \\frac{n}{r})$ without balancing. An $O(r)$-time and $O(r)$-space construction lets us apply the method to run-length encoded BWT (RLBWT) permutations such as LF and $φ$ to obtain optimal-time algorithms for BWT inversion and suffix array (SA) enumeration in $O(r)$ additional working space. Finally, we provide the RunPerm library, providing flexible plug and play move structure support, and use it to evaluate our splitting approach. Experiments find length capping results in faster move structures, but also a space reduction: at least $\\sim 40\\%$ for LF across large repetitive genomic collections."

To ensure reliable evaluation, we adopt leakage-resistant time-block splits with embargo and use Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC). We find that results depend strongly on the label-noise regime: we apply an ex-post minimum-movement filter that discards samples with realized next-day absolute return below tau to define evaluation subsets with reduced near-zero label ambiguity. This induces a non-monotonic data-noise trade-off that can reveal predictive signal but eventually increases variance as sample size shrinks; the filter is used for offline benchmark construction rather than an inference-time decision rule. In the stabilized subsets, fusion is regime dependent: early fusion by channel stacking can exhibit negative transfer, whereas late fusion with dual encoders and a fusion head provides the dominant clean-performance gains; cross-view consistency regularization has secondary, backbone-dependent effects. We further evaluate test-time L-infinity perturbations using FGSM and PGD under two threat scenarios: view-constrained attacks that perturb one view and joint attacks that perturb both. We observe severe vulnerability at tiny budgets with strong view asymmetry. Late fusion consistently improves robustness under view-constrained attacks, but joint attacks remain challenging and can still cause substantial worst-case degradation."

In this work, we study unsupervised window-level insider threat detection on the CERT r4.2 dataset and show that explicitly separating activity presence from activity magnitude yields substantial performance gains. We introduce a dual-channel convolutional autoencoder that reconstructs both a binary activity mask and corresponding activity values, allowing the model to focus representational capacity on sparse behavioral structure rather than dense inactive baselines.

Previous studies have suggested a positive connection between these two populations, particularly around metal-rich stars, and proposed that nearly all CJ-hosting stars may also harbor inner SEs. In this work, we use TESS transits to investigate the occurrence of hot SEs in systems with known CJs detected by radial velocity (RV). Out of a statistical sample of 132 CJ systems, we identify five transiting hot super-Earths ($1$-$4R_\\oplus$, $P<10\\mathrm{d}$) around four stars, including one new candidate (TOI-6965.01) around HD 50554. To enable statistical analysis, we first validate the two candidates around HD 50554 using TESS photometry, archival RV measurements, and Gaia astrometry. After accounting for detection sensitivity and geometric transit probability, we find that the presence of CJs enhances the occurrence rate of hot super-Earths by a factor of $8.1^{+4.3}_{-3.2}$ relative to field stars, with the case of no enhancement ruled out at the 99.9% confidence level. Taking into account the average multiplicity of hot SEs, we find that about 87% of CJ systems host at least one hot SE. Our results provide strong supporting evidence for a positive SE-CJ correlation. We also briefly explore the correlation around metal-poor hosts and for specific sub-populations (e.g., warm super-Earths or cold super-Jupiters)."

    "abstract": "Unidentified Falling Objects (UFOs) refer to sporadic beam losses observed during LHC operation. The prevailing explanation is that micrometer-sized dust particles released from the beam screen produce beam losses through interactions with the protons. However, the release mechanism of these particles remains unknown. We propose that roughly $(1-10)$% of UFOs may be caused by axion quark nuggets (AQNs), macroscopic dark matter (DM) candidates with masses of order $(5-1000)\\,$g. The AQN model naturally relates the dark- and visible-matter abundances ($Ω_\\mathrm{DM}\\simΩ_\\mathrm{visible}$) and provides a mechanism for generating the baryon-antibaryon asymmetry, with DM composed of both matter and antimatter AQNs. When passing underground within approximately 100km of the LHC, an antimatter AQN generates acoustic waves strong enough to trigger multiple UFO events within $2\\,$s. If three correlated UFOs (placed at different locations along the LHC ring) are detected, the signal-to-noise ratio can exceed 5 across the entire allowed AQN mass range for a measurement time of about 360 hours. Practically, the LHC can serve as a large broadband acoustic detector for AQNs."

    "abstract": "The coexistence of terrestrial networks (TN) and non-terrestrial networks (NTN) in the frequency range 3 (FR3) upper mid-band presents considerable interference concerns, as dense TN deployments can severely degrade NTN downlink performance. Existing studies rely on interference-nulling beamforming, precoding, or exclusion zones that require accurate channel state information (CSI) and static coordination, making them unsuitable for dynamic NTN scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we develop an optimization framework that jointly controls TN downlink power, uplink power, and antenna downtilt to protect NTN links while preserving terrestrial performance. The resultant non-convex coupling between TN and NTN parameters is addressed by a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)-based reinforcement learning method that develops adaptive power and tilt control strategies. Simulation results demonstrate a reduction up to 8 dB in the median interference-to-noise ratio (INR) while maintaining over 87% TN basestation activity, outperforming conventional baseline methods and validating the feasibility of the proposed strategy for FR3 coexistence."

In this work we provide an explicit quantum circuit for block encoding a sparse matrix with a periodic diagonal structure. The proposed methodology is based on the linear combination of unitaries (LCU) framework and on an efficient unitary operator used to project the complex exponential at a frequency $ω$ multiplied by the computational basis into its real and imaginary components. We demonstrate a distinct computational advantage with a $\\mathcal{O}(\\text{poly}(n))$ gate complexity, where $n$ is the number of qubits, in the worst-case scenario used for banded matrices, and $\\mathcal{O}(n)$ when dealing with a simple diagonal matrix, compared to the exponential scaling of general-purpose methods for dense matrices. Various applications for the presented methodology are discussed in the context of solving differential problems such as the advection-diffusion-reaction (ADR) dynamics, using quantum algorithms with optimal scaling, e.g., quantum singular value transformation (QSVT). Numerical results are used to validate the analytical formulation."

    "abstract": "Scientific knowledge has become central to policymaking as societies face challenges related to technological change, climate risk, and public health. Despite the growing emphasis on evidence-based policy, a systematic understanding of how science is selectively used in policy, specifically which forms of knowledge are preferred and which scientific citations translate into influence, remains limited. We address these questions by constructing a novel dataset that links policy documents from the Overton database with publications from the American Physical Society, enabling an analysis of how physics knowledge enters and circulates in policy discourse. Using subfield classifications, we provide quantitative evidence for a gap between scientific communities and policymakers. First, we find that policy documents draw on broad and interdisciplinary areas of physics, such as General Physics and Interdisciplinary Physics, rather than mirroring the structure of physics research production. Second, we identify substantial institutional heterogeneity with systematic differences in subfield preferences across policy producing organizations and topics. Third, network analysis reveals that interdisciplinary areas of physics act as a central bridge connecting specialized subfields. Finally, regression analysis reveals a clear separation between policy visibility and policy influence. While interdisciplinary areas facilitate entry into policy discourse, it does not necessarily increase downstream policy influence. Conversely, documents citing geophysics are associated with approximately 24 percent higher policy influence, likely driven by the political salience of climate change policy. Our findings underscore the distinction between scientific visibility and policy influence, contributing to a deeper understanding of the complex relationship between scientific communities and policy system."

To mitigate the combinatorial explosion induced by the semantic relaxation of queries, our method is built on two key algorithmic ideas: fast exact lookup enabled by a disk-aware design, and dynamic corpus-aware pruning. We theoretically show that the proposed method suppresses exponential growth in the search space with respect to query length by leveraging statistical properties of natural language. In experiments on FineWeb-Edu (Lozhkov et al., 2024) (1.4T tokens), we show that our method achieves significantly lower search latency than existing methods: infini-gram (Liu et al., 2024), infini-gram mini (Xu et al., 2025), and SoftMatcha (Deguchi et al., 2025). As a practical application, we demonstrate that our method identifies benchmark contamination in training corpora, unidentified by existing approaches.

UAVs equipped with gimballed electro-optical sensors are typically used to localize targets, however, reliance on these sensors increases mechanical complexity, cost, and susceptibility to single-point failures, limiting scalability and robustness in multi-UAV operations. This work presents a new trajectory optimization framework that enables cooperative target localization using UAVs with fixed, non-gimballed cameras operating in coordination with a surface vessel. This estimation-aware optimization generates dynamically feasible trajectories that explicitly account for mission constraints, platform dynamics, and out-of-frame events. Estimation-aware trajectories outperform heuristic paths by reducing localization error by more than a factor of two, motivating their use in cooperative operations. Results further demonstrate that coordinated UAVs with fixed, non-gimballed cameras achieve localization accuracy that meets or exceeds that of single gimballed systems, while substantially lowering system complexity and cost, enabling scalability, and enhancing mission resilience."

The work provides a systematic analysis of the architectural patterns based on more than twenty recent research works and the existing standards, and it proposes a layered security architecture. The architecture includes the hardware rooted trust at peripheral level, the zero trust principles at network level, and the semantic security mechanisms at application level. The framework focuses on practical implementation aspects such as the performance overhead, interoperability requirements, and the compliance with new regulations, which are very important for the real IoT deployments. The paper reports quantitative metrics which include the cryptographic performance on Cortex-M class microcontrollers with the detection accuracy rates and the energy consumption values. The proposed architecture shows that cross-layer security integration can provide defense in depth while it still satisfies the constraints of resource-limited IoT environments.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into software systems, giving rise to a new class of systems referred to as LLMware. Beyond traditional source-code components, LLMware embeds or interacts with LLMs that depend on other models and datasets, forming complex supply chains across open-source software (OSS), models, and datasets. However, licensing issues emerging from these intertwined dependencies remain largely unexplored. Leveraging GitHub and Hugging Face, we curate a large-scale dataset capturing LLMware supply chains, including 12,180 OSS repositories, 3,988 LLMs, and 708 datasets. Our analysis reveals that license distributions in LLMware differ substantially from traditional OSS ecosystems. We further examine license-related discussions and find that license selection and maintenance are the dominant concerns, accounting for 84% of cases. To understand incompatibility risks, we analyze license conflicts along supply chains and evaluate state-of-the-art detection approaches, which achieve only 58% and 76% F1 scores in this setting. Motivated by these limitations, we propose LiAgent, an LLM-based agent framework for ecosystem-level license compatibility analysis. LiAgent achieves an F1 score of 87%, improving performance by 14 percentage points over prior methods. We reported 60 incompatibility issues detected by LiAgent, 11 of which have been confirmed by developers. Notably, two conflicted LLMs have over 107 million and 5 million downloads on Hugging Face, respectively, indicating potentially widespread downstream impact. We conclude with implications and recommendations to support the sustainable growth of the LLMware ecosystem."

Using techniques from Network Science and Machine Learning, including Erdős-Rényi for model sparsification, we enhance the efficiency of GNNs for real-world applications. We demonstrate our approach on N-1 contingency assessment in electrical grids, a critical task for ensuring grid reliability. We apply our methods to three datasets of varying sizes, exploring Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) and Graph Isomorphism Networks (GIN) with different degrees of sparsification and rewiring. Comparison across sparsification levels shows the potential of combining insights from both research fields to improve GNN performance and scalability. Our experiments highlight the importance of tuning sparsity parameters: while sparsity can improve generalization, excessive sparsity may hinder learning of complex patterns. Our adaptive rewiring approach, particularly when combined with early stopping, proves promising by allowing the model to adapt its connectivity structure during training. This research contributes to understanding how sparsity can be effectively leveraged in GNNs for critical applications like power grid reliability analysis."

    "abstract": "Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) enables vehicle platooning through inter-vehicle communication, improving traffic efficiency and safety. Conventional CACC relies on feedback linearization, assuming exact vehicle parameters; however, longitudinal vehicle dynamics are nonlinear and subject to parametric uncertainty. Applying feedback linearization with a nominal model yields imperfect cancellation, leading to model mismatch and degraded performance with off-the-shelf CACC controllers. To improve robustness without redesigning the CACC law, we explicitly model the mismatch between the ideal closed-loop dynamics assumed by the CACC design and the actual dynamics under parametric uncertainties. Robustness is formulated as an $\\mathcal{L}_2$ trajectory-matching problem, minimizing the energy of this mismatch to make the uncertain system behave as closely as possible to the ideal model. This objective is addressed by optimizing over plant equivalent controller (PEC) realizations that preserve the nominal closed-loop behavior while mitigating the effects of parametric uncertainty. Stability and performance are enforced via linear matrix inequalities, yielding a convex optimization problem applicable to heterogeneous platoons. Experimental results demonstrate improved robustness and performance under parametric uncertainty while preserving nominal CACC behavior."

These applications depend on the KG's factual accuracy, so verifying facts is essential, yet challenging. Expert manual verification is ideal but impractical on a large scale. Automated methods show promise but are not ready for real-world KGs. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer potential with their semantic understanding and knowledge access, yet their suitability and effectiveness for KG fact validation remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce FactCheck, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs for KG fact validation across three key dimensions: (1) LLMs internal knowledge; (2) external evidence via Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG); and (3) aggregated knowledge employing a multi-model consensus strategy. We evaluated open-source and commercial LLMs on three diverse real-world KGs. FactCheck also includes a RAG dataset with 2+ million documents tailored for KG fact validation. Additionally, we offer an interactive exploration platform for analyzing verification decisions. The experimental analyses demonstrate that while LLMs yield promising results, they are still not sufficiently stable and reliable to be used in real-world KG validation scenarios. Integrating external evidence through RAG methods yields fluctuating performance, providing inconsistent improvements over more streamlined approaches -- at higher computational costs. Similarly, strategies based on multi-model consensus do not consistently outperform individual models, underscoring the lack of a one-fits-all solution. These findings further emphasize the need for a benchmark like FactCheck to systematically evaluate and drive progress on this difficult yet crucial task."

This format supports early literacy and assists individuals with reading challenges, while also allowing general readers to seamlessly switch between reading and listening. With the emergence of natural-sounding neural Text-to-Speech (TTS) technology, several commercial services have been developed to leverage these technology for converting standard text e-books into high-quality narrated e-books. However, no open-source solutions currently exist to perform this task. In this paper, we present Calliope, an open-source framework designed to fill this gap. Our method leverages state-of-the-art open-source TTS to convert a text e-book into a narrated e-book in the EPUB 3 Media Overlay format. The method offers several innovative steps: audio timestamps are captured directly during TTS, ensuring exact synchronization between narration and text highlighting; the publisher's original typography, styling, and embedded media are strictly preserved; and the entire pipeline operates offline. This offline capability eliminates recurring API costs, mitigates privacy concerns, and avoids copyright compliance issues associated with cloud-based services. The framework currently supports the state-of-the-art open-source TTS systems XTTS-v2 and Chatterbox. A potential alternative approach involves first generating narration via TTS and subsequently synchronizing it with the text using forced alignment. However, while our method ensures exact synchronization, our experiments show that forced alignment introduces drift between the audio and text highlighting significant enough to degrade the reading experience.

    "abstract": "Linear mixed-effects models are a central analytical tool for modeling hierarchical and longitudinal data, as they allow simultaneous representation of fixed and random sources of variation. In practice, inference for such models is most often based on likelihood-based approximations, which are computationally efficient, but rely on numerical integration and may be unreliable example wise in small-sample settings. In this study, the somewhat obscure four-parameter generalized beta density is shown to be usable as a conjugate prior distribution for a simple linear mixed model. This leads to a closed-form Bayesian solution for a balanced mixed-model design, representing a methodological development beyond standard approximate or simulation-based Bayesian approaches. Although the derivation is restricted to a balanced setting, the proposed framework suggests a pathway toward analytically tractable Bayesian inference for more complex mixed-model structures. The method is evaluated through comparison with a standard frequentist solution based on likelihood estimation for linear mixed-effects models. Results indicate that the Bayesian approach performs just as well as the frequentist alternative, while yielding slightly reduced mean squared error. The study further discusses the use of empirical Bayes strategies for hyperparameter specification and outlines potential directions for extending the approach beyond the balanced case."

For instance, in hyperparameter tuning, the validation accuracy of a model configuration (arm) typically increases with each training epoch. A defining characteristic of RMAB is em horizon-dependent optimality: unlike standard settings, the optimal strategy here shifts dramatically depending on the available budget $T$. This implies that knowledge of $T$ yields significantly greater utility in RMAB, empowering the learner to align its decision-making with this shifting optimality. However, the horizon-aware setting remains underexplored. To address this, we propose a novel CUmulative Reward Estimation UCB (CURE-UCB) that explicitly integrates the horizon. We provide a rigorous analysis establishing a new regret upper bound and prove that our method strictly outperforms horizon-agnostic strategies in structured environments like ``linear-then-flat'' instances. Extensive experiments demonstrate its significant superiority over baselines."

Our systematic analysis of the layer-dependent topological phases based on \\textit{ab} initio computations predicts the two-layer UOTe film to be an ideal 2D AFM Chern insulator in which the Hall conductivity is quantized with a fully compensated spin magnetization. By applying an in-plane strain or electric field, we show how the itinerancy of U-5f electrons can be manipulated to trigger a transition between the nontrivial ($C = 1$) and trivial ($C = 0$) phases. Interestingly, the 3-layer UOTe film is found to have zero charge conductance but it hosts a quantized spin Hall conductivity (SHC) with finite magneto-electric coupling, suggesting the presence of an axion insulator-like state. The unique magnetic structure of UOTe supports a layer-tunable topology in which films with an odd number of layers are axion-like insulators, while films with an even number of layers are Chern insulators, and the bulk material is a Dirac semimetal. Our study offers a new intrinsic AFM materials platform for realizing correlated topological phases for next-generation spintronics applications and fundamental science studies."

    "abstract": "This work addresses the problem of analyzing cooperation in heterogeneous multi-agent systems which operate under partial observability and temporal role dependency, framed within a destructive multi-agent foraging setting. Unlike most previous studies, which focus primarily on algorithmic performance with respect to task completion, this article proposes a systematic set of general-purpose cooperation metrics aimed at characterizing not only efficiency, but also coordination and dependency between teams and agents, fairness, and sensitivity. These metrics are designed to be transferable to different multi-agent sequential domains similar to foraging. The proposed suite of metrics is structured into three main categories that jointly provide a multilevel characterization of cooperation: primary metrics, inter-team metrics, and intra-team metrics. They have been validated in a realistic destructive foraging scenario inspired by dynamic aquatic surface cleaning using heterogeneous autonomous vehicles. It involves two specialized teams with sequential dependencies: one focused on the search of resources, and another on their destruction. Several representative approaches have been evaluated, covering both learning-based algorithms and classical heuristic paradigms."

    "abstract": "In a typical school choice application, the students have strict preferences over the schools while the schools have coarse priorities over the students based on their distance and their enrolled siblings. The outcome of a centralized admission mechanism is then usually obtained by the Deferred Acceptance (DA) algorithm with random tie-breaking. Therefore, every possible outcome of this mechanism is a stable solution for the coarse priorities that will arise with certain probability. This implies a probabilistic assignment, where the admission probability for each student-school pair is specified. In this paper, we propose a new efficiency-improving stable `smart lottery' mechanism. We aim to improve the probabilistic assignment ex-ante in a stochastic dominance sense, while ensuring that the improved random matching is still ex-post stable, meaning that it can be decomposed into stable matchings regarding the original coarse priorities. Therefore, this smart lottery mechanism can provide a clear Pareto-improvement in expectation for any cardinal utilities compared to the standard DA with lottery solution, without sacrificing the stability of the final outcome. We show that although the underlying computational problem is NP-hard, we can solve the problem by using advanced optimization techniques such as integer programming with column generation. We conduct computational experiments on generated and real instances. Our results show that the welfare gains by our mechanism are substantially larger than the expected gains by standard methods that realize efficiency improvements after ties have already been broken."

To bridge this gap, we propose TwiFF-2.7M, the first large-scale, temporally grounded VCoT dataset derived from $2.7$ million video clips, explicitly designed for dynamic visual question and answer. Accompanying this, we introduce TwiFF-Bench, a high-quality evaluation benchmark of $1,078$ samples that assesses both the plausibility of reasoning trajectories and the correctness of final answers in open-ended dynamic settings. Building on these foundations, we propose the TwiFF model, a unified modal that synergistically leverages pre-trained video generation and image comprehension capabilities to produce temporally coherent visual reasoning cues-iteratively generating future action frames and textual reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TwiFF significantly outperforms existing VCoT methods and Textual Chain-of-Thought baselines on dynamic reasoning tasks, which fully validates the effectiveness for visual question answering in dynamic scenarios.

We focus on subject and object marking determined through various permutations of nominative, ergative, and dative noun forms. A treebank-based approach for the generation of minimal pairs using the Grew query language is implemented. We create a dataset of 370 syntactic tests made up of seven tasks containing 50-70 samples each, where three noun forms are tested in any given sample. Five encoder- and two decoder-only models are evaluated with word- and/or sentence-level accuracy metrics. Regardless of the specific syntactic makeup, models performed worst in assigning the ergative case correctly and strongest in assigning the nominative case correctly. Performance correlated with the overall frequency distribution of the three forms (NOM > DAT > ERG). Though data scarcity is a known issue for low-resource languages, we show that the highly specific role of the ergative along with a lack of available training data likely contributes to poor performance on this case. The dataset is made publicly available and the methodology provides an interesting avenue for future syntactic evaluations of languages where benchmarks are limited."

However, developing reliable AI systems for autonomous vehicles remains a substantial challenge. Over the past decade, multi-task learning has emerged as a powerful approach to address complex problems in driving perception. Multi-task networks offer several advantages, including increased computational efficiency, real-time processing capabilities, optimized resource utilization, and improved generalization. In this study, we present AurigaNet, an advanced multi-task network architecture designed to push the boundaries of autonomous driving perception. AurigaNet integrates three critical tasks: object detection, lane detection, and drivable area instance segmentation. The system is trained and evaluated using the BDD100K dataset, renowned for its diversity in driving conditions. Key innovations of AurigaNet include its end-to-end instance segmentation capability, which significantly enhances both accuracy and efficiency in path estimation for autonomous vehicles. Experimental results demonstrate that AurigaNet achieves an 85.2% IoU in drivable area segmentation, outperforming its closest competitor by 0.7%. In lane detection, AurigaNet achieves a remarkable 60.8% IoU, surpassing other models by more than 30%. Furthermore, the network achieves an mAP@0.5:0.95 of 47.6% in traffic object detection, exceeding the next leading model by 2.9%. Additionally, we validate the practical feasibility of AurigaNet by deploying it on embedded devices such as the Jetson Orin NX, where it demonstrates competitive real-time performance. These results underscore AurigaNet's potential as a robust and efficient solution for autonomous driving perception systems. The code can be found here https://github.com/KiaRational/AurigaNet."

Existing methods predominately optimize memory management while treating memory extraction as a static process, resulting in poor generalization, where agents accumulate instance-specific noise rather than robust memories. To address this, we propose Unified Memory Extraction and Management (UMEM), a self-evolving agent framework that jointly optimizes a Large Language Model to simultaneous extract and manage memories. To mitigate overfitting to specific instances, we introduce Semantic Neighborhood Modeling and optimize the model with a neighborhood-level marginal utility reward via GRPO. This approach ensures memory generalizability by evaluating memory utility across clusters of semantically related queries. Extensive experiments across five benchmarks demonstrate that UMEM significantly outperforms highly competitive baselines, achieving up to a 10.67% improvement in multi-turn interactive tasks. Futhermore, UMEM maintains a monotonic growth curve during continuous evolution. Codes and models will be publicly released."

Significant $p_{\\rm T}$- and $η$-dependent fluctuations of the second-harmonic flow vector are observed with more than 5$σ$ confidence in p$-$Pb collisions, similar to the observations in Pb$-$Pb collisions. The influence of residual non-flow effects has been evaluated and cannot account for the observed fluctuations, thereby confirming the observation of flow vector fluctuations in small collision systems at the LHC. Comparisons to model calculations from 3DGlauber+MUSIC+UrQMD and the parton transport model from AMPT are also presented. The measurements provide constraints on the theoretical modelling of the three-dimensional initial geometry and its event-by-event fluctuations, offering critical insights into the origin of collective flow in small collision systems at the LHC."

This failure mode is not captured by existing VideoLLM benchmarks, which focus primarily on task accuracy and factual correctness. We introduce VideoSTF, the first framework for systematically measuring and stress-testing output repetition in VideoLLMs. VideoSTF formalizes repetition using three complementary n-gram-based metrics and provides a standardized testbed of 10,000 diverse videos together with a library of controlled temporal transformations. Using VideoSTF, we conduct pervasive testing, temporal stress testing, and adversarial exploitation across 10 advanced VideoLLMs. We find that output repetition is widespread and, critically, highly sensitive to temporal perturbations of video inputs. Moreover, we show that simple temporal transformations can efficiently induce repetitive degeneration in a black-box setting, exposing output repetition as an exploitable security vulnerability. Our results reveal output repetition as a fundamental stability issue in modern VideoLLMs and motivate stability-aware evaluation for video-language systems.

The analysis is carried out within the framework of QCD light-cone sum rules, using interpolating currents constructed from colour-singlet meson bilinears to reflect their molecular configurations. Both perturbative and non-perturbative photon contributions are included,and numerical predictions for the magnetic and electric quadrupole moments are obtained. The magnetic moments are found to lie in the range $1$--$3$ nuclear magnetons, with the largest value associated with the $D^{*}\\bar{K}$ configuration. The quadrupole moments are an order of magnitude smaller, of order $10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{fm}^{2}$, indicating only weak deviations from spherical charge distributions. A flavour decomposition shows that the magnetic response is dominated by the light quarks, while the charm-quark contribution is strongly suppressed, a feature naturally expected for loosely bound hadronic molecules. The present analysis extends QCD light-cone sum-rule studies of exotic hadrons by providing a systematic determination of the electromagnetic moments of the $D^{(\\ast)}\\bar K^{(\\ast)}$ molecular systems. These results provide quantitative benchmarks that may help discriminate between molecular configurations and more compact multiquark interpretations and may offer useful guidance for future experimental studies of electromagnetic signatures of charm--strange exotic states."

We evaluated DermFM-Zero across 20 benchmarks spanning zero-shot diagnosis and multimodal retrieval, achieving state-of-the-art performance without task-specific adaptation. We further evaluated its zero-shot capabilities in three multinational reader studies involving over 1,100 clinicians. In primary care settings, AI assistance enabled general practitioners to nearly double their differential diagnostic accuracy across 98 skin conditions. In specialist settings, the model significantly outperformed board-certified dermatologists in multimodal skin cancer assessment. In collaborative workflows, AI assistance enabled non-experts to surpass unassisted experts while improving management appropriateness. Finally, we show that DermFM-Zero's latent representations are interpretable: sparse autoencoders unsupervisedly disentangle clinically meaningful concepts that outperform predefined-vocabulary approaches and enable targeted suppression of artifact-induced biases, enhancing robustness without retraining.

For the linear system without rotation, stratification not only suppresses the lift-up effect but also exhibits certain dispersion effects, except for some points where degradation occurs, which will bring essential difficulties to nonlinear estimates. In contrast, when rotation is taken into account, we observe that this degeneracy in dispersion effects disappears; furthermore, we can derive dispersive estimates for the second and third components of the simple-zero mode within the velocity field. Additionally, we develop three good unknowns to minimize linear coupling terms as much as possible while mitigating growth induced by linear stretching terms; through constructing a series of multipliers, we achieve enhanced dissipation and inviscid damping effects. In our analysis of the nonlinear system aimed at establishing an improved stability threshold, we utilize quasi-linearization methods to rectify deficiencies in dispersive estimates related to both the first component of velocity and temperature, as well as address regularity issues along vertical directions caused by buoyancy forces and stratification. Consequently, we demonstrate that if initial perturbations in velocity and temperature satisfy $\\left\\|u_{\\mathrm{in}}\\right\\|_{H^{N+2}\\cap W^{N+3,1}}+\\left\\|θ_{\\mathrm{in}}\\right\\|_{H^{N+1}\\cap W^{N+3,1}}<δ\\mathbf{Re}^{-\\frac{14}{15}}$, for any $N\\geq 11$ and some $δ>0$ independent of $\\mathbf{Re}$, then the solution to the 3D Boussinesq equations with rotation is nonlinearly stable without transitioning away from the steady state."

We show that this scheme preserves, at the discrete level, an entropy estimate on the gradient, which then allows us to establish the convergence of the discrete solution to the continuous solution.

We reformulate nonparametric regression as conditional sample mean estimation, which is implemented directly via the learned conditional diffusion model. Unlike traditional bootstrap methods that decouple the estimation of the conditional distribution, sampling, and nonparametric regression, our approach integrates these components into a unified generative framework. With the expressive capacity of diffusion models, our method facilitates both efficient sampling from high-dimensional or multimodal distributions and accurate nonparametric estimation. We establish rigorous theoretical guarantees for the proposed method. In particular, we derive optimal end-to-end convergence rates in the Wasserstein distance between the learned and target conditional distributions. Building on this foundation, we further establish the convergence guarantees of the resulting bootstrap procedure.

We investigate the transport of cosmic-ray electrons (CREs) and the associated galactic wind, and assess their impact on the surrounding medium in NGC 3044. We obtained the NGC 3044 total intensity image at 943 MHz from the Australian SKA Pathfinder (ASKAP) observations with a resolution of 16 arcsec and an rms noise of 20 $μ$Jy beam$^{-1}$. The sensitivity is higher than the previous observations at similar frequencies. We find that the ASKAP intensity profiles perpendicular to the disk can be fit with two exponential components. The scale heights of the thin and thick disks are $0.43 \\pm 0.13$ kpc and $1.91 \\pm 0.26$ kpc, respectively. By jointly fitting total intensity and spectral index profiles with one-dimensional advection and diffusion models, we find that CREs are advected outward from the disk with the velocity increasing with height in a power law. Beyond $\\sim3$ kpc, the velocity exceeds the escape speed of $\\sim400$ km s$^{-1}$, indicating a strong wind. We further identify a possible superbubble of radius $\\sim3$ kpc filled with soft X-ray emitting hot gas and surrounded by an HI shell and a bright H$α$ rim. These results demonstrate that radio continuum observations provide a powerful probe of cosmic-ray-driven winds in normal star-forming spiral galaxies."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a closed-loop automation framework for heterogeneous modular robots, covering the full pipeline from morphological construction to adaptive control. In this framework, a mobile manipulator handles heterogeneous functional modules including structural, joint, and wheeled modules to dynamically assemble diverse robot configurations and provide them with immediate locomotion capability. To address the state-space explosion in large-scale heterogeneous reconfiguration, we propose a hierarchical planner: the high-level planner uses a bidirectional heuristic search with type-penalty terms to generate module-handling sequences, while the low level planner employs A* search to compute optimal execution trajectories. This design effectively decouples discrete configuration planning from continuous motion execution. For adaptive motion generation of unknown assembled configurations, we introduce a GPU accelerated Annealing-Variance Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) controller. By incorporating a multi stage variance annealing strategy to balance global exploration and local convergence, the controller enables configuration-agnostic, real-time motion control. Large scale simulations show that the type-penalty term is critical for planning robustness in heterogeneous scenarios. Moreover, the greedy heuristic produces plans with lower physical execution costs than the Hungarian heuristic. The proposed annealing-variance MPPI significantly outperforms standard MPPI in both velocity tracking accuracy and control frequency, achieving real time control at 50 Hz. The framework validates the full-cycle process, including module assembly, robot merging and splitting, and dynamic motion generation."

Despite large-scale multi-embodiment pre-training, existing Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) remain tightly coupled to their training embodiments and typically require costly fine-tuning. We introduce Language-Action Pre-training (LAP), a simple recipe that represents low-level robot actions directly in natural language, aligning action supervision with the pre-trained vision-language model's input-output distribution. LAP requires no learned tokenizer, no costly annotation, and no embodiment-specific architectural design. Based on LAP, we present LAP-3B, which to the best of our knowledge is the first VLA to achieve substantial zero-shot transfer to previously unseen robot embodiments without any embodiment-specific fine-tuning. Across multiple novel robots and manipulation tasks, LAP-3B attains over 50% average zero-shot success, delivering roughly a 2x improvement over the strongest prior VLAs. We further show that LAP enables efficient adaptation and favorable scaling, while unifying action prediction and VQA in a shared language-action format that yields additional gains through co-training."

    "abstract": "In twisted transition metal dichalcogenides (tTMDs), atomic reconstruction gives rise to moiré domains with alternating ferroelectric polarization, whose domain size and overall electric dipole moment are tunable by an out-of-plane electric field. Previous transport measurements in Hall bar devices have successfully demonstrated the overall ferroelectric behavior of tTMDs from a collective ensemble of ferroelectric moiré domains. To locally probe a single ferroelectric moiré domain, we fabricate and study mesoscopic quantum transport via a gate-defined twisted molybdenum disulfide (tMoS2) quantum point contact (QPC). The local property of a single moiré domain is invulnerable to long-range disorder and twist-angle inhomogeneity, resulting in an unusually long conductance plateau with large electrical hysteresis. The comparison between local and global measurements confirms that antiferroelectricity can emerge from alternating polarization of individual ferroelectric domains. Using a QPC as a single charge sensor, we characterize the nature and time scale of different domain evolution mechanisms with single atomic dipole resolution. Our findings shed new light on the microscopic ferroelectric behavior and dynamics within a single tTMD moiré domain, paving the way toward more advanced ferroelectric quantum devices with tunable local Hamiltonian, such as ferroelectric tTMD quantum dots (QDs)."

Furthermore, multimodal fusion often suffers from redundancy and imbalance. To address these issues, we propose a novel text-guided framework. First, we introduce an in-context learning-based multi-stage text augmentation mechanism to generate high-quality anomaly text samples for fine-tuning the text feature extractor. Second, we design a multi-scale bottleneck Transformer fusion module that uses compressed bottleneck tokens to progressively integrate information across modalities, mitigating redundancy and imbalance.

Our findings suggest that participants were able to significantly differentiate female agents by personality, while male agents were not consistently distinguished. We also observed evidence of personality synchrony, where participants tended to perceive the first agent as more similar to their own personality, with this effect driven mainly by male participants, especially toward male agents.

The fraction of samples exhibiting defect states increases with the phase delay $α$ and peaks at $α_{c}$, where the system crosses over to asynchronous states filled with chimera clusters. While the traveling speed, number, and width of these defects increase with $α$, the total spatial extent of the defects remains robust against the system size $N$.

We propose Generalized Robust Adaptive-Bandwidth Multiview Diffusion Maps (GRAB-MDM), a new kernel-based diffusion geometry framework for integrating multiple noisy data sources. The key innovation of GRAB-MDM is a {view}-dependent bandwidth selection strategy that adapts to the geometry and noise level of each view, enabling a stable and principled construction of multiview diffusion operators. Under a common-manifold model, we establish asymptotic convergence results and show that the adaptive bandwidths lead to provably robust recovery of the shared intrinsic structure, even when noise levels and sensor dimensions differ across views. Numerical experiments demonstrate that GRAB-MDM significantly improves robustness and embedding quality compared with fixed-bandwidth and equal-bandwidth baselines, and usually outperform existing algorithms. The proposed framework offers a practical and theoretically grounded solution for multiview sensor fusion in high-dimensional noisy environments."

In this proposal and position paper, we argue and provide tentative evidence that this text-centric focus overlooks other forms of prompting GenAI models, such as problem decomposition diagrams functioning as prompts for code generation in their own right enabling new types of programming activities and assessments. To support this position, we present findings from a large introductory Python programming course, where students constructed decomposition diagrams that were used to prompt GPT-4.1 for code generation. We demonstrate that current models are very successful in their ability to generate code from student-constructed diagrams.

Their reliable execution critically depends on the ability to reason through ambiguous situations in which clarification seeking is necessary to ensure correct task execution. However, progress is limited by the lack of scalable, task-agnostic frameworks for systematically curating and measuring the impact of ambiguity across custom workflows. We address this gap by introducing LHAW (Long-Horizon Augmented Workflows), a modular, dataset-agnostic synthetic pipeline that transforms any well-specified task into controllable underspecified variants by systematically removing information across four dimensions - Goals, Constraints, Inputs, and Context - at configurable severity levels. Unlike approaches that rely on LLM predictions of ambiguity, LHAW validates variants through empirical agent trials, classifying them as outcome-critical, divergent, or benign based on observed terminal state divergence. We release 285 task variants from TheAgentCompany, SWE-Bench Pro and MCP-Atlas according to our taxonomy alongside formal analysis measuring how current agents detect, reason about, and resolve underspecification across ambiguous settings. LHAW provides the first systematic framework for cost-sensitive evaluation of agent clarification behavior in long-horizon settings, enabling development of reliable autonomous systems."

For the semidiscrete setting, where one distribution is continuous and the other is discrete, we derive a complete characterization of the optimal transport plan and develop simulation-based methods to efficiently compute it. One particularly novel aspect of our approach is the efficient computation of a tie-breaking rule that preserves marginal distributions.

Prior research has explored the modeling of user preferences through sequential interactions and the user-item interaction graph, utilizing advanced techniques such as graph neural networks and transformer-based architectures. However, these methods typically fall short in simultaneously accounting for the dynamic nature of graph topologies and the sequential pattern of interactions in user preference models. Moreover, they often fail to adequately capture the multiple user behavior boundaries during model optimization. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a boundary-aware Multi-Behavioral Dynamic Graph Transformer (MB-DGT) model that dynamically refines the graph structure to reflect the evolving patterns of user behaviors and interactions. Our model involves a transformer-based dynamic graph aggregator for user preference modeling, which assimilates the changing graph structure and the sequence of user behaviors. This integration yields a more comprehensive and dynamic representation of user preferences. For model optimization, we implement a user-specific multi-behavior loss function that delineates the interest boundaries among different behaviors, thereby enriching the personalized learning of user preferences. Comprehensive experiments across three datasets indicate that our model consistently delivers remarkable recommendation performance."

Meanwhile, developers routinely surface risk-relevant insights during code review, yet this information is largely ignored by automated testing tools. We present EyeQ, a system that leverages developer intelligence from code reviews to guide fuzzing. EyeQ extracts security-relevant signals from review discussions, localizes the implicated program regions, and translates these insights into annotation-based guidance for fuzzing. The approach operates atop existing annotation-aware fuzzing, requiring no changes to program semantics or developer workflows. We first validate EyeQ through a human-guided feasibility study on a security-focused dataset of PHP code reviews, establishing a strong baseline for review-guided fuzzing. We then automate the workflow using a large language model with carefully designed prompts. EyeQ significantly improves vulnerability discovery over standard fuzzing configurations, uncovering more than 40 previously unknown bugs in the security-critical PHP codebase."

While the classic Knaster-Tarski theorem addresses a single function with sequential iteration, modern computing systems require parallel execution with overwrite semantics, non-atomic updates, and stale reads. We prove three convergence theorems under progressively relaxed synchronization: (1) Interleaving semantics with fair scheduling, (2) Parallel execution with update-only-on-change semantics (processes write only on those coordinates whose values change), and (3) Distributed execution with bounded staleness (updates propagate within $T$ rounds) and $i$-locality (each process modifies only its own component). Our approach differs from prior work in fundamental ways: Cousot-Cousot's chaotic iteration uses join-based merges that preserve information. Instead, we use coordinate-wise overwriting. Bertsekas's asynchronous methods assume contractions. We use coordinate-wise overwriting with structural constraints (locality, bounded staleness) instead. Applications include parallel and distributed algorithms for the transitive closure, stable marriage, shortest paths, and fair division with subsidy problems. Our results provide the first exact least-fixed-point convergence guarantees for overwrite-based parallel updates without join operations or contraction assumptions."

    "abstract": "Recent advances in reaction prediction have achieved near-saturated accuracy on standard benchmarks (e.g., USPTO), yet most state-of-the-art models formulate the task as a one-shot mapping from reactants to products, offering limited insight into the underlying reaction process. Procedural alternatives introduce stepwise generation but often rely on mechanism-specific supervision, discrete symbolic edits, and computationally expensive inference. In this work, we propose LatentRxnFlow, a new reaction prediction paradigm that models reactions as continuous latent trajectories anchored at the thermodynamic product state. Built on Conditional Flow Matching, our approach learns time-dependent latent dynamics directly from standard reactant-product pairs, without requiring mechanistic annotations or curated intermediate labels. While LatentRxnFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance on USPTO benchmarks, more importantly, the continuous formulation exposes the full generative trajectory, enabling trajectory-level diagnostics that are difficult to realize with discrete or one-shot models. We show that latent trajectory analysis allows us to localize and characterize failure modes and to mitigate certain errors via gated inference. Furthermore, geometric properties of the learned trajectories provide an intrinsic signal of epistemic uncertainty, helping prioritize reliably predictable reaction outcomes and flag ambiguous cases for additional validation. Overall, LatentRxnFlow combines strong predictive accuracy with improved transparency, diagnosability, and uncertainty awareness, moving reaction prediction toward more trustworthy deployment in high-throughput discovery workflows."

    "abstract": "All-to-all collective communication is a core primitive in distributed machine learning and high-performance computing. At the server scale, the communication demands of these workloads are increasingly outstripping the bandwidth and energy limits of electrical interconnects, driving a growing interest in photonic interconnects. However, leveraging these interconnects for all-to-all communication is nontrivial. The core challenge lies in jointly optimizing a sequence of topologies and flow schedules, reconfiguring only when the transmission savings from traversing shorter paths outweigh the reconfiguration cost. Yet the search space of this joint optimization is enormous. Existing work sidesteps this challenge by making unrealistic assumptions on reconfiguration costs so that it is never or always worthwhile to reconfigure. In this paper, we show that any candidate sequence of topologies and flow schedules can be expressed as a sum of adjacency matrices and their powers. This abstraction captures the entire solution space and yields a lower bound on all-to-all completion time. Building on this formulation, we identify a family of topology sequences with strong symmetry and high expansion that admits bandwidth-efficient schedules, which our algorithm constructs with low computational overhead. Together, these insights allow us to efficiently construct near-optimal solutions, effectively avoiding enumeration of the combinatorial design space. Evaluation shows that our approach reduces all-to-all completion time by up to 44% on average across a wide range of network parameters, message sizes and workload types."

    "abstract": "Agentic AI systems automate enterprise workflows but existing defenses--guardrails, semantic filters--are probabilistic and routinely bypassed. We introduce authenticated workflows, the first complete trust layer for enterprise agentic AI. Security reduces to protecting four fundamental boundaries: prompts, tools, data, and context. We enforce intent (operations satisfy organizational policies) and integrity (operations are cryptographically authentic) at every boundary crossing, combining cryptographic elimination of attack classes with runtime policy enforcement. This delivers deterministic security--operations either carry valid cryptographic proof or are rejected. We introduce MAPL, an AI-native policy language that expresses agentic constraints dynamically as agents evolve and invocation context changes, scaling as O(log M + N) policies versus O(M x N) rules through hierarchical composition with cryptographic attestations for workflow dependencies. We prove practicality through a universal security runtime integrating nine leading frameworks (MCP, A2A, OpenAI, Claude, LangChain, CrewAI, AutoGen, LlamaIndex, Haystack) through thin adapters requiring zero protocol modifications. Formal proofs establish completeness and soundness. Empirical validation shows 100% recall with zero false positives across 174 test cases, protection against 9 of 10 OWASP Top 10 risks, and complete mitigation of two high impact production CVEs."

Unlike traditional statistical aligners, our system employs a template-based Prompt Manager that leverages large language models (LLMs) for sentence segmentation and alignment under strict JSON output constraints. In this tool, automated preprocessing integrates into a human-in-the-loop workflow, allowing researchers to refine alignments and apply custom translation technique annotations through a stand-off architecture. By leveraging LLM-assisted processing, the tool balances annotation efficiency with the linguistic precision required to analyze complex translation phenomena in specialized domains."

This SoK presents a comprehensive overview of the PI landscape, covering attacks, defenses, and their evaluation practices. Through a systematic literature review and quantitative analysis, we establish taxonomies that categorize PI attacks by payload generation strategies (heuristic vs. optimization) and defenses by intervention stages (text, model, and execution levels). Our analysis reveals a key limitation shared by many existing defenses and benchmarks: they largely overlook context-dependent tasks, in which agents are authorized to rely on runtime environmental observations to determine actions. To address this gap, we introduce AgentPI, a new benchmark designed to systematically evaluate agent behavior under context-dependent interaction settings. Using AgentPI, we empirically evaluate representative defenses and show that no single approach can simultaneously achieve high trustworthiness, high utility, and low latency. Moreover, we show that many defenses appear effective under existing benchmarks by suppressing contextual inputs, yet fail to generalize to realistic agent settings where context-dependent reasoning is essential. This SoK distills key takeaways and open research problems, offering structured guidance for future research and practical deployment of secure LLM agents."

A key bottleneck is the lack of benchmarks that align natural-language specifications with reference formulations/solver code grounded in real optimization models. To fill in this gap, we introduce MIPLIB-NL, built via a structure-aware reverse construction methodology from real mixed-integer linear programs in MIPLIB~2017. Our pipeline (i) recovers compact, reusable model structure from flat solver formulations, (ii) reverse-generates natural-language specifications explicitly tied to this recovered structure under a unified model--data separation format, and (iii) performs iterative semantic validation through expert review and human--LLM interaction with independent reconstruction checks. This yields 223 one-to-one reconstructions that preserve the mathematical content of the original instances while enabling realistic natural-language-to-optimization evaluation. Experiments show substantial performance degradation on MIPLIB-NL for systems that perform strongly on existing benchmarks, exposing failure modes invisible at toy scale."

Adaptive Feature Masking encourages diverse feature discovery while preserving singlefeature interpretability. The framework yields new analysis capabilities: branch point tracking locates tokens where feature choice determines output correctness; critic trajectory analysis separates policy limitations from value estimation errors; layer-wise comparison reveals syntactic features in early layers and semantic features in later layers.

Although hyperspectral imaging (HSI) enables material discrimination using spectral signatures, standardized benchmarks for UAV-based landmine detection remain scarce. In this work, we present a systematic benchmark of four classical statistical detection algorithms, including Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM), Matched Filter (MF), Adaptive Cosine Estimator (ACE), and Constrained Energy Minimization (CEM), alongside a proposed lightweight Spectral Neural Network utilizing Parametric Mish activations for PFM-1 landmine detection. We also release pixel-level binary ground truth masks (target/background) to enable standardized, reproducible evaluation. Evaluations were conducted on inert PFM-1 targets across multiple scene crops using a recently released VNIR hyperspectral dataset. Metrics such as receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, area under the curve (AUC), precision-recall (PR) curve, and average precision (AP) were used. While all methods achieve high ROC-AUC on an independent test set, the ACE method observes the highest AUC of 0.989. However, because target pixels are extremely sparse relative to background, ROC-AUC alone can be misleading; under precision-focused evaluation (PR and AP), the Spectral-NN outperforms classical detectors, achieving the highest AP. These results emphasize the need for precision-focused evaluation, scene-aware benchmarking, and learning-based spectral models for reliable UAV-based hyperspectral landmine detection. The code and pixel-level annotations will be released."

To resolve this, we propose a Dual-Stream Architecture that fuses unsupervised learning for surface anomaly detection with macroscopic physics proxies for cumulative load estimation. This approach leverages low-frequency sensor data to generate a multi-dimensional health vector, distinguishing between dynamic hazards and sustained mechanical effort. Validated on a RISC-V embedded platform, the architecture demonstrates low computational overhead, enabling comprehensive, edge-based health monitoring on resource-constrained ECUs without the latency or bandwidth costs of cloud-based monitoring."

We introduce TaperNorm, a drop-in replacement for RMSNorm/LayerNorm that behaves exactly like the standard normalizer early in training and then smoothly tapers to a learned sample-independent linear/affine map. A single global gate is held at $g{=}1$ during gate warmup, used to calibrate the scaling branch via EMAs, and then cosine-decayed to $g{=}0$, at which point per-token statistics vanish and the resulting fixed scalings can be folded into adjacent linear projections. Our theoretical and empirical results isolate scale anchoring as the key role played by output normalization: as a (near) $0$-homogeneous map it removes radial gradients at the output, whereas without such an anchor cross-entropy encourages unbounded logit growth (``logit chasing''). We further show that a simple fixed-target auxiliary loss on the pre-logit residual-stream scale provides an explicit alternative anchor and can aid removal of the final normalization layer. Empirically, TaperNorm matches normalized baselines under identical setups while eliminating per-token statistics and enabling these layers to be folded into adjacent linear projections at inference. On an efficiency microbenchmark, folding internal scalings yields up to $1.22\\times$ higher throughput in last-token logits mode.

Using USPTO reaction classes and challenging C-H functionalisation reactions, we benchmark forward reaction prediction, retrosynthesis and reagent prediction. LoRA achieves accuracy comparable to full fine-tuning while effectively mitigating catastrophic forgetting and better preserving multi-task performance. Both fine-tuning approaches generalise beyond training distributions, producing plausible alternative solvent predictions. Notably, C-H functionalisation fine-tuning reveals that LoRA and full fine-tuning encode subtly different reactivity patterns, suggesting more effective reaction-specific adaptation with LoRA. As LLMs continue to scale, our results highlight the practicality of modular, parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategies for their flexible deployment for chemistry applications."

This work demonstrates that the quantum entanglement in this process may be accompanied by a decrease, constrained by a lower boundary, but will not be completely lost. Thus, the entanglement of these systems undergoes redistribution within the phase space during the sequential decays of hyperons, and an important role of hyperon polarization is highlighted. By using the explicit spin density matrix of baryon pairs, it is also found that quantumness of the system characterized by quantum discord always have the possibility to increase during decay processes, even when entanglement evaluated by concurrence and negativity does not increase."

In this work, we introduce Feature Activation Coverage (FAC) which measures data diversity in an interpretable feature space. Building upon this metric, we further propose a diversity-driven data synthesis framework, named FAC Synthesis, that first uses a sparse autoencoder to identify missing features from a seed dataset, and then generates synthetic samples that explicitly reflect these features. Experiments show that our approach consistently improves both data diversity and downstream performance on various tasks, including instruction following, toxicity detection, reward modeling, and behavior steering. Interestingly, we identify a shared, interpretable feature space across model families (i.e., LLaMA, Mistral, and Qwen), enabling cross-model knowledge transfer.

We introduce a human-interpretable structural encoding strategy for graph-to-text translation that injects graph structure directly into natural language prompts. Our method involves computing a variant of Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) similarity classes and maps them to human-like color tokens rather than numeric labels. The key insight is that semantically meaningful and human-interpretable cues may be more effectively processed by LLMs than opaque symbolic encoding. Experimental results on multiple algorithmic and predictive graph tasks show the considerable improvements by our method on both synthetic and real-world datasets. By capturing both local and global-range dependencies, our method enhances LLM performance especially on graph tasks that require reasoning over global graph structure."

These results show that current VLMs are effective for well-defined extraction tasks but remain brittle in interactive, multi-step financial analysis. Multimodal Finance Eval offers a challenging benchmark to measure and drive progress in this high-stakes setting."

    "abstract": "Monocular depth estimation is a central problem in computer vision with applications in robotics, AR, and autonomous driving, yet the self-attention mechanisms that drive modern Transformer architectures remain opaque. We introduce SVD-Inspired Attention (SVDA) into the Dense Prediction Transformer (DPT), providing the first spectrally structured formulation of attention for dense prediction tasks. SVDA decouples directional alignment from spectral modulation by embedding a learnable diagonal matrix into normalized query-key interactions, enabling attention maps that are intrinsically interpretable rather than post-hoc approximations. Experiments on KITTI and NYU-v2 show that SVDA preserves or slightly improves predictive accuracy while adding only minor computational overhead. More importantly, SVDA unlocks six spectral indicators that quantify entropy, rank, sparsity, alignment, selectivity, and robustness. These reveal consistent cross-dataset and depth-wise patterns in how attention organizes during training, insights that remain inaccessible in standard Transformers. By shifting the role of attention from opaque mechanism to quantifiable descriptor, SVDA redefines interpretability in monocular depth estimation and opens a principled avenue toward transparent dense prediction models."

To address this, based on an analogy between the Dockerfile and the agentic task, we propose to employ agents to simulate and explore environment histories, guided by execution feedback. By tracing histories of a healthy environment, its state can be inverted to an earlier one with runtime failures, from which a task can be derived by packing the buggy state and the corresponding error messages. With our method, named CLI-Gym, a total of 1,655 environment-intensive tasks are derived, being the largest collection of its kind. Moreover, with curated successful trajectories, our fine-tuned model, named LiberCoder, achieves substantial absolute improvements of +21.1% (to 46.1%) on Terminal-Bench, outperforming various strong baselines. To our knowledge, this is the first public pipeline for scalable derivation of environment-intensive tasks."

Attribution of LLM-generated text to LLM input data could help with these challenges, but so far we have more questions than answers: what elements of LLM outputs require attribution, what goals should it serve, how should it be implemented? We contribute a human-centric data attribution framework, which situates the attribution problem within the broader data economy. Specific use cases for attribution, such as creative writing assistance or fact-checking, can be specified via a set of parameters (including stakeholder objectives and implementation criteria). These criteria are up for negotiation by the relevant stakeholder groups: creators, LLM users, and their intermediaries (publishers, platforms, AI companies). The outcome of domain-specific negotiations can be implemented and tested for whether the stakeholder goals are achieved. The proposed approach provides a bridge between methodological NLP work on data attribution, governance work on policy interventions, and economic analysis of creator incentives for a sustainable equilibrium in the data economy."

While many tool invocations repeat across parallel rollouts and could in principle be cached, naively caching their outputs for reuse is incorrect since tool outputs depend on the environment state induced by prior agent interactions. We present TVCACHE, a stateful tool-value cache for LLM agent post-training. TVCACHE maintains a tree of observed tool-call sequences and performs longest-prefix matching for cache lookups: a hit occurs only when the agent's full tool history matches a previously executed sequence, guaranteeing identical environment state. On three diverse workloads-terminal-based tasks, SQL generation, and video understanding. TVCACHE achieves cache hit rates of up to 70% and reduces median tool call execution time by up to 6.9X, with no degradation in post-training reward accumulation."

Furthermore, we prove that with high probability, the trace of a random walk of length $(1+\\varepsilon)n\\log n$ on $G$ is Hamiltonian, regardless of the starting vertex. These results also hold for random $d$-regular graphs with sufficiently large $d$. These findings answer two questions proposed by Frieze, Krivelevich, Michaeli, and Peled [PLMS, 2018].

    "abstract": "We propose a constructive algorithm for identifying complete data distributions in graphical models of missing data. The complete data distribution is unrestricted, while the missingness mechanism is assumed to factorize according to a conditional directed acyclic graph. Our approach follows an interventionist perspective in which missingness indicators are treated as variables that can be intervened on. A central challenge in this setting is that sequences of interventions on missingness indicators may induce and propagate selection bias, so that identification can fail even when a propensity score is invariant to available interventions. To address this challenge, we introduce a tree-based identification algorithm that explicitly tracks the creation and propagation of selection bias and determines whether it can be avoided through admissible intervention strategies. The resulting tree provides both a diagnostic and a constructive characterization of identifiability under a given missingness mechanism. Building on these results, we develop recursive inverse probability weighting procedures that mirror the intervention logic of the identification algorithm, yielding valid estimating equations for both the missingness mechanism and functionals of the complete data distribution. Simulation studies and a real-data application illustrate the practical performance of the proposed methods. An accompanying R package, flexMissing, implements all proposed procedures."

    "abstract": "Micro-structural models of contagion and systemic risk emphasize that shock propagation is inherently multi-channel, spanning counterparty exposures, short-term funding and roll-over risk, securities cross-holdings, and common-asset (fire-sale) spillovers. Empirical implementations, however, often rely on stylized or simulated networks, or focus on a single exposure dimension, reflecting the practical difficulty of reconciling heterogeneous granular collections into a coherent representation with consistent identifiers and consolidation rules. We close part of this gap by constructing an empirically grounded multilayer network for euro area significant banking groups that integrates several supervisory and statistical datasets into layer-consistent exposure matrices defined on a common node set. Each layer corresponds to a distinct transmission channel, long- and short-term credit, securities cross-holdings, short-term secured funding, and overlapping external portfolios, and nodes are enriched with balance-sheet information to support model calibration. We document pronounced cross-layer heterogeneity in connectivity and centrality, and show that an aggregated (flattened) representation can mask economically relevant structure and misidentify the institutions that are systemically important in specific markets. We then illustrate how the resulting network disciplines standard systemic-risk analytics by implementing a centrality-based propagation measure and a micro-structural agent-based framework on real exposures. The approach provides a data-grounded basis for layer-aware systemic-risk assessment and stress testing across multiple dimensions of the banking network."

A basic demand-side question remains unanswered. When ordinary people can fact-check anything they want, what do they actually ask about? We provide the first large-scale evidence on this question by analyzing close to 2{,}500 statements submitted by 457 participants to an open-ended AI fact-checking system. Each claim is classified along five semantic dimensions (domain, epistemic form, verifiability, target entity, and temporal reference), producing a behavioral map of public verification demand. Three findings stand out. First, users range widely across topics but default to a narrow epistemic repertoire, overwhelmingly submitting simple descriptive claims about present-day observables. Second, roughly one in four requests concerns statements that cannot be empirically resolved, including moral judgments, speculative predictions, and subjective evaluations, revealing a systematic mismatch between what users seek from fact-checking tools and what such tools can deliver. Third, comparison with the FEVER benchmark dataset exposes sharp structural divergences across all five dimensions, indicating that standard evaluation corpora encode a synthetic claim environment that does not resemble real-world verification needs. These results reframe fact-checking as a demand-driven problem and identify where current AI systems and benchmarks are misaligned with the uncertainty people actually experience."

    "abstract": "The dense Galactic Center environment is expected to host compact binary inspirals detectable by future space-borne gravitational wave (GW) observatories (e.g., LISA, TianQin, Taiji) in the millihertz band. Aided by information from these facilities, next-generation ground-based GW detectors (e.g., Cosmic Explorer, Einstein Telescope) can potentially capture gravitational radiation in the hectohertz band from rapidly spinning neutron star (NS) components in such binaries. These Galactic Center systems are thus anticipated to act as dual-line (i.e., low-frequency inspiral and high-frequency spin) GW sources. However, the formation channels of these systems remain largely unexplored. In this \\textit{Letter}, we propose that the von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai (ZLK) effect can enhance the formation of dual-line GW sources in hierarchical triples involving the Galactic supermassive black hole, Sgr A*. We show that ZLK-driven oscillations in the eccentricity and inclination of the inner binary can modulate the GW emission from both the binary inspiral and the individual NS spins. This effect boosts the expected dual-line source count by a factor of $\\sim 3$, from rare to $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ in 4 years, making dual-line observations substantially more probable. Our results demonstrate that the ZLK effect provides an important formation channel for Galactic dual-line GW sources."

    "abstract": "Semialgebraic graphs are graphs whose vertices are points in $\\mathbb{R}^d$, and adjacency between two vertices is determined by the truth value of a semialgebraic predicate of constant complexity. We show how to harness polynomial partitioning methods to construct compact adjacency labeling schemes for families of semialgebraic graphs. That is, we show that for any family of semialgebraic graphs, given a graph on $n$ vertices in this family, we can assign a label consisting of $O(n^{1-2/(d+1) + \\varepsilon})$ bits to each vertex (where $\\varepsilon > 0$ can be made arbitrarily small and the constant of proportionality depends on $\\varepsilon$ and on the complexity of the adjacency-defining predicate), such that adjacency between two vertices can be determined solely from their two labels, without any additional information. We obtain for instance that unit disk graphs and segment intersection graphs have such labelings with labels of $O(n^{1/3 + \\varepsilon})$ bits. This is in contrast to their natural implicit representation consisting of the coordinates of the disk centers or segment endpoints, which sometimes require exponentially many bits. It also improves on the best known bound of $O(n^{1-1/d}\\log n)$ for $d$-dimensional semialgebraic families due to Alon (Discrete Comput. Geom., 2024), a bound that holds more generally for graphs with shattering functions bounded by a degree-$d$ polynomial. We also give new bounds on the size of adjacency labels for other families of graphs. In particular, we consider semilinear graphs, which are semialgebraic graphs in which the predicate only involves linear polynomials. We show that semilinear graphs have adjacency labels of size $O(\\log n)$. We also prove that polygon visibility graphs, which are not semialgebraic in the above sense, have adjacency labels of size $O(\\log^3 n)$."

Most deployed encoders rely on task-agnostic downsampling and linear brightness-to-amplitude mappings, which are suboptimal under realistic perceptual models. While global inverse problems have been formulated as neural networks, such approaches can be fast at inference, and can achieve high reconstruction fidelity, but require training and have limited generalizability to arbitrary inputs. We cast stimulus encoding as a constrained sparse least-squares problem under a linearized perceptual forward model. Our key observation is that the resulting perception matrix can be highly sparse, depending on patient and implant configuration. Building on this, we apply an efficient projected residual norm steepest descent solver that exploits sparsity and supports stimulus bounds via projection. In silico experiments across four simulated patients and implant resolutions from $15\\times15$ to $100\\times100$ electrodes demonstrate improved reconstruction fidelity, with up to $+0.265$ SSIM increase, $+12.4\\,\\mathrm{dB}$ PSNR, and $81.4\\%$ MAE reduction on Fashion-MNIST compared to Lanczos downsampling."

Building upon the foundational work of Field (1965) and the subsequent analysis by Waters and Proga (2019), this study revisits the characteristics of thermal instability in a uniform, non-magnetic medium. Our primary aim is to reevaluate and expand the understanding of instability domains, focusing on the classification and characteristics of thermal and acoustic modes in the presence of heating, radiative cooling, and thermal conduction. Except for Spitzers expression for parallel thermal conductivity, the heating and cooling processes are unspecified. Additionally, we investigate the existence of isobaric and isochoric thermal modes across the extreme limits of very short and very long wavelengths, as well as at intermediate wavelengths. We perform an in-depth analysis of the dispersion relation for an infinite, uniform hydrodynamic medium, as initially derived by Field (1965). This approach enables the generation of growth-rate and dispersion diagrams, providing insight into the behaviour of thermal instability across different wavelength ranges. With the inclusion of thermal conduction, our study refines the classification of the seven instability regions previously outlined by Waters and Proga (2019). Our findings confirm that their classification holds when the Field length is smaller than or comparable to the thermal wavelength. For larger Field lengths, a simplified classification becomes impractical. Furthermore, we discuss the potential implications of the catastrophic cooling instability (Waters and Stricklan 2025) in the context of cool coronal rain formation. Our work not only validates certain classifications, but also proposes new insights into complex instability behaviours, thereby enhancing the theoretical framework established by Field and others."

We evaluate and benchmark denoising strategies including Principal Component Analysis, Independent Component Analysis, sparse unsupervised representations: iterative soft thresholding with 2D-1D wavelets, and supervised deep learning with a 3D U-Net, to identify techniques that suppress noise while preserving flux and morphology across peak SNRs of 2.5-8, applied to (i) synthetic spectral cubes of rotating toy disk galaxies, (ii) synthetic [C II] IFU cubes from FIRE simulations, and (iii) ALMA [C II] observations of CRISTAL galaxies and W2246-0526. Performance is assessed via RMSE, conservation of flux and spectra, noise reduction, and SNR improvement of the central galaxy. For synthetic cubes: PCA and ICA provide marginal improvement; IST reduces noise effectively at moderate SNRs but can suppress emission at low SNRs; and the U-Net outperforms IST, though it can produce quantifiable hallucinations at lower-SNRs. For moderate-SNR observations (ALMA-CRISTAL), U-Net and IST achieve comparable performance, conserving >91% flux and increasing SNR by >6. However, for observations with complex morphologies absent in the training set (W2246), the U-Net underperforms relative to IST, recovering ~80% flux, while IST robustly conserves flux and improves SNR by ~3, highlighting generalisation challenges and the need for physically-motivated training priors. We conclude that IST is a robust unsupervised denoiser for moderate-SNR data, and a synthetically trained U-Net generalises effectively to real data, dependent on training priors. This framework offers a pathway for transferable denoising for ALMA, VLT/MUSE, and JWST."

Despite rapid advances in large language models (LLMs), it remains unclear whether they can meet the structural requirements of this process, which hinge on preserving roles, methods, and effect-size attribution across documents rather than on recognizing isolated entities. We propose a structural, diagnostic framework that evaluates LLM-based evidence extraction as a progression of schema-constrained queries with increasing relational and numerical complexity, enabling precise identification of failure points beyond atom-level extraction. Using a manually curated corpus spanning five scientific domains, together with a unified query suite and evaluation protocol, we evaluate two state-of-the-art LLMs under both per-document and long-context, multi-document input regimes. Across domains and models, performance remains moderate for single-property queries but degrades sharply once tasks require stable binding between variables, roles, statistical methods, and effect sizes. Full meta-analytic association tuples are extracted with near-zero reliability, and long-context inputs further exacerbate these failures. Downstream aggregation amplifies even minor upstream errors, rendering corpus-level statistics unreliable. Our analysis shows that these limitations stem not from entity recognition errors, but from systematic structural breakdowns, including role reversals, cross-analysis binding drift, instance compression in dense result sections, and numeric misattribution, indicating that current LLMs lack the structural fidelity, relational binding, and numerical grounding required for automated meta-analysis.

    "abstract": "In the search for metal-poor stars, large spectroscopic surveys are an invaluable tool. However, the spectra of metal-poor stars can be difficult to analyse because of the relative lack of available lines, which can also lead to misclassification. We aim to identify the stars observed by the APOGEE survey that are below the metallicity limit of APOGEE's analysis. For the highest confidence candidates, we classify the orbital properties of the stars to investigate whether their orbital distribution matches what we would expect for stars that are this metal poor and to select especially interesting targets for spectroscopic follow-up purposes. We examined the properties derived by APOGEE for metal-poor stars from the literature to find signatures of stars with a metallicity below the range of the grid used for spectral analysis. The calibrated APOGEE stellar parameters provide a clear signature of the most metal-poor stars in the survey, indicated by null values for their metallicities while having effective temperatures and surface gravities determined by the pipeline. From comparison with the literature, we find that, within a temperature range of 3700 - 6700 K and above a threshold of S/N > 30, the vast majority of APOGEE stars without calibrated metallicities are very metal poor. The radial velocities provided by APOGEE, Gaia DR3 positions and astrometry along with spectrophotometric distances derived in this work allowed for the computation of their orbits. In this work, we select 289 very metal-poor red giant stars (likely below = -2.5) from the APOGEE results. Our sample contains 16 very metal-poor member candidates of the Magellanic Clouds, 14 very metal-poor stars with orbits confined to the inner Galaxy, and 13 inner Galaxy halo interlopers."

    "abstract": "Smoke segmentation is critical for wildfire management and industrial safety applications. Traditional visible-light-based methods face limitations due to insufficient spectral information, particularly struggling with cloud interference and semi-transparent smoke regions. To address these challenges, we introduce hyperspectral imaging for smoke segmentation and present the first hyperspectral smoke segmentation dataset (HSSDataset) with carefully annotated samples collected from over 18,000 frames across 20 real-world scenarios using a Many-to-One annotations protocol. However, different spectral bands exhibit varying discriminative capabilities across spatial regions, necessitating adaptive band weighting strategies. We decompose this into three technical challenges: spectral interaction contamination, limited spectral pattern modeling, and complex weighting router problems. We propose a mixture of prototypes (MoP) network with: (1) Band split for spectral isolation, (2) Prototype-based spectral representation for diverse patterns, and (3) Dual-level router for adaptive spatial-aware band weighting. We further construct a multispectral dataset (MSSDataset) with RGB-infrared images. Extensive experiments validate superior performance across both hyperspectral and multispectral modalities, establishing a new paradigm for spectral-based smoke segmentation."

Motivated by a discretised version of the Hammersley--Aldous--Diaconis process, we introduce a partially asymmetric long range misanthrope process (PALRMP) on a finite one-dimensional lattice with periodic boundary conditions where particles can move between sites that are not necessarily neighbours, as long as there are no particles in between the departure and arrival sites. In this model, each site $\\ell$ has an inhomogeneous rate parameter $x_\\ell$ associated to it, and the hop rate of a particle moving from site $k$ to site $\\ell$ depends upon the parameter associated to the target site $x_\\ell$, the direction the particle moves, and the number of particles at sites $k$ and $\\ell$. We also consider the homogeneous PALRMP, where all the $x_\\ell$'s are 1. We find necessary and sufficient conditions on the hop rates under which the stationary distribution is of factorised form for both the PALRMP and the homogeneous PALRMP, as well as the extreme variants, namely the ones where the particle motion is totally asymmetric (TALRMP) and symmetric (SLRMP). As an illustrative example, we study in detail the discrete Hammersley--Aldous--Diaconis process."

The approach only involves at worse a quadratic cost in the system size, allowing to simulate up to several thousands of qubits on a classical computer. It provides qualitatively accurate description of one-qubit observables evolutions, making it a useful reference in comparison to techniques limited to small qubit numbers. The predictive power is however less robust for multi-qubits observables. We benchmark the method on the $k$-local transverse-field Ising model (TFIM), considering a large variety of systems ranging from local to all-to-all interactions, and from weak to strong coupling regimes, with up to 2000 qubits. To showcase the versatility of the approach, simulations on 2D and 3D Ising models are also made."

Our results show that a single well-placed link outperformed the full 72-link mesh (AUC 0.541 vs. 0.489, Cohen's $d$=0.86). Even a random link selection matched optimized selection ($p$=0.35). The benefit comes from avoiding multi-link fusion, not from choosing the right link. We attribute this to a \"dilution effect\": links whose Fresnel zones miss activity regions contribute noise that overwhelms signal from informative links. In our deployment, strategic link placement mattered 2.7$\\times$ more than classifier choice.

    "abstract": "A principal delegates choice to an agent whose decision depends on both beliefs and tastes. The principal can steer the delegated decision using two costly instruments: (i) an information policy that determines a Bayes--plausible distribution of posteriors, and (ii) a bias-management policy that shifts the agent's effective taste. We study a binary-state, two-action, convex hull of two benchmark tastes specialization with posterior-separable information costs. The analysis admits an inner--outer decomposition: optimal bias management is bang--bang (either no intervention or the minimal intervention needed to flip the agent's action), while the optimal information policy is characterized by concavification of an endogenous posterior value function that already incorporates optimal management and information costs. This structure clarifies how information acquisition and bias management interact; they can be complements, substitutes, or both depending on the primitives of the model. Information changes which posteriors are realized and hence where management is used; management reshapes the curvature and kinks of the posterior value function and hence the marginal value of information. The model delivers regime classifications for pooling vs. informativeness and for management at different posteriors within informative signals, and highlights how comparative statics can be monotone or non-monotone depending on how concavification contact points move with costs."

    "abstract": "Aligning large language models (LLMs) on domain-specific data remains a fundamental challenge. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) offers a straightforward way to inject domain knowledge but often degrades the model's generality. In contrast, on-policy reinforcement learning (RL) preserves generality but fails to effectively assimilate hard samples that exceed the model's current reasoning level. Recent off-policy RL attempts improve hard sample utilization, yet they suffer from severe training instability due to the forced distribution shift toward off-policy knowledge. To reconcile effective off-policy knowledge absorption with the stability of on-policy RL, we propose Rephrasing Policy Optimization (RePO). In RePO, the policy model is prompted to first comprehend off-policy knowledge and then rephrase it into trajectories that conform to its own stylistic and parametric distribution. RePO dynamically replaces low-reward rollouts with these rephrased, high-quality trajectories. This strategy guides the model toward correct reasoning paths while strictly preserving on-policy training dynamics. Experiments on several benchmarks demonstrate that RePO improves hard-sample utilization and outperforms existing baselines, achieving state-of-the-art performance."

This paper posits a data-centric explanation for this phenomenon, contending that RL's generalization advantage arises from an implicit data filtering mechanism that inherently prioritizes medium-difficulty training samples. To test this hypothesis, we systematically evaluate the OOD generalization of SFT models across training datasets of varying difficulty levels. Our results confirm that data difficulty is a critical factor, revealing that training on hard samples significantly degrades OOD performance. Motivated by this finding, we introduce Difficulty-Curated SFT (DC-SFT), a straightforward method that explicitly filters the training set based on sample difficulty. Experiments show that DC-SFT not only substantially enhances OOD generalization over standard SFT, but also surpasses the performance of RL-based training, all while providing greater stability and computational efficiency. This work offers a data-centric account of the OOD generalization gap in VLMs and establishes a more efficient pathway to achieving robust generalization.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success, however, the emergence of content generation distortion (hallucination) limits their practical applications. The core cause of hallucination lies in LLMs' lack of awareness regarding their stored internal knowledge, preventing them from expressing their knowledge state on questions beyond their internal knowledge boundaries, as humans do. However, existing research on knowledge boundary expression primarily focuses on white-box LLMs, leaving methods suitable for black-box LLMs which offer only API access without revealing internal parameters-largely unexplored. Against this backdrop, this paper proposes LSCL (LLM-Supervised Confidence Learning), a deep learning-based method for expressing the knowledge boundaries of black-box LLMs. Based on the knowledge distillation framework, this method designs a deep learning model. Taking the input question, output answer, and token probability from a black-box LLM as inputs, it constructs a mapping between the inputs and the model' internal knowledge state, enabling the quantification and expression of the black-box LLM' knowledge boundaries. Experiments conducted on diverse public datasets and with multiple prominent black-box LLMs demonstrate that LSCL effectively assists black-box LLMs in accurately expressing their knowledge boundaries. It significantly outperforms existing baseline models on metrics such as accuracy and recall rate. Furthermore, considering scenarios where some black-box LLMs do not support access to token probability, an adaptive alternative method is proposed. The performance of this alternative approach is close to that of LSCL and surpasses baseline models."

The model extends current impulse control formulations by allowing (i) the controller to choose the mean of the stochastic delay of their impulses, and allowing (ii) for multiple pending orders, so that several impulses can be submitted and executed asynchronously at random times. The framework is motivated by an optimal trading problem between centralized (CEX) and decentralized (DEX) exchanges. In DEXs, traders control the distribution of the execution delay through the priority fee paid, introducing a fundamental trade-off between delays, uncertainty, and costs. We study the optimal trading problem of a trader exploiting trading signals in CEXs and DEXs. From a mathematical perspective, we derive the associated dynamic programming principle of this new class of impulse control problems, and establish the viscosity properties of the corresponding quasi-variational inequalities. From a financial perspective, our model provides insights on how to carry out execution across CEXs and DEXs, highlighting how traders manage latency risk optimally through priority fee selection. We show that employing the optimal priority fee has a significant outperformance over non-strategic fee selection."

In this work, we develop a Bayesian framework for signal component decomposition, which combines Gibbs sampling with plug-and-play (PnP) diffusion priors to draw component samples from the posterior distribution. Unlike many existing methods, our framework supports incorporating model-driven and data-driven prior knowledge into the diffusion prior in a unified manner. Moreover, the proposed posterior sampler allows component priors to be learned separately and flexibly combined without retraining. Under suitable assumptions, the proposed DiG sampler provably produces samples from the posterior distribution. We also show that DiG can be interpreted as an extension of a class of recently proposed diffusion-based samplers, and that, for suitable classes of sensing operators, DiG better exploits the structure of the measurement model. Numerical experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our method over existing approaches."

Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as the primary reward provider, leveraging their rich multimodal priors to guide alignment. However, their computation and memory cost can be substantial, and optimizing a latent diffusion generator through a pixel-space reward introduces a domain mismatch that complicates alignment. In this paper, we propose DiNa-LRM, a diffusion-native latent reward model that formulates preference learning directly on noisy diffusion states. Our method introduces a noise-calibrated Thurstone likelihood with diffusion-noise-dependent uncertainty. DiNa-LRM leverages a pretrained latent diffusion backbone with a timestep-conditioned reward head, and supports inference-time noise ensembling, providing a diffusion-native mechanism for test-time scaling and robust rewarding. Across image alignment benchmarks, DiNa-LRM substantially outperforms existing diffusion-based reward baselines and achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art VLMs at a fraction of the computational cost. In preference optimization, we demonstrate that DiNa-LRM improves preference optimization dynamics, enabling faster and more resource-efficient model alignment."

Collectively, these primitives challenge models to solve problems grounded entirely in the immediate context. Our systematic evaluation of 12 representative models reveals significant performance deficits in these tasks. Crucially, our diagnostic analysis disentangles these failure modes.

    "abstract": "Humanoid locomotion has advanced rapidly with deep reinforcement learning (DRL), enabling robust feet-based traversal over uneven terrain. Yet platforms beyond leg length remain largely out of reach because current RL training paradigms often converge to jumping-like solutions that are high-impact, torque-limited, and unsafe for real-world deployment. To address this gap, we propose APEX, a system for perceptive, climbing-based high-platform traversal that composes terrain-conditioned behaviors: climb-up and climb-down at vertical edges, walking or crawling on the platform, and stand-up and lie-down for posture reconfiguration. Central to our approach is a generalized ratchet progress reward for learning contact-rich, goal-reaching maneuvers. It tracks the best-so-far task progress and penalizes non-improving steps, providing dense yet velocity-free supervision that enables efficient exploration under strong safety regularization. Based on this formulation, we train LiDAR-based full-body maneuver policies and reduce the sim-to-real perception gap through a dual strategy: modeling mapping artifacts during training and applying filtering and inpainting to elevation maps during deployment. Finally, we distill all six skills into a single policy that autonomously selects behaviors and transitions based on local geometry and commands. Experiments on a 29-DoF Unitree G1 humanoid demonstrate zero-shot sim-to-real traversal of 0.8 meter platforms (approximately 114% of leg length), with robust adaptation to platform height and initial pose, as well as smooth and stable multi-skill transitions."

Current $P^{-1}$ methods suffer from a fundamental limitation -- they can only generate a fixed surface-like structure in data space, which poorly covers the richness of this space. We address this by a new method that can `sweep' the data space under user control. Our method works generically for any $P$ technique and dataset, is controlled by two intuitive user-set parameters, and is simple to implement.

    "abstract": "The prevailing paradigm in large language model (LLM) development is to pretrain a base model, then perform further training to improve performance and model behavior. However, hyperparameter optimization and scaling laws have been studied primarily from the perspective of the base model's validation loss, ignoring downstream adaptability. In this work, we study pretraining from the perspective of model plasticity, that is, the ability of the base model to successfully adapt to downstream tasks through fine-tuning. We focus on the role of weight decay, a key regularization parameter during pretraining. Through systematic experiments, we show that models trained with larger weight decay values are more plastic, meaning they show larger performance gains when fine-tuned on downstream tasks. This phenomenon can lead to counterintuitive trade-offs where base models that perform worse after pretraining can perform better after fine-tuning. Further investigation of weight decay's mechanistic effects on model behavior reveals that it encourages linearly separable representations, regularizes attention matrices, and reduces overfitting on the training data. In conclusion, this work demonstrates the importance of using evaluation metrics beyond cross-entropy loss for hyperparameter optimization and casts light on the multifaceted role of that a single optimization hyperparameter plays in shaping model behavior."

If a set encodes itself robustly, any partial information about the set suffices to fully recover the information about the original set. Jockusch defined a set $A$ to be introenumerable if each infinite subset of $A$ can enumerate $A$, and this is an example of a set which encodes itself. There are several other notions capturing self-encoding differently. We say $A$ is uniformly introenumerable if each infinite subset of $A$ can uniformly enumerate $A$, whereas $A$ is introreducible if each infinite subset of $A$ can compute $A$. We investigate properties of various notions of self-encoding and prove new results on their interactions. Greenberg, Harrison-Trainor, Patey, and Turetsky showed that we can always find some uniformity from an introenumerable set. We show that this can be reversed: we can construct an introenumerable set by patching up uniformity. This gives a rise to a new method of constructing a nontrivial introenumerable or introreducible set."

To obtain a non-trivial and unique characterization, we define the generalized Pareto principle via the decreasing rearrangement of the gain density function. Within this framework, we analyze both constructed gain densities that exemplify the framework and its imposed restrictions, as well as distribution families commonly encountered in datasets, including power-law, exponential, and normal distributions. Finally, we predict commonly encountered ranges for the generalized Pareto principle and discuss the implications of elevating a structural property into a prescriptive role."

We show that generative methods systematically underperform evolutionary alternatives with respect to other metrics, such as generational distance. We relate this failure mode to the offline-frontier shift, i.e., the displacement of the offline dataset from the Pareto front, which acts as a fundamental limitation in offline MOO. We argue that overcoming this limitation requires out-of-distribution sampling in objective space (via an integral probability metric) and empirically observe that generative methods remain conservatively close to the offline objective distribution. Our results position offline MOO as a distribution-shift--limited problem and provide a diagnostic lens for understanding when and why generative optimization methods fail."

This feature has been proposed as a promising electromagnetic counterpart to MBHB mergers detectable by LISA. In this work, we examine whether non-thermal X-ray emission powered by magnetic reconnection could obscure or modify this thermal X-ray drop. We construct semi-analytic models for both the thermal X-ray emission from minidiscs and the non-thermal synchrotron emission produced by reconnection in magnetically dominated black hole magnetospheres. Evaluating these models across the MBHB mass range relevant for LISA, we find that for physically motivated magnetic field strengths and accretion rates, the non-thermal X-ray luminosity remains several orders of magnitude below the thermal component throughout the inspiral. Even under optimistic assumptions that enhance the non-thermal emission, it remains significantly subdominant. We further incorporate the magnetospheric balding framework to model the decay of non-thermal emission near merger, finding that reconnection-powered X-ray emission fades on short, mass-scaled timescales once the external magnetic flux supply is disrupted. Taken together, our results indicate that non-thermal emission is unlikely to mask the disappearing thermal X-ray signature, reinforcing its robustness as an electromagnetic counterpart to MBHB mergers and its potential utility for multi-messenger studies with LISA."

    "abstract": "Flow-matching models deliver state-of-the-art fidelity in image and video generation, but the inherent sequential denoising process renders them slower. Existing acceleration methods like distillation, trajectory truncation, and consistency approaches are static, require retraining, and often fail to generalize across tasks. We propose FastFlow, a plug-and-play adaptive inference framework that accelerates generation in flow matching models. FastFlow identifies denoising steps that produce only minor adjustments to the denoising path and approximates them without using the full neural network models used for velocity predictions. The approximation utilizes finite-difference velocity estimates from prior predictions to efficiently extrapolate future states, enabling faster advancements along the denoising path at zero compute cost. This enables skipping computation at intermediary steps. We model the decision of how many steps to safely skip before requiring a full model computation as a multi-armed bandit problem. The bandit learns the optimal skips to balance speed with performance. FastFlow integrates seamlessly with existing pipelines and generalizes across image generation, video generation, and editing tasks. Experiments demonstrate a speedup of over 2.6x while maintaining high-quality outputs. The source code for this work can be found at https://github.com/Div290/FastFlow."

Here, we combine theory, simulations and experiments on Sunset Yellow-water chromonic mixtures to show that such materials spontaneously phase separate, even without assuming any underlying microscopic attraction between the molecular species. In our minimal model, demixing depends solely on the Onsager-like coupling between local nematogen density and orientational order. If such a coupling is sufficiently strong, nematic defects trigger the nucleation of isotropic droplets, which then coalesce due to elastic or interfacial tensions. We further show that strong anchoring of the director field at the interface arrests this coarsening process, resulting in a stable microphase separated lamellar pattern. This self-assembled smectic phase has striking and unusual features, including spontaneous undulations, heterogeneous layer spacing, long-lived glassy defect patterns and lamellar onions. Our results identify orientational-density coupling and elastocapillarity as fundamental mechanisms to guide self-assembly in lyotropic and chromonic liquid crystals."

    "abstract": "Enormous fluid antenna systems (E-FAS), the system concept that utilizes position reconfigurability in the large scale, have emerged as a new architectural paradigm where intelligent surfaces are repurposed from passive smart reflectors into multi-functional electromagnetic (EM) interfaces that can route guided surface waves over walls, ceilings, and building facades, as well as emit space waves to target receivers. This expanded functionality introduces a new mode of signal propagation, enabling new forms of wireless communication. In this paper, we provide an analytical performance characterization of an E-FAS-enabled wireless link. We first develop a physics-consistent end-to-end channel model that couples a surface-impedance wave formulation with small-scale fading on both the base station (BS)-surface and launcher-user segments. We illustrate that the resulting effective BS-user channel remains circularly symmetric complex Gaussian, with an enhanced average power that explicitly captures surface-wave attenuation and junction losses. For single-user cases with linear precoding, we derive the outage probability and ergodic capacity in closed forms, together with high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) asymptotics that quantify the gain of E-FAS over purely space-wave propagation. For the multiuser case with zero-forcing (ZF) precoding, we derive the distribution of the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and obtain tractable approximations for the ergodic sum-rate, explicitly revealing how the E-FAS macro-gain interacts with the BS spatial degrees of freedom (DoF). In summary, our analysis shows that E-FAS preserves the diversity order dictated by small-scale fading while improving the coding gain enabled by cylindrical surface-wave propagation."

Using methods borrowed from the theory of resetting processes, we determine the first-passage properties of a collection of independent particles that are synthesized and degraded at constant rates, and follow an arbitrary diffusive process in space. At equal synthesis and degradation rates, the mean reaction time with a target site can be minimized as in stochastic resetting, and a $CV$-criterion is derived. When the degradation rate is held fixed and the synthesis costs are taken into account, an optimal synthesis rate is obtained. In bounded domains, despite particle degradation, SSD improves the mean search time compared to a single non-degrading particle if the synthesis rate exceeds a critical value. The latter obeys a universal relation. We illustrate these findings with Brownian diffusion on the infinite line and in an interval."

Traditional approaches rely on supervised training with word-level aligned data, which is difficult to collect at scale and thus depends on synthetic alignments using language-specific heuristics that are suboptimal. We propose Hibiki-Zero, which eliminates the need for word-level alignments entirely. This fundamentally simplifies the training pipeline and enables seamless scaling to diverse languages with varying grammatical structures, removing the bottleneck of designing language-specific alignment heuristics. We first train on sentence-level aligned data to learn speech translation at high latency, then apply a novel reinforcement learning strategy using GRPO to optimize latency while preserving translation quality. Hibiki-Zero achieves state-of-the-art performance in translation accuracy, latency, voice transfer, and naturalness across five X-to-English tasks. Moreover, we demonstrate that our model can be adapted to support a new input language with less than 1000h of speech. We provide examples, model weights, inference code and we release a benchmark containing 45h of multilingual data for speech translation evaluation."

We classify deflector scale by measuring $θ_{\\rm{E}}$ to determine the mass enclosed by the Einstein radius, $M(<θ_{\\rm{E}})$. We quantify deflector environment by using photometric redshifts to determine the galaxy surface density to the fifth-nearest neighbor $Σ_5(z)$. We find that 47.2% of our deflectors are embedded in cluster environments, whereas only 9.0% have cluster-scale Einstein radii (masses). We measure a weak correlation ($r = 0.38$) between Einstein mass and $Σ_5(z)$, suggesting that the assumption of single galaxy-scale deflectors in lens modeling is overly-simplified. We hypothesize that the weak correlation results from galaxy-scale bias in the original AGEL selection and the observational challenge of detecting faint arcs with large Einstein radii. Comparing number densities, $N_{\\rm{gal}}$, between AGEL and control fields, we find that AGEL deflectors are in systematically denser environments. Our study provides a method to identify strong lenses as a function of deflector environment and approximate the impact of large-scale environment in lens modeling.

Our approach formalizes the intent-to-action pathway with a hierarchical labeling scheme, predicting high-level communicative intents and low-level speech acts to learn their causal and temporal dependencies. To train this system, we develop a high quality corpus that pairs controllable, event-rich dialogue data with human-annotated labels. The GoT framework structures streaming predictions as an evolving graph, enabling a transformer to forecast the next speech act, generate concise justifications for its decisions, and dynamically refine its reasoning.

To address this, we transform multimodal recommendation into discrete semantic tokenization. We present Sparse-Regularized Multimodal Tokenization for Cold-Start Recommendation (MoToRec), a framework centered on a sparsely-regularized Residual Quantized Variational Autoencoder (RQ-VAE) that generates a compositional semantic code of discrete, interpretable tokens, promoting disentangled representations. MoToRec's architecture is enhanced by three synergistic components: (1) a sparsely-regularized RQ-VAE that promotes disentangled representations, (2) a novel adaptive rarity amplification that promotes prioritized learning for cold-start items, and (3) a hierarchical multi-source graph encoder for robust signal fusion with collaborative signals. Extensive experiments on three large-scale datasets demonstrate MoToRec's superiority over state-of-the-art methods in both overall and cold-start scenarios. Our work validates that discrete tokenization provides an effective and scalable alternative for mitigating the long-standing cold-start challenge."

    "abstract": "A fundamental challenge in photonics-based deterministic quantum information processing is to realize key transformations on time scales shorter than those of detrimental decoherence and loss mechanisms. This challenge has been addressed through device-focused approaches that aim to increase nonlinear interactions relative to decoherence rates. In this work, we adopt a complementary architecture-focused approach by proposing a recirculating quantum photonic network (RQPN) that minimizes the duration of quantum information processing tasks, thereby reducing the requirements on nonlinear interaction rates. The RQPN consists of a network of all-to-all connected nonlinear cavities with dynamically controlled waveguide couplings, and it processes information by capturing a photonic input state, recirculating photons between the cavities, and releasing a photonic output state. We demonstrate the RQPN's architectural advantage through two examples: first, we show that processing all qubits simultaneously yields faster operations than single- and two-qubit decompositions of the three-qubit Toffoli gate. Second, we demonstrate implementations of a measurement-free correction for single-photon loss, achieving up to seven-fold speedups and significantly improved hardware efficiency relative to state-of-the-art architecture proposals. Our work shows that a single hardware-efficient recirculating architecture substantially reduces the temporal overhead of multi-qubit gates and quantum error correction, thereby lowering the barrier to experimental realizations of deterministic photonic quantum information processing."

In particular, when the original Hawkes process has a stationary first moment (constant marginal mean), the limiting process takes the form of a time-inhomogeneous rough fractional Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR) equation with a constant mean-reversion parameter and a time-dependent diffusion coefficient. This class of equations is particularly appealing from a practical perspective, especially for the so-called $\\textit{fake stationary rough Heston}$ model.

    "abstract": "Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are characterized by pervasive datafication and surveillance through sensors like in-cabin cameras, LIDAR, and GPS. Drawing on 16 semi-structured interviews with AV drivers analyzed using constructivist grounded theory, this study examines how users make sense of vehicular surveillance within everyday datafication. Findings reveal drivers demonstrate few AV-specific privacy concerns, instead normalizing monitoring through comparisons with established digital platforms. We theorize this indifference by situating AV surveillance within the `surveillance ecology' of platform environments, arguing the datafied car functions as a mobile extension of the `leaky home' -- private spaces rendered permeable through connected technologies continuously transmitting behavioral data. The study contributes to scholarship on surveillance beliefs, datafication, and platform governance by demonstrating how users who have accepted comprehensive smartphone and smart home monitoring encounter AV datafication as just another node in normalized data extraction. We highlight how geographic restrictions on data access -- currently limiting driver log access to California -- create asymmetries that impede informed privacy deliberation, exemplifying `tertiary digital divides.' Finally, we examine how machine learning's reliance on data-intensive approaches creates structural pressure for surveillance that transcends individual manufacturer choices. We propose governance interventions to democratize social learning, including universal data access rights, binding transparency requirements, and data minimization standards to prevent race-to-the-bottom dynamics in automotive datafication."

    "abstract": "With the growing demand for wireless spectrum, dynamic spectrum sharing (DSS) frameworks such as the Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) have emerged as practical solutions to improve utilization while protecting incumbent users (IUs) such as military radars. However, current incumbent protection mechanisms face critical limitations. The Environmental Sensing Capability (ESC) requires costly sensor deployments and remains vulnerable to interference and security risks. Alternatively, the Incumbent Informing Capability (IIC) requires IUs to disclose their identities and operational parameters to the Spectrum Coordination System (SCS), creating linkable records that compromise operational privacy and mission secrecy. We propose IU-GUARD, a privacy-preserving spectrum sharing framework that enables IUs to access spectrum without revealing their identities. Leveraging verifiable credentials (VCs) and zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), IU-GUARD allows IUs to prove their authorization to the SCS while disclosing only essential operational parameters. This decouples IU identity from spectrum access, prevents cross-request linkage, and mitigates the risk of centralized SCS data leakage. We implement a prototype, and our evaluation shows that IU-GUARD achieves strong privacy guarantees with practical computation and communication overhead, making it suitable for real-time DSS deployment."

    "abstract": "Understanding what constitutes high-quality pre-training data remains a central question in language model training. In this work, we investigate whether benchmark performance is primarily driven by the degree of statistical pattern overlap between pre-training corpora and evaluation datasets. We measure this overlap using word-level unigram cross-entropy and word frequency statistics, and perform controlled experiments across $10$ zero-shot benchmarks, $4$ pre-training datasets spanning $8.5\\mathrm{B}$ to $60\\mathrm{B}$ tokens, and model sizes ranging from $400\\mathrm{M}$ to $3\\mathrm{B}$ parameters. Our results demonstrate a robust inverse relationship between word-level unigram cross-entropy and benchmark performance, suggesting that widely used benchmarks are strongly influenced by word overlap between training and evaluation data. Thus, larger pre-training subsets with similar word-level unigram cross-entropy yield improved downstream results, indicating that word frequency statistics play an additional role in shaping benchmark scores. Taken together, these results suggest that many standard benchmarks are only weakly out-of-distribution relative to pre-training corpora, so that simple word-overlap statistics predict benchmark performance."

Initially, they converge towards a solution at a sublinear rate. Then, after a certain point, the method identifies the set of active constraints and the convergence enters a faster local linear regime. Theory characterizing this phenomenon spans over three decades. However, most existing work only guarantees eventual identification of the active set and relies heavily on nondegeneracy conditions, such as strict complementarity, which often fail to hold in practice. We characterize mild conditions on the problem geometry and the algorithm under which this phenomenon provably occurs. Our guarantees are entirely nonasymptotic and, importantly, do not rely on strict complementarity. Our framework encompasses several widely-used algorithms, including the proximal point method, the primal-dual hybrid gradient method, the alternating direction method of multipliers, and the extragradient method."

Yet what constitutes a good workflow depends heavily on the task distribution and the available operators. Under domain shift, current systems typically rely on iterative workflow refinement to discover a feasible workflow from a large workflow space, incurring high iteration costs and yielding unstable, domain-specific behavior. In response, we internalize a decompose-recompose-decide mechanism into an open-source LLM for cross-domain workflow generation. To decompose, we learn a compact set of reusable workflow capabilities across diverse domains. To recompose, we map each input task to a sparse composition over these bases to generate a task-specific workflow in a single pass. To decide, we attribute the success or failure of workflow generation to counterfactual contributions from learned capabilities, thereby capturing which capabilities actually drive success by their marginal effects. Across stringent multi-domain, cross-domain, and unseen-domain evaluations, our 1-pass generator surpasses SOTA refinement baselines that consume 20 iterations, while substantially reducing generation latency and cost."

Modern AI is transforming this process by enabling experts and non-experts alike to generate code without actually writing code, but instead, through natural language instructions, or \"vibe coding\". While increasingly popular, the cumulative impact of vibe coding on productivity and collaboration, as well as the role of humans in this process, remains unclear. Here, we introduce a controlled experimental framework for studying collaborative vibe coding and use it to compare human-led, AI-led, and hybrid groups. Across 16 experiments involving 604 human participants, we show that people provide uniquely effective high-level instructions for vibe coding across iterations, whereas AI-provided instructions often result in performance collapse. We further demonstrate that hybrid systems perform best when humans retain directional control (providing the instructions), while evaluation is delegated to AI."

To validate the efficiency of the proposed method, we conducted comprehensive experiments on five board games: Animal Shogi, Gardner Chess, Go, Hex, and Othello. The results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves more efficient learning than existing methods across these environments. In addition, our extensive ablation study shows the importance of core techniques used in the proposed method. We believe that our efficient algorithm shows the potential of model-free reinforcement learning in domains traditionally dominated by search-based methods."

This work performs the first large-scale study of the 1D Anderson-lattice underlying the Kondo necklace with quasi-exact numerical methods, comparing this with the perturbative effective 1D Kondo-necklace model derived from the former. This study is based on an exact mapping of the Anderson model to one of a superconducting pairing layer connected to a metallic reservoir which is valid in arbitrary spatial dimensions, thereby linking the previously disparate areas of reservoir-enhanced superconductivity, following Kivelson's pioneering proposals, and that of periodic Kondo-systems. Our work reveals that below the length-scales on which the insulating state sets in, which can be very large, superconducting and density-density correlations are degenerate and may both appear to approach an almost ordered state, to a degree that far exceeds that of any isolated 1D pairing layer with short-range interactions. We trace these effects to the effective extended-range coupling that the metallic layer mediates within the pairing layer. These results translate directly to the appearance of near-long-range magnetic order at intermediate scales in the Kondo-systems, and explain the strong renormalization of the RKKY-coupling that we effectively observe, in terms of the back-action of the pairing layer onto the metallic layer. The effects we predict could be tested either by local probes of quasi-1D heavy fermion compounds such as CeCo$_2$Ga$_8$, in engineered chains of ad-atoms or in ultracold atomic gases."

We introduce a canonical model and construct a Lyapunov-based proof establishing local exponential stability of the hovering equilibrium. Crucially, the analysis explicitly addresses the structural challenges - specifically the induced non-minimum-phase behavior - that prevent the application of standard cascade arguments."

In other words, each connected component of $H$ has at least $2$ vertices. This problem naturally arises in graph theory along with other variants of the well-studied Maximum Common Subgraph problem and also has applications in computational social choice. We show that this problem is NP-hard and provide an FPT algorithm when parameterized by $h$. Next, we conduct a study of the problem on common structural parameters like vertex cover number, maximum degree, treedepth, pathwidth and treewidth of one or both input graphs. We derive a complete dichotomy of parameterized results for our problem with respect to individual parameterizations as well as combinations of parameterizations from the above structural parameters. This provides us with a deep insight into the complexity theoretic and parameterized landscape of this problem."

To address this, we study the two-model risk change, $ΔR := R_P(\\tilde{Q}) - R_P(Q)$, under covariate shift. We introduce TRACE (Theoretical Risk Attribution under Covariate-shift Effects), a framework that decomposes $|ΔR|$ into an interpretable upper bound. This decomposition disentangles the risk change into four actionable factors: two generalization gaps, a model change penalty, and a covariate shift penalty, transforming the bound into a powerful diagnostic tool for understanding why performance has changed. To make TRACE a fully computable diagnostic, we instantiate each term. The covariate shift penalty is estimated via a model sensitivity factor (from high-quantile input gradients) and a data-shift measure; we use feature-space Optimal Transport (OT) by default and provide a robust alternative using Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD). The model change penalty is controlled by the average output distance between the two models on the target sample. Generalization gaps are estimated on held-out data. We validate our framework in an idealized linear regression setting, showing the TRACE bound correctly captures the scaling of the true risk difference with the magnitude of the shift. Across synthetic and vision benchmarks, TRACE diagnostics are valid and maintain a strong monotonic relationship with the true performance degradation. Crucially, we derive a deployment gate score that correlates strongly with $|ΔR|$ and achieves high AUROC/AUPRC for gating decisions, enabling safe, label-efficient model replacement."

    "abstract": "The slow iterative sampling nature remains a major bottleneck for the practical deployment of diffusion and flow-based generative models. While consistency models (CMs) represent a state-of-the-art distillation-based approach for efficient generation, their large-scale application is still limited by two key issues: training instability and inflexible sampling. Existing methods seek to mitigate these problems through architectural adjustments or regularized objectives, yet overlook the critical reliance on trajectory selection. In this work, we first conduct an analysis on these two limitations: training instability originates from loss divergence induced by unstable self-supervised term, whereas sampling inflexibility arises from error accumulation. Based on these insights and analysis, we propose the Dual-End Consistency Model (DE-CM) that selects vital sub-trajectory clusters to achieve stable and effective training. DE-CM decomposes the PF-ODE trajectory and selects three critical sub-trajectories as optimization targets. Specifically, our approach leverages continuous-time CMs objectives to achieve few-step distillation and utilizes flow matching as a boundary regularizer to stabilize the training process. Furthermore, we propose a novel noise-to-noisy (N2N) mapping that can map noise to any point, thereby alleviating the error accumulation in the first step. Extensive experimental results show the effectiveness of our method: it achieves a state-of-the-art FID score of 1.70 in one-step generation on the ImageNet 256x256 dataset, outperforming existing CM-based one-step approaches."

However, the variance of the imbalance of the unspecified covariates may be inflated comparing to the one under the simple randomization. The inflation of the variance causes the usual test of treatment effects being not valid and adjusting the test being not an easy work. In this paper, we propose a new kind covariate adaptive randomization procedures to balance covariates between two treatments with a ratio $ρ:(1-ρ)$. Under this kind of CAR procedures, the convergence rate of the imbalance of the specified covariates is $o(n^{1/2})$, and at the same time the asymptotic variance of the imbalance of any unspecified (observed or unobserved) covariates does not exceed the one under the simple randomization. The ``shift problem'' found by Liu, Hu, and Ma (2025) will not appear under the new CAR procedures."

OccFace adopts a unified dense 100-point layout and a heatmap-based backbone, and adds an occlusion module that jointly predicts landmark coordinates and per-point visibility by combining local evidence with cross-landmark context. Visibility supervision mixes manual labels with landmark-aware masking that derives pseudo visibility from mask-heatmap overlap. We also create an occlusion-aware evaluation suite reporting NME on visible vs. occluded landmarks and benchmarking visibility with Occ AP, F1@0.5, and ROC-AUC, together with a dataset annotated with 100-point landmarks and per-point visibility.

This paper presents a dual-loop architecture that combines an inner-loop non-minimum-phase resonant controller (NRC) for active damping with an outer-loop tracking controller augmented by a constant-gain, lead-in-phase (CgLp) reset element to provide phase lead at the targeted crossover without increasing loop gain. We show that aggressively tuned CgLp designs with larger phase lead can introduce pronounced higher-order harmonics, degrading error sensitivity in specific frequency bands and causing multiple-reset behavior. To address this, a shaping filter is introduced in the reset-trigger path to regulate the reset action and suppress harmonic-induced effects while preserving the desired crossover-phase recovery. The proposed controllers are implemented in real time on an industrial piezo nanopositioner, demonstrating an experimental open-loop crossover increase of approximately 55~Hz and a closed-loop bandwidth improvement of about 34~Hz relative to a well-tuned linear baseline."

RQ1: At the backbone level, the VLM can introduce additional subspaces upon the vision-only backbones. RQ2: This unique subspace leads to a different behavioral in some long-tail scenario: the VLM tends to be more aggressive whereas ViT is more conservative, and each decisively wins on about 2--3% of test scenarios; With an oracle that selects, per scenario, the better trajectory between the VLM and ViT branches, we obtain an upper bound of 93.58 PDMS. RQ3: To fully harness this observation, we propose HybridDriveVLA, which runs both ViT and VLM branches and selects between their endpoint trajectories using a learned scorer, improving PDMS to 92.10. Finally, DualDriveVLA implements a practical fast--slow policy: it runs ViT by default and invokes the VLM only when the scorer's confidence falls below a threshold; calling the VLM on 15% of scenarios achieves 91.00 PDMS while improving throughput by 3.2x.

    "abstract": "The task of graph-level anomaly detection (GLAD) is to identify anomalous graphs that deviate significantly from the majority of graphs in a dataset. While deep GLAD methods have shown promising performance, their black-box nature limits their reliability and deployment in real-world applications. Although some recent methods have made attempts to provide explanations for anomaly detection results, they either provide explanations without referencing normal graphs, or rely on abstract latent vectors as prototypes rather than concrete graphs from the dataset. To address these limitations, we propose Prototype-based Graph-Level Anomaly Detection (ProtoGLAD), an interpretable unsupervised framework that provides explanation for each detected anomaly by explicitly contrasting with its nearest normal prototype graph. It employs a point-set kernel to iteratively discover multiple normal prototype graphs and their associated clusters from the dataset, then identifying graphs distant from all discovered normal clusters as anomalies. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that ProtoGLAD achieves competitive anomaly detection performance compared to state-of-the-art GLAD methods while providing better human-interpretable prototype-based explanations."

    "abstract": "The evaluation of informative path planning algorithms for autonomous vehicles is often hindered by fragmented execution pipelines and limited transferability between simulation and real-world deployment. This paper introduces a unified architecture that decouples high-level decision-making from vehicle-specific control, enabling algorithms to be evaluated consistently across different abstraction levels without modification. The proposed architecture is realized through GuadalPlanner, which defines standardized interfaces between planning, sensing, and vehicle execution. It is an open and extensible research tool that supports discrete graph-based environments and interchangeable planning strategies, and is built upon widely adopted robotics technologies, including ROS2, MAVLink, and MQTT. Its design allows the same algorithmic logic to be deployed in fully simulated environments, software-in-the-loop configurations, and physical autonomous vehicles using an identical execution pipeline. The approach is validated through a set of experiments, including real-world deployment on an autonomous surface vehicle performing water quality monitoring with real-time sensor feedback."

    "abstract": "Generative recommendation via autoregressive models has unified retrieval and ranking into a single conditional generation framework. However, fine-tuning these models with Reinforcement Learning (RL) often suffers from a fundamental probability-reward mismatch. Conventional likelihood-dominated decoding (e.g., beam search) exhibits a myopic bias toward locally probable prefixes, which causes two critical failures: (1) insufficient exploration, where high-reward items in low-probability branches are prematurely pruned and rarely sampled, and (2) advantage compression, where trajectories sharing high-probability prefixes receive highly correlated rewards with low within-group variance, yielding a weak comparative signal for RL. To address these challenges, we propose V-STAR, a Value-guided Sampling and Tree-structured Advantage Reinforcement framework. V-STAR forms a self-evolving loop via two synergistic components. First, a Value-Guided Efficient Decoding (VED) is developed to identify decisive nodes and selectively deepen high-potential prefixes. This improves exploration efficiency without exhaustive tree search. Second, we propose Sibling-GRPO, which exploits the induced tree topology to compute sibling-relative advantages and concentrates learning signals on decisive branching decisions. Extensive experiments on both offline and online datasets demonstrate that V-STAR outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, delivering superior accuracy and candidate-set diversity under strict latency constraints."

    "abstract": "Unbalanced Optimal Transport (UOT) has emerged as a robust relaxation of standard Optimal Transport, particularly effective for handling outliers and mass variations. However, scalable algorithms for UOT, specifically those based on Gradient Descent (SGD), remain largely underexplored. In this work, we address this gap by analyzing the semi-dual formulation of Entropic UOT and demonstrating its suitability for adaptive gradient methods. While the semi-dual is a standard tool for large-scale balanced OT, its geometry in the unbalanced setting appears ill-conditioned under standard analysis. Specifically, worst-case bounds on the marginal penalties using $χ^2$ divergence suggest a condition number scaling with $n/\\varepsilon$, implying poor scalability. In contrast, we show that the local condition number actually scales as $\\mathcal{O}(1/\\varepsilon)$, effectively removing the ill-conditioned dependence on $n$. Exploiting this property, we prove that SGD methods adapt to this local curvature, achieving a convergence rate of $\\mathcal{O}(n/\\varepsilon T)$ in the stochastic and online regimes, making it suitable for large-scale and semi-discrete applications. Finally, for the full batch discrete setting, we derive a nearly tight upper bound on local smoothness depending solely on the gradient. Using it to adapt step sizes, we propose a modified Adaptive Nesterov Accelerated Gradient (ANAG) method on the semi-dual functional and prove that it achieves a local complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(n^2\\sqrt{1/\\varepsilon}\\ln(1/δ))$."

    "abstract": "The neutral silicon--vacancy (SiV$^{0}$) center in diamond combines inversion symmetry with optical emission, making it a robust quantum emitter resilient to stray electric fields. Using first-principles density-functional theory, we quantify its response to isotropic strain spanning strong compression and tensile regimes (effective hydrostatic pressures of approximately $-80$ to $180$~GPa). The coexistence of doubly degenerate $e_g$ and $e_u$ levels produces a structural instability captured by a quadratic product Jahn--Teller model. Under isotropic compression, the zero-phonon line blue-shifts nearly linearly while the $E_g$ phonon stiffens, suppressing vibronic instabilities and reducing Jahn--Teller quenching. Consequently, the Ham-reduced excited-state spin--orbit splitting increases substantially and the dark--bright vibronic gap widens. In contrast, isotropic tensile strain enhances vibronic effects and induces symmetry breaking beyond a critical strain, with tunneling-mediated dynamical averaging at the onset. Throughout the symmetry-preserving regime, parity remains well defined, so isotropic strain alone does not activate the dark transition. Charge-transition levels indicate photostability of the emission deep into the compressive regime, and near the highest photostable deformation ($\\sim 100$~GPa), the radiative lifetime increases due to a reduced transition dipole moment despite the increasing optical energy. These trends yield compact calibration relations linking optical and spin observables to isotropic strain and establish SiV$^{0}$ as a symmetry-protected, strain-tunable quantum emitter operating into the multi-megabar-equivalent regime."

The TWSD can reduce the forward velocity of a molecular beam of heavy neutral polar molecules such as strontium monofluoride (SrF) and barium monofluoride (BaF) from $\\sim$ 200 m/s down to $\\sim$ 6 m/s. The main motivation for the development of this device is the increased sensitivity from precision spectroscopy of the decelerated molecules to test fundamental physics. The high-voltage generation system can produce eight pulsed sinusoidal waveforms with a maximum amplitude of 10 kV and a linear frequency sweep from 16.7 kHz down to 500 Hz over the span of 40 ms at a repetition rate of 10 Hz. The eight waveforms are phase-offset to each other by 45 degrees. To slow down the heavy molecules, the decelerator is required to have a length of $\\sim$ 4 m, which results in a significant capacitive coupling between adjacent channels of $\\sim$ 160 pF. As a consequence, the control and stability of the waveforms is extra challenging. We designed a method that compensates for the frequency-dependent coupling between the eight channels. Allowing for amplitude and phase-offsets that do not deviate more than 1% and 2 degrees, respectively, from their design values during the frequency sweep. The system outperforms commercially available options in terms of stability, output voltage amplitude, cost and ease of maintenance. This approach is also relevant for other fields where precise control of high-voltage waveforms is required, such as particle accelerator physics, plasma physics and mass spectroscopy."

The plastic events collectively induce distributed dipoles that are responsible for screening effects and the creation of typical length-scales that are absent in classical elasticity theory. The nonlinear theory exposes an instability that results in the creation of shear bands. By solving the weakly nonlinear amplitude equation we present analytic expressions for the displacement fields that is associated with shear bands, explaining the role of the elastic moduli that determine the width of a shear band from ductile to brittle characteristics. We derive an energy functional whose Hessian possesses an eigenvalue that goes to zero at the shear-banding instability, providing a prediction for the critical value of the accumulated stress that results in an instability."

    "abstract": "We investigate the effects of different dust and gas opacity descriptions on the structure and evolution of the inner regions of protoplanetary discs. The influence on the episodic instability of the inner rim is hereby of central interest. 2D axisymmetric radiation hydrodynamic models are employed to simulate the evolution of the inner disc over several thousand years. Our simulations greatly expand on previous models by implementing detailed opacity descriptions in terms of their mean and frequency-dependent values, allowing us to also consider binned frequency-dependent irradiation. The adaptive opacity description significantly affects the structure of the inner disc rim, with gas opacities exerting the greatest influence. The resulting effects include shifts in the position of both the dust sublimation front and the dead zone inner edge, a significantly altered temperature in the dust-free region and the manifestation of an equilibrium temperature degeneracy as a sharp temperature transition. The episodic instability due to MRI activation in the dead zone still occurs, but at lower inner disc densities. While the gas opacities set the initial conditions for the instability, the evolution of the outburst itself is mainly governed by the dust opacities. The analysis of criteria for non-axisymmetric instabilities reveals possible breaking of the density peaks produced by the burst. However, due to the periodicity of the instability, the inner edge itself may remain stable throughout quiescent phases according to linear criteria. Although the thermal structure of the inner disc is crucially affected by different opacity descriptions, the mechanism of the periodic instability of the DZIE remains active and is only marginally influenced by gas opacities. The observational consequences of the severely altered temperatures may be significant and require further investigation."

It is based on the log-normal Poisson model, which offers more flexibility in the variance of counts than a Poisson model. A latent variable is added for the overrepresentation of zeros in the data. The imputation of missing data is made possible by assuming that the latent variance matrix has low rank and the inclusion of covariates. \\\\ We demonstrate the identifiability in the presence of missing data. Since maximum likelihood inference is intractable, we use a variational expectation-maximization algorithm to infer the parameters. We provide an estimate of the asymptotic variance of the estimators and derive prediction intervals for the imputations, an estimate of the temporal trend, and a procedure for detecting a potential change in this trend. \\\\ We evaluate our imputations and associated prediction intervals using artificially degraded monitoring data set.

We control this enlargement via a Gaussian measure bound stable under Euclidean thickening.

    "abstract": "The success of text-guided diffusion models has established a new image generation paradigm driven by the iterative refinement of text prompts. However, modifying the original text prompt to achieve the expected semantic adjustments often results in unintended global structure changes that disrupt user intent. Existing methods rely on empirical feature map selection for intervention, whose performance heavily depends on appropriate selection, leading to suboptimal stability. This paper tries to solve the aforementioned problem from a frequency perspective and analyzes the impact of the frequency spectrum of noisy latent variables on the hierarchical emergence of the structure framework and fine-grained textures during the generation process. We find that lower-frequency components are primarily responsible for establishing the structure framework in the early generation stage. Their influence diminishes over time, giving way to higher-frequency components that synthesize fine-grained textures. In light of this, we propose a training-free frequency modulation method utilizing a frequency-dependent weighting function with dynamic decay. This method maintains the structure framework consistency while permitting targeted semantic modifications. By directly manipulating the noisy latent variable, the proposed method avoids the empirical selection of internal feature maps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods, achieving an effective balance between preserving structure and enabling semantic updates."

In this paper, we aim to compile a sample of Fermi blazars and radio galaxies to provide new insights towards a unified accretion and ejection scenario between aligned and misaligned radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGNs), by considering their optical emission-line classifications (low- and high-excitation radio galaxies, LERGs, HERGs), which are more representative of their accretion states. We adopted statistical analyses of accretion properties and high-energy beaming patterns for both Fermi blazars and radio galaxies to investigate a unified accretion-ejection scenario. In the gamma-ray luminosity-photon index plane, HERGs populate the region of higher luminosities and softer photon indices, akin to FSRQs, whereas LERGs fill lower luminosities with harder photon indices, analogous to BL Lacs. This parallel segregation indicates that LERGs and HERGs represent the misaligned counterparts of BL Lacs and FSRQs, respectively. The unified picture is further supported by the Compton dominance-photon index diagram, where FSRQs and HERGs dominated by external Compton (EC) emissions are distinctly separated from BL Lacs and LERGs governed by synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) emissions. Similarly, the diagram of accretion rate versus gamma-ray photon index reveals two distinct accretion-ejection states: a low-accretion-rate branch (BL Lacs and LERGs) is associated with the SSC model, and a high-accretion-rate branch (FSRQs and HERGs) is linked to the EC model. These results strongly strengthen the idea of a unified accretion and ejection paradigm between blazars and radio galaxies into two distinct states."

To address these challenges, we propose SRast, a novel physically constrained generalist framework designed for robust spatial transcriptomics super-resolution. To tackle heterogeneity, SRast employs a strategic decoupling architecture that explicitly decouples gene semantics representation from spatial geometry deconvolution, utilizing self-supervised learning to align latent distributions and mitigate cross-sample shifts. Regarding physical priors, SRast reformulates the task as ratio prediction on the simplex, performing a flow matching model to learn optimal transport-based geometric transformations that strictly enforce local mass conservation. Extensive experiments across diverse species, tissues, and platforms demonstrate that SRast achieves state-of-the-art performance, exhibiting superior zero-shot generalization capabilities and ensuring physical consistency in recovering fine-grained biological structures."

Then, we apply it to compute the eigenvalues of the free oscillation of Earth, assuming that Earth is a unit ball modeled as a homogeneous and isotropic q-EBM. So far, an analytical and systematic way to compute the eigenvalues of the FOE has been missing when modeling Earth as a q-EBM. In particular, we compute some clusters of eigenvalues (abbreviated by C-ev's). To be more precise, integrating by parts with respect to time of the q-EBM under the assumption that the initial strain is zero, the q-EBM becomes the sum of two terms. The first term, called the instantaneous term, doesn't have any integration with respect to time, but the second term, called the memory term, has such an integration. Then, consider the eigenvalues of the instantaneous part of the q-EBM. The eigenfunctions of C-ev's share the same eigenfunctions of the instantaneous part. However, the C-ev's may be shifted from the eigenvalues of the instantaneous part. Further, we analyze the structure of C-ev's and provide an inversion formula identifying the q-EBM from the C-ev's."

Although useful, task-specific modeling often increases training costs and limits generalization across behavioral settings. Recent reasoning RL methods facilitate training a single unified model across multiple behavioral tasks, but do not explicitly address learning across different heterogeneous behavioral data. To address this gap, we introduce Heterogeneity-Aware Relative Policy Optimization (HARPO), an RL method that balances leaning across heterogeneous tasks and samples. This is achieved by modulating advantages to ensure that no single task or sample carries disproportionate influence during policy optimization. Using HARPO, we develop and release Omnisapiens-7B 2.0, a foundation model for social behavior processing. Relative to existing behavioral foundation models, Omnisapiens-7B 2.0 achieves the strongest performance across behavioral tasks, with gains of up to +16.85% and +9.37% on multitask and held-out settings respectively, while producing more explicit and robust reasoning traces. We also validate HARPO against recent RL methods, where it achieves the most consistently strong performance across behavioral tasks."

Central to this mathematical achievement is the ``ghost equation'' methodology, a sophisticated auxiliary derivation that bypasses the non-differentiability of classical Euler-Lagrange systems. We propose that the next era of mathematical discovery lies in the integration of these pure analytical constructs with LRMs grounded in topos theory and formal verification frameworks such as Safe and Typed Chain-of-Thought (PC-CoT). By modeling the reasoning process as a categorical colimit in a slice topos, we demonstrate how LRMs can autonomously navigate the ``Dark Side'' of the calculus of variations, providing machine-checkable proofs for regularity bounds in complex, multi-phase physical systems."

Synthetic data produced by generative artificial intelligence (genAI) models trained on real data is often seen as one possible solution to comply with privacy regulations. While powerful genAI models for heterogeneous hospital time series have recently been introduced, such modeling does not guarantee privacy protection, as the generated data may still reveal identifying information about individuals in the models' training cohort. Applying established privacy mechanisms to generative time series models, however, proves challenging as post-hoc data anonymization through k-anonymization or similar techniques is limited, while model-centered privacy mechanisms that implement differential privacy (DP) may lead to unstable training, compromising the utility of generated data. Given these known limitations, privacy audits for generative time series models are currently indispensable regardless of the concrete privacy mechanisms applied to models and/or data. In this work, we use a battery of established privacy attacks to audit state-of-the-art hospital time series models, trained on the public MIMIC-IV dataset, with respect to privacy preservation. Furthermore, the eICU dataset was used to mount a privacy attack against the synthetic data generator trained on the MIMIC-IV dataset. Results show that established privacy attacks are ineffective against generated multivariate clinical time series when synthetic data generators are trained on large enough training datasets. Furthermore, we discuss how the use of existing DP mechanisms for these synthetic data generators would not bring desired improvement in privacy, but only a decrease in utility for machine learning prediction tasks."

    "abstract": "Reward models learned from human preferences are central to aligning large language models (LLMs) via reinforcement learning from human feedback, yet they are often vulnerable to reward hacking due to noisy annotations and systematic biases such as response length or style. We propose Bayesian Non-Negative Reward Model (BNRM), a principled reward modeling framework that integrates non-negative factor analysis into Bradley-Terry (BT) preference model. BNRM represents rewards through a sparse, non-negative latent factor generative process that operates at two complementary levels: instance-specific latent variables induce disentangled reward representations, while sparsity over global latent factors acts as an implicit debiasing mechanism that suppresses spurious correlations. Together, this disentanglement-then-debiasing structure enables robust uncertainty-aware reward learning. To scale BNRM to modern LLMs, we develop an amortized variational inference network conditioned on deep model representations, allowing efficient end-to-end training. Extensive empirical results demonstrate that BNRM substantially mitigates reward over-optimization, improves robustness under distribution shifts, and yields more interpretable reward decompositions than strong baselines."

    "abstract": "While recent advances in Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) have shown that rule-based reward schemes can enable effective post-training for large language models, their extension to cross-modal, vision-centric domains remains largely underexplored. This limitation is especially pronounced in the medical imaging domain, where effective performance requires both robust visual perception and structured reasoning. In this work, we address this gap by proposing VRFT-Aug, a visual reinforcement fine-tuning framework tailored for the medical domain. VRFT-Aug introduces a series of training strategies designed to augment both perception and reasoning, including prior knowledge injection, perception-driven policy refinement, medically informed reward shaping, and behavioral imitation. Together, these methods aim to stabilize and improve the RFT process. Through extensive experiments across multiple medical datasets, we show that our approaches consistently outperform both standard supervised fine-tuning and RFT baselines. Moreover, we provide empirically grounded insights and practical training heuristics that can be generalized to other medical image tasks. We hope this work contributes actionable guidance and fresh inspiration for the ongoing effort to develop reliable, reasoning-capable models for high-stakes medical applications."

    "abstract": "Packet-level discrete-event simulation (PLDES) is a prevalent tool for evaluating detailed performance of large model training. Although PLDES offers high fidelity and generality, its slow performance has plagued networking practitioners. Existing optimization techniques either simplify the network model, resulting in large errors; or execute it in parallel using multiple processors, with an upper bound on speedup. This paper explores an alternative optimization direction that reduces the computational loads of PLDES while maintaining high fidelity. Our key insight is that, in distributed LLM training, packet-level traffic behaviors often exhibit repetitive contention patterns and steady-states where flow rates stabilize, ignoring these redundant discrete events speeds up the simulation considerably and the error is negligible. We realize this idea by proposing Wormhole, a user-transparent PLDES kernel capable of automatically memoization for unsteady-states and skipping for steady-states. Wormhole adopts network partitioning, state memoization and reuse, and rate-based steady-state identification to accurately determine the periods of each flow's steady-state, while maintaining simulation consistency after fast-forwarding. Experiments demonstrate that Wormhole can achieve a 744x speedup over the original ns-3 (510x for MoE workload), with a bounded error of <1%. Applying current multithreading parallel techniques and Wormhole together allows a 1012x speedup, reducing the simulation time for one GPT-13B training under 128 GPUs from 9 hours to 5 minutes."

This paper presents a nonlinear, model-based framework for magnetic pitch control of an ingestible capsule robot actuated by a four-coil electromagnetic array. Angle-dependent magnetic forces and torques acting on embedded permanent magnets are characterized using three-dimensional finite-element simulations and embedded as lookup tables in a control-oriented rigid-body pitching model with rolling contact and actuator dynamics. A constrained model predictive controller (MPC) is designed to regulate pitch while respecting hardware-imposed current and slew-rate limits. Experiments on a compliant stomach-inspired surface demonstrate robust pitch reorientation from both horizontal and upright configurations, achieving about three to five times faster settling and reduced oscillatory motion than on-off control. Furthermore, an extended Kalman filter (EKF) fusing inertial sensing with intermittent visual measurements enables stable closed-loop control when the camera update rate is reduced from 30 Hz to 1 Hz, emulating clinically realistic imaging constraints. These results establish finite-element-informed MPC with sensor fusion as a scalable strategy for pitch regulation, controlled docking, and future multi-degree-of-freedom capsule locomotion."

We prove that HZO reduces the query complexity from $O(ML^2)$ to $O(ML \\log L)$ for a network of width $M$ and depth $L$, representing a significant leap over existing ZO methodologies.

We introduce dnaHNet, a state-of-the-art tokenizer-free autoregressive model that segments and models genomic sequences end-to-end. Using a differentiable dynamic chunking mechanism, dnaHNet compresses raw nucleotides into latent tokens adaptively, balancing compression with predictive accuracy. Pretrained on prokaryotic genomes, dnaHNet outperforms leading architectures including StripedHyena2 in scaling and efficiency. This recursive chunking yields quadratic FLOP reductions, enabling $>3 \\times$ inference speedup over Transformers. On zero-shot tasks, dnaHNet achieves superior performance in predicting protein variant fitness and gene essentiality, while automatically discovering hierarchical biological structures without supervision. These results establish dnaHNet as a scalable, interpretable framework for next-generation genomic modeling."

Traditionally, photoelectrical signals are transmitted from the cryogenic region to the outside using coaxial cables through vacuum feedthroughs on the cryostats. In this paper, we investigate an analog optical transmission method in which the raw electrical signals are converted into optical signals with light intensity linearly proportional to the electrical amplitude, transmitted out of the cryogenic environment through optical fiber, and subsequently converted back into electrical signals by photoelectric devices while preserving the signal waveform. This new approach offers advantages, including low attenuation over long-distance transmission and reduced crosstalk across the feedthroughs. Additionally, the low-temperature optical wavelength multiplexing scheme has been investigated and applied, increasing the transmission capability of a single fiber. At -100 degree Celsius, the proposed analog optical readout system achieves a -3dB bandwidth of larger than 150MHz, a dynamic range of up to 500mV, and a low cryogenic-region power consumption of 70mW per channel, demonstrating its strong potential for low-temperature experiments."

Standard Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) offer clear feature attributions but are often constrained by their strictly additive nature, which can limit predictive performance. Introducing feature interactions can boost accuracy yet may obscure individual feature contributions. To address these issues, we propose Neural Additive Experts (NAEs), a novel framework that seamlessly balances interpretability and accuracy. NAEs employ a mixture of experts framework, learning multiple specialized networks per feature, while a dynamic gating mechanism integrates information across features, thereby relaxing rigid additive constraints. Furthermore, we propose targeted regularization techniques to mitigate variance among expert predictions, facilitating a smooth transition from an exclusively additive model to one that captures intricate feature interactions while maintaining clarity in feature attributions. Our theoretical analysis and experiments on synthetic data illustrate the model's flexibility, and extensive evaluations on real-world datasets confirm that NAEs achieve an optimal balance between predictive accuracy and transparent, feature-level explanations.

    "abstract": "Privacy-preserving training on sensitive data commonly relies on differentially private stochastic optimization with gradient clipping and Gaussian noise. The clipping threshold is a critical control knob: if set too small, systematic over-clipping induces optimization bias; if too large, injected noise dominates updates and degrades accuracy. Existing adaptive clipping methods often depend on per-example gradient norm statistics, adding computational overhead and introducing sensitivity to datasets and architectures. We propose a control-driven clipping strategy that adapts the threshold using a lightweight, weight-only spectral diagnostic computed from model parameters. At periodic probe steps, the method analyzes a designated weight matrix via spectral decomposition and estimates a heavy-tailed spectral indicator associated with training stability. This indicator is smoothed over time and fed into a bounded feedback controller that updates the clipping threshold multiplicatively in the log domain. Because the controller uses only parameters produced during privacy-preserving training, the resulting threshold updates are post-processing and do not increase privacy loss beyond that of the underlying DP optimizer under standard composition accounting."

    "abstract": "Standard autoregressive language models generate text token-by-token from a fixed vocabulary, inducing a tree-structured state space when viewing token sampling as an action, which limits flexibility and expressiveness. Recent work introduces dynamic vocabulary by sampling retrieved text spans but overlooks that the same sentence can be composed of spans of varying lengths, lacking explicit modeling of the directed acyclic graph (DAG) state space. This leads to restricted exploration of compositional paths and is biased toward the chosen path. Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) are powerful for efficient exploring and generalizing over state spaces, particularly those with a DAG structure. However, prior GFlowNets-based language models operate at the token level and remain confined to tree-structured spaces, limiting their potential. In this work, we propose Flow of SpanS (FOSS), a principled GFlowNets framework for span generation. FoSS constructs a dynamic span vocabulary by segmenting the retrieved text flexibly, ensuring a DAG-structured state space, which allows GFlowNets to explore diverse compositional paths and improve generalization. With specialized reward models, FoSS generates diverse, high-quality text. Empirically, FoSS improves MAUVE scores by up to 12.5% over Transformer on text generation and achieves 3.5% gains on knowledge-intensive tasks, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Scaling experiments further demonstrate FoSS benefits from larger models, more data, and richer retrieval corpora, retaining its advantage over strong baselines."

This paradigm fails to update the model's internal representations based on search feedback, often yielding physically inconsistent or mathematically redundant expressions. In this work, we propose PiT-PO (Physics-informed Token-regularized Policy Optimization), a unified framework that evolves the LLM into an adaptive generator via reinforcement learning. Central to PiT-PO is a dual-constraint mechanism that rigorously enforces hierarchical physical validity while simultaneously applying fine-grained, token-level penalties to suppress redundant structures. Consequently, PiT-PO aligns LLM to produce equations that are both scientifically consistent and structurally parsimonious. Empirically, PiT-PO achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks and successfully discovers novel turbulence models for challenging fluid dynamics problems. We also demonstrate that PiT-PO empowers small-scale models to outperform closed-source giants, democratizing access to high-performance scientific discovery."

First, the aeroelastic system is modeled as two-dimensional coupled wave PDEs with internal anti-damping terms, derived by Piston theory and Hamilton's principle. Using Fourier series expansion, the 2-D problem is decomposed into a parameterized family of 1-D systems. For each mode, a full-state boundary feedback controller is designed via PDE backstepping transformation. To enable output-feedback implementation, a state observer is further designed to estimate the distributed states over the two-dimensional spatial domain. Through Lyapunov analysis, the exponential stability of the 2-D elastic plate PDE under the proposed boundary control is established with a designer-tunable decay rate. Numerical simulations verify the effectiveness of the control strategy in suppressing flow-induced vibrations."

Interpreting ECGs is inherently challenging, and diagnostic accuracy can vary depending on the interpreter's experience. Although echocardiography provides rich diagnostic information, it requires specialized equipment and personnel, limiting its availability. In this study, we focus on constructing a robust ECG encoder for multimodal pretraining using real world hospital data. We employ SigLIP, a CLIP based model with a sigmoid based loss function enabling multi label prediction, and introduce a modified loss function tailored to the multi label nature of ECG data. Experiments demonstrate that incorporating medical knowledge in the language model and applying the modified loss significantly improve multi label ECG classification. To further enhance performance, we increase the embedding dimensionality and apply random cropping to mitigate data drift. Finally, per label analysis reveals which ECG findings are easier or harder to predict. Our study provides a foundational framework for developing medical models that utilize ECG data."

To achieve this, we develop a stabilized discretization approach that guarantees the preservation of the original energy dissipation law and ensures the boundedness of each gas component's molar density. Furthermore, the proposed method incorporates an adaptive time-stepping strategy that dynamically adjusts the time step size based on the system's dynamics, significantly enhancing computational efficiency without compromising stability or accuracy. For spatial discretization, a mixed finite element method combined with an upwind scheme is employed for the flow and transport equations to ensure local mass conservation, while a discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method is utilized for discretizing the momentum equation of poroelasticity to effectively overcome numerical locking phenomena. Numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the performance, robustness, and applicability of the method in simulating multicomponent gas flow under various scenarios."

    "abstract": "Multi-sensor fusion is central to robust robotic perception, yet most existing systems operate under static sensor configurations, collecting all modalities at fixed rates and fidelity regardless of their situational utility. This rigidity wastes bandwidth, computation, and energy, and prevents systems from prioritizing sensors under challenging conditions such as poor lighting or occlusion. Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) and modality-aware fusion suggest the potential for adaptive perception, but prior efforts have largely focused on re-weighting features at inference time, ignoring the physical cost of sensor data collection. We introduce a framework that unifies sensing, learning, and actuation into a closed reconfiguration loop. A task-specific detection backbone extracts multispectral features (e.g. RGB, IR, mmWave, depth) and produces quantitative contribution scores for each modality. These scores are passed to an RL agent, which dynamically adjusts sensor configurations, including sampling frequency, resolution, sensing range, and etc., in real time. Less informative sensors are down-sampled or deactivated, while critical sensors are sampled at higher fidelity as environmental conditions evolve. We implement and evaluate this framework on a mobile rover, showing that adaptive control reduces GPU load by 29.3\\% with only a 5.3\\% accuracy drop compared to a heuristic baseline. These results highlight the potential of resource-aware adaptive sensing for embedded robotic platforms."

    "abstract": "The rapid advancement of generative AI has raised concerns about the authenticity of digital images, as highly realistic fake images can now be generated at low cost, potentially increasing societal risks. In response, several datasets have been established to train detection models aimed at distinguishing AI-generated images from real ones. However, existing datasets suffer from limited generalization, low image quality, overly simple prompts, and insufficient image diversity. To address these limitations, we propose a high-quality, large-scale dataset comprising over 730,000 images across multiple categories, including both real and AI-generated images. The generated images are synthesized via state-of-the-art methods, including text-to-image generation (guided by over 10,000 carefully designed prompts), image inpainting, image refinement, and face swapping. Each generated image is annotated with its generation method and category. Inpainting images further include binary masks to indicate inpainted regions, providing rich metadata for analysis. Compared to existing datasets, detection models trained on our dataset demonstrate superior generalization capabilities. Our dataset not only serves as a strong benchmark for evaluating detection methods but also contributes to advancing the robustness of AI-generated image detection techniques. Building upon this, we propose a lightweight detection method based on image noise entropy, which transforms the original image into an entropy tensor of Non-Local Means (NLM) noise before classification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that models trained on our dataset achieve strong generalization, and our method delivers competitive performance, establishing a solid baseline for future research. The dataset and source code are publicly available at https://real-hd.github.io."

    "abstract": "Electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) has been established as a powerful analytical technique for investigating the oxidation state, band structure, and dielectric properties of materials with exceptional spatial resolution. Inspired by twisted 2D materials, we utilize low-loss EELS to examine the plasmonic excitations in 2D moiré Au nanocrystal superlattices (NCSLs) formed by liquid-air interface self-assembly using a double-dipping method. This approach produces stacked hexagonal layers that can be twisted, forming moiré patterns in NCSLs whose twist angles are precisely measured via scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). Low-loss EELS effectively mitigates challenges arising from fabrication-induced non-uniformity and reveals a blue shift in plasmonic excitation when comparing single-layer, double-layer, and twisted configurations. This sharply contrasts with the optical spectroscopy measurements, which show an overall red shift relative to the EELS data. The high spatial resolution of STEM-EELS further demonstrates that twist-induced symmetry breaking strongly influences plasmonic behavior. Coupled dipole modeling explains the observed discrepancies: the electron beam excites out-of-plane polarization modes unavailable to optical probes, while optical measurements average over ensembles. Our findings highlight that EELS provides complementary information to optical spectroscopy for understanding how structural arrangements at the nanoscale influence collective electronic properties, advancing the design of plasmonic metamaterials."

    "abstract": "The problem of model collapse has presented new challenges in iterative training of generative models, where such training with synthetic data leads to an overall degradation of performance. This paper looks at the problem from a statistical viewpoint, illustrating that one can actually hope for improvement when models are trained on data contaminated with synthetic samples, as long as there is some amount of fresh information from the true target distribution. In particular, we consider iterative training on samples sourced from a mixture of the true target and synthetic distributions. We analyze the entire iterative evolution in a next-token prediction language model, capturing how the interplay between the mixture weights and the sample size controls the overall long-term performance. With non-trivial mixture weight of the true distribution, even if it decays over time, simply training the model in a contamination-agnostic manner with appropriate sample sizes can avoid collapse and even recover the true target distribution under certain conditions. Simulation studies support our findings and also show that such behavior is more general for other classes of models."

    "abstract": "Normal-form proper equilibrium, introduced by Myerson as a refinement of normal-form perfect equilibrium, occupies a distinctive position in the equilibrium analysis of extensive-form games because its more stringent perturbation structure entails the sequential rationality. However, the size of the normal-form representation grows exponentially with the number of parallel information sets, making the direct determination of normal-form proper equilibria intractable. To address this challenge, we develop a compact sequence-form proper equilibrium by redefining the expected payoffs over sequences, and we prove that it coincides with the normal-form proper equilibrium via strategic equivalence. To facilitate computation, we further introduce an alternative representation by defining a class of perturbed games based on an $\\varepsilon$-permutahedron over sequences. Building on this representation, we introduce two differentiable path-following methods for computing normal-form proper equilibria. These methods rely on artificial sequence-form games whose expected payoff functions incorporate logarithmic or entropy regularization through an auxiliary variable. We prove the existence of a smooth equilibrium path induced by each artificial game, starting from an arbitrary positive realization plan and converging to a normal-form proper equilibrium of the original game as the auxiliary variable approaches zero. Finally, our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed methods."

Specifically, we propose a hierarchical semantic-spatial query initializer to derive the query set from superpoints by considering both semantic cues and spatial distribution, achieving comprehensive scene coverage and accelerated convergence. We further present a coordinate-guided state space model (SSM) decoder that progressively refines queries. The novel decoder features a local aggregation scheme that restricts the model to focus on geometrically coherent regions and a spatial dual-path SSM block to capture underlying dependencies within the query set by integrating associated coordinates information. Our design enables efficient instance prediction, avoiding the incorporation of noisy information and reducing redundant computation. LaSSM ranks first place on the latest ScanNet++ V2 leaderboard, outperforming the previous best method by 2.5% mAP with only 1/3 FLOPs, demonstrating its superiority in challenging large-scale scene instance segmentation. LaSSM also achieves competitive performance on ScanNet, ScanNet200, S3DIS and ScanNet++ V1 benchmarks with less computational cost. Extensive ablation studies and qualitative results validate the effectiveness of our design. The code and weights are available at https://github.com/RayYoh/LaSSM."

    "abstract": "Multiscale simulations utilizing high-fidelity, microscopic Monte Carlo models to provide the nonlinear response for continuum models can easily become computationally intractable. Surrogate models for the high-fidelity Monte Carlo models can overcome this but come with some challenges. One such challenges arise by the sampling noise in the underlying Monte Carlo data, which leads to uncontrolled errors possibly corrupting the surrogate even though it would be highly accurate in the case of noise-free data. Another challenge arises by the 'curse of dimensionality' when the response depends on many macro-variables. These points are addressed by a novel noise-balanced sparse grids interpolation approach which, in a quasi-optimal fashion, controls the amount of Monte Carlo sampling for each data point. The approach is complemented by a multilevel on-the-fly construction during the multiscale simulation. Besides its efficiency, a particularly appealing feature is the ease of use of the approach with only a single hyperparameter controlling the whole surrogate construction - from the surrogate's accuracy with guaranteed convergence to which data needs to be created with which accuracy. The approach is demonstrated on challenging examples from heterogeneous catalysis, coupling microscopic kinetic Monte Carlo models into macroscopic reactor simulations."

Unlike classical pupil-plane wavefront sen-sors, the proposed architecture does not include any wavelength-specific optical elements, enabling straightforward adaptation across a broad spectral range. The achievable spatial resolution of the reconstructed wavefront is scalable with the modulator resolution. We experimentally demonstrate wavefront reconstruction at 650 nm and at 2116 nm, where commercial wavefront sensors are not widely available. The reconstructed wavefront is validated against a commercial lateral shearing interferometer at 650 nm, and the method is further integrated into a closed-loop adaptive optics system using a deformable mirror. The approach is particularly suited for applications requiring high spatial resolution and large dynamic range in slowly varying or quasi-static laser fields, where computational reconstruction speed is not of the primary concern."

The former aligns the generator with the surrogate, alleviating distribution shift, while the latter biases the generative part of the joint model using the predictive one to efficiently generate optimized molecules at inference-time.

We ask whether weakening optimality to the requirement that each player merely avoid worst responses -- arguably the weakest meaningful rationality criterion -- yields tractable solution concepts. We show that it does not: any solution concept with this minimal guarantee is ``as intractable'' as pure Nash equilibrium. In general games, determining the existence of no-worst-response action profiles is NP-complete, finding one is NP-hard, and counting them is #P-complete. In potential games, where existence is guaranteed, the search problem is PLS-complete. Computational intractability therefore stems not only from the requirement of optimality, but also from the requirement of a minimal rationality guarantee for each player. Moreover, relaxing the latter requirement gives rise to a tractability trade-off between the strength of individual rationality guarantees and the fraction of players satisfying them."

To address these challenges, we introduce MoEEdit, the first routing-stable framework for parameter-modifying knowledge editing in MoE LLMs. Our method reparameterizes expert updates via per-expert null-space projections that keep router inputs invariant and thereby suppress routing shifts. The resulting block-structured optimization is solved efficiently with a block coordinate descent (BCD) solver. Experiments show that MoEEdit attains state-of-the-art efficacy and generalization while preserving high specificity and routing stability, with superior compute and memory efficiency. These results establish a robust foundation for scalable, precise knowledge editing in sparse LLMs and underscore the importance of routing-stable interventions."

That is, incidence of (or mortality from) multiple diseases is recorded at the scale of areal units where incidence (mortality) across the diseases is expected to manifest dependence. The modeling involves a hierarchical structure: a Poisson model for disease counts (conditioning on the rates) at the first stage, and a specification of a function of the rates using spatial random effects at the second stage. These random effects are specified as a prior and introduce spatial smoothing to the rate (or risk) estimates. What we see in the literature is the amount of smoothing induced under a given prior across areal units compared with the observed/empirical risks. Our contribution here extends previous research on smoothing in univariate areal data models. Specifically, for three different choices of multivariate prior, we investigate both within prior smoothing according to hyperparameters and across prior smoothing. Its benefit to the user is to illuminate the expected nature of departure from perfect fit associated with these priors since model performance is not a question of goodness of fit. We propose both theoretical and empirical metrics for our investigation and illustrate with both simulated and real data."

This parameter characterizes a sharp phase transition between vanishing and exploding activations, and we calculate the Lyapunov exponent explicitly for Gaussian or orthogonal weight matrices. Our results reveal that standard methods, such as He initialization or orthogonal initialization, do not guarantee activation stabilty for deep networks of low width. Based on these theoretical insights, we propose a novel initialization method, referred to as Lyapunov initialization, which sets the Lyapunov exponent to zero and thereby ensures that the neural network is as stable as possible, leading empirically to improved learning."

To bridge the gap between phenomenological and computational approaches and overcome sample-size limitations, our research integrated three methodologies. Study A: structured phenomenological interviews with autistic individuals using the Transdiagnostic Assessment of Temporal Experience. Study B: computational analysis of an autobiographical corpus of autistic narratives built for this purpose. Study C: a replication of a computational study using narrative flow measures to assess the perceived phenomenological authenticity of autistic autobiographies. Interviews revealed that the most significant differences between the autistic and control groups concerned unpredictability of experience. Computational results mirrored these findings: the temporal lexicon in autistic narratives was significantly more negatively valenced - particularly the \"Immediacy & Suddenness\" category. Outlier analysis identified terms associated with perceived discontinuity (unpredictably, precipitously, and abruptly) as highly negative. The computational analysis of narrative flow found that the autistic narratives contained within the corpus quantifiably resemble autobiographical stories more than imaginary ones. Overall, the temporal challenges experienced by autistic individuals were shown to primarily concern lived unpredictability and stem from the contents of lived experience, and not from autistic narrative construction."

So in this Letter we extend such an inverse method to non-Hermitian media, offering more freedom to manipulate the wave flows. Our principle of a curved-space analogue picture powered with gain and loss, is exemplified by three types: amplitude controlling, phase conversion, and direction shunting. Our numeric examples showcase precise wave manipulation in a surprisingly simple manner, which goes beyond convectional paradigms of TO and is readily implementable in realistic photonic platform."

    "abstract": "Continuous-time generative models have achieved remarkable success in image restoration and synthesis. However, controlling the composition of multiple pre-trained models remains an open challenge. Current approaches largely treat composition as an algebraic composition of probability densities, such as via products or mixtures of experts. This perspective assumes the target distribution is known explicitly, which is almost never the case. In this work, we propose a different paradigm that formulates compositional generation as a cooperative Stochastic Optimal Control problem. Rather than combining probability densities, we treat pre-trained diffusion models as interacting agents whose diffusion trajectories are jointly steered, via optimal control, toward a shared objective defined on their aggregated output. We validate our framework on conditional MNIST generation and compare it against a naive inference-time DPS-style baseline replacing learned cooperative control with per-step gradient guidance."

We demonstrate four benchmark problems of increasing complexity: the Darcy flow, the Fisher-KPP equation, a nonlinear potential equation and finally, an Allen-Cahn type equation.

    "abstract": "Participatory approaches are widely invoked in AI governance, yet participation rarely translates into durable influence. In public sector and civic AI systems, community contributions such as deliberations, annotations, prompts, and incident reports are often recorded informally, weakly linked to system updates, and disconnected from enforceable rights or sustained compensation. As a result, participation is frequently symbolic rather than accountable. We introduce the Participation Ledger, a machine readable and auditable framework that operationalizes participation as traceable influence, enforceable authority, and compensable labor. The ledger represents participation as an influence graph that links contributed artifacts to verified changes in AI systems, including datasets, prompts, adapters, policies, guardrails, and evaluation suites. It integrates three elements: a Participation Evidence Standard documenting consent, privacy, compensation, and reuse terms; an influence tracing mechanism that connects system updates to replayable before and after tests, enabling longitudinal monitoring of commitments; and encoded rights and incentives. Capability Vouchers allow authorized community stewards to request or constrain specific system capabilities within defined boundaries, while Participation Credits support ongoing recognition and compensation when contributed tests continue to provide value. We ground the framework in four urban AI and public space governance deployments and provide a machine readable schema, templates, and an evaluation plan for assessing traceability, enforceability, and compensation in practice."

    "abstract": "Training recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with standard backpropagation through time (BPTT) can be challenging, especially in the presence of long input sequences. A practical alternative to reduce computational and memory overhead is to perform BPTT repeatedly over shorter segments of the training data set, corresponding to truncated BPTT. In this paper, we examine the training of RNNs when using such a truncated learning approach for time series tasks. Specifically, we establish theoretical bounds on the accuracy and performance loss when optimizing over subsequences instead of the full data sequence. This reveals that the burn-in phase of the RNN is an important tuning knob in its training, with significant impact on the performance guarantees. We validate our theoretical results through experiments on standard benchmarks from the fields of system identification and time series forecasting. In all experiments, we observe a strong influence of the burn-in phase on the training process, and proper tuning can lead to a reduction of the prediction error on the training and test data of more than 60% in some cases."

The current design of Pollux features four spectropolarimetric channels, three of which are in the UV range. For the near-UV (NUV) [236-472 nm] and mid-UV (MUV) [118-236 nm] channels, the polarimeters consist of waveplates and prisms made of MgF2, a birefringent material. However, no such birefringent material can be used for the far-UV (FUV) channel [100-123 nm]. Therefore, the polarimeter for this FUV channel is composed solely of mirrors in an innovative assembly. In this talk, we aim to detail the architecture of the test bench that will allow us to validate the performance of these different polarimeters, as part of the HWO GOMaP. Given that we are working in the vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) range, the test bench operates in a vacuum chamber in a clean room. We will discuss the adaptable architecture of the bench based on wavelength and the measurement methodology that we will implement to test if the polarimeters achieve the precision of $10^{-3}$ required for the Pollux instrument. With this test bench, we will successfully increase the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of UV spectropolarimeters and, for the first time, develop a means to test FUV spectropolarimetry."

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence has shifted from a software-centric discipline to an infrastructure-driven system. Large-scale training and inference increasingly depend on tightly coupled data centers, high-capacity optical networks, and energy systems operating close to physical and environmental limits. As a result, control over data and algorithms alone is no longer sufficient to achieve meaningful AI sovereignty. Practical sovereignty now depends on who can deploy, operate, and adapt AI infrastructure under constraints imposed by energy availability, sustainability targets, and network reach. This tutorial-survey introduces the concept of AI infrastructure sovereignty, defined as the ability of a region, operator, or nation to exercise operational control over AI systems within physical and environmental limits. The paper argues that sovereignty emerges from the co-design of three layers: AI-oriented data centers, optical transport networks, and automation frameworks that provide real-time visibility and control. We analyze how AI workloads reshape data center design, driving extreme power densities, advanced cooling requirements, and tighter coupling to local energy systems, with sustainability metrics such as carbon intensity and water usage acting as hard deployment boundaries. We then examine optical networks as the backbone of distributed AI, showing how latency, capacity, failure domains, and jurisdictional control define practical sovereignty limits. Building on this foundation, the paper positions telemetry, agentic AI, and digital twins as enablers of operational sovereignty through validated, closed-loop control across compute, network, and energy domains. The tutorial concludes with a reference architecture for sovereign AI infrastructure that integrates telemetry pipelines, agent-based control, and digital twins, framing sustainability as a first-order design constraint."

For a massless scalar field $Ψ$ in the Hartle-Hawking state and with arbitrary curvature coupling, we compute the renormalized vacuum expectation value $\\langle Ψ^2 \\rangle_{\\textrm{ren}}$. The monopole produces a solid-angle deficit and makes the spacetime non-Ricci-flat. Working perturbatively in the monopole parameter $η$ and retaining terms through $O(η^2)$, we find that $\\langle Ψ^2 \\rangle_{\\textrm{ren}}$ on the horizon splits into two contributions: a genuinely monopole-induced term evaluated at the horizon and the usual Schwarzschild result - with the event horizon radius modified by the presence of $η$. Our result parallels earlier analyses for Schwarzschild black holes pierced by a cosmic string."

The association between FRB 200428 and a magnetar X-ray burst (MXB) from SGR J1935+2154 has significantly advanced the understanding of FRB and magnetar bursts. However, it is uncertain whether this association between MXB and FRB (i.e. MXB/FRB 200428) is genuine or just coincidental only based on this single event. Here we report the discovery of a bright ($\\rm\\sim7.6\\times10^{-7}\\,erg \\cdot cm^{-2}$ in 1-250 keV) magnetar X-ray burst detected by GECAM on October 14th, 2022 (dubbed as MXB 221014) from SGR J1935+2154, which is associated with a FRB detected by CHIME and GBT. We conducted a detailed temporal and spectral analysis of MXB 221014 with GECAM data and find that it is a bright and typical ($T_{90}\\sim$250 ms) X-ray burst from this magnetar. Interestingly, we find two narrow X-ray pulses in the MXB, one of which temporally aligns with the main pulse of the FRB 221014 $\\sim5.70$ ms latter than the peak time of FRB 221014), resembling the feature found in MXB/FRB 200428. Furthermore, we did comprehensive comparison between MXB/FRB 221014 and MXB/FRB 200428, and find that while the two events share several common features, they also exhibit distinct differences, highlighting the variety of the MXB-FRB association morphology. This finding not only confirms the association between MXB and FRB but also provides new insights into the mechanism of and the relationship between FRB and MXB."

    "abstract": "Smart contracts are stateful programs deployed on blockchains; they secure over a trillion dollars in transaction value per year. High-stakes smart contracts often rely on timely alerts about external events, but prior work has not analyzed their resilience to an attacker suppressing alerts via bribery. We formalize this challenge in a cryptoeconomic setting as the \\emph{alerting problem}, giving rise to a game between a bribing adversary and~$n$ rational participants, who pay a penalty if they are caught deviating from the protocol. We establish a quadratic, i.e.,~$O(n^2)$, upper bound, whereas a straightforward alerting protocol only achieves~$O(n)$ bribery cost. We present a \\emph{simultaneous game} that asymptotically achieves the quadratic upper bound and thus asymptotically-optimal bribery resistance. We then present two protocols that implement our simultaneous game: The first leverages a strong network synchrony assumption. The second relaxes this strong assumption and instead takes advantage of trusted hardware and blockchain proof-of-publication to establish a timed commitment scheme. These two protocols are constant-time but incur a linear storage overhead on the blockchain. We analyze a third, \\emph{sequential alerting} protocol that optimistically incurs no on-chain storage overhead, at the expense of~$O(n)$ worst-case execution time. All three protocols achieve asymptotically-optimal bribery costs, but with different resource and performance tradeoffs. Together, they illuminate a rich design space for practical solutions to the alerting problem."

In practical FL systems, privacy constraints prohibit centralizing raw data, while communication efficiency introduces further challenges for distributed preprocessing. We introduce FedPS, a unified framework for federated data preprocessing based on aggregated statistics. FedPS leverages data-sketching techniques to efficiently summarize local datasets while preserving essential statistical information. Building on these summaries, we design federated algorithms for feature scaling, encoding, discretization, and missing-value imputation, and extend preprocessing-related models such as k-Means, k-Nearest Neighbors, and Bayesian Linear Regression to both horizontal and vertical FL settings. FedPS provides flexible, communication-efficient, and consistent preprocessing pipelines for practical FL deployments."

Instead, some of the additional assumptions which are usually made in the physics literature turn out to be an a posteriori consequence in our approach.

    "abstract": "Deep learning models trained in a supervised setting have revolutionized audio and speech processing. However, their performance inherently depends on the quantity of human-annotated data, making them costly to scale and prone to poor generalization under unseen conditions. To address these challenges, Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) has emerged as a promising paradigm, leveraging vast amounts of unlabeled data to learn relevant representations. The application of SSL for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) has been extensively studied, but research on other downstream tasks, notably Speaker Recognition (SR), remains in its early stages. This work describes major SSL instance-invariance frameworks (e.g., SimCLR, MoCo, and DINO), initially developed for computer vision, along with their adaptation to SR. Various SSL methods for SR, proposed in the literature and built upon these frameworks, are also presented. An extensive review of these approaches is then conducted: (1) the effect of the main hyperparameters of SSL frameworks is investigated; (2) the role of SSL components is studied (e.g., data-augmentation, projector, positive sampling); and (3) SSL frameworks are evaluated on SR with in-domain and out-of-domain data, using a consistent experimental setup, and a comprehensive comparison of SSL methods from the literature is provided. Specifically, DINO achieves the best downstream performance and effectively models intra-speaker variability, although it is highly sensitive to hyperparameters and training conditions, while SimCLR and MoCo provide robust alternatives that effectively capture inter-speaker variability and are less prone to collapse. This work aims to highlight recent trends and advancements, identifying current challenges in the field."

Traditional early warning signals (EWSs) based on critical slowing down, such as increasing sample variance, are widely used, but their ability to reliably indicate imminent bifurcations and forecast their timing remains limited. Here, we introduce TIPMOC (TIpping via Power-law fits and MOdel Comparison), a parametric framework designed to statistically detect the approach of a bifurcation and estimate its future location using only the sample variance. TIPMOC exploits the mathematical property that variance diverges with a characteristic power-law form near codimension-one bifurcations. By sequentially monitoring system variance as a control parameter changes, TIPMOC statistically adjudicates between linear and power-law divergence at each step. When evidence favors power-law divergence, TIPMOC forecasts the impending tipping point and estimates its position; otherwise, it avoids false positives. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate TIPMOC's robustness and accuracy in both detection and timing prediction across different types of dynamics and bifurcation. TIPMOC shows low false positive rates and performs well even with uneven sampling and colored noise. This method thus enhances the interpretability and practical utility of classical EWSs, serving as both a transparent add-on and a stand-alone statistical tool for forecasting regime shifts in diverse complex systems."

Existing approaches typically employ early aggregation of user behaviors to maintain efficiency. However, such non-unified or partially unified modeling creates an information bottleneck by discarding fine-grained, token-level signals essential for unlocking scaling gains. In this work, we revisit the fundamental distinctions between CTR prediction and Large Language Models (LLMs), identifying two critical properties: the asymmetry in information density between behavioral and non-behavioral features, and the modality-specific priors of content-rich signals. Accordingly, we propose the Efficiently Scalable Transformer (EST), which achieves fully unified modeling by processing all raw inputs in a single sequence without lossy aggregation. EST integrates two modules: Lightweight Cross-Attention (LCA), which prunes redundant self-interactions to focus on high-impact cross-feature dependencies, and Content Sparse Attention (CSA), which utilizes content similarity to dynamically select high-signal behaviors. Extensive experiments show that EST exhibits a stable and efficient power-law scaling relationship, enabling predictable performance gains with model scale. Deployed on Taobao's display advertising platform, EST significantly outperforms production baselines, delivering a 3.27\\% RPM (Revenue Per Mile) increase and a 1.22\\% CTR lift, establishing a practical pathway for scalable industrial CTR prediction models."

However, these comparisons have two primary issues. First, they mostly considered only reliability as a comparison metric and selected a few LLMs (such as Codex and ChatGPT) for comparision. This paper proposes a comprehensive code quality assessment framework called Programmatic Excellence via LLM Iteration (PELLI). PELLI is an iterative analysis-based process that upholds high-quality code changes. We extended the state-of-the-art by performing a comprehensive evaluation that generates quantitative metrics for analyzing three primary nonfunctional requirements (such as maintainability, performance, and reliability) while selecting five popular LLMs. For PELLI's applicability, we selected three application domains while following Python coding standards. Following this framework, practitioners can ensure harmonious integration between LLMs and human developers, ensuring that their potential is fully realized. PELLI can serve as a practical guide for developers aiming to leverage LLMs while adhering to recognized quality standards. This study's outcomes are crucial for advancing LLM technologies in real-world applications, providing stakeholders with a clear understanding of where these LLMs excel and where they require further refinement. Overall, based on three nonfunctional requirements, we have found that GPT-4T and Gemini performed slightly better. We also found that prompt design can influence the overall code quality. In addition, each application domain demonstrated high and low scores across various metrics, and even within the same metrics across different prompts."

    "abstract": "Many staff and students in higher education have adopted generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools in their work and study. GenAI is expected to enhance cognitive systems by enabling personalized learning and streamlining educational services. However, stakeholders perceptions of GenAI in higher education remain divided, shaped by cultural, disciplinary, and institutional contexts. In addition, the EU AI Act requires universities to ensure regulatory compliance when deploying cognitive systems. These developments highlight the need for institutions to engage stakeholders and tailor GenAI integration to their needs while addressing concerns. This study investigates how GenAI is perceived within the disciplines of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering (ITEE). Using a mixed-method approach, we surveyed 61 staff and 37 students at the Faculty of ITEE, University of Oulu. The results reveal both shared and discipline-specific themes, including strong interest in programming support from GenAI and concerns over response quality, privacy, and academic integrity. Drawing from these insights, the study identifies a set of high-level requirements and proposes a conceptual framework for responsible GenAI integration. Disciplinary-specific requirements reinforce the importance of stakeholder engagement when integrating GenAI into higher education. The high-level requirements and the framework provide practical guidance for universities aiming to harness GenAI while addressing stakeholder concerns and ensuring regulatory compliance."

    "abstract": "Spin waves are promising information carriers for analog and wave-based computing, requiring compact and precisely engineered scattering landscapes. Focused ion beam (FIB) irradiation enables such control by locally modifying the spin-wave dispersion in yttrium iron garnet (YIG), yet the underlying crystallographic mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we present an experimentally validated framework that attributes FIB-induced spin-wave steering to magnetoelastic effects arising from irradiation-induced lattice dislocations. Following FIB irradiation and wet-chemical etching, local height profiles were obtained by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and used as fixed geometric constraints in fits of spin-wave dispersion relations measured by time-resolved magneto-optical Kerr effect (trMOKE) microscopy. The dispersion relation was extended by an explicit magnetoelastic field term, treated as a fit parameter. Its evolution reveals three successive deformation regimes, elastic, plastic, and partial amorphization, explaining the observed non-monotonic dependence of the spin-wave wavelength on ion dose. A three-phase deformation scenario based on SRIM simulations reproduces the extracted magnetoelastic field trends, validating the fitting approach. Micromagnetic simulations incorporating strain tensors derived from the experimental magnetoelastic field reproduce the characteristic non-monotonic wavelength behavior. These results establish a physical basis for FIB-engineered graded-index (GRIN) spin-wave landscapes and magnetoelastically programmable magnonic devices."

    "abstract": "Generative sequence modeling faces a fundamental tension between the expressivity of Transformers and the efficiency of linear sequence models. Existing efficient architectures are theoretically bounded by shallow, single-step linear updates, while powerful iterative methods like Test-Time Training (TTT) break hardware parallelism due to state-dependent gradients. We propose PRISM (Parallel Residual Iterative Sequence Model) to resolve this tension. PRISM introduces a solver-inspired inductive bias that captures key structural properties of multi-step refinement in a parallelizable form. We employ a Write-Forget Decoupling strategy that isolates non-linearity within the injection operator. To bypass the serial dependency of explicit solvers, PRISM utilizes a two-stage proxy architecture: a short-convolution anchors the initial residual using local history energy, while a learned predictor estimates the refinement updates directly from the input. This design distills structural patterns associated with iterative correction into a parallelizable feedforward operator. Theoretically, we prove that this formulation achieves Rank-$L$ accumulation, structurally expanding the update manifold beyond the single-step Rank-$1$ bottleneck. Empirically, it achieves comparable performance to explicit optimization methods while achieving 174x higher throughput."

CycFlow learns an instance-conditioned vector field that continuously transports input 2D coordinates to a canonical circular arrangement, where the optimal tour is recovered from this $2N$ dimensional representation via angular sorting. By leveraging data-dependent flow matching, we bypass the quadratic bottleneck of edge scoring in favor of linear coordinate dynamics.

Previous approaches for the construction of SBP operators have usually relied on either local methods or sparse differentiation matrices, as commonly used in finite difference schemes. However, these methods often impose implicit requirements that are not part of the formal SBP definition. We demonstrate that adherence to the SBP definition alone does not guarantee the desired accuracy, and we identify conditions for SBP operators to achieve both accuracy and stability. Specifically, we analyze the error minimization for an augmented basis, discuss the role of sparsity, and examine the importance of nullspace consistency in the construction of SBP operators. Furthermore, we show how these design criteria can be integrated into a recently proposed optimization-based construction procedure for function space SBP (FSBP) operators on arbitrary grids. Our findings are supported by numerical experiments that illustrate the improved accuracy for the numerical solution using the proposed SBP operators."

We demonstrate that the performance of a trading strategy using the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) evaluated within a walk-forward procedure based on the Robust Sharpe Ratio is highly dependent on the chosen window size. We investigated the strategy on intraday Bitcoin data at six frequencies (1 minute to 60 minutes) using 81 combinations of walk-forward window lengths (1 day to 28 days) over a 19-month training period. The two best-performing parameter sets from the training data were applied to a 21-month out-of-sample testing period to ensure data independence. The strategy was only executed once during the testing period. To further validate the framework, strategy parameters estimated on Bitcoin were applied to Binance Coin and Ethereum. Our results suggest the robustness of our custom approach. In the training period for Bitcoin, all combinations of walk-forward windows outperformed a Buy-and-Hold strategy. During the testing period, the strategy performed similarly to Buy-and-Hold but with lower drawdown and a higher Information Ratio. Similar results were observed for Binance Coin and Ethereum. The real strength was demonstrated when a portfolio combining Buy-and-Hold with our strategies outperformed all individual strategies and Buy-and-Hold alone, achieving the highest overall performance and a 50 percent reduction in drawdown. A conservative fee of 0.1 percent per transaction was included in all calculations. A cost sensitivity analysis was performed as a sanity check, revealing that the strategy's break-even point was around 0.4 percent per transaction. This research highlights the importance of optimizing walk-forward window lengths and emphasizing the value of single-time out-of-sample testing for reliable strategy evaluation."

Across all these settings, we show that the sum of the Betti numbers is almost surely as small as possible, attaining a trivial lower bound $|χ|$ dictated by the dimensions of the underlying vector spaces and the Euler formula.

Computing exact coalescence probabilities has been difficult because collisions reduce the particle count, while classical determinantal methods require a fixed count throughout. We introduce ghost particles: when two particles merge, the discarded trajectory continues as an invisible walker. Ghosts restore the missing dimension, enabling an exact determinantal formula. We prove that the probability of any specified coalescence pattern is given by a determinant. Integrating out ghost positions yields a closed-form ghost-free formula for the surviving particles. The framework applies to discrete lattice paths, birth-death chains, and continuous diffusions including Brownian motion."

    "abstract": "Machine learning models are increasingly present in our everyday lives; as a result, they become targets of adversarial attackers seeking to manipulate the systems we interact with. A well-known vulnerability is a backdoor introduced into a neural network by poisoned training data or a malicious training process. Backdoors can be used to induce unwanted behavior by including a certain trigger in the input. Existing mitigations filter training data, modify the model, or perform expensive input modifications on samples. If a vulnerable model has already been deployed, however, those strategies are either ineffective or inefficient. To address this gap, we propose our inference-time backdoor mitigation approach called FIRE (Feature-space Inference-time REpair). We hypothesize that a trigger induces structured and repeatable changes in the model's internal representation. We view the trigger as directions in the latent spaces between layers that can be applied in reverse to correct the inference mechanism. Therefore, we turn the backdoored model against itself by manipulating its latent representations and moving a poisoned sample's features along the backdoor directions to neutralize the trigger. Our evaluation shows that FIRE has low computational overhead and outperforms current runtime mitigations on image benchmarks across various attacks, datasets, and network architectures."

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for code generation in fast, informal development workflows, often referred to as vibe coding, where speed and convenience are prioritized, and security requirements are rarely made explicit. In this setting, models frequently produce functionally correct but insecure code, creating a growing security risk. Existing approaches to improving code security rely on full-parameter fine-tuning or parameter-efficient adaptations, which are either costly and prone to catastrophic forgetting or operate at coarse granularity with limited interpretability and control. We present GoodVibe, a neuron-level framework for improving the security of code language models by default. GoodVibe is based on the key insight that security-relevant reasoning is localized to a small subset of neurons. We identify these neurons using gradient-based attribution from a supervised security task and perform neuron-selective fine-tuning that updates only this security-critical subspace. To further reduce training cost, we introduce activation-driven neuron clustering, enabling structured updates with minimal overhead. We evaluate GoodVibe on six LLMs across security-critical programming languages, including C++, Java, Swift, and Go. GoodVibe substantially improves the security of generated code while preserving general model utility, achieving up to a 2.5x improvement over base models, matching or exceeding full fine-tuning with over 4,700x fewer trainable parameters, and reducing training computation by more than 3.6x compared to the parameter-efficient baseline (LoRA). Our results demonstrate that neuron-level optimization offers an effective and scalable approach to securing code generation without sacrificing efficiency or generality."

Results are discussed for light ($π$, $K$), heavy-light ($D$, $D_s$, $B$, $B_s$, $B_c$), and heavy-heavy ($η_c$, $η_b$) pseudoscalar mesons, allowing for a systematic analysis of the role played by quark-mass asymmetry and heavy-quark dynamics. The study highlights how increasing quark masses drive a transition from broad, asymmetric momentum distributions to increasingly symmetric and spatially compact configurations. Comparisons with lattice QCD, Dyson-Schwinger equation studies, and contact-interaction models are presented where available. Overall, the algebraic model offers a transparent and symmetry-consistent framework to explore the three-dimensional momentum and spatial structure of pseudoscalar mesons across all quark-mass regimes."

Once we obtain the scheme and prove its second-order accuracy and $A$-stability, which is not a trivial task, we also state a result concerning its $MS$-stability. This concept is also analyzed for different parameter ranges in our scheme and the It{ô}--Taylor approximation of order 2, revealing scenarios where, for certain time step sizes, the developed method is $MS$-stable while the It{ô}--Taylor one is not. This concept is really useful to tackle slow-fast problems such as stiff ones, which we aim to explore further in future work. Finally, we validate the theoretical results with some academic test cases."

However, existing evaluations are predominantly vehicle-centric and fail to assess perception and reasoning from a cyclist-centric viewpoint. To address this gap, we introduce CyclingVQA, a diagnostic benchmark designed to probe perception, spatio-temporal understanding, and traffic-rule-to-lane reasoning from a cyclist's perspective. Evaluating 31+ recent VLMs spanning general-purpose, spatially enhanced, and autonomous-driving-specialized models, we find that current models demonstrate encouraging capabilities, while also revealing clear areas for improvement in cyclist-centric perception and reasoning, particularly in interpreting cyclist-specific traffic cues and associating signs with the correct navigational lanes. Notably, several driving-specialized models underperform strong generalist VLMs, indicating limited transfer from vehicle-centric training to cyclist-assistive scenarios. Finally, through systematic error analysis, we identify recurring failure modes to guide the development of more effective cyclist-assistive intelligent systems."

Such interference departs from the assumptions underlying conventional detection methods based on Gaussian noise models and leads to detection mismatch that fundamentally affects symbol-level performance. In particular, the presence of random interference amplitude and non-uniform phase alters the structure of the optimal decision regions and renders standard Euclidean distance-based detectors suboptimal. To address this challenge, we develop the maximum-likelihood Gaussian-phase approximate (ML-G) detector, a low-complexity detection rule that accurately approximates maximum-likelihood detection while remaining suitable for practical implementation. The proposed detector explicitly incorporates the statistical properties of the interference and induces decision regions that differ significantly from those arising under conventional metrics. Building on the ML-G framework, we further investigate constellation design under interference-aware detection and formulate an optimization problem that seeks symbol placements that minimize the symbol error probability subject to an average energy constraint. The resulting constellations are obtained numerically and adapt to the interference environment, exhibiting non-standard and asymmetric structures as interference strength increases. Simulation results demonstrate clear symbol error probability gains over established benchmark schemes across a range of interference conditions, particularly in scenarios with dominant additive interference."

In this paper, we propose 3DXTalker, an expressive 3D talking avatar through data-curated identity modeling, audio-rich representations, and spatial dynamics controllability. 3DXTalker enables scalable identity modeling via 2D-to-3D data curation pipeline and disentangled representations, alleviating data scarcity and improving identity generalization. Then, we introduce frame-wise amplitude and emotional cues beyond standard speech embeddings, ensuring superior lip synchronization and nuanced expression modulation. These cues are unified by a flow-matching-based transformer for coherent facial dynamics. Moreover, 3DXTalker also enables natural head-pose motion generation while supporting stylized control via prompt-based conditioning. Extensive experiments show that 3DXTalker integrates lip synchronization, emotional expression, and head-pose dynamics within a unified framework, achieves superior performance in 3D talking avatar generation."

To push the boundaries of adaptation efficiency for vision tasks, we propose an adapter with Complex Linear Projection Optimization (CoLin). For architecture, we design a novel low-rank complex adapter that introduces only about 1% parameters to the backbone. For efficiency, we theoretically prove that low-rank composite matrices suffer from severe convergence issues during training, and address this challenge with a tailored loss. Extensive experiments on object detection, segmentation, image classification, and rotated object detection (remote sensing scenario) demonstrate that CoLin outperforms both full fine-tuning and classical delta-tuning approaches with merely 1% parameters for the first time, providing a novel and efficient solution for deployment of vision foundation models.

To address these limitations, we propose \\textbf{ADAlign}, an Adaptive Distribution Alignment framework for GDA. Unlike heuristic methods, ADAlign requires no manual specification of alignment criteria. It automatically identifies the most relevant discrepancies in each transfer and aligns them jointly, capturing the interplay between attributes, structures, and their dependencies. This makes ADAlign flexible, scenario-aware, and robust to diverse and dynamically evolving shifts. To enable this adaptivity, we introduce the Neural Spectral Discrepancy (NSD), a theoretically principled parametric distance that provides a unified view of cross-graph shifts. NSD leverages neural characteristic function in the spectral domain to encode feature-structure dependencies of all orders, while a learnable frequency sampler adaptively emphasizes the most informative spectral components for each task via minimax paradigm. Extensive experiments on 10 datasets and 16 transfer tasks show that ADAlign not only outperforms state-of-the-art baselines but also achieves efficiency gains with lower memory usage and faster training."

    "abstract": "Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) downlink transmission facilitates critical time-sensitive visual applications but is fundamentally constrained by bandwidth scarcity and dynamic channel impairments. The rapid fluctuation of the air-to-ground (A2G) link creates a regime where reliable transmission slots are intermittent and future channel quality can only be predicted with uncertainty. Conventional deep joint source-channel coding (DeepJSCC) methods transmit coupled feature streams, causing global reconstruction failure when specific time slots experience deep fading. Decoupling semantic content into a deterministic structure component and a stochastic texture component enables differentiated error protection strategies aligned with channel reliability. A predictive transmission framework is developed that utilizes a split-stream variational codec and a channel-aware scheduler to prioritize the delivery of structural layout over reliable slots. Experimental evaluations indicate that this approach achieves a 5.6 dB gain in peak signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio over single-stream baselines and maintains structural fidelity under significant prediction mismatch."

Existing models, such as clique, k-plex, and γ-quasi-clique, use fixed density thresholds that overlook the natural decay of connectivity as the subgraph size increases. The Flexi-clique model overcomes this limitation by imposing a degree constraint that grows sub-linearly with subgraph size. We provide the algorithmic study of Flexi-clique, proving its NP-hardness and analysing its non-hereditary properties. To address its computational challenge, we propose the Flexi-Prune Algorithm FPA, a fast heuristic using core-based seeding and connectivity-aware pruning, and the Efficient Branch-and-Bound Algorithm EBA, an exact framework enhanced with multiple pruning rules. Experiments on large real-world and synthetic networks demonstrate that FPA achieves near-optimal quality at much lower cost, while EBA efficiently computes exact solutions. Flexi-clique thus provides a practical and scalable model for discovering large, meaningful subgraphs in complex networks."

    "abstract": "This paper studies distributed online convex optimization with time-varying coupled constraints, motivated by distributed online control in network systems. Most prior work assumes a separability condition: the global objective and coupled constraint functions are sums of local costs and individual constraints. In contrast, we study a group of agents, networked via a communication graph, that collectively select actions to minimize a sequence of nonseparable global cost functions and to stratify nonseparable long-term constraints based on full-information feedback and intra-agent communication. We propose a distributed online primal-dual belief consensus algorithm, where each agent maintains and updates a local belief of the global collective decisions, which are repeatedly exchanged with neighboring agents. Unlike the previous consensus primal-dual algorithms under separability that ask agents to only communicate their local decisions, our belief-sharing protocol eliminates coupling between the primal consensus disagreement and the dual constraint violation, yielding sublinear regret and cumulative constraint violation (CCV) bounds, both in $O({T}^{1/2})$, where $T$ denotes the time horizon. Such a result breaks the long-standing $O(T^{3/4})$ barrier for CCV and matches the lower bound of online constrained convex optimization, indicating the online learning efficiency at the cost of communication overhead."

    "abstract": "Generative Recommendation (GR) has excelled by framing recommendation as next-token prediction. This paradigm relies on Semantic IDs (SIDs) to tokenize large-scale items into discrete sequences. Existing GR approaches predominantly generate SIDs via Residual Quantization (RQ), where items are encoded into embeddings and then quantized to discrete SIDs. However, this paradigm suffers from inherent limitations: 1) Objective misalignment and semantic degradation stemming from the two-stage compression; 2) Error accumulation inherent in the structure of RQ. To address these limitations, we propose UniSID, a Unified SID generation framework for generative advertisement recommendation. Specifically, we jointly optimize embeddings and SIDs in an end-to-end manner from raw advertising data, enabling semantic information to flow directly into the SID space and thus addressing the inherent limitations of the two-stage cascading compression paradigm. To capture fine-grained semantics, a multi-granularity contrastive learning strategy is introduced to align distinct items across SID levels. Finally, a summary-based ad reconstruction mechanism is proposed to encourage SIDs to capture high-level semantic information that is not explicitly present in advertising contexts. Experiments demonstrate that UniSID consistently outperforms state-of-the-art SID generation methods, yielding up to a 4.62% improvement in Hit Rate metrics across downstream advertising scenarios compared to the strongest baseline."

We present a systematic investigation of this phenomenon. We demonstrate empirically that all frontier models suffer significantly degraded accuracy for integer addition as the number of digits increases. Furthermore, we show that most errors made by these models are highly interpretable and can be attributed to either operand misalignment or a failure to correctly carry; these two error classes explain 87.9%, 62.9%, and 92.4% of Claude Opus 4.1, GPT-5, and Gemini 2.5 Pro errors, respectively. Finally, we show that misalignment errors are frequently related to tokenization, and that carrying errors appear largely as independent random failures."

Using millions of funding and publication datasets across the past ten years, we investigate how U.S. China geopolitical tensions reshaped individual research activities of U.S. based scientists, particularly those collaborating with Chinese peers. We find that although U.S. China geopolitical tensions significantly reduce funding opportunities, many scientists actively respond by pivoting their research portfolios toward alternative topics, and this adaptive reorientation partially mitigates funding losses. Crucially, the effectiveness of this adaptive strategy is highly unequal: for scientists in high risk domains, those of Asian descent, and early-career scientists, pivoting offers only limited protection against funding loss. Our results demonstrate that geopolitical tensions reshape science through shifts in scientists' strategic decisions about their research focus. Understanding this adaptive but uneven reconfiguration is essential for science policies to strengthen the resilience and inclusiveness of the scientific enterprise."

Through interviews and co-design workshops with PWS and domain experts, we identify challenges in stuttered speech annotation and develop practices that integrate the lived experiences of PWS into the annotation process.

Unfortunately, an adversary can corrupt the measurement data during transmission from the local-BMS to the cloud-BMS, leading to disrupted EV charging. Therefore, to ensure reliable voltage data under such sensor attacks, this paper proposes a two-stage error-corrected self-learning Koopman operator-based secure voltage estimation scheme for large-format battery packs. The first stage of correction compensates for the Koopman approximation error. The second stage aims to recover the error amassing from the lack of higher-order battery dynamics information in the self-learning feedback, using two alternative methods: an adaptable empirical strategy that uses cell-level knowledge of open circuit voltage to state-of-charge mapping for pack-level estimation, and a Gaussian process regression-based data-driven method that leverages minimal data-training. During our comprehensive case studies using the high-fidelity battery simulation package 'PyBaMM-liionpack', our proposed secure estimator reliably generated real-time voltage estimation with high accuracy under varying pack topologies, charging settings, battery age-levels, and attack policies. Thus, the scalable and adaptable algorithm can be easily employed to diverse battery configurations and operating conditions, without requiring significant modifications, excessive data or sensor redundancy, to ensure optimum charging of EVs under compromised sensing."

While the expanding landscape of jet observables reveals multi-faceted aspects of jet-medium interactions, a precise and simultaneous description of the nuclear modification factors of hadrons and full jets still remains a challenge for theoretical models. In this work, we present two essential improvements to the linear Boltzmann transport (LBT) model to bridge this gap. First, instead of implementing in-medium parton transport after vacuum parton showers complete, we introduce a medium scale at which the parton transport is inserted into the vacuum parton showers, providing a more physical picture of parton-QGP interactions. Second, we incorporate color flow information into the LBT model, enabling string connections between partons whose configurations are correlated with the medium-modified parton showers before hadronization. We demonstrate that both improvements alter the predicted ratio of hadron to jet quenching, leading to a satisfactory description of the nuclear modification factors of hadrons and jets with different flavors within a unified framework."

    "abstract": "When designing new materials, it is often necessary to tailor the material design (with respect to its design parameters) to have some desired properties (e.g. Young's modulus). As the set of design parameters grow, the search space grows exponentially, making the actual synthesis and evaluation of all material combinations virtually impossible. Even using traditional computational methods such as Finite Element Analysis becomes too computationally heavy to search the design space. Recent methods use machine learning (ML) surrogate models to more efficiently determine optimal material designs; unfortunately, these methods often (i) are notoriously difficult to interpret and (ii) under perform when the training data comes from a non-uniform sampling of the design space. We suggest the use of tensor completion methods as an all-in-one approach for interpretability and predictions. We observe classical tensor methods are able to compete with traditional ML in predictions, with the added benefit of their interpretable tensor factors (which are given completely for free, as a result of the prediction). In our experiments, we are able to rediscover physical phenomena via the tensor factors, indicating that our predictions are aligned with the true underlying physics of the problem. This also means these tensor factors could be used by experimentalists to identify potentially novel patterns, given we are able to rediscover existing ones. We also study the effects of both types of surrogate models when we encounter training data from a non-uniform sampling of the design space. We observe more specialized tensor methods that can give better generalization in these non-uniforms sampling scenarios. We find the best generalization comes from a tensor model, which is able to improve upon the baseline ML methods by up to 5% on aggregate $R^2$, and halve the error in some out of distribution regions."

Several Galactic scenarios have been proposed, including an evolved supernova remnant and a pulsar wind nebula. Yet, no shocked gas, shell-like structure, or compact pulsar candidate has been identified. Follow-up observations with VERITAS and the LST-1 prototype have not firmly clarified its nature. A recent microquasar candidate from GMRT radio data remains uncertain. Here we present the first dedicated near-infrared study of the field, combining deep JHKs imaging with narrow band observations targeting the H2 v=1-0 S(1) line. Our observations were initially planned to encompass the full source region, but now only partially cover the latest updated position and size of LHAASO J2108+5157. We find no evidence of shocked emission, extended nebular structures, or an accreting compact object signature in the covered field. The GMRT radio source, despite its jet-like morphology, exhibits near-infrared properties incompatible with both a Galactic microquasar and a nearby radio galaxy, discouraging an association with the gamma-ray emission. Our analysis reveals no convincing counterpart consistent within the positional uncertainty, leaving LHAASO J2108+5157 as an enigmatic ultra-high energy emitter that requires deeper observations."

    "abstract": "Reliable surface completion from sparse point clouds underpins many applications spanning content creation and robotics. While 3D diffusion transformers attain state-of-the-art results on this task, we uncover that they exhibit a catastrophic mode of failure: arbitrarily small on-surface perturbations to the input point cloud can fracture the output into multiple disconnected pieces -- a phenomenon we call Meltdown. Using activation-patching from mechanistic interpretability, we localize Meltdown to a single early denoising cross-attention activation. We find that the singular-value spectrum of this activation provides a scalar proxy: its spectral entropy rises when fragmentation occurs and returns to baseline when patched. Interpreted through diffusion dynamics, we show that this proxy tracks a symmetry-breaking bifurcation of the reverse process. Guided by this insight, we introduce PowerRemap, a test-time control that stabilizes sparse point-cloud conditioning. We demonstrate that Meltdown persists across state-of-the-art architectures (WaLa, Make-a-Shape), datasets (GSO, SimJEB) and denoising strategies (DDPM, DDIM), and that PowerRemap effectively counters this failure with stabilization rates of up to 98.3%. Overall, this work is a case study on how diffusion model behavior can be understood and guided based on mechanistic analysis, linking a circuit-level cross-attention mechanism to diffusion-dynamics accounts of trajectory bifurcations."

Our results show that the detection problem is substantially easier if the mask is known upfront compared to the case where the mask is hidden. Our analysis is built upon a novel Fourier-analytic framework for bounding signed subgraph counts in Gaussian random geometric graphs that exploits cancellations which arise after approximating characteristic functions by an appropriate power series. The resulting bounds are applicable to much larger subgraphs than considered in previous work which enables tight information-theoretic bounds, while the bounds considered in previous works only lead to lower bounds from the lens of low-degree polynomials. As a consequence we identify the optimal information-theoretic thresholds and rule out computational-statistical gaps. Our bounds further improve upon the bounds on Fourier coefficients of random geometric graphs recently given by Bangachev and Bresler [STOC'24] in the dense, bipartite case. The techniques also extend to sparser and non-bipartite settings, at least if the considered subgraphs are sufficiently small. We furhter believe that they might help resolve open questions for related detection problems."

These lightweight components are designed to guide a video diffusion backbone while maintaining its core generative capabilities.

Rigorous statistical analysis shows that, with short planning horizons (e.g., one step ahead), our planner is faster than the state-of-the-art across all scenarios tested (between 45% and 98% faster on average, depending on the scenario), while planning less efficient motions (requiring 5% fewer to 700% more stance changes on average). In all but one scenario (Chimney Walking), longer planning horizons (e.g., four steps ahead) extended the average planning times (between 73% faster and 400% slower than the state-of-the-art) but resulted in higher quality motion plans (between 8% more and 47% fewer stance changes than the state-of-the-art)."

The solution is straight forward when the number of observations is greater than the number of features but computational difficulties arise in both the high-dimensional setting, where there are more features than there are observations, and when the data are very large. Many works have proposed solutions for the high-dimensional setting and frequently involve additional assumptions or tuning parameters. We propose a fast and simple iterative algorithm for both classical and high-dimensional RRLDA on large data that is free from these additional requirements and that comes with guarantees. We also explain how RRLDA-RK provides implicit regularization towards the least norm solution without explicitly incorporating penalties.

While, on the one hand, $\\ell_1$-regularization is a standard tool for variable selection in high-dimensional regimes and, on the other hand, the $\\ell_2$ penalty provides stability and solution uniqueness through strict convexity, the standard Elastic Net nevertheless suffers from shrinkage bias that frequently yields suboptimal prediction accuracy. We propose to address this limitation through a framework called \\textit{relaxation}. Existing relaxation implementations rely on naive linear interpolations of penalized and unpenalized solutions, which ignore the non-linear geometry that characterizes the entire regularization path and risk violating the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions. Renet addresses these limitations by enforcing sign consistency through an adaptive relaxation procedure that dynamically dispatches between convex blending and efficient sub-path refitting. Furthermore, we identify and formalize a unique synergy between relaxation and the ``One-Standard-Error'' rule: relaxation serves as a robust debiasing mechanism, allowing practitioners to leverage the parsimony of the 1-SE rule without the traditional loss in predictive fidelity. Our theoretical framework incorporates automated stability safeguards for ultra-high dimensional regimes and is supported by a comprehensive benchmarking suite across 20 synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating that Renet consistently outperforms the standard Elastic Net and provides a more robust alternative to the Adaptive Elastic Net in high-dimensional, low signal-to-noise ratio and high-multicollinearity regimes. By leveraging an adaptive solver backend, Renet delivers these statistical gains while offering a computational profile that remains competitive with state-of-the-art coordinate descent implementations."

Here, we report that such reentrance naturally emerges in a Hamiltonian (conservative) model known to recapitulate properties of (active) bird flocks, and exhibits clustering behaviour reminiscent of MIPS. We numerically demonstrate the reentrance of the homogeneous phase and identify the underlying mechanism as a competition between the amplitude of a spin-velocity coupled drive and mobility-limited kinetic frustration. Specifically, we reveal that strong spin-velocity coupling suppresses transverse diffusion, thereby leading the system into an arrest that closes the window for phase separation. Overall, our work offers a Hamiltonian, conservative, bridge between reentrant physics across equilibrium and non-equilibrium materials."

    "abstract": "In this work, we attempted to apply the dipole fitting (DF) method to galaxy clusters to search for cosmic anisotropic signals, and to construct a statistical isotropic analysis scheme for them. Compared to Type Ia supernova (SNe Ia), the galaxy clusters offer a significant advantage in terms of spatial distribution. This advantage makes the anisotropic signals obtained from them more reliable. From 313 galaxy clusters (Chandra + XMM-Newton), we find two preferred directions (l, b) = (${257.82^{\\circ}}_{-52.88}^{+58.01}$, $-31.30{^{\\circ}}_{-39.46}^{+35.92}$) and ($80.89{^{\\circ}}_{-52.46}^{+60.97}$, $31.75{^{\\circ}}_{-40.16}^{+35.19}$). The former to a direction where the universe is expanding at a faster rate than the surrounding area, while the latter to a slower rate of expansion. The corresponding magnitude of anisotropy is $|A|$ = 5.2 $\\sim$ 5.4 $\\times$ 10$^{-4}$. The results of statistical isotropy analyses give $\\sim$1.0$σ$ confidence level. From the reanalyses based on the subsamples including Chandra, XMM-Newton, low reshift (LR, $z < 0.10$), high redshift (HR, $z > 0.10$) datasets, we find that the observation equipment and sample redshift can affect the preferred direction, anisotropic magnitude, and statistical significance of anisotropy. The XMM-Newton dataset gives a statistical significance of 2.26$σ$ (Mock) and 2.86$σ$ (Iso) which are much higher than that from Chandra and the total datasets. The magnitude of anisotropy $|A|$ from HR dataset is larger than that from LR dataset. Overall, our results indicate the presence of anisotropic signals in galaxy clusters, which must be taken seriously. Further test is still needed to better understand these signals."

However, progress in this area has been limited by the lack of large, diverse datasets necessary to address critical challenges such as generalization to new users and robustness to shifts in factors like footwear or walking speed. The recent release of the UNB StepUP-P150 dataset, the largest and most comprehensive collection of high-resolution footstep pressure recordings to date, opens new opportunities for addressing these challenges through deep learning. To mark this milestone, the First International StepUP Competition for Biometric Footstep Recognition was launched. Competitors were tasked with developing robust recognition models using the StepUP-P150 dataset that were then evaluated on a separate, dedicated test set designed to assess verification performance under challenging variations, given limited and relatively homogeneous reference data. The competition attracted global participation, with 23 registered teams from academia and industry. The top-performing team, Saeid_UCC, achieved the best equal error rate (EER) of 10.77% using a generative reward machine (GRM) optimization strategy. Overall, the competition showcased strong solutions, but persistent challenges in generalizing to unfamiliar footwear highlight a critical area for future work."

Extensive comparisons with LASSO, SHAP, and deep learning based methods show that GRASP consistently delivers comparable or superior predictive accuracy, while identifying fewer, less redundant, and more stable features."

Clustering behavior-datapoint similarity matrices also enables unsupervised discovery of emergent behaviors. Applying this to OLMo 2's production DPO training, we surfaced distractor-triggered compliance: a harmful behavior where the model complies with dangerous requests when benign formatting instructions are appended. Filtering top-ranked datapoints reduces this behavior by 63% while switching their labels achieves 78%. Our method outperforms gradient-based attribution and LLM-judge baselines while being over 10 times cheaper than both. This in-the-wild model organism - emerging from contaminated preference data rather than deliberate injection - provides a realistic benchmark for safety techniques."

However, since real-world implementations of CBCP and DBCP are nascent, their relative merits remain unclear. In this work, we compare the efficacy of deploying CBCP and DBCP in reducing user costs and increasing toll revenues. We first formulate a non-atomic congestion game in which low-income users receive a travel credit or toll discount for accessing tolled lanes. We establish that, in our formulation, Nash equilibrium flows always exist and can be computed or well approximated via convex programming. Our main result establishes a set of practically relevant conditions under which DBCP provably outperforms CBCP in inducing equilibrium outcomes that minimize a given societal cost, which encodes user cost reduction and toll revenue maximization. Finally, we validate our theoretical contributions via a case study of the 101 Express Lanes Project, a CBCP program implemented in the San Francisco Bay Area."

Participants also completed pairwise ranking tasks to prioritise six core ethical concerns. Findings revealed that students valued targeted intervention but responded negatively to AI monitoring, regardless of sensing methods. Students preferred system-generated hints over teacher-initiated assistance, citing learning agency and social embarrassment concerns. Students' ethical considerations prioritised autonomy and privacy, followed by transparency, accuracy, fairness, and learning beneficence.

    "abstract": "Current large vision-language models (LVLMs) typically rely on text-only reasoning based on a single-pass visual encoding, which often leads to loss of fine-grained visual information. Recently the proposal of ''thinking with images'' attempts to alleviate this limitation by manipulating images via external tools or code; however, the resulting visual states are often insufficiently grounded in linguistic semantics, impairing effective cross-modal alignment - particularly when visual semantics or geometric relationships must be reasoned over across distant regions or multiple images. To address these challenges, we propose ''chatting with images'', a new framework that reframes visual manipulation as language-guided feature modulation. Under the guidance of expressive language prompts, the model dynamically performs joint re-encoding over multiple image regions, enabling tighter coupling between linguistic reasoning and visual state updates. We instantiate this paradigm in ViLaVT, a novel LVLM equipped with a dynamic vision encoder explicitly designed for such interactive visual reasoning, and trained it with a two-stage curriculum combining supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning to promote effective reasoning behaviors. Extensive experiments across eight benchmarks demonstrate that ViLaVT achieves strong and consistent improvements, with particularly pronounced gains on complex multi-image and video-based spatial reasoning tasks."

    "abstract": "Reservoir Computing (RC), a type of recurrent random neural network, is a powerful framework for modeling complex and chaotic dynamics. However, its autonomous (closed-loop) operation is often plagued by inherent instability. Moreover, performance is highly sensitive to the reservoir's random initialization, leading to vulnerability to noise and/or behaviour that bears no resemblance whatsoever to the target dynamical system. Here we identify a primary cause of this unreliability: the emergence of excessive, spurious unstable or neutral modes in the closed-loop dynamics. We introduce a simple deterministic input layer design principle that directly addresses this vulnerability by structurally suppressing the emergence of these spurious modes a priori (before training). Our approach dramatically improves robustness to both initialization sensitivity and internal noise, doubling the prediction horizon. Furthermore, we demonstrate on chaotic dynamical systems that this design enables robust estimation of the full Lyapunov spectrum (100\\% success rate across 50 seeds), signifying that the autonomous RC faithfully emulates the essential properties of the target dynamical system. This work provides a systematic explanation for a common RC failure mode and offers a concrete design guideline, advancing RCs from heuristic trial-and-error tuning toward a reliable tool for modeling complex systems."

In this work, we carefully investigate this phenomenon in symmetric and asymmetric geometries, shedding light on practical considerations in situations when a closed-form analytical solution is not readily available. Combinations of time domain analysis and spectral filtering are used to enable systematic analysis of these structures. Our approach can be generalized to more complex structures, including multilayered and inhomogeneous cases, providing new opportunities for optimized energy storage and advanced sensing applications utilizing complex-frequency dynamics in lossless designs."

We pretrain motion time-series models using such synthetic data and evaluate their transfer across diverse downstream HAR tasks. Our results show that synthetic pretraining improves generalisation when mixed with real data or scaled sufficiently.

Besides, a signal can only travel a maximum distance before its quality falls below a certain threshold, necessitating its regeneration by regenerators installed at network nodes. In addition, the price of installing and maintaining regenerators belongs to a discrete uncertainty set. Robust optimization seeks a solution with guaranteed performance against all scenarios modeled in an uncertainty set. Thus, the problem is to find a subset of nodes with minimum cost for the placement of the regenerator, ensuring that all nodes can communicate even if a subset of network links fails. To solve the problem optimally, we propose two solution approaches, including one flow-based and one cut-based integer programming formulation, as well as their iterative exact method.

    "abstract": "Isomerization in molecular systems almost invariably occurs through 3-dimensional motion due to the nature of chemical bonding. Pseudorotation is an unusual type of isomerization that occurs in some high symmetry systems that gives the appearance of rigid-body rotation yet only involves atom rearrangements. This paper demonstrates that pseudorotation occurs in 2-dimensions in an optical matter (OM) system of metal nanoparticle constituents. The difference in dimensionality of the dynamics arises from the electrodynamic field-interference nature of optical binding vs. quantum mechanical bonding in polyatomic molecules. The 8-nanoparticle OM \"kite\" structure we study in experiments and simulations has D2 (D2h) symmetry and a D4 symmetric transition state. The mechanism for pseudorotation involves correlated motion of all 8 nanoparticles with smooth (continuous) evolution of their interactions and without particles jumping in or out of the OM array. While the OM kite structure only occurs with 10% probability vs. other OM isomers, its rate of pseudorotation is rapid relative to transitions to other structural isomers (e.g., \"teardrop\"). The other isomers have structures that lie on a trigonal lattice with inter-particle separations at distances that enhance field interference and induced polarizations. Even though the kite isomer has inter-particle separations that would manifest destructive interference on a particle pair (i.e., 2-body) basis, the kite structure is the slowest to rearrange into any other isomer. We show that the unusual structure and dynamics of the kite optical matter system result from N-body interactions and forces demonstrating that N-body effects are important in this class of active matter and presumably more generally."

While recent works have further proven the universality of a (slightly generalized) model, the next immediate question pertains to its trainability, i.e., whether it suffers from the exponentially vanishing loss gradients, known as the barren plateau issue, preventing effective use, and how regimes of trainability overlap with regimes of possible quantum advantage. Here, we provide significant strides in these directions. To study the trainability at initialization, we analytically derive closed-form expressions for the variances of the partial derivatives of the MMD loss function and provide general upper and lower bounds. With uniform initialization, we show that barren plateaus depend on the generator set and the spectrum of the chosen kernel. We identify regimes in which low-weight-biased kernels avoid exponential gradient suppression in structured topologies. Also, we prove that a small-variance Gaussian initialization ensures polynomial scaling for the gradient under mild conditions. As for the potential quantum advantage, we further argue, based on previous complexity-theoretic arguments, that sparse IQP families can output a probability distribution family that is classically intractable, and that this distribution remains trainable at initialization at least at lower-weight frequencies."

The best performing approach successfully reorders documents up to 15 pages, with Kendall's tau ranging from 0.95 for short documents (2-5 pages) to 0.72 for 15 page documents. We observe two unexpected failures: seq2seq transformers fail to generalize on long documents (Kendall's tau drops from 0.918 on 2-5 pages to 0.014 on 21-25 pages), and curriculum learning underperforms direct training by 39% on long documents. Ablation studies suggest learned positional encodings are one contributing factor to seq2seq failure, though the degradation persists across all encoding variants, indicating multiple interacting causes. Attention pattern analysis reveals that short and long documents require fundamentally different ordering strategies, explaining why curriculum learning fails. Model specialization achieves substantial improvements on longer documents (+0.21 tau)."

Network topology shapes this memory structure in distinct ways: small-world rewiring drives dynamics toward a single dominant relaxation mode, while fragmented environments sustain multiple persistent modes corresponding to isolated subpopulations. We apply this framework to covert influence operations where adversaries manipulate target populations exclusively via environmental intermediaries. The steady-state response admits a random-walk interpretation through hitting probabilities, revealing how zealot opinions diffuse through the environment to shift system agent opinions toward the zealot mean - even when zealots never directly contact targets."

Despite recent progress of large visual-language models and agentic AI, accurately counting such instruments remains highly challenging, particularly in dense scenarios where instruments are tightly clustered. To address this problem, we introduce Chain-of-Look, a novel visual reasoning framework that mimics the sequential human counting process by enforcing a structured visual chain, rather than relying on classic object detection which is unordered. This visual chain guides the model to count along a coherent spatial trajectory, improving accuracy in complex scenes. To further enforce the physical plausibility of the visual chain, we introduce the neighboring loss function, which explicitly models the spatial constraints inherent to densely packed surgical instruments. We also present SurgCount-HD, a new dataset comprising 1,464 high-density surgical instrument images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches for counting (e.g., CountGD, REC) as well as Multimodality Large Language Models (e.g., Qwen, ChatGPT) in the challenging task of dense surgical instrument counting."

In this work, we introduce the Degree of Information Abstraction (DIA), a general metric that quantifies how well a representation compresses input data while preserving task-relevant semantics. We derive a tractable information-theoretic formulation of DIA and propose a DIA-based information abstraction framework. As a case study, we apply DIA to a large language model (LLM)-guided video transmission task, where abstraction-aware encoding significantly reduces transmission volume by $99.75\\%$, while maintaining semantic fidelity. Our results suggest that DIA offers a principled tool for rebalancing energy and information in intelligent systems and opens new directions in neural network design, neuromorphic computing, semantic communication, and joint sensing-communication architectures."

When $g,g^{\\prime}\\in\\text{range}(F)$, we show that: 1) Unregularized projection: exact preservation holds iff $P$ is injective on $\\text{range}(F)$, which necessitates $m\\geq \\text{rank}(F)$; 2) Regularized projection: ridge regularization fundamentally alters the sketching barrier, with approximation guarantees governed by the effective dimension of $F$ at the regularization scale; 3) Factorized influence: for Kronecker-factored curvatures $F=A\\otimes E$, the guarantees continue to hold for decoupled sketches $P=P_A\\otimes P_E$, even though such sketches exhibit row correlations that violate i.i.d. assumptions. Beyond this range-restricted setting, we analyze out-of-range test gradients and quantify a \\emph{leakage} term that arises when test gradients have components in $\\ker(F)$. This yields guarantees for influence queries on general test points. Overall, this work develops a novel theory that characterizes when projection provably preserves influence and provides principled guidance for choosing the sketch size in practice."

    "abstract": "The no-cloning theorem forbids the creation of identical copies of qubits, thereby imposing strong limitations on quantum technologies. A recently-proposed protocol, encrypted cloning, showed, however, that the creation of perfect clones is theoretically possible - if the clones are simultaneously encrypted with a single-use decryption key. It has remained an open question, however, whether encrypted cloning is stable under hardware noise and thus practical as a quantum primitive. This is nontrivial because spreading quantum information widely could dilute it until barely exceeding the noise level, leading to catastrophic fidelity decay. Given the complexity of hardware noise, theory and classical simulation are insufficient to settle this. Here, we settle this question experimentally, on IBM Heron-R2 superconducting processors using up to 154 qubits. We find that encrypted cloning is stable under hardware noise, even when used as a module, namely in parallel, series or interleaved, while preserving pre-existing entanglement. This establishes it as a versatile quantum primitive for practical use, and it necessitates a refinement to our understanding of the no-cloning theorem: quantum information can be spread at will, in theory and in practice, without dilution or degradation, if encrypted or obscured. The actual constraint is that the decryption mechanism must be single-use."

We introduce YOR, an open-source, low-cost mobile manipulator that integrates an omnidirectional base, a telescopic vertical lift, and two arms with grippers to achieve whole-body mobility and manipulation. Our design emphasizes modularity, ease of assembly using off-the-shelf components, and affordability, with a bill-of-materials cost under 10,000 USD. We demonstrate YOR's capability by completing tasks that require coordinated whole-body control, bimanual manipulation, and autonomous navigation.

It has various applications in different areas, such as forensic linguistics and general linguistics studies. Although considerable research has been conducted on NLI regarding two different languages, such as English and German, the literature indicates a significant gap regarding NLI for dialects and subdialects. The gap becomes wider in less-resourced languages such as Kurdish. This research focuses on NLI within the context of a subdialect of Sorani (Central) Kurdish. It aims to investigate the NLI for Hewlêri, a subdialect spoken in Hewlêr (Erbil), the Capital of the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. We collected about 24 hours of speech by recording interviews with 40 native or non-native Hewlêri speakers, 17 female and 23 male. We created three Neural Network-based models: Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), which were evaluated through 66 experiments, covering various time-frames from 1 to 60 seconds, undersampling, oversampling, and cross-validation. The RNN model showed the highest accuracy of 95.92% for 5-second audio segmentation, using an 80:10:10 data splitting scheme. The created dataset is the first speech dataset for NLI on the Hewlêri subdialect in the Sorani Kurdish dialect, which can be of benefit to various research areas."

Because each participant invests data and compute, clients need mechanisms to later prove the provenance of a jointly trained model. Model watermarking embeds a hidden signal in the weights, but naive approaches either do not scale with many clients as per-client watermarks dilute as $K$ grows, or give any individual client the ability to verify and potentially remove the watermark. We introduce $(t,K)$-threshold watermarking: clients collaboratively embed a shared watermark during training, while only coalitions of at least $t$ clients can reconstruct the watermark key and verify a suspect model. We secret-share the watermark key $τ$ so that coalitions of fewer than $t$ clients cannot reconstruct it, and verification can be performed without revealing $τ$ in the clear. We instantiate our protocol in the white-box setting and evaluate on image classification. Our watermark remains detectable at scale ($K=128$) with minimal accuracy loss and stays above the detection threshold ($z\\ge 4$) under attacks including adaptive fine-tuning using up to 20% of the training data."

We constrained the large parameter space by training a binary classifier to predict parameter combinations yielding observations in regimes of interest, i.e. moderate spike counts. We compared two neural density estimators: one using handcrafted summary statistics and one using a summary network trained in combination with the neural density estimator. The summary network yielded a more focused posterior and generated posterior predictive traces that accurately captured the membrane potential dynamics. When using handcrafted summary statistics, posterior predictive traces match the included features but show deviations in the exact dynamics. The posteriors showed signs of bias and miscalibration but were still able to yield posterior predictive samples that were close to the target observations on which the posteriors were constrained.

Our approach surpasses existing solutions by approximately 5% in CLIPScore-based visual quality, benefiting from its inherent handling of right angles and flexible settings.

For example, the number of up-votes on social media posts, or the number of bicycles available at a public rental station. While it is possible to model these as continuous values, and to apply traditional regression, this approach changes the underlying distribution on the labels from discrete to continuous. Discrete distributions have certain benefits, which leads us to the question whether such integer labels can be modeled directly by a discrete distribution, whose parameters are predicted from the features of a given instance. Moreover, we focus on the use case of output distributions of neural networks, which adds the requirement that the parameters of the distribution be continuous so that backpropagation and gradient descent may be used to learn the weights of the network. We investigate several options for such distributions, some existing and some novel, and test them on a range of tasks, including tabular learning, sequential prediction and image generation. We find that overall the best performance comes from two distributions: Bitwise, which represents the target integer in bits and places a Bernoulli distribution on each, and a discrete analogue of the Laplace distribution, which uses a distribution with exponentially decaying tails around a continuous mean."

The proposed architecture prioritizes efficiency by filtering known threats through heuristics, classifying uncertain samples using machine learning, and validating borderline cases with third-party intelligence. On benchmark datasets, SecureScan achieves 93.1 percent accuracy with balanced precision (0.87) and recall (0.92), demonstrating strong generalization and reduced overfitting through threshold-based decision calibration. A calibrated threshold and gray-zone logic (0.45-0.55) were introduced to minimize false positives and enhance real-world stability.

Characteristic such tools, e.g., Why3, Dafny, and Viper, is that this process does not involve user interaction, expecting all guiding hints like invariants to be given upfront. For sequential correctness, this paradigm is well established, thanks to approaches like weakest precondition generation and symbolic execution. However, to capture temporal properties, the specification language of choice for a broader system perspective, additional concerns and challenges are introduced into the translation and proof. Approaches based on symbolic model-checking can verify such properties on system models, e.g., using automata constructions. However, ascribing temporal properties to structured and data-intensive programs is more difficult. Several program calculi have been proposed in the literature, each of which on their own falls short in some regard of supporting an auto-active workflow. However, all essential ideas, while perhaps some are not widely acknowledged, are in fact found in the literature. In this paper, we demonstrate how to assemble these ideas into a weakest-precondition calculus for linear temporal properties and demonstrate it with examples."

    "abstract": "Two-sided marketplaces embody heterogeneity in incentives: producers seek exposure while consumers seek relevance, and balancing these competing objectives through constrained optimization is now a standard practice. Yet real platforms face finer-grained complexity: consumers differ in preferences and engagement patterns, producers vary in catalog value and capacity, and business objectives impose additional constraints beyond raw relevance. We formalize two-sided fairness under these realistic conditions, extending prior work from soft single-item allocations to discrete multi-item recommendations. We introduce Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) as a consumer-side objective that compresses group-level utility disparities, and integrate business constraints directly into the optimization. Our experiments reveal that the \"free fairness\" regime, where producer constraints impose no consumer cost, disappears in multi item settings. Strikingly, moderate fairness constraints can improve business metrics by diversifying exposure away from saturated producers. Scalable solvers match exact solutions at a fraction of the runtime, making fairness-aware allocation practical at scale. These findings reframe fairness not as a tax on platform efficiency but as a lever for sustainable marketplace health."

    "abstract": "Kidney exchange programs among hospitals in the United States and across European countries improve efficiency by pooling donors and patients on a centralized platform. Sustaining such cooperation requires stability. When the core is empty, hospitals or countries may withhold easily matched pairs for internal use, creating incentive problems that undermine participation and reduce the scope and efficiency of exchange. We propose a method to restore core stability by augmenting the platform with altruistic donors. Although the worst-case number of required altruists can be large, we show that in realistic settings only a small number is needed. We analyze two models of the compatibility graph, one based on random graphs and the other on compatibility types. When only pairwise exchanges are allowed, the number of required altruists is bounded by the maximum number of independent odd cycles, defined as disjoint odd cycles with no edges between them. This bound grows logarithmically with market size in the random graph model and is at most one third of the number of compatibility types in the type-based model. When small exchange cycles are allowed, it suffices for each participating organization to receive a number of altruists proportional to the number of compatibility types. Finally, simulations show that far fewer altruists are needed in practice than worst-case theory suggests."

The resulting matter-geometry coupling introduces additional dynamical effects that may account for the late-time acceleration of the universe without invoking dark energy. In the present work, we focus instead on the early-time regime and investigate the corresponding quantum cosmological dynamics. We analyze a Friedmann--Lemaitre--Robertson--Walker (FLRW) universe within the $f(R, T)$ framework, employing Schutz's perfect fluid formalism to extract a time parameter emerging from the matter sector itself. This approach is particularly well motivated in $f(R, T)$ gravity, where the coupling between geometry and the energy-momentum tensor's trace makes matter an active participant in the dynamics of spacetime and the evolution of cosmic time. The gravitational Hamiltonian, canonical momenta, and potential are derived, leading to the corresponding Schrödinger--Wheeler--DeWitt (SWDW) equation. The wave function of the universe is obtained for specific forms of $f(R, T)$, and the results are compared with previous studies in $f(R)$ and $f(R, T)$ models, highlighting the role of matter-geometry coupling in the emergence of quantum cosmological dynamics."

To address these challenges, we propose a framework for fast and predictive video-conditioned action. Our approach first selects and adapts a robust video generation model to ensure reliable future predictions, then applies adversarial distillation for fast, few-step video generation, and finally trains an action model that leverages both generated videos and real observations to correct spatial errors. Extensive experiments show that our method produces temporally coherent, spatially accurate video predictions that directly support precise manipulation, achieving significant improvements in embodiment consistency, spatial referring ability, and task completion over existing baselines.

In practice it is often extremely effective, even when the preconditioner is learned from the chain. We analyse and compare the finite-time computational costs of schemes which learn a preconditioner based on the target covariance or the expected Hessian of the target potential with that of a corresponding scheme that does not use preconditioning. We apply our results to the Unadjusted Langevin Algorithm (ULA) for an appropriately regular target, establishing non-asymptotic guarantees for preconditioned ULA which learns its preconditioner. Our results are also applied to the unadjusted underdamped Langevin algorithm in the supplementary material. To do so, we establish non-asymptotic guarantees on the time taken to collect $N$ approximately independent samples from the target for schemes that learn their preconditioners under the assumption that the underlying Markov chain satisfies a contraction condition in the Wasserstein-2 distance. This approximate independence condition, that we formalize, allows us to bridge the non-asymptotic bounds of modern MCMC theory and classical heuristics of effective sample size and mixing time, and is needed to amortise the costs of learning a preconditioner across the many samples it will be used to produce."

This is most relevant in the design of spacecraft, where radiation pressure presents the dominant non-conservative forcing mechanism, which is the case beyond approximately 800 km altitude. Despite its importance, the high computational cost of high-fidelity radiation pressure modeling has limited its use in large-scale spacecraft design, optimization, and space situational awareness applications. We enable this by offering three innovations in the simulation, in representation and in optimization: First, a practical computer graphics-inspired Monte-Carlo (MC) simulation of radiation pressure. The simulation is highly parallel, uses importance sampling and next-event estimation to reduce variance and allows simulating an entire family of designs instead of a single spacecraft as in previous work. Second, we introduce neural networks as a representation of forces from design parameters. This neural proxy model, learned from simulations, is inherently differentiable and can query forces orders of magnitude faster than a full MC simulation. Third, and finally, we demonstrate optimizing inverse radiation pressure designs, such as finding geometry, material or operation parameters that minimizes travel time, maximizes proximity given a desired end-point, minimize thruster fuel, trains mission control policies or allocated compute budget in extraterrestrial compute."

    "abstract": "Cross-view geo-localization (CVGL) is pivotal for GNSS-denied UAV navigation but remains brittle under the drastic geometric misalignment between oblique aerial views and orthographic satellite references. Existing methods predominantly operate within a 2D manifold, neglecting the underlying 3D geometry where view-dependent vertical facades (macro-structure) and scale variations (micro-scale) severely corrupt feature alignment. To bridge this gap, we propose (MGS)$^2$, a geometry-grounded framework. The core of our innovation is the Macro-Geometric Structure Filtering (MGSF) module. Unlike pixel-wise matching sensitive to noise, MGSF leverages dilated geometric gradients to physically filter out high-frequency facade artifacts while enhancing the view-invariant horizontal plane, directly addressing the domain shift. To guarantee robust input for this structural filtering, we explicitly incorporate a Micro-Geometric Scale Adaptation (MGSA) module. MGSA utilizes depth priors to dynamically rectify scale discrepancies via multi-branch feature fusion. Furthermore, a Geometric-Appearance Contrastive Distillation (GACD) loss is designed to strictly discriminate against oblique occlusions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that (MGS)$^2$ achieves state-of-the-art performance, recording a Recall@1 of 97.5\\% on University-1652 and 97.02\\% on SUES-200. Furthermore, the framework exhibits superior cross-dataset generalization against geometric ambiguity.

    "abstract": "Operating drones in urban environments often means they need to land on rooftops, which can have different geometries and surface irregularities. Accurately detecting roof inclination using conventional sensing methods, such as vision-based or acoustic techniques, can be unreliable, as measurement quality is strongly influenced by external factors including weather conditions and surface materials. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel unmanned aerial manipulator morphology featuring a dual-arm aerial manipulator with an omnidirectional 3D workspace and extended reach. Building on this design, we develop a proprioceptive contact detection and contact localization strategy based on a momentum-based torque observer. This enables the UAM to infer the inclination of slanted surfaces blindly - through physical interaction - prior to touchdown. We validate the approach in flight experiments, demonstrating robust landings on surfaces with inclinations of up to 30.5 degrees and achieving an average surface inclination estimation error of 2.87 degrees over 9 experiments at different incline angles."

    "abstract": "AI-based systems can increasingly perform work tasks autonomously. In safety-critical tasks, human oversight of these systems is required to mitigate risks and to ensure responsibility in case something goes wrong. Since people often struggle to stay focused and perform good oversight, intelligent support systems are used to assist them, giving decision recommendations, alerting users, or restricting them from dangerous actions. However, in cases where recommendations are wrong, decision support might undermine the very reason why human oversight was employed -- genuine moral responsibility. The goal of our study was to investigate how a decision support system that restricted available interventions would affect overseer's perceived moral responsibility, in particular in cases where the support errs. In a simulated oversight experiment, participants (\\textit{N}=274) monitored an autonomous drone that faced ten critical situations, choosing from six possible actions to resolve each situation. An AI system constrained participants' choices to either six, four, two, or only one option (between-subject study). Results showed that participants, who were restricted to choosing from a single action, felt less morally responsible if a crash occurred. At the same time, participants' judgments about the responsibility of other stakeholders (the AI; the developer of the AI) did not change between conditions. Our findings provide important insights for user interface design and oversight architectures: they should prevent users from attributing moral agency to AI, help them understand how moral responsibility is distributed, and, when oversight aims to prevent ethically undesirable outcomes, be designed to support the epistemic and causal conditions required for moral responsibility."

New JWST/NIRSpec IFU observations target the tip of the structure, where a SMBH would produce a bow shock, whereas a normal galaxy would host an HII region. Using standard BPT diagrams ([OIII]5007/Hb vs [NII]6583/Ha and [OIII]5007/Hb vs [OII]6716,6731/Ha), we find that the line ratios at the tip fall on the locus of low-metallicity low-extinction HII regions. This region does not overlap with loci typical of shocks in merging galaxies. Thus, these results are consistent with the interpretation that the linear structure is a star-forming galaxy, with the bright knot representing one of its HII regions."

    "abstract": "Bayesian Optimization (BO) is a powerful tool for optimizing complex non-linear systems. However, its performance degrades in high-dimensional problems with tightly coupled parameters and highly asymmetric objective landscapes, where rewards are sparse. In such needle-in-a-haystack scenarios, even advanced methods like trust-region BO (TurBO) often lead to unsatisfactory results. We propose a domain knowledge guided Bayesian Optimization approach, which leverages physical insight to fundamentally simplify the search problem by transforming coordinates to decouple input features and align the active subspaces with the primary search axes. We demonstrate this approach's efficacy on a challenging 12-dimensional, 6-crystal Split-and-Delay optical system, where conventional approaches, including standard BO, TuRBO and multi-objective BO, consistently led to unsatisfactory results. When combined with an reverse annealing exploration strategy, this approach reliably converges to the global optimum. The coordinate transformation itself is the key to this success, significantly accelerating the search by aligning input co-ordinate axes with the problem's active subspaces. As increasingly complex scientific instruments, from large telescopes to new spectrometers at X-ray Free Electron Lasers are deployed, the demand for robust high-dimensional optimization grows. Our results demonstrate a generalizable paradigm: leveraging physical insight to transform high-dimensional, coupled optimization problems into simpler representations can enable rapid and robust automated tuning for consistent high performance while still retaining current optimization algorithms."

To bridge this gap, we introduce AudioRAG, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate audio-based reasoning augmented by information retrieval in realistic web environments. This benchmark comprises both LLM-generated and manually curated question-answer pairs. Our evaluations reveal that even the state-of-the-art LALMs struggle to answer these questions.

Our main idea is to exploit the palindromicity of the equivariant $Z$-polynomial, reducing the computation to the already established symmetric-group equivariant Kazhdan--Lusztig theory for the graphic matroids of cycle graphs, and then to apply Proudfoot's equivariant Kazhdan--Lusztig--Stanley inversion identity to obtain the inverse polynomial. Passing to dimensions recovers the previously known nonequivariant thagomizer polynomials, while the coefficient formulas admit a natural expression in terms of the wreath product Frobenius characteristic for the hyperoctahedral group."

The proposed metrics assess how synthetic data reproduces key temporal characteristics, categorized into marginal, covariance, individual-level and measurement structures. We show that strong marginal-level resemblance may conceal distortions in covariance and disruptions in individual-level trajectories. Temporal preservation is influenced by factors such as original data quality, measurement frequency, and preprocessing strategies, including binning, variable encoding and precision. Variables with sparse or highly irregular measurement times provide limited information for learning temporal dependencies, resulting in reduced resemblance between the synthetic and original data. No single metric adequately captures temporal preservation; instead, a multidimensional evaluation across all characteristics provides a more comprehensive assessment of synthetic data quality. Overall, the proposed metrics clarify how and why temporal structures are preserved or degraded, enabling more reliable evaluation and improvement of generative models and supporting the creation of temporally realistic synthetic longitudinal patient data."

While the bump-on-tail (BOT) instability within the Berk-Breizman framework has served as a canonical model for understanding such phenomena, a unified nonlinear description remains incomplete when drag, diffusion, and Krook relaxation act simultaneously. In this work, we present a comprehensive numerical investigation of the BOT instability that explicitly retains all three collision operators together with external wave damping. Using a validated characteristic-based BOT code, we systematically scan the multi-dimensional collision parameter space and construct nonlinear regime maps and bifurcation diagrams. To organize the rich dynamics, we introduce a two-level categorization that combines global wave-energy evolution with chirping subtypes identified from spectral morphology. We find that diffusion and Krook relaxation regularize the nonlinear dynamics and promote ordered transitions from chaotic behaviors to periodic oscillations and steady saturation as collision strength increases, with the saturation level decreasing approximately exponentially with external damping. In contrast, drag alone does not admit steady solutions and instead drives persistent or chaotic chirping through convective deformation of resonant phase-space structures. When drag is combined with diffusion or Krook relaxation, clear transition sequences emerge: increasing drag breaks hole-clump symmetry, broadens the effective resonance region, and drives systematic transitions from transient to intermittent and persistent chirping."

Here, we establish antiferroaxial altermagnetism as a broadly prevalent, generic, and microscopically grounded multiferroic mechanism, in which antiferroaxial counter-rotating distortions both induce altermagnetism and enable its deterministic and reversible switching. Within a unified Landau-theory and symmetry framework, we identify a symmetry-allowed trilinear invariant coupling the antiferroaxial order, the Néel vector, and the altermagnetic order, and derive general symmetry criteria for its occurrence. This coupling locks the induced altermagnetism to the antiferroaxial order, so that reversing the latter reverses the spin splitting and associated time-reversal-odd responses, such as anomalous Hall conductivity. We provide a practical spin group dictionary mapping Néel-vector representations to the resulting $d$-, $g$-, and $i$-wave antiferroaxial altermagnetism, validate the mechanism with ligand-rotation tight-binding models and first-principles calculations, and identify many candidate materials by screening the MAGNDATA and C2DB databases. Our results elevate antiferroaxiality to a universal ferroic control knob for structurally programmable altermagnetic spintronics."

    "abstract": "Sampling equilibrium molecular configurations from the Boltzmann distribution is a longstanding challenge. Boltzmann Generators (BGs) address this by combining exact-likelihood generative models with importance sampling, but their practical scalability is limited. Meanwhile, coarse-grained surrogates enable the modeling of larger systems by reducing effective dimensionality, yet often lack the reweighting process required to ensure asymptotically correct statistics. In this work, we propose Coarse-Grained Boltzmann Generators (CG-BGs), a principled framework that unifies scalable reduced-order modeling with the exactness of importance sampling. CG-BGs act in a coarse-grained coordinate space, using a learned potential of mean force (PMF) to reweight samples generated by a flow-based model. Crucially, we show that this PMF can be efficiently learned from rapidly converged data via force matching. Our results demonstrate that CG-BGs faithfully capture complex interactions mediated by explicit solvent within highly reduced representations, establishing a scalable pathway for the unbiased sampling of larger molecular systems."

    "abstract": "With the growing deployment of sequential recommender systems in e-commerce and other fields, their black-box interfaces raise security concerns: models are vulnerable to extraction and subsequent adversarial manipulation. Existing black-box extraction attacks primarily rely on hard labels or pairwise learning, often ignoring the importance of ranking positions, which results in incomplete knowledge transfer. Moreover, adversarial sequences generated via pure gradient methods lack semantic consistency with real user behavior, making them easily detectable. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a dual-enhanced attack framework. First, drawing on primacy effects and position bias, we introduce a cognitive distribution-driven extraction mechanism that maps discrete rankings into continuous value distributions with position-aware decay, thereby advancing from order alignment to cognitive distribution alignment. Second, we design a behavior-aware noisy item generation strategy that jointly optimizes collaborative signals and gradient signals. This ensures both semantic coherence and statistical stealth while effectively promoting target item rankings. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods in both attack success rate and evasion rate, validating the value of integrating cognitive modeling and behavioral consistency for secure recommender systems."

We derive fluid and diffusion limits, yielding closed-form steady-state means, variances, and covariances for the joint queue--server process $(Q,S)$. The diffusion limits allow us to derive new staffing rules for the probability of delay and the probability of abandonment targets. A key insight is that server stochasticity induces systematic capacity loss relative to fixed--server systems, leading to a regime--dependent staffing adjustment: additive shifts in underloaded regimes and multiplicative scaling in overloaded regimes. Our simulation experiments confirm both the accuracy of the limit theorems and the performance of the staffing schedule's ability to achieve their targets."

Although recent progress in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) has boosted step-by-step inference in mathematics and coding, it is still underexplored whether this benefit transfers to socio-cognitive skills. We present a systematic study of nine advanced Large Language Models (LLMs), comparing reasoning models with non-reasoning models on three representative ToM benchmarks. The results show that reasoning models do not consistently outperform non-reasoning models and sometimes perform worse. A fine-grained analysis reveals three insights. First, slow thinking collapses: accuracy significantly drops as responses grow longer, and larger reasoning budgets hurt performance. Second, moderate and adaptive reasoning benefits performance: constraining reasoning length mitigates failure, while distinct success patterns demonstrate the necessity of dynamic adaptation. Third, option matching shortcut: when multiple choice options are removed, reasoning models improve markedly, indicating reliance on option matching rather than genuine deduction. We also design two intervention approaches: Slow-to-Fast (S2F) adaptive reasoning and Think-to-Match (T2M) shortcut prevention to further verify and mitigate the problems. With all results, our study highlights the advancement of LRMs in formal reasoning (e.g., math, code) cannot be fully transferred to ToM, a typical task in social reasoning. We conclude that achieving robust ToM requires developing unique capabilities beyond existing reasoning methods."

The key challenge stems from the degeneracy of $f(x)$, which leads to a more complex structure of the free boundary compared to the classical setting. To analyze it, we introduce the epiperimetric inequality developed by Weiss (Invent Math 138:23-50, 1999). Although this powerful tool was firstly introduced for the classical obstacle problem characterized by $f(x)>0$ in B_1, it also proves effective in our degenerate setting. This allows us to first obtain the decay rate of the Weiss energy for all blow-ups at the origin, which in turn implies the uniqueness of the blow-up profiles. With this uniqueness established, we then prove a very weak directional monotonicity properties satisfied by the solutions. This finally yields the regularity of the free boundary at the origin if the origin is a regular point."

    "abstract": "Cognitive load, the mental effort required during working memory, is central to neuroscience, psychology, and human-computer interaction. Accurate assessment is vital for adaptive learning, clinical monitoring, and brain-computer interfaces. Physiological signals such as pupillometry and electroencephalography are established biomarkers of cognitive load, but their comparative utility and practical integration as lightweight, wearable monitoring solutions remain underexplored. EEG provides high temporal resolution of neural activity. Although non-invasive, it is technologically demanding and limited in wearability and cost due to its resource-intensive nature, whereas pupillometry is non-invasive, portable, and scalable. Existing studies often rely on deep learning models with limited interpretability and substantial computational expense. This study integrates feature-based and model-driven approaches to advance time-series analysis. Using the OpenNeuro 'Digit Span Task' dataset, this study investigates cognitive load classification from EEG and pupillometry. Feature-based approaches using Catch-22 features and classical machine learning models outperform deep learning in both binary and multiclass tasks. The findings demonstrate that pupillometry alone can compete with EEG, serving as a portable and practical proxy for real-world applications. These results challenge the assumption that EEG is necessary for load detection, showing that pupil dynamics combined with interpretable models and SHAP based feature analysis provide physiologically meaningful insights. This work supports the development of wearable, affordable cognitive monitoring systems for neuropsychiatry, education, and healthcare."

Building on both procedures, we introduce the Principal Component based Highly Adaptive Lasso (PCHAL) and Principal Component based Highly Adaptive Ridge (PCHAR). These estimators constitute an outcome-blind dimension reduction which offer substantial gains in computational efficiency and match the empirical performances of HAL and HAR.

The Necessary President problem asks whether a candidate, if nominated, becomes the winner of the election for all possible nominations from other parties. We study the computational complexity of Necessary President for several voting rules. We show that while this problem is solvable in polynomial time for Borda, Maximin, and Copeland$^α$ for every $α\\in [0,1]$, it is $\\mathsf{coNP}$-complete for general classes of positional scoring rules that include $\\ell$-Approval and $\\ell$-Veto, even when the maximum size of a party is two.

Additionally, we prove that Necessary President for Ranked Pairs is $\\mathsf{coNP}$-complete even for maximum party size two, and $\\mathsf{W}[1]$-hard with respect to the number of parties; remarkably, both of these results hold even for constant number of voters."

Based on the learned symbolic model of states, NSAM learns action masks that rules out infeasible actions. NSAM enables end-to-end integration of symbolic reasoning and deep policy optimization, where improvements in symbolic grounding and policy learning mutually reinforce each other.

Mathematical problem-solving is central to students' success in mathematics education, yet many learners struggle to plan, justify, and verify their solutions. Although large language models (LLMs) show promise as intelligent tutors, they often lack structured pedagogical alignment grounded in established learning theories. To address this gap, we operationalize Polya's problem-solving framework within an instruction-tuned LLM to promote metacognitive engagement and examine the effects of pedagogy-aligned fine-tuning compared to domain-only and general-purpose instruction tuning. Built on the Llama-3.1-8B architecture, Llama-Polya was fine-tuned on synthetic math problem-solving data derived from GSM8K, structured according to Polya's four stages. We developed and evaluated multiple variants-general-purpose instruct, math-domain metamath, pedagogy-aligned polya-v2, and sequential metamath+polya-v2-using both quantitative accuracy metrics and qualitative pedagogical assessments. Results indicate that models tuned with Polya's framework and domain-specific data produced more balanced reasoning-stage distributions and fewer premature answers. Expert evaluators also observed improved pedagogical coherence and metacognitive prompting, although limitations in personalization and mathematical rigor remained. These findings suggest that pedagogy-grounded instruction tuning can enhance educational alignment and reasoning transparency in LLM-based tutoring systems."

    "abstract": "Underwater Image Enhancement (UIE) is an ill-posed problem where natural clean references are not available, and the degradation levels vary significantly across semantic regions. Existing UIE methods treat images with a single global model and ignore the inconsistent degradation of different scene components. This oversight leads to significant color distortions and loss of fine details in heterogeneous underwater scenes, especially where degradation varies significantly across different image regions. Therefore, we propose SUCode (Semantic-aware Underwater Codebook Network), which achieves adaptive UIE from semantic-aware discrete codebook representation. Compared with one-shot codebook-based methods, SUCode exploits semantic-aware, pixel-level codebook representation tailored to heterogeneous underwater degradation. A three-stage training paradigm is employed to represent raw underwater image features to avoid pseudo ground-truth contamination. Gated Channel Attention Module (GCAM) and Frequency-Aware Feature Fusion (FAFF) jointly integrate channel and frequency cues for faithful color restoration and texture recovery. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that SUCode achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming recent UIE methods on both reference and no-reference metrics. The code will be made public available at https://github.com/oucailab/SUCode."

    "abstract": "We study the almost sure convergence of the Stochastic Approximation algorithm to the fixed point $x^\\star$ of a nonlinear operator under a negative drift condition and a general noise sequence with finite $p$-th moment for some $p > 1$. Classical almost sure convergence results of Stochastic Approximation are mostly analyzed for the square-integrable noise setting, and it is shown that any non-summable but square-summable step size sequence is sufficient to obtain almost sure convergence. However, such a limitation prevents wider algorithmic application. In particular, many applications in Machine Learning and Operations Research admit heavy-tailed noise with infinite variance, rendering such guarantees inapplicable. On the other hand, when a stronger condition on the noise is available, such guarantees on the step size would be too conservative, as practitioners would like to pick a larger step size for a more preferable convergence behavior. To this end, we show that any non-summable but $p$-th power summable step size sequence is sufficient to guarantee almost sure convergence, covering the gap in the literature. Our guarantees are obtained using a universal Lyapunov drift argument. For the regime $p \\in (1, 2)$, we show that using the Lyapunov function $\\norm{x-x^\\star}^p$ and applying a Taylor-like bound suffice. For $p > 2$, such an approach is no longer applicable, and therefore, we introduce a novel iterate projection technique to control the nonlinear terms produced by high-moment bounds and multiplicative noise. We believe our proof techniques and their implications could be of independent interest and pave the way for finite-time analysis of Stochastic Approximation under a general noise condition."

While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at basic Visual Question Answering (VQA), they consistently struggle to grasp the nuanced cultural, emotional, and contextual implications embedded in visual content. This difficulty stems from the task's demand for sophisticated multi-hop reasoning, cultural context, and Theory of Mind (ToM) capabilities, which current models lack. To fill this gap, we propose MetaphorStar, the first end-to-end visual reinforcement learning (RL) framework for image implication tasks. Our framework includes three core components: the fine-grained dataset TFQ-Data, the visual RL method TFQ-GRPO, and the well-structured benchmark TFQ-Bench. Our fully open-source MetaphorStar family, trained using TFQ-GRPO on TFQ-Data, significantly improves performance by an average of 82.6% on the image implication benchmarks. Compared with 20+ mainstream MLLMs, MetaphorStar-32B achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) on Multiple-Choice Question and Open-Style Question, significantly outperforms the top closed-source model Gemini-3.0-pro on True-False Question. Crucially, our experiments reveal that learning image implication tasks improves the general understanding ability, especially the complex visual reasoning ability. We further provide a systematic analysis of model parameter scaling, training data scaling, and the impact of different model architectures and training strategies, demonstrating the broad applicability of our method.

    "abstract": "The original version of the de Broglie-Bohm pilot-wave theory, also called Bohmian mechanics, attempted to treat the wave function or pilot wave as a part of the physical ontology of nature. More recent versions of the de Broglie-Bohm theory appearing in the last few decades have tried to regard the pilot wave instead as an aspect of the theory's nomology, or dynamical laws. This paper argues that neither of these views is correct, and that the de Broglie-Bohm pilot wave is best understood as a collection of latent variables in the sense of a hidden Markov model, a construct that was not available when de Broglie and Bohm originally formulated what became their pilot-wave theory. This paper also discusses several other challenges for the ontological view of the pilot wave. One such challenge is due to Foldy-Wouthuysen gauge transformations, which connect up with the Deotto-Ghirardi ambiguity in the de Broglie-Bohm theory. Another challenge arises from the freedom to carry out canonical transformations in the wave function's own notion of phase space, as defined by Strocchi and Heslot."

The obtained expressions have a visual representation in the form of rooted trees and Feynman-type diagrams, where their structural pattern will explain the combinatorial factors involved in the expansion. These representations offer a novel application and interpretation specifically tailored for the secondorder, damped Klein-Gordon setting, enabling more complex causal relationships to be explicitly modeled compared to first-order stochastic approaches, thus marking a technical innovation in diagrammatic expansions for such systems. The model takes into account both the initial data from a deterministic approach as well as stochastic sources, for instance, Gaussian noise. Simulations have been performed symmetry-breaking regime to show the relaxation towards stationary states and the symmetry-broken patterns."

    "abstract": "While reasoning over long context is crucial for various real-world applications, it remains challenging for large language models (LLMs) as they suffer from performance degradation as the context length grows. Recent work MemAgent has tried to tackle this by processing context chunk-by-chunk in an RNN-like loop and updating a textual memory for final answering. However, this naive recurrent memory update faces two crucial drawbacks: (i) memory can quickly explode because it can update indiscriminately, even on evidence-free chunks; and (ii) the loop lacks an exit mechanism, leading to unnecessary computation after even sufficient evidence is collected. To address these issues, we propose GRU-Mem, which incorporates two text-controlled gates for more stable and efficient long-context reasoning. Specifically, in GRU-Mem, the memory only updates when the update gate is open and the recurrent loop will exit immediately once the exit gate is open. To endow the model with such capabilities, we introduce two reward signals $r^{\\text{update}}$ and $r^{\\text{exit}}$ within end-to-end RL, rewarding the correct updating and exiting behaviors respectively. Experiments on various long-context reasoning tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of GRU-Mem, which generally outperforms the vanilla MemAgent with up to 400\\% times inference speed acceleration."

Specifically, for any constant $0<c<1$, no algorithm that inspects only an induced subgraph of order at most $n^c$ can determine whether $G(n,p)$ contains a dominating set of size $k=\\ln n$. We demonstrate that the existence of such a dominating set can be flipped by a local symmetry mapping that alters only a constant number of edges, thereby producing indistinguishable random graph instances which require exhaustive search. These results demonstrate that the extreme hardness of the dominating set problem in random graphs cannot be attributed to local structure, but instead arises from the self-referential nature and near-independence structure of the entire solution space."

The dynamic knowledge base with DCMD is added to the UGVs to: support enhanced situation awareness; improve autonomous decision making; and facilitate agility within complex and dynamic environments. As UGVs are heavily reliant on the a priori information added pre-mission, unexpected occurrences during a mission can cause identification ambiguities and require increased levels of user input. Updating this a priori information with contextual information can help UGVs realise their full potential. To address this, the dynamic knowledge base was designed using an ontology-driven representation, supported by near real-time information acquisition and analysis, to provide in-mission on-platform DCMD updates. This was implemented on a team of four UGVs that executed a laboratory based surveillance mission. The results showed that the ontology-driven dynamic representation of the UGV operational environment was machine actionable, producing contextual information to support a successful and timely mission, and contributed directly to the situation awareness."

We propose a distributional viewpoint and introduce **statistical provability**, defined as the finite-horizon success probability of reaching a verified proof, averaged over an instance distribution, and formalize modern theorem-proving pipelines as time-bounded MDPs. Exploiting Bellman structure, we prove existence of optimal policies under mild regularity, derive provability certificates via sub-/super-solution inequalities, and bound the performance gap of score-guided planning (greedy/top-\\(k\\)/beam/rollouts) in terms of approximation error, sequential statistical complexity, representation geometry (metric entropy/doubling structure), and action-gap margin tails.

To resolve this, we introduce RLTT (Reward Latent Thought Trajectories), a reinforcement learning framework which distributes reward across the full latent reasoning trajectory. RLTT provides dense, trajectory-level credit assignment without relying on external verifiers and can directly replace GRPO with negligible overhead. Across extensive experiments with Ouro-2.6B-Thinking under identical training and inference conditions, RLTT yields substantial improvements over GRPO on challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks, improving accuracy by +14.4% on MATH-500, +16.6% on AIME24, and +10.0% on BeyondAIME. Despite being trained exclusively on mathematics, RLTT also transfers effectively to non-mathematical reasoning benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of trajectory-level credit assignment for reinforcement learning in LoopLMs."

We suggest that even weak vertically correlated disorder (arising from interstitial-oxygen staging, twin boundaries, extended strain fields, or defect-pinned charge textures) can impose a layer-dependent modulation of the interlayer tunneling amplitude t(z). Because the bare interlayer coupling is intrinsically small, such modulations generate an effectively multichannel c-axis electrodynamic response, consistent with multi-component Josephson plasma resonances, nonmonotonic c-axis resistivity, redistribution of bilayer magnetic spectral weight, and field-enhanced vertical CDW correlations. We propose a phenomenological framework in which the organization of disorder, rather than its magnitude, governs the effective interlayer coupling and its electrodynamic signatures. This viewpoint unifies diverse c-axis anomalies across several cuprate families, suggesting that controlling vertical disorder correlations offers a viable pathway for tuning dimensionality and interlayer coherence in high-Tc superconductors."

We apply the use of interpretability indicators -- originally proposed with SVDA -- to monitor attention dynamics during training and assess structural properties of the learned representations. Experimental evaluations on four widely used benchmarks -- CIFAR-10, FashionMNIST, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-100 -- demonstrate that SVDA consistently yields more interpretable attention patterns without sacrificing classification accuracy.

    "abstract": "We construct and analyze generative diffusions that transport a point mass to a prescribed target distribution over a finite time horizon using the stochastic interpolant framework. The drift is expressed as a conditional expectation that can be estimated from independent samples without simulating stochastic processes. We show that the diffusion coefficient can be tuned \\emph{a~posteriori} without changing the time-marginal distributions. Among all such tunings, we prove that minimizing the impact of estimation error on the path-space Kullback--Leibler divergence selects, in closed form, a Föllmer process -- a diffusion whose path measure minimizes relative entropy with respect to a reference process determined by the interpolation schedules alone. This yields a new variational characterization of Föllmer processes, complementing classical formulations via Schrödinger bridges and stochastic control. We further establish that, under this optimal diffusion coefficient, the path-space Kullback--Leibler divergence becomes independent of the interpolation schedule, rendering different schedules statistically equivalent in this variational sense."

To resolve the generalization bottleneck, we introduce a hierarchical Vision-Language-Action framework \\our{} that leverages the generalization of large-scale pre-trained world model for robust and generalizable VIsual Subgoal TAsk decomposition VISTA. Our hierarchical framework \\our{} consists of a world model as the high-level planner and a VLA as the low-level executor. The high-level world model first divides manipulation tasks into subtask sequences with goal images, and the low-level policy follows the textual and visual guidance to generate action sequences. Compared to raw textual goal specification, these synthesized goal images provide visually and physically grounded details for low-level policies, making it feasible to generalize across unseen objects and novel scenarios. We validate both visual goal synthesis and our hierarchical VLA policies in massive out-of-distribution scenarios, and the performance of the same-structured VLA in novel scenarios could boost from 14% to 69% with the guidance generated by the world model. Results demonstrate that our method outperforms previous baselines with a clear margin, particularly in out-of-distribution scenarios.

We suggest a general method to compute invariant correlators using differential operators that act on the partition function. This method allows to compute general invariant correlators in terms of the fundamental invariants. Moreover, in some cases the correlators appear to be simply polynomials in the invariants. This could be an interesting manifestation of superintegrability phenomenon in the theory of integral discriminants."

    "abstract": "VLA models have achieved remarkable progress in embodied intelligence; however, their evaluation remains largely confined to simulations or highly constrained real-world settings. This mismatch creates a substantial reality gap, where strong benchmark performance often masks poor generalization in diverse physical environments. We identify three systemic shortcomings in current benchmarking practices that hinder fair and reliable model comparison. (1) Existing benchmarks fail to model real-world dynamics, overlooking critical factors such as dynamic object configurations, robot initial states, lighting changes, and sensor noise. (2) Current protocols neglect spatial--physical intelligence, reducing evaluation to rote manipulation tasks that do not probe geometric reasoning. (3) The field lacks scalable fully autonomous evaluation, instead relying on simplistic 2D metrics that miss 3D spatial structure or on human-in-the-loop systems that are costly, biased, and unscalable. To address these limitations, we introduce RADAR (Real-world Autonomous Dynamics And Reasoning), a benchmark designed to systematically evaluate VLA generalization under realistic conditions. RADAR integrates three core components: (1) a principled suite of physical dynamics; (2) dedicated tasks that explicitly test spatial reasoning and physical understanding; and (3) a fully autonomous evaluation pipeline based on 3D metrics, eliminating the need for human supervision. We apply RADAR to audit multiple state-of-the-art VLA models and uncover severe fragility beneath their apparent competence. Performance drops precipitously under modest physical dynamics, with the expectation of 3D IoU declining from 0.261 to 0.068 under sensor noise. Moreover, models exhibit limited spatial reasoning capability. These findings position RADAR as a necessary bench toward reliable and generalizable real-world evaluation of VLA models."

    "abstract": "Agents powered by large language models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted in the software industry, contributing code as collaborators or even autonomous developers. As their presence grows, it becomes important to assess the current boundaries of their coding abilities. Existing agentic coding benchmarks, however, cover a limited task scope, e.g., bug fixing within a single pull request (PR), and often rely on non-executable evaluations or lack an automated approach for continually updating the evaluation coverage. To address such issues, we propose FeatureBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate agentic coding performance in end-to-end, feature-oriented software development. FeatureBench incorporates an execution-based evaluation protocol and a scalable test-driven method that automatically derives tasks from code repositories with minimal human effort. By tracing from unit tests along a dependency graph, our approach can identify feature-level coding tasks spanning multiple commits and PRs scattered across the development timeline, while ensuring the proper functioning of other features after the separation. Using this framework, we curated 200 challenging evaluation tasks and 3825 executable environments from 24 open-source repositories in the first version of our benchmark. Empirical evaluation reveals that the state-of-the-art agentic model, such as Claude 4.5 Opus, which achieves a 74.4% resolved rate on SWE-bench, succeeds on only 11.0% of tasks, opening new opportunities for advancing agentic coding. Moreover, benefiting from our automated task collection toolkit, FeatureBench can be easily scaled and updated over time to mitigate data leakage. The inherent verifiability of constructed environments also makes our method potentially valuable for agent training."

    "abstract": "In large scale agile systems development, the lack of a unified requirements engineering (RE) process is a major challenge, exacerbated by the absence of high level guiding principles for effective requirements management. To address this challenge, we conducted a five year longitudinal case study with Grundfos AB, in collaboration with the Software Centre in Sweden. RE principles were first derived through qualitative data collection spanning more than 25 sprints, approximately 320 weekly synchronisation meetings, and seven cross-company, company-specific workshops between 2019 and 2024. These activities engaged practitioners from diverse roles, representing several hundred developers across domains. In late 2024, five in depth focus groups with senior leaders at Grundfos provided retrospective validation of the principles and assessed their strategic impact. We aim to (1) empirically examine RE principles in large scale agile system development, (2) explore their benefits in practice within the case company, and (3) identify a set of transferable RE principles for large scale contexts. Using thematic analysis, six key RE principles architectural context, stakeholder-driven validation and alignment, requirements practices in large-scale agile organisations. evolution with lightweight documentation, delegated requirements management, organisational roles and responsibilities, and a shared understanding of requirements are derived. The study was further validated through crosscompany expert evaluation with three additional multinational organisations (Bosch, Ericsson, and Volvo Cars), which are directly responsible for largescale requirements management. Together, these efforts provide a scalable and adaptable foundation for improving requirements practices in largescale agile organisations."

    "abstract": "Rotary positional embeddings (RoPE) are widely used in large language models to encode token positions through multiplicative rotations, yet their behavior at long context lengths remains poorly characterized. In this work, we reinterpret RoPE as phase modulation applied to a bank of complex oscillators, enabling analysis through classical signal processing theory. Under this formulation, we derive principled lower bounds on the RoPE base parameter that are necessary to preserve positional coherence over a target context length. These include a fundamental aliasing bound, analogous to a Nyquist limit, and a DC-component stability bound that constrains phase drift in low-frequency positional modes. We further extend this analysis to deep transformers, showing that repeated rotary modulation across layers compounds angular misalignment, tightening the base requirement as depth increases. Complementing these results, we derive a precision-dependent upper bound on the RoPE base arising from finite floating-point resolution. Beyond this limit, incremental phase updates become numerically indistinguishable, leading to positional erasure even in the absence of aliasing. Together, the lower and upper bounds define a precision- and depth-dependent feasibility region a Goldilocks zone for long-context transformers. We validate the framework through a comprehensive case study of state-of-the-art models, including LLaMA, Mistral, and DeepSeek variants, showing that observed successes, failures, and community retrofits align closely with the predicted bounds. Notably, models that violate the stability bound exhibit attention collapse and long-range degradation, while attempts to scale beyond one million tokens encounter a hard precision wall independent of architecture or training."

The advent of quantum computing has led to researchers wondering if the promised exponential advantage can be obtained for these problems by variational quantum multi-objective optimization (QMOO) algorithm. Here, we improve it by introducing a Pareto Archive and dominated solutions substitution, clearly improving in hyper-volume convergence at additional quantum and classical cost. We propose the use of RMNK-landscapes as a unifying testbed for benchmarking QMOO, as it is common in classical multi-objective field. By devising a generic classical-to-quantum mapping of these landscapes, we perform a numerical hyperparameter tuning of QMOO, significantly enhancing its performance. Finally, we compare QMOO against well-known classical solvers for multi-objective tasks, NSGA-II/III, showing comparable results in small instances. Our results demonstrate that QMOO, when carefully tuned for the task at hand, might be advantageous on harder problems than its classical counterparts."

In the Lindblad setting, dissipative processes are described through jump operators, distinguishing between absorption and emission of photons. This enables the simple identification of emitted photons which provides a straightforward way to obtain the radiation statistics. Outside the rotating-wave limit, the Lindblad approach does not work. Open quantum systems can then be described by, e.g., the quantum Langevin equation. However, in this framework the number of emitted photons is not easily accessible. In this work, we point out how to obtain the photon counting statistics from a quantum Langevin equation and provide an expression for the photon current operator, for arbitrary systems coupled to linear environments. As an example, we employ the method to study the radiation statistics of a damped harmonic oscillator at finite temperature beyond the rotating-wave approximation. We show that even outside the rotating-wave limit, the most important contribution to the radiation statistics can be captured by an effective Lindblad equation, thus extending the range of possible applications of the Lindblad framework."

We map four moments in which actors negotiate between representational accuracy and organizational imperatives: creation, correction, collusion, and augmentation. Bureaucrats routinely privilege what data do over what they represent, creating fictions that serve civil servants' self-interest and enable constrained administrations. We argue that \"fakeness\" of state data is relational (context dependent), processual (emerging through workflows), and performative (brought into being through labeling and practice). We urge practitioners to center fitness-for-purpose in assessments of data and contextual governance. Rather than chasing impossible representational accuracy, sociotechnical systems should render the politics of useful fictions visible, contestable, and accountable."

Theprinciple is to measure by interferometry the deflection of a low-intensity probe pulse when crossingthe vacuum optical index gradient produced by an external high-intensity pump pulse. The detectionof the expected signal requires measuring the position of the interference intensity profile with a highspatial resolution, limited by the ultimate quantum noise. However, the spatial resolution is highlydegraded by the phase noise induced by the mechanical vibrations of the interferometer. In order tosuppress this interferometric phase noise, we have developed a new method, named High-FrequencyPhase Noise Suppression (HFPNS) method, based on the use of a delayed reference signal to correctany noise-related signal appearing in the probe beam.

The first paper in this series successfully identified a sample of 327 very metal-poor stars (with [Fe/H] < -2) from the APOGEE database, 289 of which are on the red giant branch. The spectra of these stars were not properly analysed by the APOGEE main pipeline because they are very metal poor. In this work, we measure metallicities for these stars using the abundances of the elements Mg and Si. We demonstrate that the absorption lines of the elements Mg and Si are of good quality despite the challenging combination of (low) metallicity, wavelength regime, spectral resolution, and signal-to-noise ratios available for these spectra. A specialised pipeline was designed to measure the abundance of Mg and Si in APOGEE spectra and yielded a robust estimate of the overall metallicity. In order to provide reliable measurements, we tested three different sets of assumptions for Mg and Si enhancement. We present Mg and Si abundances as well as overall metallicities for 327 stars, all of which had previously gotten null values from the main APOGEE pipeline for either the calibrated M/H or [Fe/H] . The typical uncertainties for our measurements are 0.2 dex. We found five stars in our sample with unusual [Si/Mg] abundances higher than 0.5, and we connect this signature to globular cluster stars, and this might be related to specific supernova events. Our data suggest a concentration of high [Si/Mg] stars in the Sextans dwarf galaxy. Other dwarf galaxies are found to agree well with results in the literature. Our derived metallicities range between -3.1 $\\leq$ [M/H] $\\leq$ -2.25, thereby pushing the metal-poor tail of APOGEE results down by 0.6 dex."

We compare four LLMs in this teacher role (Claude Opus 4.5, GPT 5.2 Codex, Gemini 3 Pro, and DeepSeek V3.2) on SMS spam/smishing detection with two student SLMs (Qwen2.5-0.5B and SmolLM2-135M). Our results show that performance varies substantially depending on the teacher LLM, with the best configuration achieving 94.31% accuracy and 96.25% recall. We also compare against a Direct Preference Optimisation (DPO) baseline that uses the same synthetic knowledge and LoRA setup but without iterative feedback or targeted refinement; agentic knowledge distillation substantially outperforms it (e.g. 86-94% vs 50-80% accuracy), showing that closed-loop feedback and targeted refinement are critical. These findings demonstrate that agentic knowledge distillation can rapidly yield effective security classifiers for edge deployment, but outcomes depend strongly on which teacher LLM is used."

We study this question in a controlled high-dimensional Gaussian setting, focusing on compositional target functions. We analyze their learnability using an explicit three-layer fitting model trained via layer-wise spectral estimators. Although the target is globally a high-degree polynomial, its compositional structure allows learning to proceed in stages: an intermediate representation reveals structure that is inaccessible at the input level. This reduces learning to simpler spectral estimation problems, well studied in the context of multi-index models, whereas any shallow estimator must resolve all components simultaneously. Our analysis relies on Gaussian universality, leading to sharp separations in sample complexity between two and three-layer learning strategies."

    "abstract": "On-time performance is a critical challenge in the airline industry, leading to large operational and customer dissatisfaction costs. The tail assignment problem builds the sequences of flights or routes followed by individual airplanes. While airlines cannot avoid some sources of delay, choosing routes wisely limits propagation along these. This paper addresses the stochastic tail assignment problem at Air France. We propose a column generation approach for this problem. The key ingredient is the pricing algorithm, which is a stochastic shortest path problem. We use dedicated bounds to discard paths in an enumeration algorithm, and introduce new bounds based on a lattice ordering of the set of piecewise linear convex functions to strike a balance between bounds quality and computational cost. A diving heuristic enables us to retrieve integer solutions. Numerical experiments on real-world Air France instances demonstrate that our algorithms lead to an average 0.28% optimality gap on instances with up to 600 flight legs in a few hours of computing time. The resulting solutions effectively balance operational costs and delay resilience, outperforming previous approaches based on minimum turn time."

    "abstract": "Reliable and precise etching of silicon nanostructures with ultra-high aspect ratios is required in many fields. Metal assisted chemical etching (MacEtch) in vapor is a plasma-free etching method that attracts considerable attention owing to the ability to create smooth, high aspect ratio nanostructures. MacEtch understanding and applications are limited by low fidelity and inconsistent pattern transfer from the catalyst layer to the silicon substrate. The locally constrained electrochemical interactions at the catalyst site make MacEtch particularly sensitive to catalyst contamination reducing the reaction rate and pinning the catalyst during etching. Removing contaminants is essential to improve pattern transfer for reliable processes on a larger area and higher aspect ratio. Physically separating the main source of carbon - the resist - from the catalyst with a sacrificial and functional interlayer solves this issue. The interlayer separates the resist and the catalyst and allows for thorough cleaning of the substrate before catalyst deposition. The resulting clean catalyst has improved stability, quality and reproducibility, enabling reliable fabrication of dense (50% patterned area) high aspect ratio (>250:1) nanostructures. Two different interlayer materials (Cr and Al$_{2}$O$_{3}$) and two patterning approaches are presented, showcasing etching of various high aspect ratio nanostructures, such as X-ray Optics."

Whether these capabilities translate to mission-critical applications such as electricity demand forecasting--where accuracy, calibration, and robustness directly affect grid operations--remains an open question. We present a multi-dimensional benchmark evaluating four TSFMs (Chronos-Bolt, Chronos-2, Moirai-2, and TinyTimeMixer) alongside Prophet as an industry-standard baseline and two statistical references (SARIMA and Seasonal Naive), using ERCOT hourly load data from 2020 to 2024. All experiments run on consumer-grade hardware (AMD Ryzen 7, 16GB RAM, no GPU). The evaluation spans four axes: (1) context length sensitivity from 24 to 2048 hours, (2) probabilistic forecast calibration, (3) robustness under distribution shifts including COVID-19 lockdowns and Winter Storm Uri, and (4) prescriptive analytics for operational decision support. The top-performing foundation models achieve MASE values near 0.31 at long context lengths (C = 2048h, day-ahead horizon), a 47% reduction over the Seasonal Naive baseline. The inclusion of Prophet exposes a structural advantage of pre-trained models: Prophet fails when the fitting window is shorter than its seasonality period (MASE > 74 at 24-hour context), while TSFMs maintain stable accuracy even with minimal context because they recognise temporal patterns learned during pre-training rather than estimating them from scratch. Calibration varies substantially across models--Chronos-2 produces well-calibrated prediction intervals (95% empirical coverage at 90% nominal level) while both Moirai-2 and Prophet exhibit overconfidence (~70% coverage). We provide practical model selection guidelines and release the complete benchmark framework for reproducibility."

    "abstract": "Multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF) plays a vital role in numerous real-world applications, yet existing models remain constrained by their reliance on a limited historical context. This limitation prevents them from effectively capturing global periodic patterns that often span cycles significantly longer than the input horizon - despite such patterns carrying strong predictive signals. Naive solutions, such as extending the historical window, lead to severe drawbacks, including overfitting, prohibitive computational costs, and redundant information processing. To address these challenges, we introduce the Global Temporal Retriever (GTR), a lightweight and plug-and-play module designed to extend any forecasting model's temporal awareness beyond the immediate historical context. GTR maintains an adaptive global temporal embedding of the entire cycle and dynamically retrieves and aligns relevant global segments with the input sequence. By jointly modeling local and global dependencies through a 2D convolution and residual fusion, GTR effectively bridges short-term observations with long-term periodicity without altering the host model architecture. Extensive experiments on six real-world datasets demonstrate that GTR consistently delivers state-of-the-art performance across both short-term and long-term forecasting scenarios, while incurring minimal parameter and computational overhead. These results highlight GTR as an efficient and general solution for enhancing global periodicity modeling in MTSF tasks. Code is available at this repository: https://github.com/macovaseas/GTR."

The superposition of the two phase-locked RF voltages produces an amplitude-beating field whose slowly varying envelope modulates the deflection radius, transforming the circular scan into a controlled spiral on the detector plane. A detailed theoretical model describing the electron dynamics under two phase-locked RF voltages with different frequencies was derived, yielding analytical expressions for the transverse velocity and radius-vector components at the deflector exit. Spiral scanning will allow measurements with picosecond resolution in a time range 1-2 orders of magnitude larger than the period of the circular scanning."

In the absence of noise, spin correlation functions exhibit a crossover from monotonic decay at fast sweep velocities to oscillatory behavior at slow sweeps. We show that, under a stochastically driven field, the critical sweep velocity at which the spin correlation functions undergo an abrupt change decreases with increasing noise strength and scales linearly with the square of the noise intensity. Remarkably, when the noise intensity and sweep velocity are comparable, the excitation probability becomes locked to pk = 1/2 over a finite momentum window, signaling the emergence of noise-induced maximally mixed modes. This gives rise to a highly oscillatory region in the dynamical phase diagram, whose threshold sweep velocity increases with noise and likewise exhibits quadratic scaling with the noise strength. Finally, we identify a universal scaling function under which all boundary sweep-velocity curves collapse onto a single universal curve."

The accurate modeling of gas flow in porous media often poses significant challenges due to their inherent nonlinearity, the coupling between gas and rock dynamics, and the need to preserve physical principles such as mass conservation, energy dissipation and molar density boundedness. The system is further complicated by the need to balance computational efficiency with the accuracy and stability of the numerical scheme. To tackle these challenges, we adopt a stabilization approach that is able to preserve the original energy dissipation while achieving linear energy-stable numerical schemes. We also prove the convergence of the adopted linear iterative method. At each time step, the stabilization parameter is adaptively updated using a simple and explicit formula to ensure compliance with the original energy dissipation law. The proposed method uses adaptive time stepping to improve computational efficiency while maintaining solution accuracy and boundedness. The adaptive time step size is calculated explicitly at each iteration, ensuring stability and allowing for efficient handling of highly dynamic scenarios. A mixed finite element method combined with an upwind scheme is employed as spatial discretization to ensure mass conservation and stability. Finally, we conduct a series of numerical experiments to validate the performance and robustness of the proposed numerical method."

We give two new proofs for this theorem. The first proof is completely combinatorial and highlights a strong connection between the $α$-Ham-Sandwich theorem and Unique Sink Orientations of grids. The second proof uses point-hyperplane duality and the Poincaré-Miranda theorem and allows us to generalize the result to and beyond oriented matroids. For this we introduce a new concept of rainbow arrangements, generalizing colored pseudo-hyperplane arrangements. Along the way, we also show that the realizability problem for rainbow arrangements is $\\exists \\mathbb{R}$-complete, which also implies that the realizability problem for grid Unique Sink Orientations is $\\exists \\mathbb{R}$-complete."

These materials accommodate a distorted local polyhedral architecture with tetrahedral symmetry compared to traditional double halide perovskites. By employing density functional theory along with the semiclassical transport model, we have analyzed the electronic and transport properties of these materials. Our results show that at 800 K, the largest figure of merit ($zT$) is 1.30 (0.86) for p-type (n-type) Cs$_2$AgPdCl$_5$ and 0.87 for n-type Cs$_2$AgPtCl$_5$ at doping concentrations of $1.94 \\times 10^{20}$ ($3.76 \\times 10^{19}$) cm$^{-3}$ and $3.52 \\times 10^{19}$ cm$^{-3}$, respectively. Remarkably, a very low doping concentration is required to achieve a high $zT$, setting these materials apart from others in this field. Our calculations demonstrate that Cs$_2$AgPdCl$_5$ benefits from the presence of conduction and valence band valleys near the band edges; however, the flat bands present in the valence band of Cs$_2$AgPtCl$_5$ do not improve its thermoelectric performance. Among these systems, hole doping in Cs$_2$AgPdCl$_5$ has shown remarkable thermoelectric performance. Interestingly, the local octahedral distortions present in these perovskites contribute to a marked reduction in the lattice thermal conductivity to 0.27 W/mK in Cs$_2$AgPtCl$_5$ and 0.20 W/mK in Cs$_2$AgPdCl$_5$ by causing enhanced phonon scattering, further improving the thermoelectric figure of merit. This drop in thermal conductivity, combined with the favorable electronic properties, underscores the potential use of these materials for applications in highly efficient thermoelectric devices."

A local measure of the angular redundancy in neighboring particle positions is found to satisfy this characterization and thereby established as a valid local order quantifier. A precise relationship between order and symmetry is obtained by bounding this quantifier sharply from below by a simple function of the local point group and the largest stabilizer under its action on the set of bond pairs. The marginal distribution of the quantifier is given in closed form for highly coordinated particles with broadly distributed bond angles.

Under a top-$k$ search protocol and Tsybakov-type margin conditions, we derive lower bounds on finite-horizon success probability that decompose into search and learning terms, with learning controlled by sequential Rademacher/covering complexity. Our main separation result shows that when cut elimination expands a DAG of depth $D$ into a cut-free tree of size $Ω(Λ^D)$ while the cut-aware hierarchical process has size $O(λ^D)$ with $λ\\llΛ$, a flat (cut-free) learner provably requires exponentially more data than a cut-aware hierarchical learner.

One promising recent approach addresses graph transfer by discretizing the adaptation process, typically through the construction of intermediate graphs or stepwise alignment procedures. However, such discrete strategies often fail in real-world scenarios, where graph structures evolve continuously and nonlinearly, making it difficult for fixed-step alignment to approximate the actual transformation process. To address these limitations, we propose \\textbf{DiffGDA}, a \\textbf{Diff}usion-based \\textbf{GDA} method that models the domain adaptation process as a continuous-time generative process. We formulate the evolution from source to target graphs using stochastic differential equations (SDEs), enabling the joint modeling of structural and semantic transitions. To guide this evolution, a domain-aware network is introduced to steer the generative process toward the target domain, encouraging the diffusion trajectory to follow an optimal adaptation path. We theoretically show that the diffusion process converges to the optimal solution bridging the source and target domains in the latent space.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in artificial intelligence have enabled the generation of large-scale, low-cost predictions with increasingly high fidelity. As a result, the primary challenge in statistical inference has shifted from data scarcity to data reliability. Prediction-powered inference methods seek to exploit such predictions to improve efficiency when labeled data are limited. However, existing approaches implicitly adopt a use-all philosophy, under which incorporating more predictions is presumed to improve inference. When prediction quality is heterogeneous, this assumption can fail, and indiscriminate use of unlabeled data may dilute informative signals and degrade inferential accuracy. In this paper, we propose Filtered Prediction-Powered Inference (FPPI), a framework that selectively incorporates predictions by identifying a data-adaptive filtered region in which predictions are informative for inference. We show that this region can be consistently estimated under a margin condition, achieving fast rates of convergence. By restricting the prediction-powered correction to the estimated filtered region, FPPI adaptively mitigates the impact of biased or noisy predictions. We establish that FPPI attains strictly improved asymptotic efficiency compared with existing prediction-powered inference methods. Numerical studies and a real-data application to large language model evaluation demonstrate that FPPI substantially reduces reliance on expensive labels by selectively leveraging reliable predictions, yielding accurate inference even in the presence of heterogeneous prediction quality."

    "abstract": "Interpreting the inference-time behavior of deep neural networks remains a challenging problem. Existing approaches to counterfactual explanation typically ask: What is the closest alternative input that would alter the model's prediction in a desired way? In contrast, we explore counterfactual datasets. Rather than perturbing the input, our method efficiently finds the closest alternative training dataset, one that differs from the original dataset by changing a few labels. Training a new model on this altered dataset can then lead to a different prediction of a given test instance. This perspective provides a new way to assess fairness by directly analyzing the influence of label bias on training and inference. Our approach can be characterized as probing whether a given prediction depends on biased labels. Since exhaustively enumerating all possible alternate datasets is infeasible, we develop analysis techniques that trace how bias in the training data may propagate through the learning algorithm to the trained network. Our method heuristically ranks and modifies the labels of a bounded number of training examples to construct a counterfactual dataset, retrains the model, and checks whether its prediction on a chosen test case changes. We evaluate our approach on feedforward neural networks across over 1100 test cases from 7 widely-used fairness datasets. Results show that it modifies only a small subset of training labels, highlighting its ability to pinpoint the critical training examples that drive prediction changes. Finally, we demonstrate how our counterfactual datasets reveal connections between training examples and test cases, offering an interpretable way to probe dataset bias."

    "abstract": "Muscle activation initiates contractions that drive human movement, and understanding it provides valuable insights for injury prevention and rehabilitation. Yet, sensing muscle activation is barely explored in the rapidly growing mobile health market. Traditional methods for muscle activation sensing rely on specialized electrodes, such as surface electromyography, making them impractical, especially for long-term usage. In this paper, we introduce Press2Muscle, the first system to unobtrusively infer muscle activation using insole pressure sensors. The key idea is to analyze foot pressure changes resulting from full-body muscle activation that drives movements. To handle variations in pressure signals due to differences in users' gait, weight, and movement styles, we propose a data-driven approach to dynamically adjust reliance on different foot regions and incorporate easily accessible biographical data to enhance Press2Muscle's generalization to unseen users. We conducted an extensive study with 30 users. Under a leave-one-user-out setting, Press2Muscle achieves a root mean square error of 0.025, marking a 19% improvement over a video-based counterpart. A robustness study validates Press2Muscle's ability to generalize across user demographics, footwear types, and walking surfaces. Additionally, we showcase muscle imbalance detection and muscle activation estimation under free-living settings with Press2Muscle, confirming the feasibility of muscle activation sensing using insole pressure sensors in real-world settings."

Here we present a hybrid strategy combining the Variational Quantum Eigensolver with Multiconfiguration Pair-Density Functional Theory to efficiently decouple correlation effects. This approach confines static correlation to a compact multireference quantum state while recovering dynamic correlation through a classical on-top density functional using reduced-density information. By enabling self-consistent orbital optimization, the method significantly reduces quantum resource overheads without sacrificing physical rigor. We demonstrate chemical accuracy on standard benchmarks by reproducing C$_2$ equilibrium bond lengths and benzene excitation energies with mean absolute errors of 0.006 Å and 0.048 eV respectively. Most notably, for the strongly correlated Cr$_2$ dimer requiring a large complete active space (48e, 42o), the framework yields a bound potential-energy curve and recovers qualitative dissociation behavior despite realistic hardware noise. These results establish that separating correlation types provides a practical route to reliable predictions on near-term quantum hardware."

Despite recent progress, existing hallucination mitigation methods often overlook the underlying hallucination patterns driven by language bias. In this work, we design a novel pipeline to accurately synthesize Hallucination-Inducing Images (HIIs). Using synthesized HIIs, we reveal a consistent scene-conditioned hallucination pattern: models tend to mention objects that are highly typical of the scene even when visual evidence is removed. To quantify the susceptibility of VLMs to this hallucination pattern, we establish the Masked-Object-Hallucination (MOH) benchmark to rigorously evaluate existing state-of-the-art alignment frameworks. Finally, we leverage HIIs to construct high-quality preference datasets for fine-grained alignment. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach effectively mitigates hallucinations while preserving general model capabilities. Specifically, our method achieves up to a 38% improvement over the current state-of-the-art on standard hallucination benchmarks."

This work makes a numerical analysis on the sLS problem, establishes its numerous theoretical properties, and show their crucial roles on the most effective and efficient use of iterative solvers. We first establish a compact bound on the norm of the residual difference between the solutions of the LS and sLS problems, which is the first key result towards understanding the rationale of the sLS problem. Then from the perspective of backward errors, we prove that the solution of the sLS problem is the one of a certain perturbed LS problem with minimal backward error, and quantify how the embedded quality affects the residuals, solution errors, and the relative residual norms of normal equations of the LS and sLS problems. These theoretical results enable us to propose new novel and reliable general-purpose stopping criteria for iterative solvers for the sLS problem, which dynamically monitor stabilization patterns of iterative solvers for the LS problem itself and terminate them at the earliest iteration. Numerical experiments justify the theoretical bounds and demonstrate that the new stopping criteria work reliably and result in a tremendous reduction in computational cost without sacrificing attainable accuracy."

    "abstract": "Flow matching has emerged as a powerful framework for generative modeling, with recent empirical successes highlighting the effectiveness of signal-space prediction ($x$-prediction). In this work, we investigate the transfer of this paradigm to binary manifolds, a fundamental setting for generative modeling of discrete data. While $x$-prediction remains effective, we identify a latent structural mismatch that arises when it is coupled with velocity-based objectives ($v$-loss), leading to a time-dependent singular weighting that amplifies gradient sensitivity to approximation errors. Motivated by this observation, we formalize prediction-loss alignment as a necessary condition for flow matching training. We prove that re-aligning the objective to the signal space ($x$-loss) eliminates the singular weighting, yielding uniformly bounded gradients and enabling robust training under uniform timestep sampling without reliance on heuristic schedules. Finally, with alignment secured, we examine design choices specific to binary data, revealing a topology-dependent distinction between probabilistic objectives (e.g., cross-entropy) and geometric losses (e.g., mean squared error). Together, these results provide theoretical foundations and practical guidelines for robust flow matching on binary -- and related discrete -- domains, positioning signal-space alignment as a key principle for robust diffusion learning."

Existing UQ approaches for MLIPs are often limited by high computational cost or suboptimal performance. Evidential deep learning (EDL) provides a theoretically grounded single-model alternative that determines both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty in a single forward pass. However, extending evidential formulations from scalar targets to vector-valued quantities such as atomic forces introduces substantial challenges, particularly in maintaining statistical self-consistency under rotational transformations. To address this, we propose \\textit{Equivariant Evidential Deep Learning for Interatomic Potentials} ($\\text{e}^2$IP), a backbone-agnostic framework that models atomic forces and their uncertainty jointly by representing uncertainty as a full $3\\times3$ symmetric positive definite covariance tensor that transforms equivariantly under rotations. Experiments on diverse molecular benchmarks show that $\\text{e}^2$IP provides a stronger accuracy-efficiency-reliability balance than the non-equivariant evidential baseline and the widely used ensemble method. It also achieves better data efficiency through the fully equivariant architecture while retaining single-model inference efficiency."

By comparing with the semiclassical results for bulk systems, we establish a one-to-one correspondence between terminal-resolved linear noise in multi-terminal systems and direction-resolved noise in bulk transport. Specifically, the auto-correlation function scales as $2 k_B T$ when the driving field is perpendicular to the BCD and vanishes when they are parallel, whereas the cross-correlation scales as $k_B T$. Both the auto- and cross-correlation functions exhibit pronounced peaks near the band edges, consistent with BCD-induced features. In addition, the linear thermal noise increases approximately linearly with $T$ at low temperatures and is suppressed by dephasing effect at high temperatures. Our work bridges semiclassical bulk theory and quantum multi-terminal theory for linear thermal noise, highlighting the symmetry(geometry)-selection rule in quantum transport."

Existing optical sensors can measure the resulting phase aberrations, but the physical experiments required to induce these aberrations are expensive and time-intensive. Simulation methods could provide a less expensive alternative. For example, an existing simulation algorithm called boiling flow, which generalizes the Taylor frozen-flow method, can generate synthetic phase aberration data (i.e., phase screens) induced by atmospheric turbulence. However, boiling flow depends on physical parameters, such as the Fried coherence length r0, which are not well-defined for aero-optic effects. In this paper, we introduce a method to estimate the parameters of boiling flow from measured aero-optic phase aberration data. Our algorithm estimates these parameters to fit the spatial and temporal statistics of the measured data. This method is computationally efficient and our experiments show that the temporal power spectral density of the slopes of the synthetic phase screens reasonably matches that of the measured phase aberrations from two turbulent boundary layer data sets, with errors between 8-9%. However, the Kolmogorov spatial structure function of the phase screens does not match that of the measured phase aberrations, with errors above 28%. This suggests that, while the parameters of boiling flow can reasonably fit the temporal statistics of highly convective data, they cannot fit the complex spatial statistics of aero-optic phase aberrations."

    "abstract": "The utilitarian distortion framework evaluates voting rules by their worst-case efficiency loss when voters have cardinal utilities but express only ordinal rankings. Under the classical model, a longstanding tension exists: Plurality, which suffers from the spoiler effect, achieves optimal $Θ(m^2)$ distortion among deterministic rules, while normatively superior rules like Copeland and Borda have unbounded distortion. We resolve this tension under probabilistic voting with the Plackett-Luce model, where rankings are noisy reflections of utilities governed by an inverse temperature parameter $β$. Copeland and Borda both achieve at most $β\\frac{1+e^{-β}}{1-e^{-β}}$ distortion, independent of the number of candidates $m$, and within a factor of 2 of the lower bound for randomized rules satisfying the probabilistic Condorcet loser criterion known from prior work. This improves upon the prior $O(β^2)$ bound for Borda. These upper bounds are nearly tight: prior work establishes a $(1-o(1))β$ lower bound for Borda, and we prove a $(1-ε)β$ lower bound for Copeland for any constant $ε>0$. In contrast, rules that rely only on top-choice information fare worse: Plurality has distortion $Ω(\\min(e^β, m))$ and Random Dictator has distortion $Θ(m)$. Additional `veto' information is also insufficient to remove the dependence on $m$; Plurality Veto and Pruned Plurality Veto have distortion $Ω(β\\ln m)$. We also prove a lower bound of $(\\frac{5}{8}-ε)β$ (for any constant $ε>0$) for all deterministic finite-precision tournament-based rules, a class that includes Copeland and any rule based on pairwise comparison margins rounded to fixed precision. Our results show that the distortion framework aligns with normative intuitions once the probabilistic nature of real-world voting is taken into account."

The dominant oversight paradigm, LLM-as-a-Judge, faces a fundamental dilemma: how can probabilistic systems reliably supervise other probabilistic systems without inheriting their failure modes? We argue that formal verification offers a principled escape from this dilemma, yet its adoption has been hindered by a critical bottleneck: the translation from natural language requirements to formal specifications. This paper bridges this gap by proposing , a neuro-symbolic framework that employs a bidirectional Formal-of-Thought architecture: LLMs serve as specification compilers that top-down decompose high-level human intent into atomic, verifiable constraints, then bottom-up prove compliance using Dafny specifications and Z3 Satisfiability modulo theories solving, which produces mathematical guarantees rather than probabilistic scores. We validate across three benchmarks spanning behavioral safety, multi-domain constraint adherence, and agentic upward deception detection. Experiments on 7 agent models demonstrate that achieves an average improvement of 16.6% over LLM-as-a-Judge baselines, enables weak-to-strong generalization where a 7B judge achieves over 90% accuracy detecting deception from 72B agents, and provides near-linear safety improvement through iterative refinement."

The predictor is optimized on the training split for fit, while low-dimensional uncertainty controls are optimized on the regularization split to reduce train-test mismatch, yielding regime-adaptive uncertainty without per-regime noise tuning. The framework can learn continuous noise levels at the output head, within hidden features, or within operator-specific components such as spectral modes. We instantiate the approach in Fourier Neural Operators and evaluate on APEBench sweeps over observed fraction and training-set size.

    "abstract": "We study sterile neutrino dark matter (DM) in a classically conformal U(1)' extension of the Standard Model with three right-handed neutrinos and a Majoron-like singlet scalar that generate the observed pattern of active neutrino masses and mixing via the type-I seesaw mechanism. Working in the regime of strongly suppressed active-sterile mixing, we show that the observed DM abundance can be produced through freeze-in from feeble interactions mediated by the heavy Z' and the conformal scalar. We solve the Boltzmann equation for the nonthermal phase-space distribution and confront the scenario with Lyman-$α$ data by computing the matter power spectrum. For keV-scale sterile neutrinos we identify the viable parameter space consistent with structure-formation and X-ray bounds, including regions compatible with a tentative 3.5 keV line. If a second sterile state is long-lived, late decays can realize a two-component setup that alleviates the $S_8$ tension. In a highly fine-tuned variant of the model, the 220 PeV KM3NeT event can also be explained by invoking the decay of a superheavy sterile neutrino."

Tax law exemplifies these challenges, as correct answers require exact statutory citation, structured legal argumentation, and numerical accuracy under rigid grading schemes. We algorithmically generate SteuerEx, the first open benchmark derived from authentic German university tax law examinations. SteuerEx comprises 115 expert-validated examination questions spanning six core tax law domains and multiple academic levels, and employs a statement-level, partial-credit evaluation framework that closely mirrors real examination practice. We further present SteuerLLM, a domain-adapted LLM for German tax law trained on a large-scale synthetic dataset generated from authentic examination material using a controlled retrieval-augmented pipeline. SteuerLLM (28B parameters) consistently outperforms general-purpose instruction-tuned models of comparable size and, in several cases, substantially larger systems, demonstrating that domain-specific data and architectural adaptation are more decisive than parameter scale for performance on realistic legal reasoning tasks. All benchmark data, training datasets, model weights, and evaluation code are released openly to support reproducible research in domain-specific legal artificial intelligence. A web-based demo of SteuerLLM is available at https://steuerllm.i5.ai.fau.de."

While recent advances in self-supervised depth estimation have reduced reliance on ground truth supervision, existing approaches remain constrained by either bulky architectures compromising practicality or lightweight models sacrificing structural precision. These dual limitations underscore the critical need to develop lightweight yet structurally precise architectures. Our framework addresses these limitations through a three-stage architecture incorporating three novel modules: the Shuffle-Dilation Convolution (SDC) module for local feature extraction, the Rotation-Adaptive Kernel Attention (RAKA) module for hierarchical feature enhancement, and the Deep Frequency Signal Purification (DFSP) module for global feature purification. Through effective collaboration, these modules enable PuriLight to achieve both lightweight and accurate feature extraction and processing. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PuriLight achieves state-of-the-art performance with minimal training parameters while maintaining exceptional computational efficiency.

We show that these nanoflags have a Landé g-factor larger than InAs and InSb and a mobility comparable to those of the best performing InAs and InSb nanoflags. Besides, we show evidence for a surface Fermi level pinning in the conductance band of these InAs0.77Sb0.23 nanoflags, similar to the well-known behavior of InAs. This promises to make InAsSb easy to couple to superconductors, while keeping or improving many of the features that make InSb an interesting material for quantum applications."

To operationalize this framework, we developed GenFaceUI, a proof-of-concept tool that enables designers to create templates, apply semantic tags, define rules, and iteratively test outcomes. We evaluated the tool through a qualitative study with twelve designers. The results show perceived gains in controllability and consistency, while revealing needs for structured visual mechanisms and lightweight explanations.

We present arguments showing that a plasma in thermal equilibrium undergoing anisotropic compression or expansion cannot return to thermal equilibrium in the absence of particle collisions. Since most astrophysical plasmas are practically collisionless and experience significant anisotropic compression or expansion, we expect anisotropic, non-thermal, and multi-temperature particle distributions to be ubiquitous, in agreement with solar wind measurements."

LLMs promise accessible natural language (NL) graph analytics, yet they fail to process industry-scale property graphs effectively and efficiently: such datasets are large, highly heterogeneous, structurally complex, and evolve dynamically. To address this, we devise a novel abstraction for complex multi-query analytics over such graphs. Its key idea is to replace brittle generation of graph queries directly from NL with planning over a Semantic Catalog that describes both the graph schema and the graph operations. Concretely, this induces a clean separation between a Semantic Plane for LLM planning and broader reasoning, and an Execution Plane for deterministic, database-grade query execution over the full dataset and tool implementations. This design yields substantial gains in both token efficiency and task effectiveness even with small-context LLMs. We use this abstraction as the basis of the first LLM-enhanced graph analytics framework called GraphSeek. GraphSeek achieves substantially higher success rates (e.g., 86% over enhanced LangChain) and points toward the next generation of affordable and accessible graph analytics that unify LLM reasoning with database-grade execution over large and complex property graphs."

Identifying linguistically interpretable markers of dementia can support transparent and clinically grounded screening approaches. Methods: This study analyzes spontaneous speech transcripts from the DementiaBank Pitt Corpus using three linguistic representations: raw cleaned text, a part-of-speech (POS)-enhanced representation combining lexical and grammatical information, and a POS-only syntactic representation. Logistic regression and random forest models were evaluated under two protocols: transcript-level train-test splits and subject-level five-fold cross-validation to prevent speaker overlap. Model interpretability was examined using global feature importance, and statistical validation was conducted using Mann-Whitney U tests with Cliff's delta effect sizes. Results: Across representations, models achieved stable performance, with syntactic and grammatical features retaining strong discriminative power even in the absence of lexical content. Subject-level evaluation yielded more conservative but consistent results, particularly for POS-enhanced and POS-only representations. Statistical analysis revealed significant group differences in functional word usage, lexical diversity, sentence structure, and discourse coherence, aligning closely with machine learning feature importance findings. Conclusion: The results demonstrate that abstract linguistic features capture robust markers of early cognitive decline under clinically realistic evaluation. By combining interpretable machine learning with non-parametric statistical validation, this study supports the use of linguistically grounded features for transparent and reliable language-based cognitive screening."

We present an analytical treatment of the strong interaction in two-nucleon systems by modelling it with a square-well potential and solving the Schroedinger equation in the presence of the Coulomb interaction. The resulting pair wave function is regular at small relative distances and allows for the inclusion of multiple partial waves. We apply this framework to proton-proton femtoscopy and compute theoretical correlation functions for realistic source sizes. We demonstrate that the commonly used Lednicky-Lyuboshits asymptotic approximation overestimates the correlation signal for small sources. Comparisons with numerical calculations using the CATS framework and the Argonne v18 potential show good agreement within current experimental uncertainties. The proposed analytical approach provides a practical and flexible tool for femtoscopic analyses of nucleon and baryon pairs."

In many real-world domains, online learning in the environment can be risky, and specifying accurate safety costs can be difficult. However, it is often feasible to collect trajectories that reflect undesirable or unsafe behavior, implicitly conveying what the agent should avoid. We refer to these as non-preferred trajectories. We propose a novel offline safe IL algorithm, OSIL, that infers safety from non-preferred demonstrations. We formulate safe policy learning as a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP). Instead of relying on explicit safety cost and reward annotations, OSIL reformulates the CMDP problem by deriving a lower bound on reward maximizing objective and learning a cost model that estimates the likelihood of non-preferred behavior. Our approach allows agents to learn safe and reward-maximizing behavior entirely from offline demonstrations. We empirically demonstrate that our approach can learn safer policies that satisfy cost constraints without degrading the reward performance, thus outperforming several baselines."

Existing accelerators, such as Groq and Cerebras, mitigate off-chip traffic with large on-chip caches, while algorithmic innovations such as FlashAttention fuse operators to avoid materializing large attention matrices. However, as off-chip traffic decreases, our measurements show that on-chip SRAM accesses account for over 60% of energy in long-sequence workloads, making cache access the new bottleneck. We propose 3D-Flow, a hybrid-bonded, 3D-stacked spatial accelerator that enables register-to-register communication across vertically partitioned PE tiers. Unlike 2D multi-array architectures limited by NoC-based router-to-router transfers, 3D-Flow leverages sub-10 um vertical TSVs to sustain cycle-level operator pipelining with minimal overhead. On top of this architecture, we design 3D-FlashAttention, a fine-grained scheduling method that balances latency across tiers, forming a bubble-free vertical dataflow without on-chip SRAM roundtrips. Evaluations on Transformer workloads (OPT and QWEN models) show that our 3D spatial accelerator reduces 46-93% energy consumption and achieves 1.4x-7.6x speedups compared to state-of-the-art 2D and 3D designs."

    "abstract": "Assortment optimization is a fundamental challenge in modern retail and recommendation systems, where the goal is to select a subset of products that maximizes expected revenue under complex customer choice behaviors. While recent advances in data-driven methods have leveraged historical data to learn and optimize assortments, these approaches typically rely on strong assumptions -- namely, the stability of customer preferences and the correctness of the underlying choice models. However, such assumptions frequently break in real-world scenarios due to preference shifts and model misspecification, leading to poor generalization and revenue loss. Motivated by this limitation, we propose a robust framework for data-driven assortment optimization that accounts for potential distributional shifts in customer choice behavior. Our approach models potential preference shift from a nominal choice model that generates data and seeks to maximize worst-case expected revenue. We first establish the computational tractability of robust assortment planning when the nominal model is known, then advance to the data-driven setting, where we design statistically optimal algorithms that minimize the data requirements while maintaining robustness. Our theoretical analysis provides both upper bounds and matching lower bounds on the sample complexity, offering theoretical guarantees for robust generalization. Notably, we uncover and identify the notion of ``robust item-wise coverage'' as the minimal data requirement to enable sample-efficient robust assortment learning. Our work bridges the gap between robustness and statistical efficiency in assortment learning, contributing new insights and tools for reliable assortment optimization under uncertainty."

Curriculum learning has proven to be effective in this setting, as it introduces complexity progressively. However, designing effective curricula is labor-intensive and requires extensive domain expertise. LLM-based curriculum generation has only recently emerged as a potential solution, but was limited to operate in static, offline modes without leveraging real-time feedback from the optimizer. Here we propose an interactive LLM-assisted framework for online curriculum generation, where the LLM adaptively designs training cases based on real-time feedback from the evolutionary optimization process. We investigate how different feedback modalities, ranging from numeric metrics alone to combinations with plots and behavior visualizations, influence the LLM ability to generate meaningful curricula. Through a 2D robot navigation case study, tackled with genetic programming as optimizer, we evaluate our approach against static LLM-generated curricula and expert-designed baselines. We show that interactive curriculum generation outperforms static approaches, with multimodal feedback incorporating both progression plots and behavior visualizations yielding performance competitive with expert-designed curricula. This work contributes to understanding how LLMs can serve as interactive curriculum designers for embodied AI systems, with potential extensions to broader evolutionary robotics applications."

Moving beyond this limitation, we reveal a twofold dimensional advantage of higher-dimensional auxiliaries - reducing the number of required cycles, and enabling the efficient cooling of oscillators with higher initial energies. We further show that, while extending the network leads to a saturation of this dimensional advantage at moderate auxiliary dimensions, near-perfect cooling remains achievable for linear network configurations but fails for star networks. Moreover, we highlight the adaptability of the proposed protocol by demonstrating efficient cooling of hybrid continuous- and discrete-variable systems that naturally support the generation of non-Gaussian and entangled quantum resources."

For example, latent factors may influence the data in a coordinated way, even though their effect is invisible to covariance-based methods such as PCA. In practice, nonlinear neural networks often succeed in extracting such hidden structure in unsupervised and self-supervised learning. However, constructing a minimal high-dimensional model where this advantage can be rigorously analyzed has remained an open theoretical challenge. We introduce a tractable high-dimensional spiked model with two latent factors: one visible to covariance, and one statistically dependent yet uncorrelated, appearing only in higher-order moments. PCA and linear autoencoders fail to recover the latter, while a minimal nonlinear autoencoder provably extracts both. We analyze both the population risk, and empirical risk minimization. Our model also provides a tractable example where self-supervised test loss is poorly aligned with representation quality: nonlinear autoencoders recover latent structure that linear methods miss, even though their reconstruction loss is higher."

    "abstract": "Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have gained significant attention as a surrogate modeling strategy for partial differential equations (PDEs), particularly in regimes where labeled data are scarce and physical constraints can be leveraged to regularize the learning process. In practice, however, PINNs are frequently trained using experimental or numerical data that are not fully consistent with the governing equations due to measurement noise, discretization errors, or modeling assumptions. The implications of such data-to-PDE inconsistencies on the accuracy and convergence of PINNs remain insufficiently understood. In this work, we systematically analyze how data inconsistency fundamentally limits the attainable accuracy of PINNs. We introduce the concept of a consistency barrier, defined as an intrinsic lower bound on the error that arises from mismatches between the fidelity of the data and the exact enforcement of the PDE residual. To isolate and quantify this effect, we consider the 1D viscous Burgers equation with a manufactured analytical solution, which enables full control over data fidelity and residual errors. PINNs are trained using datasets of progressively increasing numerical accuracy, as well as perfectly consistent analytical data. Results show that while the inclusion of the PDE residual allows PINNs to partially mitigate low-fidelity data and recover the dominant physical structure, the training process ultimately saturates at an error level dictated by the data inconsistency. When high-fidelity numerical data are employed, PINN solutions become indistinguishable from those trained on analytical data, indicating that the consistency barrier is effectively removed. These findings clarify the interplay between data quality and physics enforcement in PINNs providing practical guidance for the construction and interpretation of physics-informed surrogate models."

    "abstract": "This paper aims to apply two major scaling transformations from the computing packaging industry to internet routers: the heterogeneous integration of high-bandwidth memories (HBMs) and chiplets, as well as in-package optics. We propose a novel internet router architecture that employs these technologies to achieve a petabit/sec router within a single integrated package. At the top-level, we introduce a novel split-parallel switch architecture that spatially divides (without processing) the incoming fibers and distributes them across smaller independent switches without intermediate OEO conversions or fine-tuned per-packet load-balancing. This passive spatial division enables scaling at the cost of a coarser traffic load balancing. Yet, through extensive evaluations of backbone network traffic, we demonstrate that differences with fine-tuned approaches are small. In addition, we propose a novel HBM-based shared-memory architecture for the implementation of the smaller independent switches, and we introduce a novel parallel frame interleaving algorithm that packs traffic into frames so that HBM banks are accessed at peak HBM data rates in a cyclical interleaving manner. We further discuss why these new technologies represent a paradigm shift in the design of future internet routers. Finally, we emphasize that power consumption may constitute the primary bottleneck to scaling."

    "abstract": "Formal privacy metrics provide compliance-oriented guarantees but often fail to quantify actual linkability in released datasets. We introduce CVPL (Cluster-Vector-Projection Linkage), a geometric framework for post-hoc assessment of linkage risk between original and protected tabular data. CVPL represents linkage analysis as an operator pipeline comprising blocking, vectorization, latent projection, and similarity evaluation, yielding continuous, scenario-dependent risk estimates rather than binary compliance verdicts. We formally define CVPL under an explicit threat model and introduce threshold-aware risk surfaces, R(lambda, tau), that capture the joint effects of protection strength and attacker strictness. We establish a progressive blocking strategy with monotonicity guarantees, enabling anytime risk estimation with valid lower bounds. We demonstrate that the classical Fellegi-Sunter linkage emerges as a special case of CVPL under restrictive assumptions, and that violations of these assumptions can lead to systematic over-linking bias. Empirical validation on 10,000 records across 19 protection configurations demonstrates that formal k-anonymity compliance may coexist with substantial empirical linkability, with a significant portion arising from non-quasi-identifier behavioral patterns. CVPL provides interpretable diagnostics identifying which features drive linkage feasibility, supporting privacy impact assessment, protection mechanism comparison, and utility-risk trade-off analysis."

However, conclusive evidence for the QCP is lacking, as the presumed QCP is buried under the superconducting dome, disguising its presence. Here, we use high-resolution resonant inelastic X-ray scattering to examine the dynamical charge-charge correlation in La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ and uncover the quantum critical scaling, a key feature required for a QCP. Specifically, \\djh{we observed that the inverse correlation lengths for various dopings and temperatures collapsed onto a universal scaling curve, yielding a critical exponent $ν$ of $0.74 \\pm 0.08$. The non-negativity of this exponent confirms the presence of a QCP. Remarkably, the value of $ν$ suggests that while the QCP is manifested through the charge-density wave, other orders also participate, such that the QCP appears to belong to the universality class characterized by the O(4) symmetry, reminiscent of the microscopic SO(4) symmetry in the Hubbard model at half-filling. Further analysis indicates that the QCP is highly dissipative with a short quasi-particle lifetime, reflecting the intertwined quantum fluctuations due to its being buried inside the superconducting state."

    "abstract": "Flight control for autonomous micro aerial vehicles (MAVs) is evolving from steady flight near equilibrium points toward more aggressive aerobatic maneuvers, such as flips, rolls, and Power Loop. Although reinforcement learning (RL) has shown great potential in these tasks, conventional RL methods often suffer from low data efficiency and limited generalization. This challenge becomes more pronounced in multi-task scenarios where a single policy is required to master multiple maneuvers. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end multi-task reinforcement learning framework, called GEAR (Geometric Equivariant Aerobatics Reinforcement), which fully exploits the inherent SO(2) rotational symmetry in MAV dynamics and explicitly incorporates this property into the policy network architecture. By integrating an equivariant actor network, FiLM-based task modulation, and a multi-head critic, GEAR achieves both efficiency and flexibility in learning diverse aerobatic maneuvers, enabling a data-efficient, robust, and unified framework for aerobatic control. GEAR attains a 98.85\\% success rate across various aerobatic tasks, significantly outperforming baseline methods. In real-world experiments, GEAR demonstrates stable execution of multiple maneuvers and the capability to combine basic motion primitives to complete complex aerobatics."

    "abstract": "Human languages provide efficient systems for expressing numerosities, but whether the sheer pressure to communicate is enough for numerical representations to arise in artificial agents, and whether the emergent codes resemble human numerals at all, remains an open question. We study two neural network-based agents that must communicate numerosities in a referential game using either discrete tokens or continuous sketches, thus exploring both symbolic and iconic representations. Without any pre-defined numeric concepts, the agents achieve high in-distribution communication accuracy in both communication channels and converge on high-precision symbol-meaning mappings. However, the emergent code is non-compositional: the agents fail to derive systematic messages for unseen numerosities, typically reusing the symbol of the highest trained numerosity (discrete), or collapsing extrapolated values onto a single sketch (continuous). We conclude that the communication pressure alone suffices for precise transmission of learned numerosities, but additional pressures are needed to yield compositional codes and generalisation abilities."

Nonetheless, it faces persistent challenges, including the pre-selection of an optimal rank and rank-specific hyper-parameters, as well as the deployment complexity of heterogeneous-rank modules and more sophisticated LoRA derivatives. In this work, we introduce LoRA-Squeeze, a simple and efficient methodology that aims to improve standard LoRA learning by changing LoRA module ranks either post-hoc or dynamically during training}. Our approach posits that it is better to first learn an expressive, higher-rank solution and then compress it, rather than learning a constrained, low-rank solution directly. The method involves fine-tuning with a deliberately high(er) source rank, reconstructing or efficiently approximating the reconstruction of the full weight update matrix, and then using Randomized Singular Value Decomposition (RSVD) to create a new, compressed LoRA module at a lower target rank. Extensive experiments across 13 text and 10 vision-language tasks show that post-hoc compression often produces lower-rank adapters that outperform those trained directly at the target rank, especially if a small number of fine-tuning steps at the target rank is allowed. Moreover, a gradual, in-tuning rank annealing variant of LoRA-Squeeze consistently achieves the best LoRA size-performance trade-off."

We propose HCW-GLB-OMD, which consists of two components: an online mirror descent (OMD)-based estimator and Hessian-based confidence weights to achieve corruption robustness. This is computationally efficient in that it only requires ${O}(1)$ space and time complexity per iteration. Under the self-concordance assumption on the link function, we show a regret bound of $\\tilde{O}\\left( d \\sqrt{\\sum_t g(τ_t) \\dotμ_{t,\\star}} + d^2 g_{\\max} κ+ d κC \\right)$, where $\\dotμ_{t,\\star}$ is the slope of $μ$ around the optimal arm at time $t$, $g(τ_t)$'s are potentially exogenously time-varying dispersions (e.g., $g(τ_t) = σ_t^2$ for heteroskedastic linear bandits, $g(τ_t) = 1$ for Bernoulli and Poisson), $g_{\\max} = \\max_{t \\in [T]} g(τ_t)$ is the maximum dispersion, and $C \\geq 0$ is the total corruption budget of the adversary. We complement this with a lower bound of $\\tildeΩ(d \\sqrt{\\sum_t g(τ_t) \\dotμ_{t,\\star}} + d C)$, unifying previous problem-specific lower bounds. Thus, our algorithm achieves, up to a $κ$-factor in the corruption term, instance-wise minimax optimality simultaneously across various instances of heteroskedastic GLBs with adversarial corruptions."

In this study, we extend a polymer dynamics simulation framework that can account for oxidative aging. We also update the model so that it can explicitly incorporate antioxidant molecules into the simulation. As a result, the framework enables us to quantify how molecular architecture of antioxidants affects oxidation kinetics, which has previously been inferred only indirectly from apparent changes in reaction rates. It also allows us to evaluate the effects of antioxidant concentration and molecular architecture on the spatial heterogeneity of oxidative aging."

Location science, network design, and logistics represent core application domains of discrete optimization, combining high practical impact with substantial computational challenges. In this work, we develop QUBO formulations for several fundamental problems in these domains, including a nonlinear integer formulation of the Discrete Ordered Median Problem (DOMP). Beyond their modeling relevance, these QUBO formulations serve as representative benchmark problems for assessing quantum algorithms and quantum hardware. We further derive a tight bound for the penalty parameter ensuring equivalence between the QUBO formulation and its underlying integer program. Finally, we conduct a comprehensive computational study using QAOA, WS-QAOA, and classical heuristics for QUBO instances of the $p$-Median Problem and the Fixed-Charge Facility Location Problem (FCFLP), and introduce two effective warm-start strategies for WS-QAOA based on its linear programming relaxation."

We identify new SySts using a machine-learning approach that combines Gaia DR3, 2MASS, and WISE photometry, parallaxes, and the pseudo-equivalent width of H alpha. A Random Forest model was trained on 166 confirmed S-type SySts and 1600 non-symbiotic stars, applying SMOTE to mitigate class imbalance. The model achieved an F1-score of 89% for the symbiotic class. Applied to 2.5 x 10^6 color-selected sources, it identified 990 candidates with probabilities more than 70%. We further refined the sample using physically motivated cuts on effective temperature, surface gravity, metallicity, and SkyMapper photometry, yielding 12 high-confidence candidates. These objects show cool temperatures, low surface gravities, near-solar metallicity, H alpha emission, moderate-to-high luminosities, and UV excess consistent with S-type SySts. Validation on recently confirmed systems recovered 92.3%, demonstrating the robustness and generalizability of our method."

The temperature dependence of electrical resistivity suggests half-metallic behaviour. Magnetoresistance shows a positive, non-saturating linear field dependence at low temperature that gradually weakens with increasing temperature. The combination of low magnetic moment and unusual magnetotransport behaviour positions CoVGe as a promising platform for exploring spin-dependent transport in Heusler-based materials."

Previous work studies two semantics: (i) the universal semantics, where an adversary picks the environment; and (ii) the prior semantics, where the environment is drawn once before execution from a fixed distribution. We clarify the relation between these semantics. For parity objectives, we show that the qualitative questions, i.e. value one, coincide, and we develop a new algorithm for the general value of MEMDP with prior semantics. In particular, we show that the prior value of an MEMDP with a parity objective can be approximated to any precision with a space efficient algorithm; equivalently, the associated gap problem is decidable in PSPACE when probabilities are given in unary (and in EXPSPACE otherwise). We then prove that the universal value equals the infimum of prior values over all beliefs. This yields a new algorithm for the universal gap problem with the same complexity (PSPACE for unary probabilities, EXPSPACE in general), improving on earlier doubly-exponential-space procedures. Finally, we observe that MEMDPs under the prior semantics form an important tractable subclass of POMDPs: our algorithms exploit the fact that belief entropy never increases, and we establish that any POMDP with this property reduces effectively to a prior-MEMDP, showing that prior-MEMDPs capture a broad and practically relevant subclass of POMDPs."

In numerical experiments, TPC performance approaches the limit of oracle $H_2$-optimal control with perfect knowledge of the underlying system model.

Despite recent progress, existing approaches often rely on pretrained encoders, semantic distillation, or heterogeneous CNN-based architectures. These designs introduce fixed inductive biases that limit reconstruction fidelity and hinder effective scaling. In this paper, we argue that discrete audio tokenization should be learned fully end-to-end using a homogeneous and scalable architecture. To this end, we first propose CAT (Causal Audio Tokenizer with Transformer), a purely Transformer-based architecture that jointly optimizes the encoder, quantizer, and decoder from scratch for high-fidelity reconstruction. Building on the CAT architecture, we develop MOSS-Audio-Tokenizer, a large-scale audio tokenizer featuring 1.6 billion parameters, pre-trained on 3 million hours of diverse, general audio data. We show that this simple, fully end-to-end approach built from homogeneous, causal Transformer blocks scales gracefully and supports high-fidelity reconstruction across diverse audio domains. Across speech, sound, and music, MOSS-Audio-Tokenizer consistently outperforms prior codecs over a wide range of bitrates, while exhibiting predictable improvements with increased scale. Notably, leveraging the discrete tokens from our model, we develop the first purely autoregressive TTS model that surpasses prior non-autoregressive and cascaded systems. Furthermore, MOSS-Audio-Tokenizer enables competitive ASR performance without auxiliary encoders. Our findings position the CAT architecture as a unified, scalable interface for the next generation of native audio foundation models."

In a periodic crystal, the usual definition of the polarization as the first moment of the charge density in a unit cell is found to depend qualitatively - allowing even a change in the sign - and quantitatively on the choice of unit cell. We examine this issue using a rigorous approach based on the framework of 2-scale convergence. By examining the continuum limit of when the lattice spacing is much smaller than the characteristic dimensions of the body, we show that the 2-scale limit provides both a bulk polarization as well as a surface charge density supported on the boundary of the body. Further, different choices of the periodic unit cell of the body lead to correspondingly different partial unit cells at the boundary; these choices give to different bulk polarization and surface charges but compensate such that the electric field and energy are independent of the choice of unit cell."

We show that in both theory and practice, traditional measures of jump variation based on lower-frequency data tend to spuriously assign a burst of volatility to the jump component. As a result, the true price variation coming from jumps is overstated. Our estimates based on tick data suggest that the jump variation is an order of magnitude smaller than typical estimates found in the existing literature."

Current implementations predominantly rely on a \"Screen-as-Interface\" paradigm, which inherits structural vulnerabilities and conflicts with the mobile ecosystem's economic foundations. In this paper, we conduct a systematic security analysis of state-of-the-art mobile agents using Doubao Mobile Assistant as a representative case. We decompose the threat landscape into four dimensions - Agent Identity, External Interface, Internal Reasoning, and Action Execution - revealing critical flaws such as fake App identity, visual spoofing, indirect prompt injection, and unauthorized privilege escalation stemming from a reliance on unstructured visual data. To address these challenges, we propose Aura, an Agent Universal Runtime Architecture for a clean-slate secure agent OS. Aura replaces brittle GUI scraping with a structured, agent-native interaction model. It adopts a Hub-and-Spoke topology where a privileged System Agent orchestrates intent, sandboxed App Agents execute domain-specific tasks, and the Agent Kernel mediates all communication. The Agent Kernel enforces four defense pillars: (i) cryptographic identity binding via a Global Agent Registry; (ii) semantic input sanitization through a multilayer Semantic Firewall; (iii) cognitive integrity via taint-aware memory and plan-trajectory alignment; and (iv) granular access control with non-deniable auditing. Evaluation on MobileSafetyBench shows that, compared to Doubao, Aura improves low-risk Task Success Rate from roughly 75% to 94.3%, reduces high-risk Attack Success Rate from roughly 40% to 4.4%, and achieves near-order-of-magnitude latency gains.

    "abstract": "We present a theoretical framework that models the laminar-turbulent transition as a topological change in the dissipative operator. The order s of the fractional Laplacian is promoted from a fixed parameter to a dynamic field, governed by a variational principle that minimizes a regularized free-energy functional. This adaptive formulation continuously interpolates between the local, viscous dissipation of the Navier-Stokes equations and the non-local, anomalous dissipation characteristic of the inertial range in Kolmogorov turbulence. From this framework, we derive an analytical expression for the critical Reynolds number, Rec, by establishing a spectral balance condition where the effective dissipative capacity of the laminar operator is saturated."

However, navigating safely and effectively in dynamic environments, particularly crowded areas, remains challenging. This paper proposes a novel framework that integrates Vision-Language Models (VLM) and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) to generate dynamic crowd-density maps (``Abstraction Maps'') for autonomous robot navigation. Our approach utilizes VLM's capability to recognize abstract environmental concepts, such as crowd densities, and represents them probabilistically via GPR. Experimental results from real-world trials on a university campus demonstrated that robots successfully generated routes avoiding both static obstacles and dynamic crowds, enhancing navigation safety and adaptability."

While CC methods employ exponential wavefunction parametrizations that guarantee size extensivity and systematic improvability, Green's function approaches such as the $GW$ approximation describe quasiparticle and optical excitations through diagrammatic resummations. Recent analyses have established a formal correspondence between these frameworks: the $GW$ approximation is equivalent to an equation-of-motion (EOM) treatment of the direct-ring coupled-cluster doubles (drCCD) method. Within this context, the extended CC (ECC) ansatz offers a unified framework connecting CC and MBPT. This formulation bridges CC-based and Green's function-based methods, providing novel avenues for incorporating vertex corrections within a CC framework that keep a positive semi-definite self-energy and lead to potentially systematically improvable Green's function approaches."

    "abstract": "The comprehensive understanding capabilities of world models for driving scenarios have significantly improved the planning accuracy of end-to-end autonomous driving frameworks. However, the redundant modeling of static regions and the lack of deep interaction with trajectories hinder world models from exerting their full effectiveness. In this paper, we propose Temporal Residual World Model (TR-World), which focuses on dynamic object modeling. By calculating the temporal residuals of scene representations, the information of dynamic objects can be extracted without relying on detection and tracking. TR-World takes only temporal residuals as input, thus predicting the future spatial distribution of dynamic objects more precisely. By combining the prediction with the static object information contained in the current BEV features, accurate future BEV features can be obtained. Furthermore, we propose Future-Guided Trajectory Refinement (FGTR) module, which conducts interaction between prior trajectories (predicted from the current scene representation) and the future BEV features. This module can not only utilize future road conditions to refine trajectories, but also provides sparse spatial-temporal supervision on future BEV features to prevent world model collapse. Comprehensive experiments conducted on the nuScenes and NAVSIM datasets demonstrate that our method, namely ResWorld, achieves state-of-the-art planning performance.

Existing approaches largely rely on supervised fine-tuning, encouraging surface-level token imitation rather than faithful modeling of underlying chart structure, which often leads to hallucinated or semantically inconsistent outputs. We propose Chart Specification, a structured intermediate representation that shifts training from text imitation to semantically grounded supervision. Chart Specification filters syntactic noise to construct a structurally balanced training set and supports a Spec-Align Reward that provides fine-grained, verifiable feedback on structural correctness, enabling reinforcement learning to enforce consistent plotting logic. Experiments on three public benchmarks show that our method consistently outperforms prior approaches. With only 3K training samples, we achieve strong data efficiency, surpassing leading baselines by up to 61.7% on complex benchmarks, and scaling to 4K samples establishes new state-of-the-art results across all evaluated metrics. Overall, our results demonstrate that precise structural supervision offers an efficient pathway to high-fidelity chart-to-code generation.

Magnetism is introduced by including on-site spin splitting, spin-orbit coupling, and spin-canting angles. As a representative material, we study SrRuO$_3$, which supports spin canting and exhibits a sign change of the AHC. In the ferromagnetic phase, the low-energy AHC is found to be close to zero at the Fermi level, in agreement with experimental observations. We show that the dependence of the AHC on the relevant physical parameters is most pronounced in the central region of the electronic bandwidth. We determine the symmetry-allowed components of the AHC for different magnetic orders in the large family of transition-metal perovskite ABO$_3$ compounds with space group $62$, including the spontaneous in-plane anomalous Hall effect. Within density functional theory, we evaluate the range of spin-canting angles in SrRuO$_3$ and demonstrate that it is suppressed as electronic correlations increase. By analyzing the AHC as a function of the canting angle, we find that the collinear magnetic configurations contribute most to the AHC, while spin canting plays a secondary role in determining its magnitude in non-collinear ferromagnets and altermagnets. However, canting can become relevant and induce a sign change of the AHC when the collinear magnetic state exhibits an AHC close to zero. Finally, we investigate the locations of Weyl points in the Brillouin zone and their evolution as a function of the canting angle."

Despite their popularity, these apps often integrate complex analytics, advertising, and attribution infrastructures that may introduce privacy and security risks. Existing research has primarily focused on tracking behaviors or monetization models, leaving configuration-level privacy exposure and children-oriented apps underexplored. In this study, we conducted a comparative static analysis of Android mobile games to investigate privacy and security risks beyond permission usage. The analysis follows a three-phase methodology comprising (i) designing study protocol, (ii) Android Package Kit (APK) collection and static inspection, and (iii) data analysis. We examined permissions, manifest-level configuration properties (e.g., backup settings, cleartext network traffic, and exported components), and embedded third-party Software Development Kit (SDK) ecosystems across children-oriented and general-audience mobile games. The extracted indicators are synthesized into qualitative privacy-risk categories to support comparative reporting. The results showed that while children-oriented games often request fewer permissions, they frequently exhibit configuration-level risks and embed third-party tracking SDKs similar to general-audience games. Architectural and configuration decisions play a critical role in shaping privacy risks, particularly for apps targeting children. This study contributes a holistic static assessment of privacy exposure in mobile games and provides actionable insights for developers, platform providers, and researchers seeking to improve privacy-by-design practices in mobile applications."

Existing debiasing methods frequently yield inconsistent improvements across datasets or attain fairness by degrading overall diagnostic utility, treating fairness as a post hoc constraint rather than a property of the learned representation. In this work, we propose Stride-Net (Sensitive Attribute Resilient Learning via Disentanglement and Learnable Masking with Embedding Alignment), a fairness-aware framework that learns disease-discriminative yet demographically invariant representations for chest X-ray analysis. Stride-Net operates at the patch level, using a learnable stride-based mask to select label-aligned image regions while suppressing sensitive attribute information through adversarial confusion loss. To anchor representations in clinical semantics and discourage shortcut learning, we further enforce semantic alignment between image features and BioBERT-based disease label embeddings via Group Optimal Transport. We evaluate Stride-Net on the MIMIC-CXR and CheXpert benchmarks across race and intersectional race-gender subgroups. Across architectures including ResNet and Vision Transformers, Stride-Net consistently improves fairness metrics while matching or exceeding baseline accuracy, achieving a more favorable accuracy-fairness trade-off than prior debiasing approaches.

    "abstract": "A Random Access query to a string $T\\in [0..σ)^n$ asks for the character $T[i]$ at a given position $i\\in [0..n)$. In $O(n\\logσ)$ bits of space, this fundamental task admits constant-time queries. While this is optimal in the worst case, much research has focused on compressible strings, hoping for smaller data structures that still admit efficient queries. We investigate the grammar-compressed setting, where $T$ is represented by a straight-line grammar. Our main result is a general trade-off that optimizes Random Access time as a function of string length $n$, grammar size (the total length of productions) $g$, alphabet size $σ$, data structure size $M$, and word size $w=Ω(\\log n)$ of the word RAM model. For any $M$ with $g\\log n<Mw<n\\logσ$, we show an $O(M)$-size data structure with query time $O(\\frac{\\log(n\\logσ\\,/\\,Mw)}{\\log(Mw\\,/\\,g\\log n)})$. Remarkably, we also prove a matching unconditional lower bound that holds for all parameter regimes except very small grammars and relatively small data structures. Previous work focused on query time as a function of $n$ only, achieving $O(\\log n)$ time using $O(g)$ space [Bille et al.; SIAM J. Comput. 2015] and $O(\\frac{\\log n}{\\log \\log n})$ time using $O(g\\log^ε n)$ space for any constant $ε> 0$ [Belazzougui et al.; ESA'15], [Ganardi, Jeż, Lohrey; J. ACM 2021]. The only tight lower bound [Verbin and Yu; CPM'13] was $Ω(\\frac{\\log n}{\\log\\log n})$ for $w=Θ(\\log n)$, $n^{Ω(1)}\\le g\\le n^{1-Ω(1)}$, and $M=g\\log^{Θ(1)}n$. In contrast, our result yields tight bounds in all relevant parameters and almost all regimes. Our data structure admits efficient deterministic construction.

We do this by explicitly creating a GRAPE pulse with fixed 'active' evolution times using single spin-1/2 methods, and pulsing on one spin at a time. By enforcing this form uniformly across offsets ('band-schematic' pulses),chemical shift and scalar coupling evolution of the entire system can be precisely controlled. We demonstrate the approach by constructing band-schematic pulses and a continuously irradiated joint INEPT (JINEPT) that achieves band-selective transfer $I_z \\rightarrow 2I_zS_z$. The framework is implemented in the software Seedless, which both rapidly generates such pulses and analyses the schematic form of arbitrary pulses, enabling robust multi-spin control, without multi-spin optimisation."

We characterize the properties of typical (i.e., most numerous) equilibria at a given diversity, including their average abundance, mutual similarity, and internal stability. This analysis reveals the existence of two distinct ME phases, which differ in how internally stable equilibria behave under invasions by absent species.

Recent work has introduced the paradigm of near-feasibility in capacitated matching settings, where agent capacities are slightly modified to ensure the existence of desirable outcomes. While useful when no stable matching exists, or some agents are left unmatched, it has not previously been investigated whether near-feasible stable matchings satisfy desirable properties with regard to their stability in the original instance. Furthermore, prior works often leave open deviation incentive issues that arise when the centralised authority modifies agents' capacities. We consider these issues in the Stable Fixtures problem model, which generalises many classical models through non-bipartite preferences and capacitated agents. We develop a formal framework to analyse and quantify agent incentives to adhere to computed matchings. Then, we embed near-feasible stable matchings in this framework and study the trade-offs between instability, capacity modifications, and computational complexity. We prove that capacity modifications can be simultaneously optimal at individual and aggregate levels, and provide efficient algorithms to compute them. We show that different modification strategies significantly affect stability, and establish that minimal modifications and minimal deviation incentives are compatible and efficiently computable under general conditions. Finally, we provide exact algorithms and experimental results for tractable and intractable versions of these problems."

Here, we employ scanning tunneling microscopy to demonstrate that NbN thin films fabricated by plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition (PE-ALD) exhibit unusual spatial homogeneity, even at thicknesses approaching the superconductor-insulator transition. Tunneling spectra acquired across the sample surface show only small variations of the order parameter with a standard deviation of 2-3%, on length scales that significantly exceed the film's grain size.

    "abstract": "Dense retrieval is a promising approach for acquiring relevant context or world knowledge in open-domain natural language processing tasks and is now widely used in information retrieval applications. However, recent reports claim a broad preference for text generated by large language models (LLMs). This bias is called \"source bias\", and it has been hypothesized that lower perplexity contributes to this effect. In this study, we revisit this claim by conducting a controlled evaluation to trace the emergence of such preferences across training stages and data sources. Using parallel human- and LLM-generated counterparts of the SciFact and Natural Questions (NQ320K) datasets, we compare unsupervised checkpoints with models fine-tuned using in-domain human text, in-domain LLM-generated text, and MS MARCO. Our results show the following: 1) Unsupervised retrievers do not exhibit a uniform pro-LLM preference. The direction and magnitude depend on the dataset. 2) Across the settings tested, supervised fine-tuning on MS MARCO consistently shifts the rankings toward LLM-generated text. 3) In-domain fine-tuning produces dataset-specific and inconsistent shifts in preference. 4) Fine-tuning on LLM-generated corpora induces a pronounced pro-LLM bias. Finally, a retriever-centric perplexity probe involving the reattachment of a language modeling head to the fine-tuned dense retriever encoder indicates agreement with relevance near chance, thereby weakening the explanatory power of perplexity. Our study demonstrates that source bias is a training-induced phenomenon rather than an inherent property of dense retrievers."

However, this sequential generation process is notoriously slow. While caching strategies have proven effective for accelerating traditional video diffusion models, existing methods assume uniform denoising across all frames-an assumption that breaks down in autoregressive models where different video chunks exhibit varying similarity patterns at identical timesteps. In this paper, we present FlowCache, the first caching framework specifically designed for autoregressive video generation. Our key insight is that each video chunk should maintain independent caching policies, allowing fine-grained control over which chunks require recomputation at each timestep. We introduce a chunkwise caching strategy that dynamically adapts to the unique denoising characteristics of each chunk, complemented by a joint importance-redundancy optimized KV cache compression mechanism that maintains fixed memory bounds while preserving generation quality. Our method achieves remarkable speedups of 2.38 times on MAGI-1 and 6.7 times on SkyReels-V2, with negligible quality degradation (VBench: 0.87 increase and 0.79 decrease respectively). These results demonstrate that FlowCache successfully unlocks the potential of autoregressive models for real-time, ultra-long video generation-establishing a new benchmark for efficient video synthesis at scale.

In this work, we introduce a new algorithm for differentially private worst-case group optimization called ASC (Adaptively Sampled and Clipped Worst-case Group Optimization). It adaptively controls both the sampling rate and the clipping threshold of each group. Thereby, it allows for harder-to-learn groups to be sampled more often while ensuring consistent privacy guarantees across all groups. Comparing ASC to prior work, we show that it results in lower-variance gradients, tighter privacy guarantees, and substantially higher worst-case group accuracy without sacrificing overall average accuracy."

Models must plan and perform multi-step reasoning over raw visual histories to locate targets based on implicit contextual cues. We construct DISBench, a challenging benchmark built on interconnected visual data. To address the scalability challenge of creating context-dependent queries, we propose a human-model collaborative pipeline that employs vision-language models to mine latent spatiotemporal associations, effectively offloading intensive context discovery before human verification. Furthermore, we build a robust baseline using a modular agent framework equipped with fine-grained tools and a dual-memory system for long-horizon navigation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DISBench poses significant challenges to state-of-the-art models, highlighting the necessity of incorporating agentic reasoning into next-generation retrieval systems."

    "abstract": "We study the collapse and possible bounce of dust in quantum-inspired gravity models with spherical symmetry. Starting from a wide class of spherically symmetric spacetimes, we write down the covariant Hamiltonian constraints that under dynamical flow give rise to metrics of many spherically symmetric gravity models. Gravity is minimally coupled to a dust field. The constraint equations are solved for the Hamiltonian evolution and simple equations for the location of the outer boundary of the dust versus time and the apparent horizons in terms of shape functions are obtained. The dust density is not assumed to be homogeneous inside the collapsing ball. In many cases, the effective quantum gravity effects stop the collapse of the dust matter field, then causes the dust field to expand thus creating a bounce at a minimum radius and avoiding the classical singularity. Using this formalism, we examine several quantum-inspired gravity metrics to obtain bounce results either previously obtained by different methods or new results."

Analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) serve as critical sensor interfaces in these systems. Yet, their vulnerability to manufacturing defects remains poorly understood despite unipolar technologies' inherently high defect densities and process variations compared to mature CMOS technologies. We present a hierarchical fault injection framework to characterize defect sensitivity in Binary Search ADCs implemented in n-type only technologies. Our methodology combines transistor-level defect characterization with system-level fault propagation analysis, enabling efficient exploration of both single and multiple fault scenarios across the conversion hierarchy. The framework identifies critical fault-sensitive circuit components and enables selective redundancy strategies targeting only the most sensitive components. The resulting defect-tolerant designs improve fault coverage from 60% to 92% under single-fault injections and from 34% to 77.6% under multi-fault injection, while incurring only 4.2% area overhead and 6% power increase. While validated on IGZO-TFTs, the methodology applies to all emerging unipolar technologies."

    "abstract": "Anticipating defensive coverage schemes is a crucial yet challenging task for offenses in American football. Because defenders' assignments are intentionally disguised before the snap, they remain difficult to recognize in real time. To address this challenge, we develop a statistical framework that integrates supervised and unsupervised learning using player tracking data. Our goal is to forecast the defensive coverage scheme -- man or zone -- through elastic net logistic regression and gradient-boosted decision trees with incrementally derived features. We first use features from the pre-motion situation, then incorporate players' trajectories during motion in a naive way, and finally include features derived from a hidden Markov model (HMM). Based on player movements, the non-homogeneous HMM infers latent defensive assignments between offensive and defensive players during motion and transforms decoded state sequences into informative features for the supervised models. These HMM-based features enhance predictive performance and are significantly associated with coverage outcomes. Moreover, estimated random effects offer interpretable insights into how different defenses and positions adjust their coverage responsibilities."

    "abstract": "We present a class of exact, dynamical, and fully analytic solutions describing regular black holes formed via the gravitational collapse of matter obeying a generalized polytropic equation of state. Starting from a Vaidya-type geometry with a radially dependent mass function, we demonstrate that regularization of the Kiselev solutions can be achieved through a physically motivated modification of the energy density profile. This procedure leads to nonsingular spacetimes with a de~Sitter core and finite curvature invariants at the center. We show that the resulting matter content is naturally described by a generalized polytropic equation of state of the form $P=αρ-ζρ^γ$, where the polytropic index $γ$ is uniquely determined by the regularization scheme. Within this framework, we obtain exact dynamical generalizations of several well-known regular black hole solutions, including the Hayward and Bardeen spacetimes, as particular cases corresponding to specific values of the polytropic parameters. Remarkably, the requirement that the equation of state remains coordinate independent imposes a universal constraint relating the regularization scale to the mass function, which in turn guarantees the existence of a regular de~Sitter core with a curvature scale independent of the black hole mass. Our results provide a unified analytic description of Hayward-like and Bardeen-like black holes emerging from gravitational collapse, offering a consistent effective-matter interpretation rooted in generalized polytropic matter."

    "abstract": "Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate remarkable general-purpose capabilities but often fall short in specialized domains such as medical imaging or geometric problem-solving. Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) can enhance performance within a target domain, but it typically causes catastrophic forgetting, limiting its generalization. The central challenge, therefore, is to adapt VLMs to new domains while preserving their general-purpose capabilities. Continual pretraining is effective for expanding knowledge in Large Language Models (LLMs), but it is less feasible for VLMs due to prohibitive computational costs and the unavailability of pretraining data for most open-source models. This necessitates efficient post-training adaptation methods. Reinforcement learning (RL)-based approaches such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) have shown promise in preserving general abilities, yet they often fail in domain adaptation scenarios where the model initially lacks sufficient domain knowledge, leading to optimization collapse. To bridge this gap, we propose Reinforced Curriculum Pre-Alignment (RCPA), a novel post-training paradigm that introduces a curriculum-aware progressive modulation mechanism. In the early phase, RCPA applies partial output constraints to safely expose the model to new domain concepts. As the model's domain familiarity increases, training gradually transitions to full generation optimization, refining responses and aligning them with domain-specific preferences. This staged adaptation balances domain knowledge acquisition with the preservation of general multimodal capabilities. Extensive experiments across specialized domains and general benchmarks validate the effectiveness of RCPA, establishing a practical pathway toward building high-performing and domain-adaptive VLMs."

In this regard, we fine-tune several pretrained AI models, namely, Prithvi-E0-2.0 and TerraMind, across three use cases, and compare this with a baseline ResNet-101 model. Firstly, we demonstrate TerraMind's LULC generation capabilities. Lastly, we explore the utility of the GFMs in forest functional trait mapping and peatlands detection. In all experiments, the GFMs outperform the baseline ResNet models. In general TerraMind marginally outperforms Prithvi. However, with additional modalities TerraMind significantly outperforms the baseline ResNet and Prithvi models. Nonetheless, consideration should be given to the divergence of input data from pretrained modalities. We note that these models would benefit from higher resolution and more accurate labels, especially for use cases where pixel-level dynamics need to be mapped."

    "abstract": "While FP8 attention has shown substantial promise in innovations like FlashAttention-3, its integration into the decoding phase of the DeepSeek Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) architecture presents notable challenges. These challenges include numerical heterogeneity arising from the decoupling of positional embeddings, misalignment of quantization scales in FP8 PV GEMM, and the need for optimized system-level support. In this paper, we introduce SnapMLA, an FP8 MLA decoding framework optimized to improve long-context efficiency through the following hardware-aware algorithm-kernel co-optimization techniques: (i) RoPE-Aware Per-Token KV Quantization, where the RoPE part is maintained in high precision, motivated by our comprehensive analysis of the heterogeneous quantization sensitivity inherent to the MLA KV cache. Furthermore, per-token granularity is employed to align with the autoregressive decoding process and maintain quantization accuracy. (ii) Quantized PV Computation Pipeline Reconstruction, which resolves the misalignment of quantization scale in FP8 PV computation stemming from the shared KV structure of the MLA KV cache. (iii) End-to-End Dataflow Optimization, where we establish an efficient data read-and-write workflow using specialized kernels, ensuring efficient data flow and performance gains. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art MLA LLMs show that SnapMLA achieves up to a 1.91x improvement in throughput, with negligible risk of performance degradation in challenging long-context tasks, including mathematical reasoning and code generation benchmarks.

However, it remains challenging due to cluttered backgrounds, severe scale variation, and large orientation changes. Existing approaches largely improve performance through multi-scale feature fusion with feature pyramid networks or contextual modeling with attention, but they often lack explicit foreground modeling and do not leverage geometric orientation priors, which limits feature discriminability. To overcome these limitations, we propose FGAA-FPN, a Foreground-Guided Angle-Aware Feature Pyramid Network for oriented object detection. FGAA-FPN is built on a hierarchical functional decomposition that accounts for the distinct spatial resolution and semantic abstraction across pyramid levels, thereby strengthening multi-scale representations. Concretely, a Foreground-Guided Feature Modulation module learns foreground saliency under weak supervision to enhance object regions and suppress background interference in low-level features. In parallel, an Angle-Aware Multi-Head Attention module encodes relative orientation relationships to guide global interactions among high-level semantic features. Extensive experiments on DOTA v1.0 and DOTA v1.5 demonstrate that FGAA-FPN achieves state-of-the-art results, reaching 75.5% and 68.3% mAP, respectively."

This study examines six conversational LLM platforms, analyzing how they define and implement features for users to access, edit, delete, and share data. Our analysis reveals an emerging paradigm of data control in conversational LLM platforms, where user data is generated and derived through interaction itself, natural language enables flexible yet often ambiguous control, and multi-user interactions with shared data raise questions of co-ownership and governance.

The WSM inequality distinguishes itself from the strong monogamy (SM) conjecture [Phys. Rev. Lett. 113, 110501 (2014)] by using coefficients rather than exponents to modulate the weight allocated to various m-partite contributions. In contrast, the MRSM inequality is formulated using only the maximum m-partite entanglement. We find that the residual entanglement of the MRSM inequality can effectively distinguish the separable states. We also compare the tightness of various SM inequalities and provide examples using a four-qubit mixed state and a five-qubit pure state to illustrate the MRSM inequality. These examples characterize the trade-off relations among entanglement components involving varying numbers of qubits. Our results provide a rigorous framework to characterize and quantify the monogamy of multipartite entanglement."

Just like SE, these tasks often employ deep learning; however, deploying additional models on-device is computationally impractical, whereas cloud-based inference would introduce additional latency and compromise privacy. Prior work on SE employed Dynamic Channel Pruning (DynCP) to reduce computation by adaptively disabling specific channels based on the current input. In this work, we investigate whether useful signal properties can be estimated from these internal pruning masks, thus removing the need for separate models. We show that simple, interpretable predictors achieve up to 93% accuracy on VAD, 84% on noise classification, and an R2 of 0.86 on F0 estimation. With binary masks, predictions reduce to weighted sums, inducing negligible overhead. Our contribution is twofold: on one hand, we examine the emergent behavior of DynCP models through the lens of downstream prediction tasks, to reveal what they are learning; on the other, we repurpose and re-propose DynCP as a holistic solution for efficient SE and simultaneous estimation of signal properties."

    "abstract": "The cosmic distance scale is built on multiple different techniques for estimating distances in space that are often connected and dependent on multiple measurements and assumptions. Double white dwarf binaries (DWDs) are common objects and are expected to produce gravitational wave (GW) signals that can be observed with space-based detectors such as LISA. By analyzing these signals we should be able to estimate the distance and sky location of the source. Previous studies have done this for circular binaries which, while they are abundant, have, in general, weaker signals than eccentric binaries and it is not possible to differentiate whether a circular binary is in the field or in a dense environment such as a globular cluster (GC). In this paper we used eccentric binaries from MOCCA GC simulations, simulated the GW signal from each binary at locations related to GCs in the Milky Way and estimated the precision on the distance and the sky location of the source. We find that distances can be estimated with higher precision than current day methods even with low eccentricity binaries and higher eccentricity further increases this precision. Although the probability of finding a tight and eccentric DWD is far lower than a circular one, we can expect to find at least a few in the dense environments of the Milky Way, such as GCs. These estimations would be independent measurements with high precision to objects inside dense environments, such as GCs inside the Milky Way and the Magellanic Clouds."

Results: AMAP-APP achieved a 147-fold increase in processing speed on consumer hardware. Morphometric outputs (area, perimeter, circularity, and slit diaphragm density) showed high correlation (r>0.90) and statistical equivalence (TOST P<0.05) to the original method. Additionally, the new ROI algorithm demonstrated superior accuracy compared to the original, showing reduced deviation from manual delineations. Conclusion: AMAP-APP democratizes deep learning-based podocyte morphometry. By eliminating the need for high-performance computing clusters and providing a user-friendly interface for Windows, macOS, and Linux, it enables widespread adoption in nephrology research and potential clinical diagnostics."

Using super-Nyquist sampling magneto-optical Kerr effect microscopy and micromagnetic simulations, we observe a systematic downshift of the spin-wave transmission gaps as the excitation power increases. This nonlinear behavior occurs at low power levels, reduced by a strong spatial concentration of spin waves within the resonator. The resulting power-dependent transmission enables neuron-like activation behavior and frequency-selective nonlinear spin-wave absorption. Our results highlight magnonic Fabry-Pérot resonators as compact low-power nonlinear elements for neuromorphic magnonic computing architectures."

    "abstract": "Quantum learning from state samples is often benchmarked in a fixed-budget paradigm, relating error to a prescribed number of copies. We instead adopt a stopping-time viewpoint: in minimal-feedback learning, the learning completion can be defined by an online run-length certificate extracted from a one-bit-per-copy record. As an instantiation, we analyze single-shot measurement learning (SSML), introduced in [Phys. Rev. A 98, 052302 (2018)] and [Phys. Rev. Lett. 126, 170504 (2021)], which tunes a unitary and halts after $M_H$ consecutive successes. Viewing the halting as a sequential certification linking the observed counter to infidelity, we derive sample-complexity bounds that separate search (driving success probability toward unity) from certification (run statistics of consecutive successes). The resulting trade-off among $M_H$, dimension $d$, and one-bit reliability clarifies when performance is control-limited versus certificate-limited. With label-flip noise probability $q$, we find a sharp feasibility threshold: once $qM_H \\gtrsim 1$, the expected halting time grows exponentially, making the learning completion impractical even under ideal control. More broadly, this shows that under severely constrained feedback, the certification can dominate sample complexity and small label noise becomes the information bottleneck. Finally, the near-optimal accuracy enabled by run-length certification aligns with the quantum-state-estimation (and equivalently, no-cloning) limits, expressed in the stopping-time terms."

However, the available $(n,γ)$ data on unstable Gd isotopes are scarce and direct measurement is challenging. In this work, we propose an approach to infer the $(n,γ)$ cross sections for unstable $^{153,159}$Gd isotopes by constraining both the $γ$-ray strength functions ($γ$SFs) and nuclear level densities (NLDs). Specifically, the key $γ$SF parameters are adjusted to match the available experimental data, and the NLD parameters are determined by renormalizing microscopic level densities through a Bayesian optimization method. Our approach is verified by comparing our predictions with the experimental $(n,γ)$ data for the stable $^{155,157}$Gd isotopes. We then infer the unstable $^{153,159}\\text{Gd}(n,γ)$ cross sections within the neutron energy range of 0.01--5.0 MeV. The resulting uncertainty is about $30\\%$, which is significantly reduced by a factor of 5.5 compared to a large uncertainty of $\\sim167\\%$ predicted with different nuclear models in TALYS. We further calculate the astrophysical reaction rates for the $^{153,159}\\text{Gd}$ isotopes. It is found that the $^{159}\\text{Gd}(n,γ)$ rate is larger by a factor of $\\sim$2.9 than the JINA REACLIB recommendation. This enhancement increases the neutron capture branching ratio at $^{159}$Gd. Consequently, the resulting $^{160}$Gd abundance is increased by a factor of $\\sim$2 compared to predictions using the JINA REACLIB rate in $s$-process nucleosynthesis simulations. Our approach is promising for extracting $(n,γ)$ data on a wider range of unstable isotopic chains as well as for essential astrophysical reaction network calculations and nuclear science applications."

    "abstract": "Diffusion models have attained remarkable breakthroughs in the real-world super-resolution (SR) task, albeit at slow inference and high demand on devices. To accelerate inference, recent works like GenDR adopt step distillation to minimize the step number to one. However, the memory boundary still restricts the maximum processing size, necessitating tile-by-tile restoration of high-resolution images. Through profiling the pipeline, we pinpoint that the variational auto-encoder (VAE) is the bottleneck of latency and memory. To completely solve the problem, we leverage pixel-(un)shuffle operations to eliminate the VAE, reversing the latent-based GenDR to pixel-space GenDR-Pix. However, upscale with x8 pixelshuffle may induce artifacts of repeated patterns. To alleviate the distortion, we propose a multi-stage adversarial distillation to progressively remove the encoder and decoder. Specifically, we utilize generative features from the previous stage models to guide adversarial discrimination. Moreover, we propose random padding to augment generative features and avoid discriminator collapse. We also introduce a masked Fourier space loss to penalize the outliers of amplitude. To improve inference performance, we empirically integrate a padding-based self-ensemble with classifier-free guidance to improve inference scaling. Experimental results show that GenDR-Pix performs 2.8x acceleration and 60% memory-saving compared to GenDR with negligible visual degradation, surpassing other one-step diffusion SR. Against all odds, GenDR-Pix can restore 4K image in only 1 second and 6GB."

By systematically eliminating unstable modes while preserving the physically relevant dynamics, our method guaranties long-time convergence without introducing artificial damping or ad hoc modifications. The theoretical framework maintains mathematical rigor through orthogonal projection operators and spectral decomposition.

    "abstract": "One of the long standing puzzles in strongly correlated materials is the microscopic origin of the quantum critical Planckian strange metal phase with universal linear in temperature scattering rate from which unconventional superconductivity directly emerges by lowering temperatures. Recently, the linear in temperature and linear in field resistivity have been simultaneously observed in high temperature cuprate superconductors, manifested by the universal field to temperature scaling in magnetoresistivity. To date, there has been a lack of coherent and unified understanding of these coexisting linear behaviors and their possible link to quantum criticality. In this work, we establish the universality in linear in temperature and linear in field Planckian behaviors in underdoped LSCO near optimal doping. Experimentally, we observe the linear in field Planckian scattering rate and its relation to its linear in temperature counterpart. Theoretically, we propose a spin based common microscopic mechanism based on Kondo-like charge fluctuations near local quantum criticality of heavy fermion formulated tJ model subject to a Zeeman term. Similar to frequency to temperature scaling near quantum criticality, we find the magnetic field here effectively introduces a Zeeman energy, reminiscent of an external energy in the quantum critical regime, leading to field to temperature scaling. Our analytically predicted universal field to temperature scaling in isotropic scattering rate and the relation between the linear in temperature and linear in field Planckian coefficients, unifies these two phenomena over an extended doping range, pointing toward a unified quantum-critical origin of Planckian transport in cuprates."

However, the choice of input device and its visualization might influence workload and thus user performance leading to suboptimal demonstrations or reduced training effects. This study investigates how different VR input configurations - motion capture gloves, controllers with hand visualization, and controllers with controller visualization - affect user experience and task execution, with the goal of identifying which configuration is best suited for which type of task. Participants performed various kitchen-related activities of daily living (ADLs), including object placement, cutting, cleaning, and pouring in a simulated environment. To address two research questions, we evaluated user experience using the System Usability Scale and NASA Task Load Index (RQ1), and task-specific interaction behavior (RQ2). The latter was assessed using trajectory segmentation, analyzing movement efficiency, unnecessary actions, and execution precision. While no significant differences in overall usability and workload were found, trajectory analysis revealed configuration-specific execution behaviors with different movement strategies. Controllers enabled significantly faster task completion with less movement variability in pick-and-place style tasks such as table setting. In contrast, motion capture gloves produced more natural movements with fewer unnecessary actions, but also showed greater variance in movement patterns for manner-oriented tasks such as cutting bread. These findings highlight trade-offs between efficiency and naturalism, and have implications for optimizing VR-based training, improving the quality of user-generated demonstrations, and tailoring interaction design to specific application goals."

    "abstract": "Generative recommendation models sequence generation to produce items end-to-end, but training from behavioral logs often provides weak supervision on underlying user intent. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) offer rich semantic priors that could supply such supervision, direct adoption in industrial recommendation is hindered by two obstacles: semantic signals can conflict with platform business objectives, and LLM inference is prohibitively expensive at scale. This paper presents S-GRec, a semantic-aware framework that decouples an online lightweight generator from an offline LLM-based semantic judge for train-time supervision. S-GRec introduces a two-stage Personalized Semantic Judge (PSJ) that produces interpretable aspect evidence and learns user-conditional aggregation from pairwise feedback, yielding stable semantic rewards. To prevent semantic supervision from deviating from business goals, Asymmetric Advantage Policy Optimization (A2PO) anchors optimization on business rewards (e.g., eCPM) and injects semantic advantages only when they are consistent. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks and a large-scale production system validate both effectiveness and scalability, including statistically significant gains in CTR and a 1.19\\% lift in GMV in online A/B tests, without requiring real-time LLM inference."

However, this single-delta approach provides limited insight into whether the observed errors are inherent to the precision level or specific to the implementation. This paper introduces \\textit{Dual-Delta Testing}, a systematic methodology that evaluates two error distributions against a high-precision oracle, enabling rigorous comparison between a custom implementation and a baseline reference.

Specifically, we interpret mixture density networks as deep latent-variable models and analyze them through an expectation maximization framework, which reveals surprising theoretical connections to natural gradient descent.

Using an Onsager--Machlup path-integral formalism, we show that the resulting adaptive dynamics are mathematically equivalent to a class of model reference adaptive control schemes and can be interpreted as a dynamic renormalization of the system's Green's function. Within this framework, the phasic overshoot commonly observed in sensory responses arises naturally from an effective inertia ($m^* \\approx τγ$) generated by memory-dissipation coupling, rather than from biochemical fine-tuning. Quantitative fits to experimental data across species yield $R^2 > 0.88$, and indicate that adaptive sensory processing operates within a narrow thermodynamically optimal regime bounded by signal-to-noise and stability constraints."

    "abstract": "Standard large language model training can create models that produce outputs their trainer deems unacceptable in deployment. The probability of these outputs can be reduced using methods such as LLM unlearning. However, unlearning a set of data (called the forget set) can degrade model performance on other distributions where the trainer wants to retain the model's behavior. To improve this trade-off, we demonstrate that using the forget set to compute only a few uphill Gauss-Newton steps provides a conceptually simple, state-of-the-art unlearning approach for LLMs. While Gauss-Newton steps adapt Newton's method to non-linear models, it is non-trivial to efficiently and accurately compute such steps for LLMs. Hence, our approach crucially relies on parametric Hessian approximations such as Kronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature (K-FAC). We call this combined approach K-FADE (K-FAC for Distribution Erasure). Our evaluation on the WMDP and ToFU benchmarks demonstrates that K-FADE suppresses outputs from the forget set and approximates, in output space, the results of retraining without the forget set. Critically, our method does this while altering the outputs on the retain set less than previous methods. This is because K-FADE transforms a constraint on the model's outputs across the entire retain set into a constraint on the model's weights, allowing the algorithm to minimally change the model's behavior on the retain set at each step. Moreover, the unlearning updates computed by K-FADE can be reapplied later if the model undergoes further training, allowing unlearning to be cheaply maintained."

These regions propagate to confidence regions for spectral clustering assignments and for smooth graph centrality functionals. All bounds are nonasymptotic and depend explicitly on the sample size, noise level, and spectral gap. The analysis isolates a failure of common practice: asymptotic perturbation arguments are often invoked without a finite-sample spectral gap, leading to invalid uncertainty claims. Under verifiable gap and concentration conditions, the present framework yields coverage guarantees and certified stability regions. Several corollaries address fairness-constrained post-processing and topological summaries derived from spectral embeddings."

We introduce MindPilot, the first closed-loop framework that uses EEG signals as optimization feedback to guide naturalistic image generation. Unlike prior work limited to invasive settings or low-level flicker stimuli, MindPilot leverages non-invasive EEG with natural images, treating the brain as a black-box function and employing a pseudo-model guidance mechanism to iteratively refine images without requiring explicit rewards or gradients. We validate MindPilot in both simulation and human experiments, demonstrating (i) efficient retrieval of semantic targets, (ii) closed-loop optimization of EEG features, and (iii) human-subject validations in mental matching and emotion regulation tasks. Our results establish the feasibility of EEG-guided image synthesis and open new avenues for non-invasive closed-loop brain modulation, bidirectional brain-computer interfaces, and neural signal-guided generative modeling."

This viewpoint replaces entropy-rate accounting by cross-entropy accounting under model mismatch, and it introduces feasibility constraints that depend jointly on capacity, delay, and perceptual continuity requirements; the resulting operating set is typically a bounded perception-capacity band rather than a one-sided threshold. We outline the protocol and architectural implications (state identifiers, anchors, bounded rollback, and patch-based updates) and provide a stylized illustrative example to visualize the induced feasibility region and its dependence on predictive quality."

    "abstract": "Recent random feature methods for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) reduce computational cost compared to physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) but still rely on iterative optimization or expensive derivative computation. We observe that sinusoidal random Fourier features possess a cyclic derivative structure: the derivative of any order of $\\sin(\\mathbf{W}\\cdot\\mathbf{x}+b)$ is a single sinusoid with a monomial prefactor, computable in $O(1)$ operations. Alternative activations such as $\\tanh$, used in prior one-shot methods like PIELM, lack this property: their higher-order derivatives grow as $O(2^n)$ terms, requiring automatic differentiation for operator assembly. We propose FastLSQ, which combines frozen random Fourier features with analytical operator assembly to solve linear PDEs via a single least-squares call, and extend it to nonlinear PDEs via Newton--Raphson iteration where each linearized step is a FastLSQ solve. On a benchmark of 17 PDEs spanning 1 to 6 dimensions, FastLSQ achieves relative $L^2$ errors of $10^{-7}$ in 0.07\\,s on linear problems, three orders of magnitude more accurate and significantly faster than state-of-the-art iterative PINN solvers, and $10^{-8}$ to $10^{-9}$ on nonlinear problems via Newton iteration in under 9s."

This theory helps software developers explain the challenges they face and the project risks that emerge as troubleshooting becomes difficult. We define troubleshooting as the cognitive problem-solving process of identifying, understanding, and constructing a mental model of the cause of an unexpected system behavior, and consider the cognitive process of troubleshooting to be an integral part of the activity of debugging. Troubleshooting is a particularly intense and draining aspect of software work, placing sustained demands on attention, working memory, and mental modeling. By surfacing and naming the confusion experience inherent in troubleshooting in terms of neurological and attentional dynamics, our theory explains how prolonged troubleshooting can deplete cognitive resources and lead to cognitive fatigue. In the study presented in this paper, we interview 27 professional developers about their troubleshooting experiences, and follow a Constructivist Grounded Theory approach to construct a theory grounded in empirical data. Our theory contributes to research on Developer Experience by providing a cognitive foundation for understanding troubleshooting difficulty, fatigue, and sustainability risk--and offers practical implications for both research and industry."

However, value learning in residual RL poses unique challenges that remain poorly understood. In this work, we identify two key bottlenecks: cold start pathology, where the critic lacks knowledge of the value landscape around the base policy, and structural scale mismatch, where the residual contribution is dwarfed by the base action. Through systematic investigation, we uncover the mechanisms underlying these bottlenecks, revealing that simple yet principled solutions suffice: base-policy transitions serve as an essential value anchor for implicit warmup, and critic normalization effectively restores representation sensitivity for discerning value differences. Based on these insights, we propose DAWN (Data-Anchored Warmup and Normalization), a minimal approach targeting efficient value learning in residual RL. By addressing these bottlenecks, DAWN demonstrates substantial efficiency gains across diverse benchmarks, policy architectures, and observation modalities."

    "abstract": "The SHAP (short for Shapley additive explanation) framework has become an essential tool for attributing importance to variables in predictive tasks. In model-agnostic settings, SHAP uses the concept of Shapley values from cooperative game theory to fairly allocate credit to the features in a vector $X$ based on their contribution to an outcome $Y$. While the explanations offered by SHAP are local by nature, learners often need global measures of feature importance in order to improve model explainability and perform feature selection. The most common approach for converting these local explanations into global ones is to compute either the mean absolute SHAP or mean squared SHAP. However, despite their ubiquity, there do not exist approaches for performing statistical inference on these quantities. In this paper, we take a semi-parametric approach for calibrating confidence in estimates of the $p$th powers of Shapley additive explanations. We show that, by treating the SHAP curve as a nuisance function that must be estimated from data, one can reliably construct asymptotically normal estimates of the $p$th powers of SHAP. When $p \\geq 2$, we show a de-biased estimator that combines U-statistics with Neyman orthogonal scores for functionals of nested regressions is asymptotically normal. When $1 \\leq p < 2$ (and the hence target parameter is not twice differentiable), we construct de-biased U-statistics for a smoothed alternative. In particular, we show how to carefully tune the temperature parameter of the smoothing function in order to obtain inference for the true, unsmoothed $p$th power. We complement these results by presenting a Neyman orthogonal loss that can be used to learn the SHAP curve via empirical risk minimization and discussing excess risk guarantees for commonly used function classes."

    "abstract": "Electroencephalography (ECoG) offers a promising alternative to conventional electrocorticography (EEG) for the early prediction of Parkinson's disease (PD), providing higher spatial resolution and a broader frequency range. However, reproducible comparisons has been limited by ethical constraints in human studies and the lack of open benchmark datasets. To address this gap, we introduce a new dataset, the first reproducible benchmark for PD prediction. It is constructed from long-term ECoG recordings of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced rat models and annotated with neural responses measured before and after electrical stimulation. In addition, we propose a Swap-Adversarial Framework (SAF) that mitigates high inter-subject variability and the high-dimensional low-sample-size (HDLSS) problem in ECoG data, while achieving robust domain generalization across ECoG and EEG-based Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) datasets. The framework integrates (1) robust preprocessing, (2) Inter-Subject Balanced Channel Swap (ISBCS) for cross-subject augmentation, and (3) domain-adversarial training to suppress subject-specific bias. ISBCS randomly swaps channels between subjects to reduce inter-subject variability, and domain-adversarial training jointly encourages the model to learn task-relevant shared features. We validated the effectiveness of the proposed method through extensive experiments under cross-subject, cross-session, and cross-dataset settings. Our method consistently outperformed all baselines across all settings, showing the most significant improvements in highly variable environments. Furthermore, the proposed method achieved superior cross-dataset performance between public EEG benchmarks, demonstrating strong generalization capability not only within ECoG but to EEG data. The new dataset and source code will be made publicly available upon publication."

Using a minimal model, we simulate the coupled evolution of the nematic order parameter and membrane height. We demonstrate a continuous transition from a curvature-dominated regime, where topological defects are trapped by local deformation, to an activity-dominated regime exhibiting active turbulence. A scaling analysis reveals that the critical activity threshold $ζ_c$ scales as $α^2/κ$, where $α$ and $κ$ are the coupling constant and bending stiffness, respectively; this relationship is confirmed by our numerical results. Furthermore, we find that significant correlations between the orientational pattern and membrane geometry persist even in the turbulent regime. Specifically, we identify that \"walls\" in the director field induce characteristic wave-like curvature profiles, providing a mechanism for dynamic coupling between order and shape. These results offer a physical framework for understanding defect-mediated deformation in nonequilibrium biological membranes."

Reasoning over such knowledge requires models to integrate spatial relationships, visual cues, real-world context, and domain-specific expertise-capabilities that current large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) still struggle to exhibit consistently. Yet, datasets used to benchmark VLMs on map-based reasoning remain narrow in scope, restricted to specific domains, and heavily reliant on artificially generated content (outputs from LLMs or pipeline-based methods), offering limited depth for evaluating genuine geospatial reasoning. To address this gap, we present MapVerse, a large-scale benchmark built on real-world maps. It comprises 11,837 human-authored question-answer pairs across 1,025 maps, spanning ten diverse map categories and multiple question categories for each. The dataset provides a rich setting for evaluating map reading, interpretation, and multimodal reasoning. We evaluate ten state-of-the-art models against our benchmark to establish baselines and quantify reasoning gaps. Beyond overall performance, we conduct fine-grained categorical analyses to assess model inference across multiple dimensions and investigate the visual factors shaping reasoning outcomes. Our findings reveal that while current VLMs perform competitively on classification-style tasks, both open- and closed-source models fall short on advanced tasks requiring complex spatial reasoning."

Rather than tightly coupling tool usage with audio reasoning, AudioRouter formulates tool use as an explicit decision making problem and optimizes a lightweight routing policy while keeping the underlying reasoning model frozen. Experimental results show that AudioRouter achieves substantial improvements on standard audio understanding benchmarks while requiring up to 600x less training data to learn tool usage compared with conventional training paradigms. These findings suggest that learning effective tool usage offers a data efficient and scalable alternative to internalizing perceptual abilities in LALMs."

To address this issue, we propose a novel nonparametric Bayesian learning (NPBL) framework for OTFS channel estimation. Specifically, a stick-breaking process is introduced to automatically infer the number of multipath components and assign each path to its corresponding cluster. The channel coefficients within each cluster are modeled by a Gaussian mixture distribution to capture complex fading statistics. Furthermore, an effective pruning criterion is designed to eliminate spurious multipath components, thereby enhancing estimation accuracy and reducing computational complexity. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance in terms of normalized mean squared error compared to existing methods."

To mitigate the tension between goal stability and reactive correctness, we introduce (i) a hierarchical branch-thinking planner that decomposes life goals into parallel objective branches and uses simulation-guided validation plus tiered re-planning to ensure feasibility; (ii) an adaptive agent profile with dual-process memory that separates short-term execution traces from long-term semantic consolidation, enabling persistent yet evolving identity; and (iii) a human-in-the-loop steering interface that injects long-horizon objectives and short commands at appropriate abstraction levels, with effects propagated through memory rather than brittle prompt overrides. The environment integrates physiological survival costs, non-substitutable multi-tier production, an AMM-based price mechanism, and a gated education-occupation system. Using high-frequency transactions from the platforms mature phase, we find stable markets that reproduce key stylized facts (heavy-tailed returns and volatility clustering) and produce structured wealth stratification driven by education and access constraints. Ablations show simplified planners can match performance on narrow tasks, while the full architecture is more robust under multi-objective, long-horizon settings, supporting delayed investment and sustained exploration."

Employing the closed-time-path formalism the influence action $S_{IF}$ is calculated using a perturbative expansion in $λ$. It is possible to identify the terms in $S_{IF}$ quadratic or higher in $Δ(s)\\equiv f(x_{+}(s))-f(x_{-}(s))$ to constitute the noise kernel, while terms linear in $Δ$ to that of the dissipation kernel. The non-Gaussian noise kernel gives rise to non-zero three-point correlation function of the corresponding stochastic force. The pathway presented here should be useful for the exploration of \\textit{non-Gaussian properties of systems nonlinearly coupled with their environments}; examples in early universe cosmology and in quantum optomechanics (QOM) are mentioned. A modified fluctuation-dissipation relation (FDR) is also established, which ensures the consistency of the model and the accuracy of results even at higher perturbative orders. Another result of significance is the derivation of a nonlinear Langevin equation which is expected to be useful for many open quantum system applications."

However, as context lengths increase, a fundamental limitation of the softmax function emerges: it tends to diffuse probability mass to irrelevant tokens degrading performance in long-sequence scenarios. Furthermore, attempts to sharpen focus by lowering softmax temperature hinder learnability due to vanishing gradients. We introduce LUCID Attention, an architectural modification that applies a preconditioner to the attention probabilities. This preconditioner, derived from exponentiated key-key similarities, minimizes overlap between the keys in a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space, thus allowing the query to focus on important keys among large number of keys accurately with same computational complexity as standard attention. Additionally, LUCID's preconditioning-based approach to retrieval bypasses the need for low temperature and the learnability problems associated with it. We validate our approach by training ~1 billion parameter language models evaluated on up to 128K tokens. Our results demonstrate significant gains on long-context retrieval tasks, specifically retrieval tasks from BABILong, RULER, SCROLLS and LongBench. For instance, LUCID achieves up to 18% improvement in BABILong and 14% improvement in RULER multi-needle performance compared to standard attention."

This extended study introduces a comprehensive, multimodal physiological framework for non-invasive hypoglycemia detection using wearable sensor signals. Unlike prior work limited to single-signal analysis, this chapter evaluates three physiological modalities, galvanic skin response (GSR), heart rate (HR), and their combined fusion, using the OhioT1DM 2018 dataset. We develop an end-to-end pipeline that integrates advanced preprocessing, temporal windowing, handcrafted and sequence-based feature extraction, early and late fusion strategies, and a broad spectrum of machine learning and deep temporal models, including CNNs, LSTMs, GRUs, and TCNs. Our results demonstrate that physiological signals exhibit distinct autonomic patterns preceding hypoglycemia and that combining GSR with HR consistently enhances detection sensitivity and stability compared to single-signal models. Multimodal deep learning architectures achieve the most reliable performance, particularly in recall, the most clinically urgent metric. Ablation studies further highlight the complementary contributions of each modality, strengthening the case for affordable, sensor-based glycemic monitoring. The findings show that real-time hypoglycemia detection is achievable using only inexpensive, non-invasive wearable sensors, offering a pathway toward accessible glucose monitoring in underserved communities and low-resource healthcare environments."

For groups of even order, we prove a universal rigidity theorem: the index-$2$ subgroup creates an immutable arithmetic barrier at density $1/2$, fixing the critical number at $|G|/2+1$ regardless of the group's internal structure. In sharp contrast, we demonstrate that for groups of odd order, this barrier vanishes, causing the critical threshold to collapse to significantly lower densities bounded by index-$5$ obstructions or the smallest prime divisor. These results unify and vastly generalize previous work on cyclic groups, providing a definitive structural theory for the transition from sparsity to saturation. As a decisive application, we resolve a conjecture of Han and Ren in algebraic coding theory. By translating the additive rigidity at density $1/2$ into a geometric constraint, we prove that for all sufficiently large $q$, any subset of rational points on an elliptic curve $E/\\mathbb{F}_q$ generating an MDS code must satisfy the tight bound $|P|\\le|E(\\mathbb{F}_q)|/2$."

Specifically, our method utilizes a pre-trained large language model to synthesize an instruction-grounded skill database tailored for legged robots. A pre-trained vision-language model is employed to extract high-level environmental semantics and ground them within the skill database, enabling real-time skill advisories for the robot. To facilitate versatile skill control, we train a style-conditioned policy capable of generating diverse and robust locomotion skills with high fidelity to specified styles. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to demonstrate real-time adaptation of legged locomotion using high-level reasoning from environmental semantics and instructions with instruction-following accuracy of up to 87% without the need for online query to on-the-cloud foundation models."

Using our DBPlanBench harness for the DataFusion engine, we expose the physical plan through a compact serialized representation and let the LLM propose localized edits that can be applied and executed. We then apply an evolutionary search over these edits to refine candidates across iterations. Our key insight is that LLMs can leverage semantic knowledge to identify and apply non-obvious optimizations, such as join orderings that minimize intermediate cardinalities. We obtain up to 4.78$\\times$ speedups on some queries and we demonstrate a small-to-large workflow in which optimizations found on small databases transfer effectively to larger databases."

For example, while transformers capture rich associations, they are mostly agnostic to event timing and ordering, thereby bypassing potential causal reasoning. Intuitively, we need a method capable of evaluating the \"degree of alignment\" among patient-specific trajectories and identifying their shared patterns, i.e., the significant events in a consistent sequence. This necessitates treating timing as a true \\emph{computable} dimension, allowing models to assign ``relative timestamps'' to candidate events beyond their observed physical times. In this work, we introduce LITT, a novel Timing-Transformer architecture that enables temporary alignment of sequential events on a virtual ``relative timeline'', thereby enabling \\emph{event-timing-focused attention} and personalized interpretations of clinical trajectories. Its interpretability and effectiveness are validated on real-world longitudinal EHR data from 3,276 breast cancer patients to predict the onset timing of cardiotoxicity-induced heart disease.

We systematically compared 16 algorithms spanning deep learning, gradient boosting, and traditional machine learning families, using data from the Nepal Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) 2019. A composite malnutrition indicator was constructed by integrating stunting, wasting, and underweight status, and model performance was evaluated using ten metrics, with emphasis on F1-score and recall to account for substantial class imbalance and the high cost of failing to detect malnourished children. Among all models, TabNet demonstrated the best performance, likely attributable to its attention-based architecture, and outperformed both support vector machine and AdaBoost classifiers. A consensus feature importance analysis identified maternal education, household wealth index, and child age as the primary predictors of malnutrition, followed by geographic characteristics, vaccination status, and meal frequency. Collectively, these results demonstrate a scalable, survey-based screening framework for identifying children at elevated risk of malnutrition and for guiding targeted nutritional interventions. The proposed approach supports Nepal's progress toward the Sustainable Development Goals and offers a transferable methodological template for similar low-resource settings globally."

    "abstract": "Structured claim decomposition is often proposed as a solution for verifying complex, multi-faceted claims, yet empirical results have been inconsistent. We argue that these inconsistencies stem from two overlooked bottlenecks: evidence alignment and sub-claim error profiles. To better understand these factors, we introduce a new dataset of real-world complex claims, featuring temporally bounded evidence and human-annotated sub-claim evidence spans. We evaluate decomposition under two evidence alignment setups: Sub-claim Aligned Evidence (SAE) and Repeated Claim-level Evidence (SRE). Our results reveal that decomposition brings significant performance improvement only when evidence is granular and strictly aligned. By contrast, standard setups that rely on repeated claim-level evidence (SRE) fail to improve and often degrade performance as shown across different datasets and domains (PHEMEPlus, MMM-Fact, COVID-Fact). Furthermore, we demonstrate that in the presence of noisy sub-claim labels, the nature of the error ends up determining downstream robustness. We find that conservative \"abstention\" significantly reduces error propagation compared to aggressive but incorrect predictions. These findings suggest that future claim decomposition frameworks must prioritize precise evidence synthesis and calibrate the label bias of sub-claim verification models."

In this work, we propose a robustness-oriented evaluation framework for KE-based detoxification that examines its reliability beyond standard classifier-based metrics along three dimensions: optimisation robustness, compositional robustness, and cross-lingual robustness. We identify pseudo-detoxification as a common failure mode, where apparent toxicity reductions arise from degenerate generation behaviours rather than meaningful suppression of unsafe content. We further show that detoxification effectiveness degrades when multiple unsafe behaviours are edited jointly, and that both monolingual and cross-lingual detoxification remain effective only under specific model-method combinations. Overall, our results indicate that KE-based detoxification is robust only for certain models, limited numbers of detoxification objectives, and a subset of languages."

    "abstract": "Multi-Resolution Hash Encoding (MHE), the foundational technique behind Instant Neural Graphics Primitives, provides a powerful parameterization for neural fields. However, its spatial behavior lacks rigorous understanding from a physical systems perspective, leading to reliance on heuristics for hyperparameter selection. This work introduces a novel analytical approach that characterizes MHE by examining its Point Spread Function (PSF), which is analogous to the Green's function of the system. This methodology enables a quantification of the encoding's spatial resolution and fidelity. We derive a closed-form approximation for the collision-free PSF, uncovering inherent grid-induced anisotropy and a logarithmic spatial profile. We establish that the idealized spatial bandwidth, specifically the Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM), is determined by the average resolution, $N_{\\text{avg}}$. This leads to a counterintuitive finding: the effective resolution of the model is governed by the broadened empirical FWHM (and therefore $N_{\\text{avg}}$), rather than the finest resolution $N_{\\max}$, a broadening effect we demonstrate arises from optimization dynamics. Furthermore, we analyze the impact of finite hash capacity, demonstrating how collisions introduce speckle noise and degrade the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR). Leveraging these theoretical insights, we propose Rotated MHE (R-MHE), an architecture that applies distinct rotations to the input coordinates at each resolution level. R-MHE mitigates anisotropy while maintaining the efficiency and parameter count of the original MHE. This study establishes a methodology based on physical principles that moves beyond heuristics to characterize and optimize MHE."

However, most existing approaches still rely on fixed workflows, applying the same reasoning procedure across diverse recommendation scenarios. In practice, user contexts vary substantially-for example, in cold-start settings or during interest shifts, so an agent should adaptively decide what evidence to gather next rather than following a scripted process. To address this, we propose ChainRec, an agentic recommender that uses a planner to dynamically select reasoning tools. ChainRec builds a standardized Tool Agent Library from expert trajectories. It then trains a planner using supervised fine-tuning and preference optimization to dynamically select tools, decide their order, and determine when to stop. Experiments on AgentRecBench across Amazon, Yelp, and Goodreads show that ChainRec consistently improves Avg HR@{1,3,5} over strong baselines, with especially notable gains in cold-start and evolving-interest scenarios. Ablation studies further validate the importance of tool standardization and preference-optimized planning."

    "abstract": "We study the pricing query complexity of revenue maximization for a single buyer whose private valuation is drawn from an unknown distribution. In this setting, the seller must learn the optimal monopoly price by posting prices and observing only binary purchase decisions, rather than the realized valuations. Prior work has established tight query complexity bounds for learning a near-optimal price with additive error $\\varepsilon$ when the valuation distribution is supported on $[0,1]$. However, our understanding of how to learn a near-optimal price that achieves at least a $(1-\\varepsilon)$ fraction of the optimal revenue remains limited. In this paper, we study the pricing query complexity of the single-buyer revenue maximization problem under such multiplicative error guarantees in several settings. Observe that when pricing queries are the only source of information about the buyer's distribution, no algorithm can achieve a non-trivial approximation, since the scale of the distribution cannot be learned from pricing queries alone. Motivated by this fundamental impossibility, we consider two natural and well-motivated models that provide \"scale hints\": (i) a one-sample hint, in which the algorithm observes a single realized valuation before making pricing queries; and (ii) a value-range hint, in which the valuation support is known to lie within $[1, H]$. For each type of hint, we establish pricing query complexity guarantees that are tight up to polylogarithmic factors for several classes of distributions, including monotone hazard rate (MHR) distributions, regular distributions, and general distributions."

This paper examines this transition by connecting foundational intelligent agent theories, including reactive, deliberative, and Belief-Desire-Intention models, with contemporary LLM-centric approaches such as tool invocation, memory-augmented reasoning, and multi-agent coordination. The paper presents three primary contributions: (i) a reference architecture for production-grade LLM agents that separates cognitive reasoning from execution using typed tool interfaces; (ii) a taxonomy of multi-agent topologies, together with their associated failure modes and mitigation approaches; and (iii) an enterprise hardening checklist that incorporates governance, observability, and reproducibility considerations. Through an analysis of emerging industry platforms, including Kore.ai, Salesforce Agentforce, TrueFoundry, ZenML, and LangChain, the study identifies a convergence toward standardized agent loops, registries, and auditable control mechanisms. It is argued that the subsequent phase of agentic AI development will parallel the maturation of web services, relying on shared protocols, typed contracts, and layered governance structures to support scalable and composable autonomy. The persistent challenges related to verifiability, interoperability, and safe autonomy remain key areas for future research and practical deployment."

Here, based on fully observational-data-driven magnetohydrodynamic simulation, we successfully reproduce the initiation of a CME originating from the super active region AR 13663, with only a one-minute time lag between the flare peak in observations and the velocity peak of the rising flux rope in the simulation. Moreover, the eruptive structure exhibits a multi-stage kinematic evolution: an initial slow acceleration, a plateau at a nearly stationary height, and a subsequent impulsive acceleration. These stages correspond to torus instability, the downward tension force exerted by the overlying toroidal field, and fast magnetic reconnection, respectively. Our results highlight the inherently multistage nature of CME initiation in real events. In configurations with strong overlying toroidal fields, the downward toroidal-field-induced tension force can suppress the rise of the flux rope and produce a plateau phase at a nearly stable height, even when torus instability occurs. In contrast, the subsequent fast magnetic reconnection beneath the flux rope can drive the impulsive eruption more effectively. The close agreement between the observed and simulated peak times over one minute demonstrates the strong potential of our data-driven model for predicting CME onset."

We study when, and how, an experimenter can ask for a series of action-dependent belief statistics after a subject chooses an action, while incentivize truthful reports without distorting the subject's optimal action in the main experimental tasks. We first propose a novel mechanism called the Counterfactual Scoring Rule (CSR), which achieves such nondistortionary elicitation of any single belief statistic by decomposing it into supplemental action-independent statistics. In contrast, when eliciting a fixed set of belief statistics without such decomposition, we show that robust nondistortionary elicitation is achievable if and only if the questions satisfy a joint alignment condition with the task payoff. The necessity of joint alignment is established through a graph theoretical approach, while its sufficiency follows from invoking an adaptation of the Becker-DeGroot-Marschak mechanism. Our characterization applies to experiments with general task-payoff structures and belief elicitation questions."

Current evaluations systematically overlook the third goal. Specifically, they either treat existing code as ground truth (a compliance trap) for regression prevention, or depend on post-failure artifacts (e.g., issue reports) for bug reproduction-so they rarely surface defects before failures. To bridge this gap, we present TestExplora, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs as proactive testers within full-scale, realistic repository environments. TestExplora contains 2,389 tasks from 482 repositories and hides all defect-related signals. Models must proactively find bugs by comparing implementations against documentation-derived intent, using documentation as the oracle. Furthermore, to keep evaluation sustainable and reduce leakage, we propose continuous, time-aware data collection. Our evaluation reveals a significant capability gap: state-of-the-art models achieve a maximum Fail-to-Pass (F2P) rate of only 16.06%. Further analysis indicates that navigating complex cross-module interactions and leveraging agentic exploration are critical to advancing LLMs toward autonomous software quality assurance. Consistent with this, SWEAgent instantiated with GPT-5-mini achieves an F2P of 17.27% and an F2P@5 of 29.7%, highlighting the effectiveness and promise of agentic exploration in proactive bug discovery tasks."

We first consider the i.i.d. arrival model and show that the pure greedy algorithm -- which myopically chooses the welfare-maximizing integral allocation -- achieves $\\widetilde{O}(1/T)$ average regret. Importantly, in contrast to prior work, our algorithm does not require distributional knowledge and achieves the optimal regret rate using only the online samples. We then go beyond i.i.d. arrivals and investigate a nonstationary model with time-varying independent distributions. In the absence of additional data about the distributions, it is known that every online algorithm must suffer $Ω(1)$ average regret. We show that only a single historical sample from each distribution is sufficient to recover the optimal $\\widetilde{O}(1/T)$ average regret rate, even in the face of arbitrary non-stationarity. Our algorithms are based on the re-solving paradigm: they assume that the remaining items will be the ones seen historically in those periods and solve the resulting welfare-maximization problem to determine the decision in every period. Finally, we also account for distribution shifts that may distort the fidelity of historical samples and show that the performance of our re-solving algorithms is robust to such shifts."

We discretize this continuum theory to derive a family of fully unlocked algorithms suitable for training neural networks. Different parameter dynamics, including gradient descent, can be derived by demanding dissipation and minimization of reflections at parameter ports. These results also imply that any physical substrate that supports the scattering and dissipation of waves can be interpreted as solving an optimization problem."

However, RL suffers from sample inefficiency and a lack of semantic interpretability in complex scenarios. Foundation Models, particularly Vision-Language Models (VLMs), can mitigate this by offering rich, context-aware knowledge, yet their high inference latency hinders deployment in high-frequency RL training loops. To bridge this gap, we present Found-RL, a platform tailored to efficiently enhance RL for AD using foundation models. A core innovation is the asynchronous batch inference framework, which decouples heavy VLM reasoning from the simulation loop, effectively resolving latency bottlenecks to support real-time learning. We introduce diverse supervision mechanisms: Value-Margin Regularization (VMR) and Advantage-Weighted Action Guidance (AWAG) to effectively distill expert-like VLM action suggestions into the RL policy. Additionally, we adopt high-throughput CLIP for dense reward shaping. We address CLIP's dynamic blindness via Conditional Contrastive Action Alignment, which conditions prompts on discretized speed/command and yields a normalized, margin-based bonus from context-specific action-anchor scoring. Found-RL provides an end-to-end pipeline for fine-tuned VLM integration and shows that a lightweight RL model can achieve near-VLM performance compared with billion-parameter VLMs while sustaining real-time inference (approx. 500 FPS).

    "abstract": "Many scientific and engineering systems exhibit intrinsically multimodal behavior arising from latent regime switching and non-unique physical mechanisms. In such settings, learning the full conditional distribution of admissible outcomes in a physically consistent and interpretable manner remains a challenge. While recent advances in machine learning have enabled powerful multimodal generative modeling, their integration with physics-constrained scientific modeling remains nontrivial, particularly when physical structure must be preserved or data are limited. This work develops a physics-informed multimodal conditional modeling framework based on mixture density representations. Mixture density networks (MDNs) provide an explicit and interpretable parameterization of multimodal conditional distributions. Physical knowledge is embedded through component-specific regularization terms that penalize violations of governing equations or physical laws. This formulation naturally accommodates non-uniqueness and stochasticity while remaining computationally efficient and amenable to conditioning on contextual inputs. The proposed framework is evaluated across a range of scientific problems in which multimodality arises from intrinsic physical mechanisms rather than observational noise, including bifurcation phenomena in nonlinear dynamical systems, stochastic partial differential equations, and atomistic-scale shock dynamics. In addition, the proposed method is compared with a conditional flow matching (CFM) model, a representative state-of-the-art generative modeling approach, demonstrating that MDNs can achieve competitive performance while offering a simpler and more interpretable formulation."

However, a critical understanding gap remains between the microscopic generation of these seeds and the macroscopic onset of the dynamo. Current kinetic models, often constrained to electron scales, predict premature saturation via magnetic trapping, leaving the generated fields potentially too weak and small-scale to effectively prime magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) processes. Here, using high-resolution kinetic simulations with a realistic mass ratio, we reveal the physics of this unexplored ion-kinetic regime. Under generalized continuous shear driving, used to simulate ubiquitous macroscopic flows, we demonstrate that the saturation of electron instabilities is not the endpoint but a precursor to a distinct, ion-dominated evolution. Massive ions, sustaining the velocity shear, trigger a subsequent filamentation instability that accesses the vast ion kinetic energy reservoir. This mechanism amplifies the magnetic energy by orders of magnitude beyond the electron-saturation limit, expanding the field coherence to ion scales. Our results establish ion kinetics as the essential ''missing link'' that bridges the divide between microscopic plasma instabilities and macroscopic cosmic dynamos."

In particular, a jump in magnetic field strength, observed by V1 in 2020.4 at 149.3 au from the Sun, was followed by a distinct \"hump\" and persistently strong magnetic field, both requiring theoretical explanation. This paper offers an interpretation of those observations using a self-consistent, MHD model of the solar wind - LISM interaction driven by the OMNI and interplanetary scintillation data combined with a turbulence analysis of Voyager data. Our simulations convincingly demonstrate that global, solar-cycle-driven compressions, on hitting the heliopause, can reproduce those puzzling V1 observations. They appear to be associated with solar cycle 24, whereas similar interstellar magnetic field structures can occur once per cycle. The turbulence analysis reveals time-dependent magnetic compressibility that persists up to 165 au at scales below 10 days. Turbulence intermittency at scales below 1 hour is mostly confined to specific intervals, possibly associated with a broad foreshock region. The apparent disappearance of intermittency since 2022 reflects the turbulence weakening rather than a fundamental change in VLISM properties. We predict that V1 will record relatively strong magnetic field strengths until $\\sim$2030, followed by weaker, infrequent perturbations. At V2, we expect multiple solar-driven compressions before 2026, followed by a major event induced by solar cycle 25 around 2030. New Horizons is expected to cross the termination shock at 80$\\pm$ au in 2031."

    "abstract": "Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering (HAC) is a widely-used clustering method based on repeatedly merging the closest pair of clusters, where inter-cluster distances are determined by a linkage function. Unlike many clustering methods, HAC does not optimize a single explicit global objective; clustering quality is therefore primarily evaluated empirically, and the choice of linkage function plays a crucial role in practice. However, popular classical linkages, such as single-linkage, average-linkage and Ward's method show high variability across real-world datasets and do not consistently produce high-quality clusterings in practice. In this paper, we propose \\emph{Chamfer-linkage}, a novel linkage function that measures the distance between clusters using the Chamfer distance, a popular notion of distance between point-clouds in machine learning and computer vision. We argue that Chamfer-linkage satisfies desirable concept representation properties that other popular measures struggle to satisfy. Theoretically, we show that Chamfer-linkage HAC can be implemented in $O(n^2)$ time, matching the efficiency of classical linkage functions. Experimentally, we find that Chamfer-linkage consistently yields higher-quality clusterings than classical linkages such as average-linkage and Ward's method across a diverse collection of datasets. Our results establish Chamfer-linkage as a practical drop-in replacement for classical linkage functions, broadening the toolkit for hierarchical clustering in both theory and practice."

LakeMLB focuses on two representative multi-table scenarios, Union and Join, and provides three real-world datasets for each scenario, covering government open data, finance, Wikipedia, and online marketplaces. The benchmark supports three representative integration strategies: pre-training-based, data augmentation-based, and feature augmentation-based approaches. We conduct extensive experiments with state-of-the-art tabular learning methods, offering insights into their performance under complex data lake scenarios.

    "abstract": "Propagation latency is inherent to any distributed network, including blockchains. Typically, blockchain protocols provide a timing buffer for block propagation across the network. In leader-based blockchains, the leader -- block proposer -- is known in advance for each slot. A fast (or low-latency) proposer may delay the block proposal in anticipation of more rewards from the transactions that would otherwise be included in the subsequent block. Deploying such a strategy by manipulating the timing is known as timing games. It increases the risk of missed blocks due to reduced time for other nodes to vote on the block, affecting the overall efficiency of the blockchain. Moreover, proposers who play timing games essentially appropriate MEV (additional rewards over transaction fees and the block reward) that would otherwise accrue to the next block, making it unfair to subsequent block proposers. We propose a double-block proposal mechanism, 2-Prop, to curtail timing games. 2-Prop selects two proposers per slot to propose blocks and confirms one of them. We design a reward-sharing policy for proposers based on how quickly their blocks propagate to avoid strategic deviations. In the induced game, which we call the Latency Game, we show that it is a Nash Equilibrium for the proposers to propose the block without delay under homogeneous network settings. Under heterogeneous network settings, we study many configurations, and our analysis shows that a faster proposer would prefer not to delay unless the other proposer is extremely slow. Thus, we show the efficacy of 2-Prop in mitigating the effect of timing games."

However, these transforms are computationally expensive when employed as differentiable loss functions for stochastic gradient descent due to their numerous paths, which significantly limits their use in neural network training. Against this problem, we propose \"Scattering transform with Random Paths for machine Learning\" (SCRAPL): a stochastic optimization scheme for efficient evaluation of multivariable scattering transforms. We implement SCRAPL for the joint time-frequency scattering transform (JTFS) which demodulates spectrotemporal patterns at multiple scales and rates, allowing a fine characterization of intermittent auditory textures. We apply SCRAPL to differentiable digital signal processing (DDSP), specifically, unsupervised sound matching of a granular synthesizer and the Roland TR-808 drum machine. We also propose an initialization heuristic based on importance sampling, which adapts SCRAPL to the perceptual content of the dataset, improving neural network convergence and evaluation performance. We make our code and audio samples available and provide SCRAPL as a Python package."

In addition to testing long-standing experimental neutrino anomalies and performing measurements of neutrino interactions with argon nuclei using the Fermilab Booster Neutrino Beam, MicroBooNE aims to develop methodologies for rare beyond the Standard Model and off-beam physics searches. Looking ahead to the upcoming Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE), with MicroBooNE serving as a valuable testbed, achieving high sensitivity and livetime for off-beam physics while satisfying data processing and storage constraints will require data-driven, intelligent, and online or real-time data selection techniques. These techniques are essential for reducing data rates and preserving rare signals with high accuracy. In this paper, we describe a fast data selection algorithm suitable for online execution to identify electrons from stopping cosmic ray muons in the MicroBooNE detector utilizing ionization charge information, and present its performance. This represents the first demonstration of online data selection in a LArTPC using real data and charge information exclusively and provides an important proof-of-principle for applying such techniques to other LArTPC experiments such as the Short-Baseline Near Detector and DUNE."

This fundamental difference explains the Lindley paradox and establishes the risk-theoretic superiority of Bayesian procedures over fixed-$α$ Neyman-Pearson tests. We extend the seminal Rubin (1965) program to contemporary settings including high-dimensional sparse inference, goodness-of-fit testing, and model selection. The framework unifies several classical results: Jeffreys' $\\sqrt{\\log n}$ threshold, the BIC penalty $(d/2)\\log n$, and the Chernoff-Stein error exponents all emerge naturally from moderate deviation analysis of Bayes risk. Our results provide theoretical foundations for adaptive significance levels and connect Bayesian testing to information theory through gambling-based interpretations."

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards has driven recent advances in LLM post-training, in particular for reasoning. Policy optimization algorithms generate a number of responses for a given prompt and then effectively weight the corresponding gradients depending on the rewards. The most popular algorithms including GRPO, DAPO, and RLOO focus on ambiguous prompts, i.e., prompts with intermediate success probability, while downgrading gradients with very easy and very hard prompts. In this paper, we consider asymmetric prompt weightings that assign higher weights to prompts with low, or even zero, empirical success probability. We find that asymmetric weighting particularly benefits from-scratch RL (as in R1-Zero), where training traverses a wide accuracy range, and less so in post-SFT RL where the model already starts at high accuracy. We also provide theory that characterizes prompt weights which minimize the time needed to raise success probability from an initial level to a target accuracy under a fixed update budget. In low-success regimes, where informative responses are rare and response cost dominates, these optimal weights become asymmetric, upweighting low success probabilities and thereby accelerating effective-time convergence."

Here we introduce the Materials Knowledge Navigation Agent (MKNA), a language-driven system that translates natural-language scientific intent into executable actions for database retrieval, property prediction, structure generation, and stability evaluation. Beyond automating tool invocation, MKNA autonomously extracts quantitative thresholds and chemically meaningful design motifs from literature and database evidence, enabling data-grounded hypothesis formation. Applied to the search for high-Debye-temperature ceramics, the agent identifies a literature-supported screening criterion (Theta_D > 800 K), rediscovers canonical ultra-stiff materials such as diamond, SiC, SiN, and BeO, and proposes thermodynamically stable, previously unreported Be-C-rich compounds that populate the sparsely explored 1500-1700 K regime. These results demonstrate that MKNA not only finds stable candidates but also reconstructs interpretable design heuristics, establishing a generalizable platform for autonomous, language-guided materials exploration."

We investigate two classes of hyperbolic models: one describing viscoelasticity with linear dissipation, and the other non-Newtonian fluids asymptotically converging to a power-law behavior. For viscoelastic models, the weaker K-condition is always satisfied and acceleration waves remain bounded. For non-Newtonian fluids, the validity of the condition depends on the power-law index $m$: it holds for Newtonian fluids ($m=1$), is violated for shear-thinning fluids ($m<1$), and leads to an instantaneous regularization of acceleration waves for shear-thickening fluids ($m>1$)."

The discussion is organized around four classes of axion scenarios, ordered from long to short lifetimes: (i) stable or long-lived axions contributing to dark radiation; (ii) stable or long-lived axions produced out-of-equilibrium and constituting dark matter; (iii) metastable axions whose decays inject energy into the primordial plasma and leave observable signatures in the global 21 cm signal; and (iv) very short-lived axions that act only as portals to additional degrees of freedom. Together, these scenarios highlight the interplay between axion phenomenology and early universe cosmology and demonstrate the potential of cosmological data to probe axions over a broad range of masses and lifetimes."

The accuracy of registration data directly impacts Internet operation, management, security, and optimization. In addition, the scarcity of IP addresses has brought into focus conflicts between RIR policy and IP registration ownership and use. The tension between a free-market based approach to address allocation versus policies to promote fairness and regional equity has resulted in court litigation that threatens the very existence of the RIR system. We develop WHEREIS, a measurement-based approach to geolocate delegated IPv4 and IPv6 prefixes at an RIR-region granularity and systematically study where addresses are used post-allocation and the extent to which registration information is accurate. We define a taxonomy of registration ``geo-consistency'' that compares a prefix's measured geolocation to the allocating RIR's coverage region as well as the registered organization's location. While in aggregate over 98% of the prefixes we examine are consistent with our geolocation inferences, there is substantial variation across RIRs and we focus on AFRINIC as a case study. IPv6 registrations are no more consistent than IPv4, suggesting that structural, rather than technical, issues play an important role in allocations. We solicit additional information on inconsistent prefixes from network operators, IP leasing providers, and collaborate with three RIRs to obtain validation. We further show that the inconsistencies we discover manifest in three commercial geolocation databases. By improving the transparency around post-allocation prefix use, we hope to improve applications that use IP registration data and inform ongoing discussions over in-region address use and policy."

SafeThink monitors the evolving reasoning trace with a safety reward model and conditionally injects an optimized short corrective prefix (\"Wait, think safely\") only when the safety threshold is violated. In our evaluations across six open-source MLRMs and four jailbreak benchmarks (JailbreakV-28K, Hades, FigStep, and MM-SafetyBench), SafeThink reduces attack success rates by 30-60% (e.g., LlamaV-o1: 63.33% to 5.74% on JailbreakV-28K, R1-Onevision: 69.07% to 5.65% on Hades) while preserving reasoning performance (MathVista accuracy: 65.20% to 65.00%).

A key lever is the \\emph{data recipe}, which comprises a data processing pipeline to transform raw sources into training corpora. Despite the growing use of LLMs to automate individual data processing steps, such as data synthesis and filtering, the overall design of data recipes remains largely manual and labor-intensive, requiring substantial human expertise and iteration. To bridge this gap, we formulate \\emph{end-to-end data recipe generation} for LLM adaptation. Given a target benchmark and a pool of available data sources, a model is required to output a complete data recipe that adapts a base LLM to the target task. We present DataChef-32B, which performs online reinforcement learning using a proxy reward that predicts downstream performance for candidate recipes. Across six held-out tasks, DataChef-32B produces practical recipes that reach comparable downstream performance to those curated by human experts. Notably, the recipe from DataChef-32B adapts Qwen3-1.7B-Base to the math domain, achieving 66.7 on AIME'25 and surpassing Qwen3-1.7B.

We prove its vulnerability with two distinct attacks: First, our attack on a model confidentiality system achieves a full confidentiality break by recovering its secret permutations and model weights. Second, our integrity attack completely bypasses the integrity checks of systems like Soter and TSQP. We demonstrate the practicality of our attacks against state-of-the-art LLMs, recovering a layer's secrets from a LLaMA-3 8B model in about 6 minutes and showing the attack scales to compromise 405B-parameter LLMs across a variety of configurations."

    "abstract": "Remote change detection in LLMs is a difficult problem. Existing methods are either too expensive for deployment at scale, or require initial white-box access to model weights or grey-box access to log probabilities. We aim to achieve both low cost and strict black-box operation, observing only output tokens. Our approach hinges on specific inputs we call Border Inputs, for which there exists more than one output top token. From a statistical perspective, optimal change detection depends on the model's Jacobian and the Fisher information of the output distribution. Analyzing these quantities in low-temperature regimes shows that border inputs enable powerful change detection tests. Building on this insight, we propose the Black-Box Border Input Tracking (B3IT) scheme. Extensive in-vivo and in-vitro experiments show that border inputs are easily found for non-reasoning tested endpoints, and achieve performance on par with the best available grey-box approaches. B3IT reduces costs by $30\\times$ compared to existing methods, while operating in a strict black-box setting."

    "abstract": "Characterization of fragmented rock piles is a fundamental task in the mining and quarrying industries, where rock is fragmented by blasting, transported using wheel loaders, and then sent for further processing. This field report studies a novel method for estimating the relative particle size of fragmented rock piles from only proprioceptive data collected while digging with a wheel loader. Rather than employ exteroceptive sensors (e.g., cameras or LiDAR sensors) to estimate rock particle sizes, the studied method infers rock fragmentation from an excavator's inertial response during excavation. This paper expands on research that postulated the use of wavelet analysis to construct a unique feature that is proportional to the level of rock fragmentation. We demonstrate through extensive field experiments that the ratio of wavelet features, constructed from data obtained by excavating in different rock piles with different size distributions, approximates the ratio of the mean particle size of the two rock piles. Full-scale excavation experiments were performed with a battery electric, 18-tonne capacity, load-haul-dump (LHD) machine in representative conditions in an operating quarry. The relative particle size estimates generated with the proposed sensing methodology are compared with those obtained from both a vision-based fragmentation analysis tool and from sieving of sampled materials."

The appeal of this novel approach is the wide class of models which it permits, ease of implementation and the posterior-like fiducial distribution without the need for a prior. We provide background information for the derivation of the relevant fiducial quantities, and a proof that the proposed MCMC algorithm targets the correct fiducial distribution. We need not assume independence nor identical distribution of the data, which makes the method attractive for application to time series and spatial data. Well-performing simulation results of the MA(1) and Matérn models are presented."

To bridge this gap, we present RISE, a scalable framework of robotic reinforcement learning via imagination. At its core is a Compositional World Model that (i) predicts multi-view future via a controllable dynamics model, and (ii) evaluates imagined outcomes with a progress value model, producing informative advantages for the policy improvement. Such compositional design allows state and value to be tailored by best-suited yet distinct architectures and objectives. These components are integrated into a closed-loop self-improving pipeline that continuously generates imaginary rollouts, estimates advantages, and updates the policy in imaginary space without costly physical interaction. Across three challenging real-world tasks, RISE yields significant improvement over prior art, with more than +35% absolute performance increase in dynamic brick sorting, +45% for backpack packing, and +35% for box closing, respectively."

The triangular Poisson relations instead generate a \\cinf-structure on phase space, given by the Hamiltonian vector fields of the family, and this structure can be exploited algorithmically. We show that the equations of motion can be reduced to and solved by a finite sequence of completely integrable Pfaffian equations. We call the resulting geometric object a Poisson \\cinf-structure and provide a systematic Pfaffian integration procedure that applies even when a complete set of conserved quantities is unavailable. The construction is illustrated on two models of physical interest: the two-particle non-periodic Toda lattice and the multi-waterbag reduction of the Vlasov equation. Also, we discuss how the theory extends to time-dependent Hamiltonian systems."

However, accurately modeling sys-tem frequency dynamics through analytical formulations is chal-lenging due to their inherent nonlinearity and complexity. To address this issue, deep neural networks (DNNs) are utilized to capture the nonlinear mapping between system operating condi-tions and key frequency performance metrics. In this paper, a DNN-based frequency prediction model is developed and trained using the high-fidelity time-domain simulation data generated in PSCAD/EMTDC. The trained DNN is subsequently transformed into an equivalent mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) form and embedded into the FCOPF problem as additional con-straints to explicitly enforce frequency security, leading to the proposed DNN-FCOPF formulation. For benchmarking, two alternative models are considered: a conventional optimal power flow without frequency constraints and a linearized FCOPF in-corporating system-level RoCoF and FN constraints. The effec-tiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by comparing the solutions of these three models through extensive PSCAD/EMTDC time-domain simulations under various loading scenarios."

In this paper, we present Pram, the first ML-based method that leverages the reasoning power of multimodal language models (MLMs) for addressing the trade-off dilemma -- a great need of service providers. As part of our proposal, Pram (i) quickly computes high-quality allocations by dividing the original problem into local subproblems, which are then resolved by an MLM-powered \"agent\", and (ii) ensures global consistency by harmonizing these subproblems via a multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm. Theoretically, we show that Pram, which learns to perform gradient descent in context, provably converges to the optimum within the family of MCF problems. Empirically, on real-world datasets and public topologies, Pram achieves performance comparable to, and in some cases even surpassing, linear programming solvers (very close to the optimal solution), and substantially lower runtimes (1 to 2 orders of magnitude faster). Moreover, Pram exhibits strong robustness (<10\\% performance degradation under link failures or flow bursts), demonstrating MLM's generalization ability to unforeseen events. Pram is objective-agnostic and seamlessly integrates with mainstream allocation systems, providing a practical and scalable solution for future networks."

We introduce a ``dynamical microscope'' framework that converts multichannel signals into circular phase--amplitude features, learns a data-driven latent trajectory representation with an autoencoder, and quantifies dynamical regimes through trajectory geometry and flow field metrics. Using a coupled Stuart--Landau oscillator network with topology-switching as ground-truth validation, we demonstrate that the framework recovers differences in dynamical laws even when regimes occupy overlapping regions of state space. Group differences can be expressed as changes in latent trajectory speed, path geometry, and flow organization on a shared manifold, rather than requiring discrete state separation. Speed and explored variance show strong regime discriminability ($η^2 > 0.5$), while some metrics (e.g., tortuosity) capture trajectory geometry orthogonal to topology contrasts. The framework provides a principled approach for analyzing regime structure in multivariate time series from neural, physiological, or physical systems."

    "abstract": "Binding energies (BEs) of adsorbates on interstellar dust grains critically control adsorption, desorption, diffusion, and surface reactivity, and therefore strongly influence astrochemical models of star- and planet-forming regions. While recent computational studies increasingly report full distributions of BEs rather than single representative values, these distributions are typically derived for either bare grain surfaces or thick water-ice mantles. In this work, we bridge these regimes by systematically investigating the BE distributions of water on partially and fully ice-covered dust grain surfaces. We employ machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) based on graph neural networks to model water adsorption on graphene and on the Mg-terminated (010) surface of forsterite, representing carbonaceous and silicate grains, respectively. The models enable extensive sampling of adsorption sites on water clusters, monolayers, and bilayers generated under both crystalline (thermally processed) and amorphous (low-temperature) growth conditions. At submonolayer coverage, the chemical nature of the underlying grain strongly affects both ice morphology and binding energies, with Mg-O interactions on silicate surfaces producing particularly deep binding sites. From monolayer coverage onward, adsorption on both substrates is dominated by hydrogen bonding within the ice, reducing the influence of the grain material. Across all coverages, amorphous ice structures systematically shift the BE distributions toward stronger binding compared to crystalline ice, introducing highly stable defect and pocket sites. These results demonstrate that BE distributions in the submonolayer to few-layer ice regime are broad and highly surface dependent, and they provide physically motivated input for next-generation astrochemical models incorporating surface heterogeneity."

First, we propose a simple algorithm to achieve end-to-end differentiability of a given (frozen) LM and then find optimised prompts via gradient descent. Our central insight is to view LMs as functions operating on sequences of distributions over tokens (rather than the traditional view as functions on sequences of tokens). Our experiments and ablations demonstrate that our DLM-powered inversion can reliably and efficiently optimise prompts of lengths $10$ and $80$ for targets of length $20$, for several white-box LMs (out-of-the-box)."

To improve efficiency, recent work has explored model upscaling: initializing larger models from trained smaller ones in order to transfer knowledge and accelerate convergence. However, this method can be sensitive to hyperparameters that need to be tuned at the target upscaled model size, which is prohibitively costly to do directly. It remains unclear whether the most common workaround -- tuning on smaller models and extrapolating via hyperparameter scaling laws -- is still sound when using upscaling. We address this with principled approaches to upscaling with respect to model widths and efficiently tuning hyperparameters in this setting. First, motivated by $μ$P and any-dimensional architectures, we introduce a general upscaling method applicable to a broad range of architectures and optimizers, backed by theory guaranteeing that models are equivalent to their widened versions and allowing for rigorous analysis of infinite-width limits. Second, we extend the theory of $μ$Transfer to a hyperparameter transfer technique for models upscaled using our method and empirically demonstrate that this method is effective on realistic datasets and architectures."

Superlinear convergence is attainable even when the Jacobian is merely uniformly continuous, relaxing the standard Lipschitz assumption to its theoretical limit. For convex regularized optimization problems, we introduce a novel globalization strategy that ensures strict objective decrease and avoids the Maratos effect, attaining local $Q$-superlinear convergence without prior knowledge of problem parameters. Unit step size acceptance in our line search strategy does not rely on continuity or even existence of the Hessian of the smooth term in the objective, making the framework compatible with other potential candidates for superlinearly convergent updates."

In this paper, we generalise the classical double copy to the motion of strings, taking as a case study the motion of an open string in a background abelian gauge field. We argue that the double copy of this situation is a closed string moving in a spacetime background arising as the double copy of the gauge theory background. The gauge theory background we consider is that of a constant electric field, which has a critical value beyond which the open string motion is pathological. We find no counterpart of this behaviour in the double copy, and interpret this result. We then examine how the closed string nevertheless still knows about the single copy gauge theory. Our results pave the way for more systematic study of the double copy in a classical string context, thus going beyond the KLT relations for amplitudes in flat space."

We show that explicitly modeling orthogonal degrees of freedom reveals insights hidden in one-dimensional projections at negligible computational overhead. Additionally, exploiting symmetries in the underlying landscape enhances reconstruction accuracy, while regularization techniques ensure numerical robustness in sparsely sampled regions. We validate our approach on three distinct systems: the conformational dynamics of alanine dipeptide, as well as coarse-grained and all-atom models of solute permeation through lipid bilayers. We demonstrate that, because FPSL learns a smooth score function rather than histogram-based densities, it overcomes the exponential scaling of grid-based methods, establishing it as a data-efficient and scalable tool for multidimensional free-energy estimation."

The proposed approach is applied to the default camera sensor model in CARLA and targets the geometric and the radiometric parts separately. Thereby, this work proposes an enhanced model that fits the characteristics of the real camera used during experiments. Images generated with the proposed simulation model reduce the sim-to-real gap and are 112.73% better than the default model in terms of the Michelson-contrast. Evaluating the OECF-curves yields an 85.16% improvement. To demonstrate the applicability, we assess the performance of a deep neural network detecting a EuroNCAP pedestrian target at distances ranging from 5m to 100m. The results show that the default simulation model leads to overconfident predictions compared to the proposed model and the real camera. Furthermore, we will use the enhanced model in X-in-the-Loop tests of automated driving systems."

Addressing the challenge of temperature rise during grinding in cyclone mills compromising product quality, which leads to much material waste, while direct internal temperature measurement remains unfeasible, this paper proposes a temperature field inversion algorithm. By formulating an inverse heat transfer model, the Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization (QPSO) algorithm is employed to perform the inversion solution. The results demonstrate that the model achieves a deviation range of merely (–0.08, 0.06), effectively avoiding local optima and realizing high-precision temperature inversion. This approach provides a reliable method for temperature monitoring in an enclosed grinding chamber. Moreover, the inverted temperature serves as a feedback signal for Robotic Closed-Loop Control, enabling real-time adjustment of grinding parameters and improving automation reliability, reducing thermal-related downtime by 30% compared to standard PID control, meeting industrial production efficiency requirements."

Theoretical analysis of the UEM is conducted, demonstrating positive semi-definiteness and eigenvalue monotonicity under specific conditions. Then, we proposed a graph Fourier transform based on UEM (UEM-GFT) that adaptively tunes spectral properties to enhance signal processing performance. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the UEM-GFT outperforms existing GSO-based methods in anomaly detection, achieving superior performance across diverse network topologies."

    "abstract": "Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) aims to improve a model’s performance on an unlabeled target domain by leveraging labeled data from a source domain. Traditional UDA methods often overlook the rich textual information inherent in class labels, limiting their effectiveness. Recent advances in visual language models (VLMs), especially the contrastive language–image pretraining (CLIP) model, provide a promising multimodal foundation by integrating both image and text representations. However, most CLIP-based UDA approaches rely on pseudo-labels generated in a zero-shot manner by the pretrained CLIP model, which may become suboptimal as training progresses. To address this limitation, we propose a pseudo-label refinement (PuRe) framework that begins training with zero-shot CLIP pseudo-labels and then transitions to self-training, where we iteratively refine the model’s own predictions as pseudo-labels. In this iterative process, we introduce label consistency learning to stabilize predictions under strong data augmentations, increasing robustness, and an information maximization (IM) loss to encourage high-confidence predictions while preserving prediction diversity. Together, these components progressively enhance pseudo-label reliability, leading to improved adaptation in the target domain. Furthermore, we propose a novel prompt learning (PL) method that fine-tunes only a minimal set of parameters, specifically a single context token and class embeddings. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PuRe surpasses existing UDA methods on multiple benchmarks."

    "abstract": "This study presents an empirical analysis of collaborative performance assessment in engineering learning scenarios. A validated instrument—derived from a previously developed questionnaire measuring seven operational dimensions of collaboration—was applied to evaluate group performance. The study involved 251 students from various engineering courses, organized into experimental groups based on personality traits and a control group formed according to student preference. Findings reveal that personality-based group formation influences collaborative performance, with outcomes varying by group configuration. Homogeneous and mixed groups emphasizing emotional stability (Neuroticism – N) demonstrated higher levels of leadership and collaboration, while heterogeneous groups underperformed compared to the control group. Across all formations, conflict management consistently emerged as the most challenging process, underscoring the importance of targeted strategies for managing interpersonal tensions in team-based learning. From a methodological standpoint, the assessment instrument exhibited high internal consistency (Cronbach’s α > 0.9), affirming its reliability for evaluating collaborative dynamics in academic contexts. The study concludes that personality-informed group formation can optimize specific collaborative processes, though its effectiveness depends on the combination of personality traits within each team. These findings hold significant implications for the field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), particularly in informing the design of educational technologies that enable adaptive group formation and provide real-time feedback in collaborative learning environments."

In telecommunications, many core tasks—from signal processing to network optimization—require precise quantitative reasoning, where errors directly impact engineering practice. Existing benchmarks evaluate LLMs on general mathematics or telecom-related language tasks, but none assess llM capability to solve numerical mathematical problems in the telecom domain. To address this gap, we introduce TeleMath, the first benchmark dataset specifically designed to evaluate LLM performance in solving mathematical problems with numerical solutions in the telecommunications domain. TeleMath is built through a novel data generation methodology that starts from a compact seed of expert-crafted problems and expands it via problem decomposition, code- and symbolic math–driven blueprint generation, parameterized synthesis, and semantic validation. The resulting benchmark comprises 500 expert-verified question– answer pairs spanning diverse topics in the telecom domain with different levels of difficulty, each requiring a numerical solution. We then conduct a systematic benchmarking study of leading open-source LLMs, comparing reasoning-oriented models against general-purpose ones. On TeleMath, the best reasoning model, Qwen3-32B, achieves 69.51% pass@1 accuracy, substantially outperforming the best non-reasoning baseline, Qwen2.5-Math-72B-Instruct, which achieves 39.99% average accuracy with 2× more parameters, underscoring the unique challenges of telecom mathematics.

    "abstract": "The growing complexity of cyber threats has exposed the limitations of traditional vulnerability assessment tools, which primarily rely on static scanning and CVSS-based scoring. These approaches often fail to capture dynamic configurations and evolving threat surfaces in enterprise environments. To address this gap, we present AegisGuard, a context-aware framework for automated vulnerability detection and adaptive risk stratification. AegisGuard integrates structured system telemetry, semantic threat intelligence through retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and a specialized large language model (LLM) to infer CVE applicability and assign five-level risk labels (L0–L4) that reflect both technical severity and environmental context. Unlike conventional scanners, AegisGuard dynamically adjusts its reasoning to system-specific privilege settings, exposure levels, and service criticality, enabling the identification of both critical exploits and subtle misconfigurations often missed by static tools. Our evaluation spans heterogeneous Linux and Windows platforms and leverages a dual-layer ground truth methodology: Core Ground Truth (C-GT) for verified vulnerabilities and Extended Ground Truth (E-GT) for semantically related threats. Results show that AegisGuard achieves an F1 score of up to 0.79 in CVE detection and exceeds 90% classification accuracy within a ±1 risk margin. Complementary ablation and prompt sensitivity analyses confirm the importance of RAG-based enrichment and structured input design in maximizing LLM effectiveness. Overall, these findings demonstrate that semantic, context-aware modeling is essential for accurate, scalable, and operationally relevant vulnerability management."

    "abstract": "Optical nonlinear media are the building blocks of nonlinear optics, which are commonly characterized by nonlinear polarizability. The inversion of polarizability for nonlinear media is an important problem in nonlinear optics. However, the maturity and accuracy of nonlinear media inversion methods lag behind those of ordinary linear media inversion methods because analytically and rigorously solving the Maxwell equations with nonlinear media is quite complicated. In order to derive inversion formulas, traditional nonlinear media inversion methods have to make various physical or mathematical approximations to the Maxwell equations. Essentially, the inversion of polarizability in nonlinear media belongs to the inverse scattering problem. Inspired by the advantages of numerical algorithms for solving the inverse scattering problem in linear media, we generalize the contrast source inversion method, which is one of the most popular methods for linear media, to second-order nonlinear media. The two-dimensional media distribution and undepleted-pump approximation are considered. Numerical tests conducted on either transverse magnetic or transverse electric data or joint data show that the generalized method can successfully reconstruct the nonlinear media distributions, and the joint inversion gives the best reconstruction quality in all test cases."

    "abstract": "Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) aims to segment objects without being constrained by a predefined set of categories. Recent advancements in OVSS have been driven by CLIP, a powerful vision-language model that enables segmentation through textual and visual feature matching. However, while visual features within a class exhibit significant diversity, their corresponding text features remain relatively limited in distribution. This discrepancy weakens the effectiveness of vision-language matching forOVSS. To address these challenges, we proposeOV-EVA(Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation with Enhanced Vision-Language Alignment), a novel training-free OVSS framework that leverages multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) to improve visual-language alignment and enhance segmentation robustness. Our method introduces an iterative vocabulary expansion strategy, where MLLMs generate a diverse and scene-relevant vocabulary set through a two-stage querying process. To ensure accurate segmentation, we incorporate a mask-guided score refinement mechanism, which enhances vocabulary terms closely aligned with the target mask while mitigating overly dominant terms across the entire image. Additionally, we introduce a top-N-based target class mapping strategy to improve the alignment between the generated vocabulary set and target class labels. The proposed OV-EVA achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks when using GPT-4o as the underlying MLLM. Furthermore, our approach demonstrates strong adaptability across different MLLMs, achieving competitive results with LLaVA and Janus-Pro. These findings suggest that leveraging generative reasoning from MLLMs offers a scalable pathway for robust zero-shot perception without task-specific training. Future work will focus on optimizing computational efficiency to facilitate real-time deployment in practical applications. We will soon release our source code."

The practical implementation of smart gird concept throws some challenging issues onto the conventional technology such as control and operation of energy resources, both renewable and conventional type, demand side management in real time mode, embedded generation, etc. The smart gird technology differs conventional existing technology in terms of extensive use of advanced sensors, inherent quality of outage recovery and healing capacity, communication in two ways, etc. In parallel to progression in smart gird technology, there is also rapid development standalone renewable energy resources operation where accessibility to main gird is the main concern. The next generation power systems are synthesized by intensive use of Information and Communication Technologies together with traditionally usable technology. In this paper endeavors have been taken to detail about new smart gird based technology and its part, advantages of this latest technology which is not quite the same as in house technology."

    "abstract": "Most existing approaches that deploy the super-twisting control (STC) policy for regulating a first-order sliding mode (FOSM) rely on assuming the perturbation and its derivative are bounded by a known constant, and/or achieve exact finite-time convergence in the constraint-free case. In contrast, this brief considers the development of a novel adaptive STC policy that guarantees exact finite-time convergence of the FOSM subjected to a state-dependent uncertainty arising from the presence of a time-varying, asymmetric output constraint. This is achieved by first initiating a smooth invertible nonlinear transformation that explicitly accounts for the output constraint, which is followed by the design of a novel adaptive STC policy that guarantees exact finite-time convergence by explicitly accounting for the state-dependent structure of the perturbation term of the resulting unconstrained error system. Formation tracking experiments under visibility constraints, including performance comparisons with leading alternative designs, are used to verify the efficacy and demonstrate the advantages of the proposed scheme."

    "abstract": "Sepsis still a common cause of morbidity and mortality in Intensive Care Units (ICUs). Early sepsis identification is essential for improving outcomes for patients with sepsis. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and feasibility of an artificial intelligence (AI)-powered Decision Support System (DSS) implementing sepsis management in the setting of ICU nursing. As a Decision Support System, the DSS was designed to ingest real-time patient data, employing machine learning algorithms, and analytics to improve early identification of sepsis and support clinical decision making. A multi-center randomized controlled trial (RCT) was conducted in three hospitals with 200 ICU nurses and 400 ICU patients. Participants were assigned either to the intervention group, using the AI system, or to the control group, who followed the standard sepsis detection protocol. Outcome measures were time to sepsis detection, response time by nurses, length of stay in the ICU, and 30-day mortality. Data collection was via electronic health records (EHRs), system logs, and hospital records. The use of the AI-driven decision support system yielded better clinical outcomes. The intervention group identified sepsis 3.4 hours' sooner (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{p}&lt;0.001$</tex>), had 5 fewer minutes in nurse response time (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{p}&lt;0.01$</tex>), had an ICU length of stay that was 1.8 days shorter (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{p}&lt;0.05$</tex>), and had an overall 30day mortality rate that was 9 % lower <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$(p&lt;0.05)$</tex> compared to the control group. Nurses reported the system had a high usability rating and a System Usability Scale (SUS) score that averaged 86.5/100 and perceived the AI system was clinically relevant to the team (mean Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) perceived usefulness 4.4/5). This research confirms that an AI-enabled Decision Support System can lead to earlier sepsis detection, quicker response times, and improved patient outcomes in ICUs. Nurses reported that they found the system intuitive and beneficial, illustrating that AI can effectively enable nursing practice. Overall, this study demonstrated one approach to leverage AI within an ICU workflow with the potential to improve the quality of care provided to patients, as well as enhance the efficiency of sepsis management. Next steps in this area of research would include multi-site and multi-center trials, researching the longer-term impacts of the system and finding further improvements."

This article proposes a dynamic pricing prediction model utilizing Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) combined within a simple-to-use Tkinter-based GUI. The system predicts past ride prices from attributes such as time, location, weather, traffic, and categorical attributes like city or type of car. ANN is capable of mapping non-linear complex relationships, and RNN considers temporal dependencies. Data preprocessing one-hot encodes and normalizes the data to prepare it for training, and the performance of the model is gauged by the <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{R}^{\\mathbf{2}}$</tex> score. Users can input ride data manually or via CSV uploads, switch between ANN and RNN models, and show predictions and SHAP-based feature importance for interpretability. Results show that ANN performs slightly better than RNN, though RNN is promising for more sequential data. The software is designed for real-world deployment in sectors like transport, logistics, and e-commerce. The modular nature allows for easy integration of future upgraded models or cloud APIs. Ultimately, the system covers deep learning and user interaction, promoting transparency, accessibility, and usability in real-world dynamic pricing prediction."

Unfortunately, recent research has demonstrated that fault injection (FI) attacks on SPHINCS+ can significantly compromise the security of the signing process. This paper introduces SHAFI, a countermeasure to FI attacks on SPHINCS+, that protects the signature generation and verification process via address masking. Experiments on a standard fault injection platform, ChipWhisperer, demonstrate that the proposed method renders faulty signatures unanalyzable by an attacker, eliminating the possibility of universal forgery attempts. This proposed technique is simple, memory and computation budget efficient, and applicable to virtually any SPHINCS+-derived hash-based signing technique.

These texts frequently contain a mixture of local languages, non-standard abbreviations, and brand-specific drug names, making them difficult to interpret accurately. The unstructured nature of these statements poses significant challenges for both healthcare professionals and automated systems, particularly when it comes to ensuring patient safety and facilitating effective clinical decision-making. With the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence, large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT3.5 have demonstrated impressive capabilities in understanding and generating human-like text across a variety of domains. These models offer a promising approach to addressing the complexities of medical text by enabling automatic extraction and clarification of critical information. In this study, we leverage the capabilities of ChatGPT-3.5 to process and refine medication statements from discharge summaries. Our goal is to automatically identify key medical entities and expand these statements into more structured and interpretable formats. By doing so, we aim to enhance the readability and usability of medication information for both humans and machines, ultimately contributing to improved healthcare data management and patient care."

This improves upon the FRI [Ben-Sasson, Bentov, Horesh, Riabzev, ICALP 2018] and the STIR [Arnon, Chiesa, Fenzi, Yogev, Crypto 2024] IOPPs for Reed-Solomon codes, that have larger query and round complexity standing at $O(\\lambda \\log d)$ and $O(\\log d+\\lambda \\log \\log d)$ respectively. We use our IOPP to give an IOP for the NPcomplete language R1CS with the same parameters. Our construction is based on the line versus point test in the low-soundness regime. Compared to the axis parallel test (which is used in all prior works), the general affine lines test has improved soundness, which is the main source of our improved soundness. Using this test involves several complications, most significantly that projection to affine lines does not preserve individual degrees, and we show how to overcome these difficulties. En route, we extend some existing machinery to more general settings. Specifically, we give proximity generators for Reed-Muller codes, show a more systematic way of handling “side conditions” in IOP constructions, and generalize the compiling procedure of [Arnon, Chiesa, Fenzi, Yogev, Crypto 2024] to general codes."

    "abstract": "We study several problems in the intersection of cryptography and complexity theory based on the following highlevel thesis.1)Obfuscation can serve as a general-purpose worst-case to average-case reduction, reducing the existence of various forms of cryptography to corresponding worst-case assumptions.2)We can therefore hope to overcome barriers in cryptography and average-case complexity by (i) making worstcase hardness assumptions beyond $P \\neq N P$, and (ii) leveraging worst-case hardness reductions, either proved by traditional complexity-theoretic methods or facilitated further by cryptography.Concretely, our results include:•Optimal Hardness. Assuming sub-exponential indistinguishability obfuscation, we give fine-grained worst-case to average case reductions for circuit-SAT. In particular, if finding an NP-witness requires nearly brute-force time in the worst case, then the same is true for some efficiently sampleable distribution. In fact, we show that under these assumptions, there exist families of one-way functions with optimal time-probability security tradeoffs. Under an additional, stronger assumption - the optimal non-deterministic hardness of refuting circuit-SAT - we construct additional cryptographic primitives such as PRGs and public-key encryption that have such optimal timeadvantage security tradeoffs.•Direct Product Hardness. Again assuming iO and optimal non-deterministic hardness of SAT refutation, we show that the “(search) k-fold SAT problem” - the computational task of finding satisfying assignments to k circuit-SAT instances simultaneously - has (optimal) hardness roughly $\\left(T / 2^{n}\\right)^{k}$ for time T algorithms. In fact, we build “optimally secure one-way product functions” (Holmgren-Lombardi, FOCS ‘18), demonstrating that optimal direct product theorems hold for some choice of one-way function family.•Single-Input Correlation Intractability. Assuming either iO or LWE, we show a worst-case to average-case reduction for strong forms of single-input correlation intractability. That is, powerful forms of correlation-intractable hash functions exist provided that a collection of worst-case “correlationfinding” problems are hard.•Non-interactive Proof of Quantumness. Assuming subexponential iO and OWFs, we give a non-interactive proof of quantumness based on the worst-case hardness of the whitebox Simon problem. In particular, this proof of quantumness result does not explicitly assume quantum advantage for an average-case task.To help prove our first two results, we show along the way how to improve the Goldwasser-Sipser “set lower bound” protocol to have communication complexity quadratically smaller in the multiplicative approximation error $\\varepsilon$."

This is true even when the input algebraic circuit has additional structure, for instance, when it is a constant-depth circuit. Indeed, no efficient deterministic algorithms are known even for the seemingly easier problem of factoring sparse polynomials or even the problem of testing the irreducibility of sparse polynomials.In this work, we make progress on these questions: we design a deterministic algorithm that runs in subexponential time, and when given as input a constant-depth algebraic circuit C over the field of rational numbers, it outputs algebraic circuits (of potentially unbounded depth) for all the irreducible factors of C, together with their multiplicities. In particular, we give the first subexponential time deterministic algorithm for factoring sparse polynomials.For our proofs, we rely on a finer understanding of the structure of power series roots of constant-depth circuits and the analysis of the Kabanets-Impagliazzo generator. In particular, we show that the Kabanets-Impagliazzo generator constructed using low-degree hard polynomials (explicitly constructed in the work of Limaye, Srinivasan & Tavenas) preserves not only the non-zeroness of small constant-depth circuits (as shown by Chou, Kumar & Solomon), but also their irreducibility and the irreducibility of their factors."

A rolling window scheme performs online updates of meter data sequences. Topology-Update conflicts are detected by the count of near-zero singular values of the power data matrix. When a conflict is flagged, it is handled via weighted similarity analysis on voltage data and the LVDSA topology is updated according to the inferred cause. If no conflict is detected, principal component analysis (PCA) is used to perform routine topology identification. Leveraging the complementary characteristics of voltage and power data, the method promptly senses conflicts and accurately updates the topology.

These matrices are linearly interpolated to generate a continuous, depth-dependent transformation model. Each pixel's depth is retrieved from the ToF camera and used to evaluate a tailored homography, which maps coordinates between modalities. To handle missing or uncertain depth data, we apply percentile-based outlier removal and edge-aware interpolation. Final alignment is performed via bilinear resampling. The method is scalable to high-resolution input, and achieves precise multimodal overlay even under non-uniform depth conditions."

    "abstract": "In recent years, nursing care has faced severe labor shortages, highlighting the need for robots capable of autonomous navigation and assistance. Accurate self-localization is crucial for autonomous movement; however, existing indoor navigation methods often rely on expensive equipment and suffer from delays caused by intensive processing demands. This paper proposes an autonomous navigation system utilizing a deep learning model that requires only visual input. The proposed method has been implemented on a newly developed omnidirectional mobile assistive robot and its performance has been validated through experimental testing. The results show that the robot could follow its designated path with minimal deviation while providing standing assistance. This approach offers a cost-effective and versatile alternative to conventional indoor navigation systems."

    "abstract": "Driver fatigue is a critical factor contributing to road accidents, particularly for long-haul and heavy vehicle drivers. Extended driving hours on highways can lead to reduced attention, slower reaction times, and microsleep, increasing accident risks. Traditional physiological monitoring methods such as EEG and ECG, while accurate, are expensive and intrusive. Vehicle-based systems like lane departure detection do not directly monitor the driver and are dependent on external conditions. Existing image-based solutions, though promising, often struggle in low-light conditions or require high-end hardware. This study proposes a real-time driver safety system that integrates Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR), Mouth Aspect Ratio (MAR), and Head Posture Analysis to detect drowsiness and fatigue more effectively. The system, implemented on a Raspberry Pi, utilizes a Pi Camera to monitor the driver's eye closure frequency, yawning patterns, and head movements. EAR analysis identifies prolonged eye closure, MAR detects excessive yawning, and head posture analysis determines if the driver's head tilts beyond a safe range, indicating drowsiness or inattentiveness. When fatigue signs exceed predefined thresholds, an alarm is triggered to alert the driver. The system leverages OpenCV, Dlib, and Python for efficient image processing and incorporates IoT functionality for remote monitoring, making it a cost-effective and scalable solution for enhancing road safety."

Preprocessing included resizing, normalization, and splitting of the data to enhance model performance. The model was trained for 30 epochs with the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss. The classification accuracy yielded a total accuracy of 95%, with precision, recall, and F1-scores of more than 0.92 for each class. The confusion matrix revealed minimal cases of misclassification, largely due to morphological similarity between certain types of cells. These outcomes validate that deep learning has the potential to enhance automated classification of blood cells and reduce reliance on human analysis. Future studies can explore ensemble models, large-scale data, and realtime integration in clinical practice to enhance classification accuracy and reliability in cancer diagnosis."

To empirically test the hypothesized effects, we draw on a survey data collected from 76 foresight practitioners. The findings show that SF has no direct impact on Innovation ambidexterity, while KM, DC and POS are mediating variables that jointly account for this relationship. Theoretical contributions and managerial implications along with future research directions are also discussed in this paper."

    "abstract": "The paper considers the problem of improving the quality of acoustic communication between a supply vessel and an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) by ensuring their coordinated movement. An algorithm for controlling the movement of a vessel based on the model-predictive control (MPC) method is proposed. The algorithm generates the trajectory of the vessel, taking into account the predicted movement of the AUV, the dynamic limitations of the vessel and the parameters of the acoustic channel. Unlike approaches aimed only at minimizing the distance, the objective function of the algorithm directly maximizes the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). This allows for comprehensive optimization of key parameters: transmission loss (TL), vessel noise level (NL), and antenna orientation. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed control algorithm, comparative modeling of three strategies was carried out: the developed algorithm; movement behind the AUV; movement along the center of the tacks. The results of numerical modeling demonstrate that the proposed approach provides a higher and more stable quality of communication compared to traditional strategies, minimizing the risks of its interruption during AUV maneuvers."

By appropriately designing the gain function, prior work [1] proposed a DBMC-based system that ensures convergence within a pre-specified time interval. However, this guarantee assumes the absence of disturbances. In this paper, we study the DBMC-based system under disturbances affecting the edge weights. We first establish rigorous error bounds on the resulting state estimates. Building on this analysis, we then propose a practical early termination strategy to prevent potential singularities, specifically, unbounded gain, that may arise in the presence of disturbances, while still ensuring that the shortest paths are correctly identified. Simulations are performed to validate and illustrate the theoretical results."

A mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model is formulated to minimize operational cost while incorporating distributed generation (DG), demand response (DR), and prosumer participation. To improve practicality, a linearized MILP approximation is also implemented for benchmarking computational efficiency. Beyond deterministic optimization, extensive Monte Carlo simulations are conducted to capture uncertainties in upstream prices, DG output, and load demand. Reliability and resilience metrics, including Energy Not Supplied (ENS) and Loss of Load Probability (LOLP), are evaluated to quantify system robustness. Results on the IEEE 33-bus test system show that P2P trading reduces operating costs by 11–16% on average and improves reliability by nearly 45% compared to the baseline. Importantly, the proposed framework not only enhances economic efficiency but also contributes to environmental sustainability by reducing reliance on fossil-fuel-based upstream grids and increasing renewable utilization. These findings confirm practical value of combining EHs with P2P trading for future smart microgrids under uncertainty."

This paper introduces a hierarchical control architecture featuring a Large Language Model (LLM) based planner that autonomously synthesizes geometric safety constraints (exclusion zones) from abstract warnings and uses a \"semantic centroid\" method to translate nuanced motion modifiers into a continuous parameterization of a downstream Model Predictive Controller (MPC). The resulting plan guides a dynamic path planner that reconstructs its navigation graph on-demand to generate consistently safe trajectories for complex multi-robot tasks, including cooperative transport. We validated our framework in a high-fidelity simulator, demonstrating that the system successfully generates paths that maneuver around language-defined hazards, representing a significant step towards creating more intuitive, adaptable, and trustworthy robotic collaborators for human-centric environments."

    "abstract": "This paper addresses channel estimation error (CEE) mitigation in user-centric cell-free (CF) massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) systems under pilot contamination (PC). To suppress the PC, we formulate an optimization problem to minimize the normalized CEE through the joint treatment of the pilot power allocation and the pilot assignment. However, the NP-hard nature of the problem makes finding a global optimal solution computationally infeasible. To tackle this challenge, we decompose the problem into two sub-problems: the fractional programming (FP) technique is employed for pilot power allocation, and a multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) approach is applied for pilot assignment. The RL-based scheme, however, involves iterative action generation and reward computation, leading to significant overhead from repeated information exchanges. To mitigate this issue, we leverage a digital twin (DT) of the CF mMIMO system, utilizing its virtual environment and contextual awareness to optimize CEE reduction with minimal overhead. By employing closed-form expressions, the proposed schemes achieve computational efficiency without reliance on complex numerical solvers. Finally, we solve the original NP-hard problem via the block-coordinate descent and sequential optimization methods. Numerical evaluations demonstrate that the proposed FP-based pilot power allocation scheme improves the 95%-likely spectral efficiency (SE) by up to 15% and reduces the average pilot transmission power by up to 83% compared to existing methods. Furthermore, the pilot assignment scheme enhances the average SE performance by up to 7.4% over state-of-the-art pilot assignment approaches. These results validate the effectiveness of our proposed framework in reducing CEE, leading to enhanced improvement in system performance in the presence of PC."

When quick scoring is prioritized, the system directly returns automatically scored results to answerers without requiring the scorers’ verification. When reliable scoring is required, the system shows the results to scorers for confirmation and correction before being disclosed to the answerers. The system comprises handwriting recognizers using deep neural networks and text-based scorers to determine whether an answer is correct, incorrect, or rejected. Question-specific scoring methods and rules (rubrics) (defined by the scorers) are used to score the answers consistently. To evaluate the system, handwritten answers in the three subjects were collected from at least 50 students for all grades of elementary and junior high schools. Scoring experiments showed that the average human scoring rate (percentage of answers rejected plus those falsely negatively scored and claimed) was under 30%, indicating that approximately 70% of the scorers’ workload could be reduced. The average risk scoring rate (ratio of false positives that may not be reported) was <2%, except for second-grade Japanese, which requires precise character writing. Finally, we conducted feasibility experiments on the entire system, including question distribution, answer capture, automatic scoring, score correction, and score return, with participants expressing satisfaction. This study lays the groundwork for a cycle of collecting handwritten answers and improving automatic scoring in educational contexts."

    "abstract": "Wheat is a staple crop in over 40 countries, with Asia accounting for more than 40% of global cultivation. Long-term mapping of wheat cover is critical for agricultural management and food security. However, existing wheat mapping products face a key limitation in spatiotemporal coverage: they either offer broad spatial coverage for a single or few years, or provide long time series that are confined to specific regions. To address this gap, we propose DeepMapping, a hybrid deep learning framework designed to generate a consistent annual fractional wheat cover product at 250 m resolution from 2001 to 2023 over Asia. Our framework integrates Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformer models to extract complementary spatial and temporal features. It processes multi-resolution data, including 250 m and 500 m MODIS reflectance, alongside GLASS Leaf Area Index and Fractional Vegetation Cover products. The model is trained with fractions derived from the 10 m resolution WorldCereal 2021 map and refined with ancillary information such as coarse-resolution crop products, land cover data, and agricultural statistics to enhance reliability. By learning the relationship between short-term, high-resolution labels and long-term, coarse-resolution MODIS observations, DeepMapping is efficiently used to generates annual wheat fractional cover product over Asia at 250 m from 2001–2023.

We propose DeepMapping, a hybrid deep learning framework, to estimate long-term annual wheat fractional cover at 250 m from MODIS data. DeepMapping integrates Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformer models to extract spatial and temporal features from MODIS data at 250 m and 500 m resolutions and Global LAnd Surface Satellite (GLASS) Leaf Area Index and Fractional Vegetation Coverage products. The DeepMapping is trained using WorldCereal 2021 at 10 m and refined with other ancillary information, such as coarse-resolution crop products, land cover data, and statistics to ensure reliability.

In this work, we are the first to show that power wasters can still be created using only High-Level Synthesis (HLS), which is a standard development flow for cloud FPGAs. We demonstrate HLS-generated power wasters that can inject faults or crash the FPGA by applying overclocking and selected input patterns."

    "abstract": "Transaction fraud detection (TFD) remains a persistent challenge due to extreme class imbalance and the intricate temporal dynamics of user behavior. Conventional data augmentation techniques typically generate isolated samples, failing to preserve the sequential and temporal dependencies essential for modeling fraudulent transaction patterns. To bridge this gap, we introduce BSCGAN, a Behavioral Sequence-aware Conditional Generative Adversarial Network, designed to synthesize realistic and temporally coherent fraudulent transaction sequences under specific class conditions. At the core of BSCGAN is a novel discriminator architecture based on Behavioral Sequence-aware LSTM (BSLSTM), which explicitly models inter-transaction time intervals and employs a dual-memory stream to disentangle long-term behavioral tendencies from short-term anomalies. This enriched temporal representation guides the generator to produce more plausible and context-aware sequences. By conditioning the generative process on class labels, BSCGAN facilitates targeted oversampling of fraudulent behaviors, thereby alleviating class imbalance during model training. Extensive experiments on realworld transaction datasets demonstrate that TFD models trained on BSCGAN-augmented data achieve significant improvements in F1-score and G-mean, validating the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Overall, this work offers an efficient solution for enhancing training data in TFD tasks by synthesizing behaviorally consistent and temporally structured fraudulent sequences."

A hydrodynamic calculation of its propeller was carried out, taking into account the results of load tests of the selected electric thruster drive in accordance with the required thrust of the main propellers. An assessment of the required energy consumption of its battery is given, which ensures the necessary autonomy of using the device for its intended purpose. The dependence of the range of the device on the speed of moving has been revealed, and the presence of an extreme of this dependence has been determined."

    "abstract": "The κ-η regression method presents a significant computational challenge for hyperparameter optimization due to its inherent quadratic time complexity for training, rendering grid search on large datasets prohibitive. This paper investigates sampling strategies as a means to mitigate this complexity. We evaluate the efficacy of performing hyperparameter tuning on a subset (25%) of training data using two distinct methods: uniform random sampling and Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH). Our empirical analysis, conducted across eight UCI regression datasets, demonstrates that both sampling techniques yield substantial reductions in computation time, ranging from 22% to 82%, compared to a full grid search. LSH-based sampling shows consistent performance in estimating the hyperparameters of the algorithm. LSH’s effectiveness stems from its capacity to create a subsample that accurately preserves the data’s local geometry, a crucial feature for distance-based κ-η regression. These results establish LSH-based sampling as a highly efficient and reliable approach for enhancing the κ-η algorithm, providing an attractive trade-off between prediction quality and processing speed."

With the results obtained with the simulation of the LabVIEW software, in figure \"4\" it can be seen that the energy consumption of the submersible pump \"1\" is reduced by 33.4% and the energy consumption of the submersible pump \"2\" by 30%. In the same way, in figure \"5\" it shows us that there is a reduction in operating time in submersible pump \"1\" of 60 hours per month and in submersible pump \"2\" of 90 hours per month, all this is due to the fact that in figure \"6\" it shows us an increase in flow flow from 149 m3/h to 215m3/h in submersible pump \"1\", from 150m3h to 220m3h in the submersible pump \"2\". Concluding that by carrying out the design of the automatic closed-loop control of submersible pumps, there is greater reliability for the operation of the mining unit and performing real-time monitoring of electrical parameters remotely, thus increasing the useful life of the mechanical and electrical components."

The stripe patterns caused by this nonuniformity are sometimes subtle, leading to unavoidable blurring of scene details and structures when using existing image destriping methods to remove stripe noise. This paper proposes a deep network for stripe noise removal in infrared images, incorporating a multi-scale feature extraction mechanism to address the challenge of selectively removing strong and weak stripe patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms several state-of-the-art approaches on publicly available datasets. It achieves better preservation of image textures and edge details while achieving the same level of stripe noise removal, thereby significantly enhancing image quality."

This methodology employs Asymmetrical Voltage-Cancellation Control (AVC) to adjust the phase relationship of the system while simultaneously modulating its output power. Through Fourier analysis, AVC is decomposed into DC bias voltage and fundamental voltage components. The AVC is directly utilized at the inverter terminal to generate DC bias variations. By employing high-permittivity type-II ceramic capacitors, real-time alteration of capacitance values during system operation becomes feasible. Compared to conventional variable capacitance methods, this approach eliminates the need for additional devices, thereby mitigating power losses that may arise from extra power components. Simulation results demonstrate that this method can effectively adjust the phase difference in the system under conditions where coil parameter variations render the system distinctly capacitive, enabling it to operate in Zero Voltage Switching (ZVS) mode."

The framework enables defenders to autonomously switch operational modes—from rescuers (rendezvousing with the target) to interceptors (intercepting the attacker), and vice versa. Using the Games of a Degree approach, we model the interaction within each mode as a linear-quadratic differential game and derive feedback Nash equilibrium strategies. We then adopt a receding horizon approach to enable mode switching and compute the agents’ switching strategies. The framework also accommodates scenarios in which the number of agents changes over the course of the game. We illustrate our results using agents modeled as differential-drive mobile robots."

At the same time, the safety of the AUV and the efficiency of its on-board equipment depend on the accuracy of the AUV movement in the vertical plane. The paper presents a method for synthesizing an adaptive system for generating a program signal for the pitch angle of AUV. This method allows you to form the desired value of the pitch angle to ensure such an angular velocity of the AUV along the pitch angle so that the thruster system can compensate for the negative torque of mutual influence between the AUV degrees of freedom. To do this, based on the equations of AUV motion in the vertical plane and the model of kinematics of the thruster system, the coefficient of conversion of the depth error into the desired pitch angle is calculated. This allows for precise control of the AUV depth during its movement at various speeds. The simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach."

The navigation system of this MSV should ensure not only high-quality of underwater work, but also ensure the safety of the crew. Therefore, it has increased requirements for accuracy and reliability. The core of the MSV's onboard navigation system is an inertial navigation system (INS) with an integrated doppler velocity log (DVL) and custom backup navigation algorithms which reserve coordinate estimation algorithms in case of INS fails. This paper presents the results of field trials of the navigation system conducted in Lake Ladoga at depths of up to 100 meters. The accuracy of both the INS and the backup navigation algorithms was evaluated in various configurations. The obtained navigation error was less than 0.2% of the distance traveled when the DVL was operating in bottom-tracking mode and less than 6.6% when the DVL was operating stably in water-mass layer mode. Emergency failures in the INS operation were identified. These failures, not described in the known literature or operation manuals of the commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) units, confirmed the necessity of developing a backup navigation system."

These conventional approaches were prone to human errors, time-consuming processes, and the risk of proxy attendance, where one individual marks attendance on behalf of another. Additionally, biometric methods like fingerprint scanners, though more secure, faced hygiene concerns, especially during public health crises, and suffered from device wear and tear. This paper presents an intelligent and automated Face Recognition-Based Attendance System leveraging machine learning techniques and Euclidean distance matching for accurate identity verification. In this product the niche feature is QR code scanning. All the registered students will have their name called upon scanning the QR code, followed by their live face verification. Only after both IN and OUT verification the student attendance is recorded by the APP. The system is also developed using a combination of VB.NET, C\\#, Python, and MySQL for back-end integration, with XAMPP used for local server handling and database connectivity. This allows the flexibility to deploy the project as either a web application or mobile application. This, in turn, makes the product economical. Hence, it can be deployed in any sector of society. The integration of multiple platforms along with the machine learning model has led to the accuracy of 92 %. As the model is trained, the accuracy is expected to achieve 100 %. With the existing system having specifications of Intel Core i3 processor, 8GB RAM, and Windows 10 OS, the time required for attendance is 1.42 sec approx. This system aims to eliminate proxy attendance, reduce manual work, and enhance reliability in academic and professional environments."

    "abstract": "The reliability of on-chip interconnects in modern integrated circuits is critically challenged by escalating current densities and Joule heating-induced temperature gradients, which intensify coupled electromigration (EM) and thermomigration (TM) effects, leading to complex stress evolution and potential premature failure. Traditional finite element method (FEM) simulations, though accurate, are computationally prohibitive for large-scale interconnects in Very Large Scale Integration Circuit (VLSI) designs. To address this, we propose a novel two-stage Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) framework for rapid and accurate prediction of coupled EM-TM-induced stress. The first stage uses a data-driven model to predict stress in individual wire segments, while the second stage employs a PINN to ensure atomic flux conservation and stress continuity at junctions of multisegment interconnects. By embedding governing partial differential equations into training, the framework learns the coupling between electrical, thermal, and mechanical phenomena. Experimental results on multisegment interconnects show excellent agreement with COMSOL simulations, with a mean relative error as low as 0.52 % and over 21.8x computational speedup, offering a scalable methodology for reliability analysis in advanced ICs."

Therefore, protecting the copyright of 3DGS models should be a priority. This paper proposes CopyR-3DGS, a method for embedding watermarks in 3DGS rendering. Specifically, we design an optimization algorithm to embed watermark information into the 3DGS model through two-stage training, followed by extracting the watermark using a dedicated extractor.

The presented circuit architecture attains significant voltage amplification through the use of coupled inductors, ensuring effective energy transfer without relying on extremely high duty cycles or large winding ratios. Owing to reduced voltage stress across semiconductor devices and passive components, low-voltage MOSFETs with small RDS (on) can be employed, minimizing conduction losses and improving overall efficiency. Furthermore, the design alleviates diode reverse-recovery issues and recovers leakage inductance energy, thereby enhancing operational performance. The converter is supplied by a single DC input source, and its operating principle, mathematical formulation, and simulation parameters are discussed comprehensively. A performance comparison with other existing high-gain architectures highlights improvements in efficiency and voltage boosting capability. Simulation results demonstrating conversion from 20 V to 180 V in PSCAD/EMTDC, along with experimental verification using a 200 W prototype, confirm the accuracy of analytical predictions and validate the practicality of the proposed converter."

    "abstract": "Thermal infrared imaging has attracted widespread attention in many fields due to the advantages of all-weather imaging and strong penetration. However, existing methods for thermal infrared novel-view synthesis often produce results with coarse details and floating artifacts, primarily caused by physical factors such as atmospheric transmission effects and thermal conduction. These challenges hinder accurate reconstruction of intricate structures and temperature distributions in thermal scenes, limiting the practical utility of previous approaches. To address these limitations, this paper introduces a physics-induced 3D Gaussian splatting method named Thermal3D-GS, the first novel-view synthesis method that relies exclusively on thermal infrared image. Thermal3D-GS begins by modeling atmospheric transmission effects and thermal conduction in three-dimensional media using neural networks. Additionally, considering the sparse features of infrared images, sparse feature priors are designed to improve the reconstruction accuracy of thermal infrared images. Furthermore, to validate the effectiveness of our method, the first large-scale benchmark dataset named Thermal Infrared Novel-view Synthesis Dataset (TI-NSD) is created. This dataset comprises 50 authentic thermal infrared video scenes, covering indoor, outdoor, traffic and UAV(Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) scenarios, with a total of 15,213 frames of thermal infrared image data. In addition, an expanded validation thermal infrared dataset, which includes three high-resolution scenes and five special scenes under varying atmospheric conditions and complex propagation media is constructed to assess generalization performance of the proposed method. Based on this dataset, this paper experimentally verifies the effectiveness of Thermal3D-GS. The results indicate that our method outperforms the baseline method with a 3.19 dB improvement in PSNR and significantly addresses the issues of floaters and indistinct edge features present in the baseline method. The dataset and our code are both publicly available in <uri xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">https://github.com/mzzcdf/Thermal3DGS</uri>."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a controlled-time tracking approach for omnidirectional mobile robots using sliding mode control. Conventional sliding mode control is known for it’s advantageous order-reduction property and the coefficients of the sliding functions are usually chosen from the reduced-order system established on the sliding manifold. However, recent literature reveals that even the full-order system can be used for choosing sliding coefficients even when order-reduction is established. This has been done for planar holonomic systems like marine vehicles, which provides a motivating source for applying similar approaches to control omnidirectional mobile robots given their holonomic kinematics. A sliding mode controller is developed based on an optimal choice of the sliding coefficient using full-order lyapunov matrices. The control design parameters ensure decay of uncertain terms, while ensuring that the error trajectories reach the sliding manifold quickly and maintain smoothness when entering the manifold. The robustness of the closed-loop system is proved via Lyapunov theory. Numerical results support the proposed approach."

    "abstract": "In the present study, the output voltage of a DC-DC boost converter is tuned to a desired value by implementing a PI controller with two loops. To achieve this, the output voltage of the converter together with the inductor current must be available for the controller. Since direct measurement of these variables may not always be possible, an improved intelligent observer based on the PI-type extremum seeking control method is applied. This is to provide the estimation values of the inductor current and the input voltage of the converter. The observer operates online, requires minimum system information, and can reliably estimate these variables using only the measured output voltage. The estimated values are then provided into a double-loop controller which keeps the value of the output voltage at the pre-set value in the presence of input voltage variations. Furthermore, a comparison is made between the results achieved by the applied observer and those achieved by classic extended state observer and a sliding mode observer to demonstrate its superior estimation accuracy and robustness. The simulations are done in MATLAB™ and the results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method during accurately estimating system states under gradual input voltage changes."

To validate its performance, the MPC controller was benchmarked against a conventional hysteresis controller. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves a 13.68% reduction in energy consumption while successfully maintaining the thermal comfort index within the desired range. This is achieved through its high adaptability to dynamic environmental changes, highlighting the potential of predictive control for enhancing energy efficiency and sustainability in modern buildings."

The development and implementation of smart IoT devices, such as the Smart IoT Fruits and Vegetables Dehydrator System, allow users to prolong the shelf life of their produce through dehydration. To assess the performance of the Dehydrator System, a pliability test was used to evaluate the quality of dehydrated fruits and vegetables. Descriptive statistics were employed to interpret the data, and hypothesis testing was conducted to determine whether the calculated critical value rejects or fails to reject the null hypothesis. With a sample size (n) of 50, a significance level of 0.05, and a one-tailed hypothesis, it was found that most of the passed samples had a critical value of 1.645, which is significantly higher than the null hypothesis value of 0.5. Therefore, the number of passed samples is greater than the failed samples, validating the heating capability of the dehydrator and its ability to produce high-quality dehydrated produce."

In this context, integrating the capabilities of hydrogen with the energy hub (EH), as an efficient framework for optimal operation of multi-carrier infrastructures, can pave the way toward sustainability and energy efficiency. Accordingly, this paper employs a hydrogen-integrated energy hub (HIEH) framework, which combines the advantages of EHs in achieving energy efficiency with hydrogen's unique ability to store electrical energy, leading to synergies in efficiency, as well as improved redundancy and reliability. This research proposes a reliability-oriented framework that aims at optimal scheduling and efficient energy management for interconnected HIEHs. Numerical result from the simulation of the proposed model within the IEEE 33-bus test system in the distribution level, including 33 HIEHs, denote the efficiency of the proposed model. Key findings from the simulations of the proposed framework demonstrate significant improvements in reliability, renewable energy curtailment, operational costs, and exported energy to the upstream grid."

    "abstract": "This study presents and experimentally validates an adaptive control method for human-exoskeleton interaction through online adaptation of desired joint trajectories. Leveraging gait phase and human-exoskeleton interaction torque estimators, our approach enables seamless assistance adaptation to varying walking patterns and speeds. Specifically, a pre-trained neural network approximates the exoskeleton's dynamics, enabling real-time interaction torque estimation from kinematic measurements and commanded motor torques alone. These estimates drive a gradient-descent update of the joint reference trajectories, minimizing a cost function that penalizes both interaction torques and trajectory modification, ensuring bounded convergence and stability without user-specific parameter tuning. We compared our adaptive controller with a fixed-trajectory gait-phase-based controller during overground and treadmill walking at three self-selected speeds ranging from 0.4 to 0.8 m/s.

    "abstract": "Data-driven soft sensors have been widely applied to estimating important yet difficult-to-measure quality-relevant variables in industrial processes. The complex industrial data exhibits nonlinearity and dynamics due to changes in operating conditions. Soft sensors developed based on the assumption of identical and independent distributions often struggle to adapt to target domain data with significant distribution discrepancy, which poses a great challenge to traditional soft sensor approaches. Additionally, the dynamic features embedded in the practical industrial processes are of great importance for an accurate soft sensor. Existing soft sensor approaches pay little attention to the combined challenge of distribution discrepancy and dynamic feature transfer, referred to as the dynamic domain adaptation challenge. In this work, we propose a Self-modified Dynamic Domain Adaptation (SDDA) soft sensor approach to solve this problem. We develop a novel sequential optimization framework for dynamic domain adaptation, where the target samples are progressively incorporated and pseudo-labels are iteratively refined to preserve the underlying temporal dependency and enable efficient dynamic feature transfer. Also, we propose a feature alignment with the transfer component analysis (TCA) to avoid potential significant distribution discrepancy and guarantee a stable prediction. We demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method via two real-world industrial cases."

To address this, we propose a novel multimodal spatial-frequency fusion and refinement network (MSFFRN). The framework is designed to holistically capture and fuse multimodal features. It employs a dual-branch architecture that integrates wavelet-based frequency decomposition with CNN-based spatial encoding for complementary feature extraction. Furthermore, a hierarchical fusion strategy using adaptive gating and cross-attention mechanisms dynamically integrates cross-modality and cross-domain information, while a dedicated feature refinement module enhances robustness against environmental distortions and preserves structural feature. Extensive experiments on the Houston 2013 and MUUFL datasets demonstrate that MSFFRN achieves state-of-the-art performance, increasing the overall accuracy (OA) by 2.66% and 1.32% on the respective datasets."

    "abstract": "This paper presents an 8×8 dual circularly polarized (DCP) phased array antenna and an associated analysis framework for achieving high polarization purity during wide-angle, multi-azimuth-plane circularly polarized (CP) beam scanning. First, polarization-incorporated array factors are formulated for 2×2 sequential-rotation (SR) subarrays and extended to large arrays, enabling explicit prediction of the right-handed and left-handed CP radiation patterns. The analysis shows that SR yields ideally pure circular polarization in the main beam direction under the simplifying assumption that, for a fixed elevation angle, the phase of the element RHCP component is invariant with respect to the azimuth angle φ (and analogously for the LHCP component) but inevitably generates cross-polarized (Cross-pol.) lobes in off-boresight directions, whose angular locations depend on the beam steering angle and inter-element spacing, whereas their peak magnitude is fundamentally bounded by the axial ratio (AR) of the array elements. Guided by this analysis, a compact self-phase-shifting DCP element operating at 5.7–5.9 GHz is developed, exhibiting port isolation exceeding 15 dB. An 8×8 DCP phased array composed of 2×2 SR minimum periodic subarrays is then designed, fabricated, and measured. Simulation results show that, during ±60° beam scanning in the φ = 0°, 45°, 90°, and 135° planes, the active VSWR remains below 2.0 within ±45° and below 3.0 within ±60°, while the AR in the main-beam direction is kept below 1.18 dB and Cross-pol. levels in the entire upper hemisphere are at least 15 dB lower than the peak co-polarized gain. Measurements confirm a slight (0.05 GHz) upward shift of the operating band and validate the predicted wide-angle, high-polarization-purity DCP performance."

A targeted calibration method has been proposed to reduce the uneven damping of gyroscopes. This method identifies the parameters of uneven damping online through amplitude control force, and obtains the specific characteristics and data of uneven damping in real time. On this basis, a virtual precession compensation force is constructed based on the identification results, and this compensation force is used to actively counteract the standing wave drift caused by uneven damping, thereby weakening the impact of uneven damping on the gyroscope output. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed calibration method, relevant experiments were conducted. The experimental results show that this calibration method can accurately identify the damping non-uniformity error parameters of the gyroscope, and effectively compensate for the error through virtual precession compensation force, significantly reducing the standing wave drift caused by uneven damping, and ultimately further improving the output accuracy of the hemispherical resonator gyroscope."

Performance is assessed using precision, recall and F1 score across real-world data. Results show that pretraining with synthetic dataset substantially reduces the amount of real data required to achieve high performance, with as little as 10% of real data needed to double the F1 score compared to training on synthetic data alone.

First, in the global field of view, the target area is quickly located through the first template matching. Secondly, perform a second template match after the robotic arm has moved above the target area. Since the simulation cockpit panel contains circular and rectangular keys, different strategies are used to extract the central pixel coordinates based on the differences in their geometric features. After obtaining the two-dimensional (2D) pixel coordinates, convert them to the three-dimensional (3D) operating space coordinate system of the robotic arm via the eye-in-hand calibration transformation matrix and the robotic arm kinematics coordinate conversion chain. Taking the A320 Flight Control Unit (FCU) panel as the experimental object, the results show that when the FCU undergoes a horizontal translation of 50 mm and a rotation of 6° in the horizontal plane, the visual recognition success rate remains above 95%, and the robotic arm operation success rate remains above 93%."

    "abstract": "The cooperative planning of multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (multi-UAV) for multi-target missions has gained increasing attention in recent years. This problem comprises three interdependent subproblems: task allocation, path planning, and cooperative optimization Under multiple constraints, these three subproblems are inherently coupled, influencing the overall effectiveness of the cooperative mission. This paper presents an integrated approach to address these challenges. First, a fair and optimal task allocation strategy is proposed, leveraging a distributed auction mechanism and optimization modeling to achieve balanced task distribution among UAVs. Second, a pruning-bridging-backtracking Dubins path planning framework is developed to facilitate smooth trajectory generation in complex environments with obstacles. Finally, particle swarm optimization (PSO) combined with local search is employed for cooperative path optimization. Simulation results confirm that the proposed method effectively enhances safety and synchronization in multi-UAV multi-target synchronous planning within complex obstacle-laden environments."

    "abstract": "Hands-on-wheel detection plays a critical role in improving safety within Autonomous Driving Systems, as it helps verify the driver’s readiness to retake control when necessary. This becomes especially important in intermediate levels of automation (such as SAE Levels 2 and 3), where the vehicle is not fully autonomous and cannot manage all driving situations. In such cases, timely driver intervention is required to ensure safe operation during transitions between automated and manual control. This paper presents and compares two different methodologies for automatic Hands-on-wheel detection. The first leverages wearable sensors, specifically, wrist-mounted devices to capture motion data, which is then processed using a Long Short-Term Memory neural network for binary classification. To validate the performance of the proposed system, it was compared with a camera-based computer vision system trained with convolutional models to detect hand presence from visual input. Experimental results showed that wearable-based systems provide a viable alternative to vision-based solutions, offering benefits such as enhanced user privacy. These findings position wearable devices as a viable alternative for integration into real-time driver monitoring frameworks."

    "abstract": "Accurate 3D object detection is essential for automated vehicles to navigate safely in complex real-world environments. Bird’s Eye View (BEV) representations, which project multi-sensor data into a top-down spatial format, have emerged as a powerful approach for robust perception. Although BEV-based fusion architectures have demonstrated strong performance through multimodal integration, the effects of sensor occlusions, caused by environmental conditions such as fog, haze, or physical obstructions, on 3D detection accuracy remain underexplored. In this work, we investigate the impact of occlusions on both camera and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) outputs using the BEVFusion architecture, evaluated on the nuScenes dataset. Detection performance is measured using mean Average Precision (mAP) and the nuScenes Detection Score (NDS). Our results show that moderate camera occlusions lead to a 41.3% drop in mAP (from 35.6% to 20.9%) when detection is based only on the camera. On the other hand, LiDAR sharply drops in performance only under heavy occlusion, with mAP falling by 47.3% (from 64.7% to 34.1%), with a severe impact on long-range detection. In fused settings, the effect depends on which sensor is occluded: occluding the camera leads to a minor 4.1% drop (from 68.5% to 65.7%), while occluding LiDAR results in a larger 26.8% drop (to 50.1%), revealing the model’s stronger reliance on LiDAR for the task of 3D object detection. Our results highlight the need for future research into occlusion-aware evaluation methods and improved sensor fusion techniques that can maintain detection accuracy in the presence of partial sensor failure or degradation due to adverse environmental conditions."

This essay talks about the creation and use of adaptable AI systems that are meant to make personalised plans for treating cancer. Machine learning methods, especially deep learning models, are used to handle huge amounts of clinical, genetic, and medical imaging data. By combining different types of data, flexible AI systems can always improve treatment suggestions, making drug regimens, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy more effective. These systems use predictive analytics to guess how the tumour will grow and how well the treatment will work, which lets therapy plans be changed in real time. AI models can also help find signs that can be used to find cancer early and predict how a patient will react to certain treatments, which makes precision medicine better. This flexible framework makes sure that treatment plans don't stay the same, but change as new patient data and clinical insights are added. This makes cancer care very personalized. Incorporating adaptable AI into cancer treatment plans could also help with the problems caused by different types of cancer and treatment resistance. The end goal of this AI-driven way is to help cancer patients live longer, have fewer side effects, and have a better quality of life generally."

These challenges must be recognized and addressed from the front-end phase of DT projects, where early risk identification is critical to project success. In response to the absence of a framework tailored to the unique characteristics of railway DT initiatives, this paper introduces D-TRACK (Digital Transformation RAilway Complexity frameworK) – a structured tool designed to support the early identification of complexity-related risks in railway DT projects. Building on the UK National Audit Office (NAO) Delivery Environment Complexity Analytic (DECA) framework, D-TRACK integrates domain-specific sources and practitioner insights to reflect the distinctive realities of the railway sector. The framework comprises twelve complexity factors organized into four overarching dimensions, each supported by guiding questions that enable a structured and systematic risk identification process. To validate D-TRACK, a serious game (SG)-style workshop was conducted with eleven experts in digitalization and railway operations. The workshop confirmed that D-TRACK effectively met its three core design objectives: railway relevance, digitalization compatibility, and risk identification support. In addition, participant feedback underscored the broader value of SGs – not only as validation tools but also as enablers of team alignment during the formative stages of complex projects."

    "abstract": "Optimal control of hybrid vehicles involving a battery and a combustion engine is necessary for efficient energy management, and this optimal control problem (OCP) can be formulated as a mixed-integer program (MIP). The real-time deployment of MIPs is challenging due to their computational complexity. As the number of integer variables increases, the solution space increases exponentially, requiring computationally expensive methods to solve. Although machine learning-based strategies help reduce computation time, they provide approximate, but not exact, solutions to MIPs and may even involve expensive one-time training, employing heavy computational resources. In this work, a multiparametric (mp) programming framework is used to improve the computation time of an OCP for hybrid vehicles while getting the exact solution; furthermore, the mp-programming framework allows for implementation through low-cost hardware like a chip without needing a computer. In the mp-programming approach, the solution is expressed as a set of piecewise linear functions in terms of the uncertain parameters that change with time. During online calculations, the optimal solution is determined through a point location search procedure. This framework is compared with the state-of-the-art branch-and-bound method in the Gurobi solver and a neural network solver model developed in this work."

In the light of recent successes in applying PINNs for solving high-dimensional differential equations, we develop a PINN to solve the problem of finding trajectories with minimum exposure to a spatiotemporal threat for a vehicle kinematic model. First, we implement PINNs that are trained to solve the BVP for a given pair of initial and final states for a given threat field. Next, we implement a PINN conditioned on the initial state for a given threat field, which eliminates the need for retraining for each initial state.

By measuring the vibrations transmitted through the fingernail, estimation of finger contact information can be achieved, without covering the finger pad. Since the vibration of the finger induced by the eccentric motor changes when it contacts an object, it can be used to estimate contact details. This paper examines whether the proposed method can simultaneously estimate the contact force and the orientation of an object’s edge. Experimental findings indicated that the edge orientation could be estimated at 74.05% accuracy, while the contact force could be estimated at 59.29% accuracy, with especially high performance when using angular velocity data compared to other data sets. Moreover, increasing the contact force improved edge orientation accuracy, reaching nearly 90% at 300 g or more."

    "abstract": "Vortex electromagnetic wave (VEMW) radar, leveraging orbital angular momentum (OAM) modes for azimuthal information encoding, has emerged as a promising technology for high-resolution staring imaging. However, its performance is fundamentally constrained by the Bessel function modulation (BFM) effect and limited OAM mode availability, leading to azimuth-range coupling artifacts and energy inefficiency. Existing compressive sensing (CS) methods, particularly conventional sparse recovery techniques, struggle with sidelobe interference, noise sensitivity, and computational bottlenecks. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an efficient two-dimensional sparse learning via iterative minimization (2D-SLIM) framework, integrating physics-driven preprocessing with accelerated optimization. First, we establish a comprehensive VEMW radar signal model that explicitly incorporates BFM effects and OAM mode orthogonality. Second, building upon the beam steering strategy, we introduce an explicit analytical compensation factor to suppress the azimuth dependent energy attenuation caused by the squared Bessel term, thereby restoring the Fourier duality between azimuth angles and OAM mode indices. Third, we develop a dimensionally consistent 2D conjugate gradient least squares (2D-CGLS) algorithm, incorporating adaptive Barzilai-Borwein step sizes and non-convex group sparsity regularization. By leveraging Kronecker product factorization and matrix-form operations, the framework eliminates redundant vector-to-matrix conversions. Extensive numerical and EM simulations demonstrate that the proposed method achieves an improvement of more than 20% in image correlation value and a convergence rate more than 30% faster, while maintaining robust imaging performance under challenging conditions of limited OAM modes (e.g., | | 20 α ≤) and low SNR (down to -5 dB), outperforming several established CS techniques."

Over the past few years, the adoption of deep learning approaches, particularly convolutional neural network (CNN) and transformer-based architectures have significantly advanced performance in this field. While these models effectively capture spectral-spatial features, they may also introduce redundant or irrelevant spatial information, potentially degrading the accuracy of HSI CD. To address this challenge, a center-pixel and gated mechanism-based attention network (CGMNet) is proposed for HSI CD, leveraging the central pixel’s significance to enhance accuracy and robustness. First, a gated-based center spatial attention (GCSA) module is designed to emphasize spatial relationships surrounding the central pixel. By incorporating gating mechanisms, GCSA selectively enhances relevant spatial features while suppressing irrelevant information. Second, a gated-based spectral attention (GSA) module is proposed to dynamically highlight the most significant spectral features, ensuring an effective spectral representation. Finally, a global transform fusion (GTF) module is proposed to capture global contextual information and to fuse it with the extracted spatial and spectral features. Moreover, we introduce a novel benchmark dataset, named the Hangzhou Bay (HZB), specifically designed to advance coastal remote sensing research. Experimental evaluations conducted on three publicly available datasets, as well as the HZB dataset, show that our CGMNet consistently outperforms some state-of-the-art methods in the HSI CD task.

Prior works have only shown weaker average-case hardness results that do not imply sampling hardness. Proving these conjectures has become a central question in quantum complexity. In this work, we show that $e^{-n \\log n-n-O\\left(n^{\\delta}\\right)}$ additive-error estimates to output probabilities of most random BosonSampling experiments are #P-hard for any $\\delta\\gt 0$, exponentially improving on prior work. In the process, we circumvent all known barrier results for proving PGC. The remaining hurdle to prove PGC is now “merely” to show that the $O\\left(n^{\\delta}\\right)$ in the exponent can be improved to $O(\\log n)$. We also obtain an analogous result for Random Circuit Sampling. We then show, for the first time, a hardness of average-case classical sampling result for BosonSampling, under an anticoncentration conjecture. Specifically, we prove the impossibility of multiplicative-error sampling from random BosonSampling experiments with probability $1-2^{-\\tilde{O}\\left(N^{1 / 3}\\right)}$ for input size N, unless the Polynomial Hierarchy collapses. This exponentially improves upon the state-of-the-art. To do this, we introduce new proof techniques which tolerate exponential loss in the worst-to-average-case reduction. This opens the possibility to show the hardness of average-case sampling without ever proving PGC."

    "abstract": "We establish new algorithmic guarantees with matching hardness results for coloring and independent set problems in one-sided expanders and related classes of graphs. For example, given a 3-colorable regular one-sided expander, we compute in polynomial time either an independent set of relative size at least $\\frac{1}{2}-o(1)$ or a proper 3-coloring for all but an $o(1)$ fraction of the vertices, where $o(1)$ stands for a function that tends to 0 with the second largest eigenvalue of the normalized adjacency matrix. This result improves on recent seminal work of Bafna, Hsieh, and Kothari (STOC 2025) developing an algorithm that efficiently finds independent sets of relative size at least 0.01 in such graphs. We also obtain an efficient 1.6667-factor approximation algorithm for VERTEX COVER in sufficiently strong regular one-sided expanders, improving over a previous $(2-\\varepsilon)$-factor approximation in such graphs for an unspecified constant $\\varepsilon\\gt 0$. We propose a new stratification of k-COLORING in terms of k-by- k matrices akin to predicate sets for constraint satisfaction problems. We prove that whenever this matrix has repeated rows, the corresponding coloring problem is NP-hard for one-sided expanders under the Unique Games Conjecture. On the other hand, if this matrix has no repeated rows, our algorithms can solve the corresponding coloring problem on one-sided expanders in polynomial time. When this k-by- k matrix has repeated rows, we furthermore characterize the maximum fraction of vertices on which a proper k-coloring can be found by polynomial-time algorithms under the Unique Games Conjecture. As starting point for our algorithmic results, we show a property of graph spectra that, to the best of our knowledge, has not been observed before: The number of negative eigenvalues smaller than $-\\tau$ is at most $O\\left(1 / \\tau^{2}\\right)$ times the number of eigenvalues larger than $\\tau^{2} / 2$. While this result allows us to bound the number of eigenvalues bounded away from 0 in one-sided spectral expanders, this property alone is insufficient for our algorithmic results. For example, given a one-sided regular expander with a balanced 3 -coloring, we can efficiently find a 3 -coloring for all but a $o(1)$ fraction of vertices. At the same time, if we only know that the graph has a balanced 3 -coloring and a bounded number of significant eigenvalues, it is NP-hard under the Unique Games Conjecture to find a 3 -coloring for all but a 0.1 fraction of vertices."

The early detection and management of these threats are critical to minimizing yield losses and ensuring sustainability.

In this paper, we construct the first known quantum codes with linear dimension and distance supporting transversal non-Clifford gates that have sublinear locality (i.e. parity-check weight). Specifically, we construct codes with transversal CCZ gates that have dimension and distance growing linearly in the block length, and have locality growing as the square root of the block length. We furthermore design an efficient decoding algorithm for these codes. The alphabet size of these codes grows as the square root of the block length, but it can be reduced to a constant (e.g. binary) while incurring a polylogarithmic loss in other parameters. We also show how to decrease the locality to the cube root of the block length, albeit with a larger alphabet size and slightly lower distance.We construct these codes as products of classical codes with appropriate algebraic structure. While our quantum codes are subsystem codes with non-commuting gauge operators, we show they nevertheless permit error correction from noisy syndrome measurements.As byproducts, we prove multiple technical results of independent interest. In particular, our efficient decoder can be viewed as a new multivariate generalization of Prony’s method for reconstructing a function from partial access to its Fourier transform. Meanwhile, our distance analysis involves new connections to the classical study of maximally recoverable codes. Our results on product codes also resolve a conjecture of Bravyi & Hastings (2014) in the large-alphabet regime, by providing a new construction of quantum codes with linear dimension and distance and small polynomial locality."

    "abstract": "The Voxel-based point cloud neural networks (PNNs) have demonstrated exceptional accuracy across various 3D point cloud tasks. However, the practical deployment of Voxel-based PNNs on resource-constrained edge devices faces significant challenges, primarily stemming from two memory-access intensive operations: the map search operation and the sparse 3D convolution (Spconv3D) operation. Specifically, three key challenges remain to be addressed, including: (1) the extensive sequential coordinate comparisons and irregular off-chip memory access patterns generated by map search operation; (2) the considerable data movement requirements associated with data-intensive convolution operation; (3) significant workload imbalance resulting from point cloud sparsity and irregularity. <p xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">In this paper, we propose Voxel-PIM, an efficient SRAM-based accelerator for Voxel-based PNNs that leverages in-memory search and compute techniques. The Voxel-PIM architecture primarily contains two Processing-in-Memory (PIM) cores: a Content-Addressable Memory (CAM)-based Search Core and a Compute-in-Memory (CIM)-based Computing Core. For the CAM core, we propose the KD-Tree-based Partitioning and Searching (KDPS) strategy, which activates only a fraction of the array and reduces search energy consumption during search operation. For the CIM array, we introduce a novel submatrices mapping method to flexibly support both Spconv3D and Conv2D operations. Furthermore, we propose a Weight Workload Balanced (W2B) method to mitigate computational imbalance. The hardware performance of Voxel-PIM is estimated for a 22nm technology. The simulation results demonstrate that Voxel-PIM achieves averagely 1.53~7.26× higher energy efficiency, 1.03~2.98× speed up in detection task, and 1.4~11.4× speed up in segmentation task compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) point cloud accelerators and general-purpose processors.</p>"

The dual-axis tilt mechanism significantly improves vehicle maneuverability and control authority compared to conventional birotor configurations. Taking advantage of the additional degrees of actuation offered by these tilting rotors, the UAV can independently control both its position and orientation. However, the coupling between rotor speeds and tilt angles introduces nonlinearities in the mapping between control inputs and the resulting forces and moments. To address this, a constant control allocation matrix is employed to approximately map the desired force and torque commands to actuator inputs. To compensate for the mismatch between the actual and assumed control allocation, a robust backstepping control architecture is developed, ensuring system stability and tracking performance in the presence of bounded unmodeled dynamics. Numerical simulations are performed to validate the proposed control strategy in various flight scenarios, including setpoint and trajectory tracking."

However, comprehensive IHC analysis is frequently limited by insufficient tissue quantities in small biopsies. Therefore, virtual multiplex staining emerges as an innovative solution to digitally transform H&E images into multiple IHC representations, yet current methods still face three critical challenges: (1) inadequate semantic guidance for multi-staining, (2) inconsistent distribution of immunochemistry staining, and (3) spatial misalignment across different stain modalities. To overcome these limitations, we present a prompt-guided framework for virtual multiplex IHC staining using only uniplex training data (PGVMS). Our framework introduces three key innovations corresponding to each challenge: First, an adaptive prompt guidance mechanism employing a pathological visual language model dynamically adjusts staining prompts to resolve semantic guidance limitations (Challenge 1). Second, our protein-aware learning strategy (PALS) maintains precise protein expression patterns by direct quantification and constraint of protein distributions (Challenge 2). Third, the prototype-consistent learning strategy (PCLS) establishes cross-image semantic interaction to correct spatial misalignments (Challenge 3). Evaluated on two benchmark datasets, PGVMS demonstrates superior performance in pathological consistency. In general, PGVMS represents a paradigm shift from dedicated single-task models toward unified virtual staining systems."

Complex background patterns in scanning electron microscope (SEM) images and diverse defect textures pose significant challenges. Traditional methods usually suffer from insufficient data, labels, and poor transferability. In this paper, we propose a novel zero-/few-shot learning approach, SEM-CLIP 2.0, based on our SEM-CLIP framework [1], for accurate defect classification and segmentation. By leveraging learnable text prompts, SEM-CLIP 2.0 fully utilizes large-scale external data sources to facilitate robust cross-domain knowledge transfer. It also customizes the Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) model to better focus on defect areas and minimize background distractions, thereby enhancing segmentation accuracy. Furthermore, our approach employs discriminative feature learning for open-set classification, facilitating more effective defect classification and enabling the detection of unknown defect categories. By alleviating the need for manual prompt engineering and extensive data annotation, SEM-CLIP 2.0 significantly reduces labor costs. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves impressive classification and segmentation results under zero-/few-shot learning scenarios."

    "abstract": "Non-Earth imaging (NEI) of resident space objects (RSO) has become more readily available recently due to an expanding commercial sector focusing specifically on the the NEI task, as well as high spatial resolution Earth imaging systems being agile enough to collect NEI targets. Imaging of RSOs is an important capability aiding those in the Space Domain Awareness (SDA) community in assessing satellite health, classification and understanding of debris objects, as well as determination of RSO capability beyond what might be available in the public domain. In addition to deliberate tasking and pointing of NEI and Earth imaging satellites to image other RSOs, it is common for RSOs to serendipitously traverse through the field of view of Earth viewing satellites such as NASA's Landsat 8 and 9. The exponential growth of objects in low Earth orbit presents a unique opportunity to advance the field of Space Domain Awareness by harnessing this serendipitous collection of spectral RSO signatures embedded in existing image data. Since the relative motion of the RSO is drastically different from the motion of the Earth, the RSO's appearance in the traditionally formed image product is almost always indecipherable. We present a novel approach to determining when RSO underflights occur for nadir viewing platforms such as Landsat 8 and 9, calculation of the RSO's apparent velocity in the viewing platform's object space, as well as a simple approach to resample the uncorrected sensor image data specifically for a particular underflight scenario. Although the concept of orbiting space objects caught within existing Earth image data has been presented by some in social media posts, this is the first work to present a clear methodology for predicting when they happen, where they happen, and how to resample the raw image data for a more exploitable RSO image to aid the data starved SDA community. This work also demonstrates the increasing frequency of such underflight events captured by the Landsat Operational Land Imager instrument, increasing from about 0.77 underflights events captured per day between 2013-2016 to an estimated 242 events per day in April of 2025."

As load unbalance is commonly seen in distribution grids, negative-sequence (NS) currents from the unbalanced load need to be provided by GFM sources. With different source combinations, the NS current sharing among GFM sources can be significantly different. An inappropriate NS current distribution may decrease the source's energy usage efficiency or cause malfunction of the sources. Therefore, analyzing the NS current distribution among different sources is critical for system planning, which is lacking in the existing literature. In this paper, a comprehensive analysis of NS current distribution among different GFM sources is conducted, considering different GFM source types. An analysis method is proposed to compare different distribution conditions, and source selection guidelines are proposed. The analyses are first verified through simulation and then experimentally demonstrated on a converter-based hardware testbed."

The implementation consists of three steps preprocessing, feature extraction, classification. When recovering images based on content, extraction highlighting is an amazing test task. In this article, the highlights of a histogram, a local binary pattern to highlight surface components, and an ordered slope histogram to highlight inclusions in a shape. The machine classifier of the reinforcement vector is used for grouping. Research results show that a combination of each of the three key points is superior to a single element or a combination of two-component recovery methods."

    "abstract": "Recent advances in end-to-end autonomous driving (E2E AD) often rely on direct expert trajectory imitation to train planners. While promising, these methods are susceptible to biases and compounding errors, which can compromise safety and road compliance. Inverse Optimal Control (IOC) has the potential to guide the planner and mitigate trajectory biases by inferring the underlying expert behavior as a planning cost. However, existing IOC approaches in E2E AD face significant limitations: expert behavior is modeled using manually designed cost terms or spatially discrete cost-maps, which may not accurately capture expert reasoning, or through high-dimensional neural networks to score trajectory proposals, restricting planners to candidate-based approaches. To address these limitations, we propose Neural Parametric Planning Cost (NPPC), an IOCbased approach that represents expert behavior through a lowdimensional, spatially continuous parametric cost function. NPPC effectively captures expert-like evaluation of the current driving scene without manual engineering or discretizations. Moreover, NPPC's low-dimensional representation enables direct optimization for planning, allowing maneuver generation beyond the predefined trajectory candidates across diverse driving scenarios. NPPC achieves superior performance over the previous state of the art in vision-based E2E AD, reducing the average collision and curb collision rates by 5.7% and 9.8%, respectively, in the open-loop evaluation and improving the driving score by 3.5% in the closed-loop evaluation."

    "abstract": "We are interested in the mobile target state detection (TSD) based on multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) orthogonal-frequency-division-multiplexing (OFDM) communication signals. Yet, communication-based TSD is of challenge, due to complex problem structures and communication symbol randomness. To address this challenge, we exploit structured features of low-speed and narrow-band systems to decouple the target state parameters and random communication symbols, and then use coherent detection to equalize random symbols. As such, a simplified sensing model holding an explicit space-time-frequency-domain correlation structure with respect to target direction angle, radial speed and relative distance, respectively, is obtained. Then, an efficient MIMO OFDM waveform-based TSD method extracting space-time-frequency correlation features is devised. It is verified by simulations that the proposed TSD method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, due to the above problem-specific algorithm design. In addition, we establish the closed-form boundaries of the maximum detectable speed and maximum detectable range for MIMO OFDM-based TSD, which are essentially subject to the limited coherent time and bandwidth, respectively. The impact of system parameters (e.g., signal bandwidth, subcarrier spacing and carrier frequency) on the detection capability boundaries is analysed to gain insights into the fundamental limits of MIMO OFDM communication-based TSD. This work does not only build a technical foundation for sensing-assisted communication design, but also provide a unified framework for understanding the potentials of MIMO OFDM communication-based sensing."

    "abstract": "This paper investigates an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) network operating over millimeter-wave and sub-Terahertz bands, where a base station serves downlink communication users (CUs), while simultaneously sensing targets. First, we propose a novel hybrid beamforming structure that reduces power consumption in high-frequency bands by using a low number of phase shifters for analog beamforming and enhances spatial diversity in baseband beamforming through improper Gaussian signaling (IGS), addressing the limitations of having only a few radio frequency chains by boosting the number of supported data streams. Together, these techniques establish a new phased-MIMO radar structure and an energy-efficient signaling strategy designed for joint sensing and communication. Second, we formulate a new beampattern-optimization objective that enables computationally efficient algorithms, which iteratively update the hybrid beamformers through closed-form expressions. This design ensures tight mainlobe concentration for sensing while simultaneously serving multiple CUs. A new soft-min function, paired with a closed-form algorithm, secures both strong worst-rate and sum-rate performance. By unifying sensing and communication objectives, the proposed framework offers a well-balanced trade-off between high CU rates and high-quality sensing beampatterns, while maintaining computational complexity scalable. Simulation results validate the practicality of the proposed approach."

    "abstract": "Autonomous path planning and collision avoidance (CA) in complex maritime environments are critical challenges for Maritime Autonomous Surface Ships (MASSs). This paper presents a novel hierarchical motion planning framework that integrates global and local path planning algorithms. For global path planning in static obstacle environments, a hybrid approach combining A*, Bezier curves, and particle swarm optimization (PSO) is proposed to enhance path search efficiency and ensure smooth trajectory optimization. For local path planning and collision avoidance with dynamic vessels, a multi-ship CA algorithm based on velocity prediction potential fields is introduced. A new collision-risk identification model is developed to ensure compliance with COLREGS and enable collaborative CA in complex multi-ship scenarios. The framework also addresses environments with both dynamic and static obstacles through a dynamic path planner that integrates global and local planning. A key innovation is the dynamic CA decision-making mechanism with alteration of course and/or speed (ACS), which provides robust real-time navigation strategies. Validation through simulations, real-ship model tests, and AIS-data analysis demonstrates the framework’s robustness and adaptability for MASS navigation. Compared to existing methods, the proposed approach significantly reduces collision-avoidance path length while maintaining safety, real-time performance, and COLREGS compliance. This work advances autonomous maritime navigation by addressing complex scenarios with a unified framework that balances efficiency, safety, and regulatory adherence."

However, existing active covert channels in IoT are constrained by the low computational power and limited storage of IoT terminal devices, making them unsuitable for complex steganographic algorithms. Moreover, the active covert channel is more vulnerable to targeted detection and blocking by traffic analysis. To address these challenges, this study proposes a passive network storage covert channel (PNSCC) that leverages intermediate IoT nodes. We also present solutions for synchronization and reversible data hiding within the PNSCC. A covert channel kernel module was designed and deployed on smart routers running the OpenWrt system, followed by experimental testing. The results indicate that the PNSCC achieves a relatively high capacity, with a covert data transmission rate of approximately 88.97 bps in real-world network environments. Additionally, it has minimal impact on actual network performance and exhibits resilience against traffic analysis."

    "abstract": "Generally, legal documents are often skimmed by many individuals because the lengthy content with dense legal jargon makes them complex and inaccessible. Many users usually bypass such texts without reading and risk their privacy. Summarizing text with key words and phrases makes it easier to understand the overall scenario by reading only the essential information. This research accomplishes it by making use of NLP and Machine Learning with algorithms such as PEGASUS and BERT, which provide extractive and abstractive summarization, emphasizing context understanding and content prioritization according to importance. Our new approach integrates Legal-BERT for classifying phrases into different categories, while graphical visualization of the results using Python libraries such as Matplotlib makes the information easier to absorb. Multilingual support using models like mBERT addresses the needs of a global audience. By classifying, prioritizing, visualizing, and summarizing the text, our research helps users make informed and confident decisions, especially for online services or platforms. Unlike prior studies that address summarization or classification in isolation, our framework uniquely integrates abstractive and extractive summarization, clause classification, multilingual processing, risk scoring, and visualization into a unified system. Preliminary evaluation on sample legal documents shows encouraging results, with competitive ROUGE and BLEU scores and improved comprehension in user feedback, making the system a practical step toward enhancing transparency, accessibility, and trust in legal agreements."

By harnessing the power of RL algorithms— DQN, PPO, and A2C— our approach demonstrates its value compared to conventional stock price analysis methods that require manual, rigorous analytics. Operating on historical stock data from 2021 to 2025, combined with the robust features created during the feature engineering phase, we demonstrate that this methodology performs well in both return maximization and risk management."

This study proposes a machine learning-based approach that integrates AI camera-detected behavioral events, demographic and occupational characteristics to predict fatigue-related performance degradation. Data were collected over 300 days from 85 truck drivers. Their performance was labelled into three classes: Normal, Reduced, and High-Risk Capability, based on predefined deviation in driving responses. Three data conditions were examined: system-detected, weighted, and verified events. A total of 43 machine learning algorithms with default settings were used for multi-class classification across various timeframe (15, 30, 45 and 60 minutes) before performance deviation occurred. Results showed that demographic and work-related factors improved accuracy in all conditions. The best performance (over 80%) was achieved under the verified-event condition with a 15-minute timeframe, indicating the benefit of short-timeframe monitoring for early fatigue detection. Feature importance analysis identified yawning and continuous driving as primary behavioral indicators, while age, driving experience, shift, and to a lesser extent, habitual alcohol consumption were key demographic and occupational factors associated with fatigue-induced capability reduction. These findings demonstrate the value of integrating validated event data, driver characteristics, and monitoring time window for effective fatigue risk assessment in transport operations."

    "abstract": "Communication protocol is a fundamental component of modern networking. With proliferation of networking and communication, users have become more concerned about privacy. This leads to development of end-to-end encrypted messaging systems which provides confidential communication. Besides confidentiality, there is an increasing demand for additional security properties such as unforgeability, anonymity, off-the-record (OTR), and consistency. However, efficiently achieving these properties simultaneously, especially on resource-constrained mobile devices, remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose MERIT, a novel multi-designated receiver authenticated broadcast encryption scheme that satisfies all the above security guarantees in a highly efficient manner. MERIT ensures the following key properties: (i) unforgeability prevents unauthorized parties from generating valid messages; (ii) privacy safeguards the messages and identities of the sender and receivers from non-designated parties; (iii) OTR ensures that receivers cannot later prove the origin of the messages even with their secret keys; and (iv) consistency ensures that all designated receivers obtain identical decrypted messages and identities. The core building block of MERIT is a practical multi-designated verifier signature (PMDVS), which might be of independent interest. We employed a novel batched cut-and-choose technology to prove that the ciphertext is well-formed. This results in an order-of-magnitude efficiency improvement in our scheme compared to its counterparts that rely on general-purpose zero-knowledge proofs. We then show how MERIT leverages PMDVS to provide unforgeability, privacy, OTR, and consistency in the scenario of group messaging. We provide security analysis to demonstrate that MERIT satisfies these security guarantees. We also conduct a thorough performance implementation, and the experimental results demonstrate that MERIT is highly efficient for deployment on mobile devices."

It uses dual-path feature encoding. By fusing the encoded Mask features from UNet and the features of the input images, the model provides image semantic support for accurate text generation. A collaborative loss function is proposed, which weights the cross-entropy losses of UNet, BLIP model, and real labels. Experimental results show that the proposed model has better performance in terms of CIDEr and SPICE, such as BLIP2 and LLaVA. The CIDEr is 123.7, which is 2.7 to 5.4 times higher than other models. The SPICE is 18.9, which is 2.7 to 5.4 times higher than other models. It can accurately identify elevator parts (such as drive motors) and generate professional descriptions.

The paper proposes an online reinforcement learning-based control strategy for adaptive voltage support of GFMCs. A state–action–reward–state–action agent dynamically adjusts the proportional-integral coefficients of the outer reactive power control loop of supervisory layer to regulate the PCC voltage via reactive power injection. The controller is model-free and learns an optimal policy in real-time, balancing voltage regulation with operational constraints such as inverter current limits.

Traditional manual survey methods face limitations such as low efficiency and high costs, while existing deep learning approaches for land cover segmentation in remote sensing imagery encounter two major challenges: firstly, insufficient model generalization capability due to geographical, meteorological, and sensor variations; secondly, the inability of conventional pixel-level segmentation results to directly generate the vector data required for engineering design.To tackle these issues, this paper proposes a deep domain adaptation method for remote sensing image-based land cover classification. The approach begins by employing a style-transfer network to reduce apparent disparities between source and target domains at the pixel level. Subsequently, a dual-branch semantic segmentation architecture is utilized to achieve domain adaptation at the feature level, significantly enhancing the model's generalization capacity in new geographical regions. Addressing engineering application needs, an innovative land cover vectorization module has been developed to enable direct conversion from pixel-level segmentation to georeferenced contours.Validation tests conducted on a proprietary dataset demonstrate that the proposed two-stage domain adaptation mechanism – integrating style transfer and feature alignment – effectively mitigates performance degradation caused by weather, seasonal, and regional factors. This method successfully resolves the dual challenges of cross-domain generalization and engineering applicability, providing reliable technical support for the digital design of power transmission and transformation projects."

This paper proposes a PT-CPT architecture based on parity-time (PT) symmetry theory, clearly defining the coupling mechanisms of plate misalignment, capacitance perturbation, and frequency drift. This paper optimally selects the push-pull inverter and bilateral LC compensation topology. The mechanisms of system detuning and frequency splitting are analyzed, and the conditions and efficiency expressions for the bilateral LC compensated PT-CPT system under PT symmetry are derived, verifying that the system can achieve constant power and constant efficiency output in a PT-symmetric state. The overall design of the PT-CPT scheme is completed. Additionally, LTspice circuit simulations validate the effectiveness of the theoretical model, The system is capable of maintaining a stable output voltage when the resistance changes from 20 to 100 ohms and the coupling coefficient varies from 200 to 1200. The research results provide new theoretical foundations and technological pathways for the design of high parameter tolerance CPT systems."

    "abstract": "This work investigates the dynamic coupling relationship between carbon emissions and economic growth in the power sector from 2000 to 2022, with a focus on its evolutionary characteristics and driving factors. A decoupling index model is constructed by integrating the Tapio elasticity approach and the OECD decoupling index, through which the decoupling states of carbon emissions and economic growth are examined. Furthermore, the Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index decomposition method is employed to identify the major determinants of carbon emissions. The results reveal that the relationship between carbon emissions and economic growth in the power sector is complex and has shifted across different states, including expansion negative decoupling, strong decoupling, expansion coupling, and weak decoupling. Specifically, population growth and economic development are the dominant forces driving the increase in carbon emissions, while improvements in energy intensity and energy structure partially mitigate this effect. These findings provide policy implications for achieving carbon peaking and carbon neutrality targets, such as optimizing the energy mix, enhancing energy efficiency, and strengthening environmental regulations."

    "abstract": "Electronic devices exposed to complex electromagnetic environments can fail at specific frequencies. Early, frequency-selective detection of such “weak spots” is therefore desirable, whereas time-domain field probes provide only broadband indications and may over-trigger. This article presents a frequency-selective detector based on software-defined radio with field-programmable gate array acceleration, which transforms time-domain samples into spectra with reduced latency. The study focuses on narrowband burst electromagnetic disturbances and develops closed-form expressions for the probability of detection as a function of front-end bandwidth, frequency span, dwell time, hopping time, frequency resolution, and disturbance duration. The analysis is corroborated by Monte Carlo simulation and conducted measurements across 70 MHz–6 GHz. Results reveal how design choices and hardware latencies bound the attainable detection probability and delineate the hopping-limited regime. This article concludes with practical boundary conditions and design guidelines to maximize detection performance under resource constraints, offering a configurable alternative where high-end real-time analysers are impractical."

A key challenge lies in the computational and energy costs of monolithic end-to-end deep learning models, which often exceed the capabilities of Internet of Things (IoT) devices. We argue for a hardware-aware, modular design that integrates efficient deep models for well-defined perceptual tasks (e.g., face detection) with physiology-grounded algorithms for sensitive, data-scarce inferences such as affective state. As a case study, we implemented a lightweight pipeline for depression detection using remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) and traditional regression, comparing it to a monolithic deep learning baseline on embedded hardware. The lightweight pipeline maintains 30 frames per second and more than doubles the battery life, while the deep learning model did not meet real-time constraints, highlighting the practical advantage of a modular sustainable design. Beyond efficiency, this approach enhances trustworthiness and privacy by enabling transparent signal processing and reducing the need to transmit raw video. We conclude with design principles grounded in human-centered and value-sensitive perspectives, emphasizing interpretability, modularity, and energy efficiency for scalable and privacy-preserving physiological monitoring on the edge."

A constant control allocation matrix is used to map the desired control forces and moments to actuator inputs.

Our cross-scale analysis characterizes feasibility and the inherent quality-latency trade-offs of language models operating at the edge, and suggests that stronger structural cues in prompts can improve plan stability."

Firstly, the optimal load offset results of LCC-LCC and SS compensation topologies caused by the active bridge loss model are analyzed. Using topology switching, a method is proposed to achieve gain measurement without the need for primary and secondary communication measurement systems using dual active bridges, which can identify mutual inductance and coil internal resistance in a symmetrical parameter structure. Experiments have shown that the optimal load after considering the active bridge loss model is closer to the actual measured optimal load. Compared with traditional methods, the optimal load error is reduced by 28.8%, and the maximum efficiency is improved by about 1.5%. And it can achieve maximum efficiency tracking and constant voltage output when the load changes."

    "abstract": "The rapid development of distributed energy systems and smart grids has led to the large-scale deployment and heterogenization of terminal devices, increasing the vulnerability of power systems to user-level software failures, network anomalies, and cross-layer cascading faults. Considering that existing evaluation methods fail to simultaneously simulate multi-layer and multi-type anomalies while quantifying terminal resilience, this paper proposes a resilience evaluation method based on hierarchical combined fault injection. The proposed method constructs a multi-layer injection framework covering the hardware, system, and application layers, and designs a two-level indicator system composed of diagnostic accuracy (DA), detection delay (DD), resource overhead (RO), service recovery time (SRT), and resilience index (RI). Single and combined fault injection experiments are conducted on Raspberry Pi, x86-based industrial PCs, and QEMU virtual nodes. The results show that SRT, DD, and RO are key factors influencing RI; resilience significantly decreases under combined fault scenarios, and resource-constrained terminals exhibit the highest vulnerability during cascading failures. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in characterizing complex fault response and recovery behaviors of heterogeneous terminals, providing a quantitative basis for terminal selection and resilience optimization strategies."

For this reason, research in this field is increasingly expanding, with the target of developing technologies able to combine improved performance with reduced environmental impact. This paper explores the challenging application of Machine Learning (ML) techniques for estimating the battery State of Charge (SoC) without relying on the electrical input data, typically required by classical model-based approaches. Following the set-up and optimization phases of ML models being able to associate vehicle speed to battery SoC, discharging profiles were extrapolated and analyzed to estimate the Remaining Useful Life (RUL). The proposed ML models achieved accurate results, with performance comparable to a traditional observer, despite relying on fewer and simpler variables. These results highlight the potentialities of data-driven approaches for realizing a scalable and easier battery monitoring."

    "abstract": "Ensuring safety is the primary objective of automated driving, which necessitates a comprehensive and accurate perception of the environment. While numerous performance evaluation metrics exist for assessing perception capabilities, incorporating safety-specific metrics is essential to reliably evaluate object detection systems. A key component for safety evaluation is the ability to distinguish between relevant and non-relevant objects — a challenge addressed by criticality or relevance metrics. This paper presents the first in-depth analysis of criticality metrics for safety evaluation of object detection systems. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature, we identify and assess a range of applicable metrics. Their effectiveness is empirically validated using the DeepAccident dataset, which features a variety of safety-critical scenarios. To enhance evaluation accuracy, we propose two novel application strategies: bidirectional criticality rating and multi-metric aggregation. Our approach demonstrates up to a 100% improvement in terms of criticality classification accuracy, highlighting its potential to significantly advance the safety evaluation of object detection systems in automated vehicles."

However, manually annotating such datasets is inherently unscalable and prohibitively expensive. We propose a fully automated, training-free approach for 2D object annotation, built upon the capabilities of pre-trained zero-shot models. Our approach integrates a Vision-Language Model (VLM) for class extraction, Grounding DINO for zero-shot object detection, and the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for mask generation. A key contribution is the use of the VLM not to query against a full class list, but to first identify the specific object categories present in an image, drastically improving detection quality. Furthermore, we introduce a refinement step using Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS), eliminating duplicate predictions. We evaluate our pipeline on diverse benchmarks, including PASCAL VOC and COCO, demonstrating its effectiveness and generalization capabilities without any task-specific training. Our method offers a practical path towards accelerating dataset creation with minimal human supervision."

The method employs the A* algorithm to provide an initial directional path and pheromone seeding, while an improved ACO performs further optimization. A multi-objective heuristic function jointly considers path length, radiation dose, and energy consumption, and a differentiated pheromone update strengthens elite paths and penalizes poor ones to accelerate convergence and enhance path smoothness. Simulation studies in diverse radiation environments show that A*_DACO achieves shorter paths, lower dose accumulation, and reduced energy cost compared with ACO and Improved ACO (IACO). A robot experiment in a nuclear radiation field further confirms the algorithm’s practicality, demonstrating safer and more efficient path planning in complex radioactive scenarios."

    "abstract": "In the Max-Cut problem in the streaming model, an algorithm is given the edges of an unknown graph $G=(V, E)$ in some fixed order, and its goal is to approximate the size of the largest cut in G. Improving upon an earlier result of Kapralov, Khanna and Sudan, it was shown by Kapralov and Krachun that for all $\\varepsilon\\gt 0$, no $o(n)$ memory streaming algorithm can achieve a $(1 / 2+\\varepsilon)$-approximation for Max-Cut. Their result holds for single-pass streams, i.e. the setting in which the algorithm only views the stream once, and it was open whether multi-pass access may help. The state-of-the-art result along these lines, due to Assadi and N, rules out arbitrarily good approximation algorithms with constantly many passes and $n^{1-\\delta}$ space for any $\\delta\\gt 0$. We improve upon this state-of-the-art result, showing that any non-trivial approximation algorithm for Max-Cut requires either polynomially many passes or polynomially large space. More specifically, we show that for all $\\varepsilon\\gt 0$, a k-pass streaming $(1 / 2+\\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm for Max-Cut requires $\\Omega_{\\varepsilon}\\left(n^{1 / 3} / k\\right)$ space. This result leads to a similar lower bound for the Maximum Directed Cut problem, showing the near optimality of the algorithm of [Saxena, Singer, Sudan, Velusamy, SODA 2025]. Our lower bounds proceed by showing a communication complexity lower bound for the Distributional Implicit Hidden Partition (DIHP) Problem, introduced by Kapralov and Krachun. While a naive application of the discrepancy method fails, we identify a property of protocols called “globalness”, and show that (1) any protocol for DIHP can be turned into a global protocol, (2) the discrepancy of a global protocol must be small. The second step is the more technically involved step in the argument, and therein we use global hypercontractive inequalities, and more specifically strong quantitative versions of the level- d inequality for global functions."

Ensuring stability through appropriate controller design for such systems is a challenging task. As has been shown in multiple works, set invariance and classical stability theory have close links.

In this paper, we propose ${\\mathcal{D}}$-invariance conditions by making use of zonotopes as set representations. Compared with polytopes, zonotopes provide a compact representation and favorable properties under various set operations, like Minkowski addition. Our ${\\mathcal{D}}$-invariance conditions using zonotopes not only allow for testing feasibility of a given set, but also allows for efficient computation of invariant sets in a particular template. We also use our zonotopic ${\\mathcal{D}}$−invariance conditions to formulate robust ${\\mathcal{D}}$−invariance conditions and a computationally efficient controller design algorithm that optimizes simultaneously the rate of convergence and the amount of control energy used by a candidate controller. Finally, we show the efficacy of our results using numerical examples."

    "abstract": "With the advancement of communication networks, MGs increasingly function as cyber-physical systems (CPSs), making them more vulnerable to cyber-attacks. Faults and cyber-attacks (CAs) can severely disrupt the operation of microgrids (MGs), impacting critical parameters and threatening overall system stability and security. To mitigate these risks, a cyber-secure control approach is required. The integrity of the system can be undermined through the injection of falsified data within inter-controller communication links To address these challenges, this paper introduces a cyber-secure self-healing secondary voltage control method that enhances the resilience of isolated AC MGs against cyber threats. The proposed distributed architecture minimizes system vulnerability while maintaining the performance of secondary controllers under false data injection (FDI) attacks. The method is validated through MATLAB/Simulink simulations. Results indicate that the proposed approach not only preserves MG stability with rapid response but also efficiently suppresses small voltage disturbances, restoring the system to its pre-attack operating state."

    "abstract": "Recent successful lunar landings have renewed interest in developing next-generation lunar landers capable of achieving pinpoint landing accuracy. The confirmed presence of water ice near the Moon’s south pole has further motivated multiple space agencies to plan missions targeting this scientifically and strategically important region. However, the south polar environment poses significant challenges due to extremely low sun elevation angles and hazardous terrain, resulting in limited or no visual navigation support during the primary deceleration phase. This leads to substantial divert requirements and increased navigation uncertainty in both vertical (altitude) and horizontal channel near the landing site. Additionally, to ensure continuous surface tracking, it is essential to maintain lander attitude within altimeter operational limits throughout the terminal descent. This constraint imposes further requirements on the lander’s permissible attitude maneuvers, particularly during large lateral divert actions to cater for navigation (horizontal) errors. In this paper, we propose a near-fuel-optimal terminal descent strategy coupled with analytical guidance formulation under state and control constraint to allow precise landings with high divert capability. The terminal descent is divided into two stages: (i) a minimum vertical thrust phase, during which the lander leverages lunar gravity to increase vertical velocity, thereby mitigating the effect of vertical navigation errors; and (ii) a terminal braking phase initiated at an optimal altitude ensuring state and control constraints are met with online non-iterative prediction algorithm. The resulting descent profile approximates a near bang-bang thrust solution, achieving fuel-efficient performance while satisfying state and control constraints. Numerical simulations are presented to evaluate the proposed strategy and compare its performance with ground-based trajectory optimization results, demonstrating the effectiveness, fuel efficiency and robustness to navigation uncertainty."

    "abstract": "Hybrid AC/DC power systems are gaining importance due to the rising penetration of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) and the widespread deployment of Voltage Source Converters (VSCs). Analyzing power flow in such systems remains challenging due to unbalanced operating conditions, strong nonlinearities, and strict operational limits. This paper presents an Adaptive Hybrid Prediction-Correction algorithm with Trust-Region and Dynamic Line Search (AHPC-TRDLS) for reliable and efficient load flow computation in large-scale hybrid systems. The framework couples a Newton-Raphson-based prediction stage with a Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient (PCG) correction, bounded adaptively by a trust-region radius. A dynamic line search mechanism is incorporated as a fallback whenever the PCG convergence stalls, ensuring numerical stability. Additional features include adaptive preconditioning, enforcement of voltage and reactive power limits, and the use of symmetrical components for unbalanced system modeling. The algorithm is implemented in MATLAB and evaluated on different hybrid AC/DC test systems of varying scales. Case studies confirm that the proposed approach offers improved convergence, robustness, and scalability under stressed, ill-conditioned, and unbalanced scenarios."

    "abstract": "With the development of embodied intelligence, current vision-language-action (VLA) models are difficult to deploy due to their large number of parameters thus high computational load, while the vision-based action models suffer from insufficient action accuracy in grasping tasks. To address these issues, this article proposes a novel Adversarial Regularization in Visuomotor Policy (ARViP) model. First, a proposed conditional variational autoencoder generative adversarial network architecture is applied to the existing generative action models. By discriminator distinguishing between real and generated samples, the generator is forced to produce increasingly realistic outputs, thereby increasing the accuracy of grasping. Second, to address the issue of causal confusion, we introduce a target detection model incorporating prior knowledge of grasped objects as the vision backbone. It allows the vision backbone to have prior knowledge of the feature space for grasped objects, which strengthens the object localization capabilities, and, in turn, improves vision understanding and processing capabilities. Finally, to address the issue of current models typically using uniform time-step optimization for all robotic arm joints, we propose a time-based joint regularization method. It introduces specialized loss functions tailored to the individual joint states at different time steps, thereby improving the prediction accuracy, smoothness, and robustness of motion sequences. In several real-world experiments, including assembling, disassembling, and stacking tasks, the proposed ARViP model improves grasping accuracy by 32% compared to the studied models."

However, its adoption in the IoT domain is still limited by the heterogeneity of the HW, the immaturity of the toolchains, and the poor reproducibility of experiments. The present paper sets out the inNuCE RI, a two-pillar facility composed of a physical inNuCE Lab and a cloud-based inNuCE HPP. The purpose of the inNuCE RI is to enable developers to prototype, evaluate and compare neuromorphic and conventional end-to-end digital solutions. From a methodological perspective, we formalize the adaptation of MLOps to event-driven sensing and brain-inspired computation as NMLOps. We illustrate how inNuCE RI instantiates NMLOps through containerized toolchains orchestrated with Kubernetes and Slurm-managed heterogeneous resources (neuromorphic chips, FPGAs, GPUs, MCUs). The approach is analyzed on representative AIoT use cases, including HAR, Braille reading, event-based gesture recognition, Hi-Co semantization of memories, navigation tracking, and constraint satisfaction problems. The development of inNuCE RI has been driven by the need to facilitate the transition from prototype (<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">in nuce</i>) to engineered AIoT systems for lower entry barriers and enforce reproducibility.

    "abstract": "Self-supervised learning (SSL) methods have recently been applied to cognitive radio technology (CRT), yielding promising results by utilizing unlabeled data. Nevertheless, most existing SSL approaches primarily focus on a single aspect, either adopting contrastive paradigms that emphasize discriminative feature learning or generative paradigms that excel at extracting the semantic structure of fine-grained information. In this paper, we introduce a novel SSL method, Soft Top-k Contrastive and Adaptive Consistency with Wavelet-Based Refinement (SCAW), which effectively integrates the advantages of both discriminative feature learning and semantic, fine-grained structural information extraction, thereby enhancing robustness and generalization in CRT scenarios. First, a wavelet-based feature refinement module is incorporated into the encoder to enable full-frequency and fine-grained semantic feature extraction. Second, a soft top-k contrastive loss is introduced to exploit inherent inter-sample relationships, thereby preserving discriminative capability and enhancing the semantic structural integrity of the learned representations. Moreover, an adaptive consistency loss is formulated to mitigate noise-induced perturbations while maintaining the underlying structure of the representations. The effectiveness of SCAW is evaluated on four public datasets across multiple downstream tasks. Experimental results show that SCAW consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods."

To harness this potential, a scalable framework integrating edge and cloud computing is needed to provide a robust computing continuum for various IoT applications and services. This paper analyses the strengths and weaknesses of existing and emerging distributed computing frameworks—ranging from traditional centralized IoT architectures, through fog, edge, and local-edge architectures, to the full three-tier edge–cloud continuum—in terms of IoT service orchestration and diverse application requirements. We emphasize the latest evolutionary step, three-tier edge-cloud continuum, which aims to resolve the most significant limitations of the previous frameworks, recognized in the literature. It enables efficient IoT service orchestration by utilizing distributed resources and computation closer to end users, while taking full advantage of the centralized resources at data centers. We evaluate the maturity of these frameworks, considering factors such as scalability, resource efficiency, adaptability to changes, resource availability, security and privacy, as well as robustness and resilience. Overall, this study aims to serve as a roadmap for researchers, network architects, and industry stakeholders to make informed decisions on implementing the computing continuum in 6G networks."

    "abstract": "Real-world time series often exhibit multi-scale periodicity, necessitating the joint modeling of short-term fluctuations and long-term trends. Traditional temporal convolutional networks (TCNs), constrained by a single receptive field, struggle to capture such heterogeneous scales. We propose the Scale-Fused Temporal Convolutional Network (SFTCN) to address this limitation. SFTCN employs parallel convolutional branches with distinct kernel sizes to extract features at multiple temporal resolutions, and introduces a cross-scale fusion module that performs weighted aggregation to jointly encode short-term dynamics and long-term patterns. Extensive experiments on ETT, Electricity, Weather and Traffic datasets show that SFTCN generally outperforms baseline models on both short-term and medium-to-long-term forecasting tasks, especially when the data exhibit strong periodicity. Ablation studies confirm that the multiscale branches and the cross-scale fusion mechanism are both essential to SFTCN's superior ability to capture complex temporal dynamics."

We propose an adaptive framework that constructs smooth STTs around static unsafe sets, enabling continuous avoidance while guiding the system toward the target within the prescribed time. A closed-form, approximation-free control law is derived to ensure the system trajectory remains within the tube and satisfies the RAS task. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through a case study, showing a significant reduction in control effort compared to prior methods."

The primary objectives of this study are to create a comprehensive framework for efficient and reliable automation, implement dynamic data preprocessing for unseen agricultural data, and establish an intelligent monitoring system to ensure consistent and accurate predictions in real-world farming environments. Additionally, this research incorporates Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques to enhance interpretability and promote transparency in AI-driven agricultural decision-making. Integrating a Streamlit-based interface facilitates interactive visualization of model explanations, enabling farmers and agricultural stakeholders to comprehend the reasoning behind recommended decisions. These improvements are consistent with recent advancements in XAI-enhanced smart farming systems, as illustrated in the companion study “XAI Streamlit-Based Enhancing Crop Recommendation System with Advanced Explainable Artificial Intelligence for Smart Farming ”Combining automation and explainability, this study contributes to developing a robust, transparent, and scalable framework that bridges the gap between advanced AI techniques and their practical application in sustainable agriculture."

We present a multi-feature TLP approach that integrates semantic, numerical, and geometric descriptors through artifact-specific Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) headers and evaluate its performance using both classical and graph-based learning methods. Four Graph Neural Network (GNN) architectures—GCN, GraphSAGE, GAT, and GIN—are systematically benchmarked against strong baselines (Random Forest, MLP) under varying conditions of graph directionality, class imbalance, and inductive (node-disjoint) evaluation. Results on a mechatronic demonstrator reveal three key findings: (1) feature-rich inputs dominate performance, with classical models often matching or surpassing GNNs on single-relation graphs; (2) undirected modeling yields marginal numerical gains but violates domain semantics, highlighting the need for relation-aware designs; and (3) inductive evaluation provides more realistic generalization estimates. Overall, the study establishes multi-feature TLP as a practical and scalable mechanism for continuously enriching Knowledge-Graph-based Digital Threads, forming the semantic foundation for AI-augmented Systems Engineering."

This paper estimates the transformer load profiles using smart meter data, billing records, and GIS mapping of customers to the transformers. First, customers’ smart meter readings are pre-processed and normalized. Discrete wavelet transform (DWT) is utilized to extract features. The features from DWT are then grouped into typical load profiles (TLPs) using k-means clustering. To allocate a TLP to customers without smart meters, k-nearest neighbor is used, which utilizes monthly energy consumption, seasonal and monthly share of consumed energy, and, if applicable, share of energy received based on customers’ tariff. Next, the TLPs are scaled using customers’ monthly energy consumption and are aggregated to reconstruct the hourly transformer loads. The performance of the method using real data is evaluated, and it shows that the mean absolute percentage error is under 10%."

Sentiment analysis and technical feature extraction are added to enhance the prediction accuracy. The call ratio-based sentiment score, relative strength index, and moving averages are added as new features in the dataset. The experiment shows that the ridge and linear regressions work better than the other methods for foreseeing Nifty50 information.

    "abstract": "The growing convergence of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies and digital health insurance platforms has introduced a new landscape of intelligent, real-time services. Insurers now rely on continuous streams of biometric and behavioural data from wearable devices, mobile health apps, and edge-connected diagnostics to design adaptive policies, monitor patient wellness, and automate claim processing. However, this evolution has simultaneously amplified vulnerabilities to data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, and unauthorized access—posing significant threats to patient privacy and institutional credibility. This study presents a secure, multi-layered architectural framework designed specifically for IoT-enabled health insurance systems. The proposed model integrates advanced end-to-end encryption protocols, blockchain-based smart contract enforcement, AI-powered anomaly detection systems, adaptive multi-factor authentication (MFA), and embedded compliance auditing aligned with HIPAA and GDPR standards. Each security mechanism is positioned at a distinct operational layer—device, network, application, and governance—to ensure both horizontal and vertical protection across the system. To evaluate the proposed framework, a simulation testbed was constructed replicating realistic insurance scenarios with twenty emulated IoT endpoints. Five common cyberattack vectors were introduced, including SQL injection, man-in-the-middle interception, biometric spoofing, zero-day malware, and smart contract exploitation. Security performance was measured using key indicators such as detection accuracy, mitigation response time, data exposure volume, and regulatory compliance adherence. The results demonstrate that the integrated framework improved threat detection to 97.1%, reduced data leakage by over 80%, and maintained 98% compliance under regulatory audit conditions. These findings affirm the viability of a modular, regulation-ready defence architecture capable of protecting sensitive health data in dynamic IoT-driven insurance environments"

    "abstract": "Predicting stock prices has attracted a lot of attention since it can help with investing choices and reduce financial risks. Because financial markets are dynamic and non-linear, it is difficult to make accurate forecasts, which calls for the use of sophisticated approaches. By utilizing Random Forest's feature selection skills and Long Short-Term Memory's (LSTM) sequential learning strengths, this study suggests a unique ensemble model for stock price prediction. Ten years' worth of historical stock data was gathered from Yahoo Finance, preprocessed, and utilized to train the models. With an accuracy of 99 % and a mean squared error (MSE) of 12.12, the ensemble model fared better than conventional methods like ARIMA, Linear Regression, and standalone Random Forest. Superior performance in identifying non-linear patterns and temporal dependencies in stock data was shown by the combination of Random Forest and LSTM. To increase forecast accuracy and market responsiveness even more, future developments will include sentiment analysis and real-time flexibility. According to the findings, hybrid models have great potential for financial forecasting and decision-making."

    "abstract": "In the finance and banking industry, product recommendation systems play an important role in enhancing customer engagement and driving cross-sell and upsell opportunities. However, traditional recommendation models often fail to account for product eligibility constraints and customer-specific suitability, leading to irrelevant suggestions. This paper introduces a novel hybrid framework that combines rule-based eligibility filtering, customer segmentation, and machine learning to generate personalized, actionable product recommendation. The goal of this paper is to predict the most suitable financial product for a customer by mimicking human reasoning. To achieve this, our research employs a hybrid approach that combines fuzzy logic rule-based eligibility filtering with a supervised machine learning model to estimate adoption probabilities and recommend the next best product for the customer. Key features such as income, risk, credit score, and employment status are used together with other engineered features such as customer segment, balance to income ratio and eligibility scores to rank products for each customer. A weighting mechanism is introduced to prioritize recommendations that align with both customer needs and business constraints. Evaluation of synthetic data generated to mimic real-world data shows that the incorporation of eligibility and behavioral characteristics significantly improves the relevance of the recommendation and predictive performance. This system presents a scalable and interpretable solution for financial institutions that aims to optimize customer targeting while maintaining operational feasibility. Ideally, recommending the right product to the right customer."

    "abstract": "Software requirements are typically written in natural language, which is prone to issues such as ambiguity, wordiness, and vagueness. These requirements issues cause faults in software development processes. In the past, a well-known EARS (easy approach to requirements syntax) template has been proposed to mitigate these issues by specifying the requirements in semiformal format. The requirements specification in the EARS format requires an understanding of the EARS and requirement engineering domain. This requires manual labor, where each requirement needs to be manually transformed, looked at, rewritten, and transcribed by a requirement engineer. We propose a novel framework for fine-tuning light-weight LLMs that can automatically rewrite the requirements from scratch. We designed and implemented a pipeline that transforms the raw requirements to EARS format by fine-tuning four LLMs, that is, BART, DistillGPT2, GPT2, T5-Small with BART using data set of 9141 raw requirements. The BART-base provides the lowest score BLEU Score (0.405) and average BLEU score (0.708) as well as the lowest final training loss (0.34), indicating strong performance in transforming the EARS requirement."

Nevertheless, extensive missing values caused by equipment malfunctions in WQM data frequently result in unreliable hydrological analysis outcomes and compromised environmental policy-making precision. A latent factorization of tensors (LFT) proves to be an efficient imputation approach. Yet, most existing LFT-based models use a single distanceoriented loss function (e.g., one based on the <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$L_{2}$</tex> norm), ignoring the characteristics of WQM data that can be better captured by alternative metrics like the <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$L_{1}$</tex> norm.

However, a critical challenge remains: verifying that the learned CBFs truly enforce safety across the entire state space. This is especially difficult when CBF is represented using neural networks (NCBFs). Several existing verification techniques attempt to address this problem including SMT-based solvers, mixed-integer programming (MIP), and interval or bound-propagation methods but these approaches often introduce loose, conservative bounds. To overcome these limitations, in this work we use CPED-NCBFs a split-conformal prediction based verification strategy to verify the learned NCBF from the expert demonstrations. We further validate our method on point mass systems and unicycle models to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed theory."

    "abstract": "Performing underwater manipulation operations on underwater objects using autonomous unmanned underwater vehicles (AUVs) equipped with manipulators is challenging due to uncertainties when working with deformed or silted objects. Solving this problem requires operator supervision, which, in the open sea, is only possible using a hydroacoustic communication channel with severely limited bandwidth. This paper presents an algorithm designed to generate data for transmission to the operator, based on which the accuracy of automatic systems for identifying previously known objects is analyzed. The essence of the algorithm is to describe an identified defect on the object's surface using primitive shapes, information about which is transmitted in several stages. The operator first receives a generalized map of defects and deviations with quantitative characteristics. Based on this map, additional information is requested, which is transmitted in the form of adaptively generated sets of primitive geometric shapes. The parameters of these shapes are dynamically adjusted to the current bandwidth of the communication channel. As a result, this approach allows transmitting information sufficient for the operator under the conditions of low bandwidth of the hydroacoustic communication channel, while also maintaining functionality in case of data packet loss."

    "abstract": "By adjusting the power output of wind turbine generators (WTGs) to simulate the inertial dynamic response of traditional synchronous generators, virtual inertia technology serves as a crucial means to enhance the frequency support capability of wind power. Furthermore, the equivalent inertia prediction of WTGs enables the advance grasp of the inertial characteristics of the units, providing a key data foundation for the precise regulation of this technology. This study proposes a method for predicting the equivalent inertia of WTGs based on the temporal convolutional network (TCN) and multi-head attention mechanism. This method makes full use of multi-dimensional time-series data such as wind speed, power output, and power grid frequency. It focuses on capturing the short-term dependencies of multi-dimensional time-series data and extracting deep-seated data features through TCN. Meanwhile, it employs the multi-head attention mechanism to calculate the attention weights of multiple subspaces, thereby accurately identifying the long-term dependencies of the data. On this basis, the method extracts key features related to virtual inertia on a global scale, achieving the accurate prediction of the inertia time constant of WTGs. Experimental results show that the proposed prediction method has an average mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.0284 s and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.0368 s, exhibiting high prediction accuracy. It provides necessary decision-making information for the optimal dispatching of wind power and the stability control of power grid frequency."

In order to solve the problem of low inertia in DC microgrids caused by the integration of a large number of power electronic devices, firstly, by analogizing the active frequency control of AC power grids, the Analog Virtual Synchronous Generators (AVSG) control suitable for Energy Storage (ES) converters is obtained; Then, in order to improve the dynamic characteristics of the bus voltage, based on the voltage balance relationship when the DC microgrid is in a steady state, the variables that affect the output current of the ES converter are derived, and an adaptive power compensation control is designed and added to the current inner loop of the ES converter to weaken the influence of the above variables and improve the dynamic characteristics of the bus voltage; Secondly, in order to accelerate the speed of restoring stable bus voltage, an Extended State Observer (ESO) is introduced in the AVSG control loop, which estimates power disturbances through ESO and compensates them to the AVSG control loop, accelerating the speed of restoring stable bus voltage; Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy was verified through Matlab/Simulink simulation analysis."

    "abstract": "Decarbonizing the traffic sector requires public transport to switch to alternative drive technologies. Despite the increasing spread of electric vehicles, there are still challenges in the electrification of public transport. These challenges are particularly pronounced for electrified 18m-buses. Due to the limited range of 18m-buses, they are not suitable as a direct replacement for their diesel equivalents, making scheduling difficult for bus operators. A promising approach to extending the range is the integration of an additional energy source on board. This approach is implemented in fuel cell range extender (FC-REX) buses. It combines a battery and a fuel cell power supply, whereby the energy is mainly provided by the battery. The power distribution of the two energy sources is controlled by an energy management system (EMS).This paper first proposes an offline Dynamic Programming (DP) approach to determine the optimal fuel cell load in the EMS using a simulation of an FC-REX bus. The aim of DP is to find out whether the energy efficiency can be improved and thus the range can be increased. To enable a real-time capable EMS without prior knowledge of the route, a neural network is subsequently investigated to approximate that optimal control strategy by training based on DP data. The control strategy is referred to as Neural Network based on Dynamic Programming (DP-NN). DP-NN is intended to combine the advantages of DP in finding the global optimum with the computationally efficient real-time control of neural networks. For evaluation purposes, DP and DP-NN are compared with a constant fuel cell power supply operating close to its most efficient load."

For the joint and link subsystems based on virtual decomposition control (VDC), a robust tracking control strategy integrating parameter adaptive and saturation function sliding mode terms is proposed to enhance the system’s ability to suppress external disturbances. Secondly, stability analyses were conducted for the subsystems and the entire machine system, respectively. Based on this, in combination with the core idea of virtual decomposition, input-to-state safety high-order control barrier functions (ISSf-HOCBF) were designed for each subsystem with different joint position constraints. This approach ensures that the safety sets of each subsystem after disturbance expansion remain forward invariant under the conditions of external disturbances and differentiated joint state space constraints. In addition, a quadratic programming (QP) framework for optimizing control input was constructed, with system safety as the primary constraint. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed safety-critical control strategy was verified through a simulation experiment of a three-degree-of-freedom robotic manipulator based on a virtual decomposition model."

This paper presents and validates DynaRyde, a framework for optimizing suburban public transit by integrating dynamic route scheduling with on-demand passenger requests using well-established algorithms. Our approach utilizes the Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) clustering algorithm to group spatially and temporally proximate ride requests, generating \"virtual stops\" in real time. Routes are then dynamically computed using a Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)-like optimization heuristic, incorporating both mandatory transit hubs and virtual stops. We implemented and evaluated the DynaRyde system using the Simulation of Urban MObility (SUMO) traffic simulation environment on a realistic suburban road network under various demand scenarios. Performance was benchmarked against an enhanced fixed-route system and a non-clustering on-demand model. Results demonstrate that our integrated system significantly improves service quality and efficiency, achieving up to a 19% increase in service coverage and a 15–35% reduction in average waiting times compared to a resource-equivalent fixed-route baseline. These findings highlight the substantial potential of integrating on-demand clustering and dynamic routing strategies to create more adaptable and passenger-centric public transit solutions."

We leverage an existing multi-class Assamese hate speech corpus containing <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{5, 0 0 1}$</tex> social media comments labeled across categories such as religionbased, political, and other forms of hate. We conduct systematic experiments using IndicBERT, mBERT, and XLM-Roberta to establish baseline results for this challenging classification task. Our experiments show that IndicBERT achieves the highest macro F1-score of 0.72, outperforming XLM-Roberta (0.68) and mBERT (0.66). We further analyze the linguistic properties of the dataset, including code-switching, domain-specific slurs, and class imbalance, and present qualitative error analyses to understand factors influencing model performance. Our results provide a first set of robust transformer-based benchmarks for Assamese multi-class hate speech detection, and highlight challenges and opportunities for future research in low-resource, fine-grained hate speech modeling."

    "abstract": "In the uniformity testing task, an algorithm is provided with samples from an unknown probability distribution over a (known) finite domain, and must decide whether it is the uniform distribution, or, alternatively, if its total variation distance from uniform exceeds some input distance parameter. This question has received a significant amount of interest and its complexity is, by now, fully settled. Yet, we argue that it fails to capture many scenarios of interest, and that its very definition as a gap problem in terms of a prespecified distance may lead to suboptimal performance. To address these shortcomings, we introduce the problem of uniformity tracking, whereby an algorithm is required to detect deviations from uniformity (however they may manifest themselves) using as few samples as possible, and be competitive against an optimal algorithm knowing the distribution profile in hindsight. Our main contribution is a polylog(opt)-competitive uniformity tracking algorithm. We obtain this result by leveraging new structural results on Poisson mixtures, which we believe to be of independent interest."

We introduced SecRisBen, a novel benchmark suite featuring realistic Register Transfer Level (RTL)-vulnerabilities systematically injected into the processor core and peripheral modules using five structured strategies. A multidimensional evaluation framework was developed to rigorously assess competing analysis tools. Two leading teams demonstrated state-of-the-art detection capabilities, employing information flow-based formal verification and semantic-driven property generation to uncover multiple high-impact vulnerabilities.

    "abstract": "Multiaccuracy and multicalibration are multi-group fairness notions for prediction that have found numerous applications in learning and computational complexity [HKRR18]. They can be achieved from a single learning primitive: weak agnostic learning. A line of work starting from [GKR+22] has shown that multicalibration implies a very strong form of learning. Here we investigate the power of multiaccuracy as a learning primitive, both with and without the additional assumption of calibration. We find that multiaccuracy in itself is rather weak, but that the addition of global calibration (this notion is called calibrated multiaccuracy) boosts its power substantially, enough to recover implications that were previously known only assuming the stronger notion of multicalibration. We give evidence that multiaccuracy might not be as powerful as standard weak agnostic learning, by showing that there is no way to post-process a multiaccurate predictor to get a weak learner, even assuming the best hypothesis has correlation 1/2. Rather, we show that it yields a restricted form of weak agnostic learning, which requires some concept in the class to have correlation greater than 1/2 with the labels. However, by also requiring the predictor to be calibrated, we recover not just weak, but strong agnostic learning. A similar picture emerges when we consider the derivation of hardcore measures from predictors satisfying multigroup fairness notions [TTV09], [CDV24]. On the one hand, while multiaccuracy only yields hardcore measures of density half the optimal, we show that (a weighted version of) calibrated multiaccuracy achieves optimal density. Our results yield new insights into the complementary roles played by multiaccuracy and calibration in each setting. They shed light on why multiaccuracy and global calibration, although not particularly powerful by themselves, together yield considerably stronger notions."

For topological codes such as the surface code, the decoder often becomes a performance bottleneck. This paper presents an optimized nearest-neighbor union-find decoder, named NNUF, a novel algorithm designed to accelerate the traditional union-find (UF) decoder. NNUF leverages pre-computed nearest-neighbor information to form preliminary error clusters, which streamlines the subsequent decoding stages. We evaluated NNUF against standard benchmarks and demonstrated that it reduces the decoding time while maintaining the high error correction performance of the original UF decoder. Specifically, for large code distances where $d \\geq 7$, our results reveal a speedup of up to $1.14 \\times$ compared to a standard UF implementation. This establishes NNUF as a valuable tool for quantum systems requiring fast and reliable decoding, representing a practical step towards real-time error correction in large-scale quantum processors."

To learn the Gibbs state of local Hamiltonians at any constant inverse temperature, the state-of-the-art provable algorithms fall short of the optimal sample and computational complexity, in sharp contrast with the locality and simplicity in the classical cases. In this work, we present a learning algorithm that learns each local term of a n-qubit Hamiltonian on any bounded-degree graph to a constant additive error with the optimal sample complexity $\\mathcal{O}(\\log n)$. The protocol uses parallelizable local quantum measurements that act within bounded neighborhoods of the graph and near-linear-time classical post-processing. We also give a learning algorithm for lattice Hamiltonians with near-optimal scaling on the learning precision and the inverse temperature. At the heart of our algorithm is the interplay between locality, the Kubo-MartinSchwinger condition, and the operator Fourier transform at arbitrary temperatures."

Building on these advantages, voltage-domain nvCIM further alleviates the IR-drop errors and static power issues inherent in current-domain designs, but its throughput remains fundamentally constrained by the bit-line (BL) settling time required to resolve small voltage differences. This paper presents a throughput-enhanced architecture for voltage-domain non-volatile CIM systems, which leverages a pipelined compute-quantize operation together with a two-step sub-ranging ADC to significantly reduce compute latency while preserving high output precision. Post-layout simulations of a 32-Kb RRAM CIM macro under 180nm process demonstrate a compute latency of 30 ns and a normalized throughput of 2.184 TOPS/bit at 1.8V, achieving a <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$4.34 \\times$</tex> overall throughput improvement over the convectional baseline.

Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), including convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformer-based models, have enhanced automated polyp detection, yet challenges such as variable polyp sizes, poor lighting, and noisy colonoscopy backgrounds persist. Early CRC detection is pivotal, significantly boosting survival rates and reducing the need for invasive treatments through prompt polyp identification and intervention. Accurate and efficient segmentation of colorectal polyps from colonoscopy images is essential for advancing CRC outcomes. We present an innovative DeepLabv3+ segmentation framework, integrating channel-spatial attention modules, attention gates, and cascaded dilated convolutions, complemented by a boundary-aware loss function. This architecture tackles the complexities of variable polyp sizes, suboptimal lighting, and background noise across public datasets: Kvasir-SEG, CVC-ClinicDB, and ETIS-Larib. Our model achieves Dice coefficients of 0.924, 0.912, and 0.881, respectively, surpassing or matching the outcomes of existing CNN and transformer-based approaches which are regarded as the standard in this use case. An ablation study confirms the efficacy of these components in enhancing segmentation performance. By enabling precise polyp delineation, this model supports early detection, equipping clinicians with actionable insights for confident decision-making. The model’s precise boundary accuracy strengthens intelligent decision-support systems, optimizing treatment strategies and elevating patient care."

The proposed modification of the algorithm accounts for the hydrodynamic interaction of the links in the incident fluid flow. The modification also considers that the drag forces depend not only on the velocities of the links but also on their mutual configuration. In particular, the influence of the wake generated by some links on others is taken into account. This is achieved through preliminary flow simulations of a manipulator link in SOLIDWORKS Flow Simulation at different velocities. The obtained experimental data are used to refine the velocities of the oncoming flow, which can also be influenced by underwater currents. The refinement is applied to those links that fall into the wake. Numerical simulations were performed to evaluate the implemented modification, using a Matlab/Simulink model of a multi-degree-of-freedom manipulator mounted on an unmanned underwater vehicle. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm modification in enhancing the accuracy of underwater manipulation tasks."

The model differentiates between two-/three-wheeler EVs with unidirectional charging and four-wheeler EVs with bidirectional V2G capability. By incorporating user charging behavior and geographic distribution characteristics, and introducing capacity commitments, penalty mechanisms, and user compensation, the framework maximizes aggregator profit. Through scenario generation and reduction, adaptive aggregation radius, and two-stage optimization, the approach effectively addresses the dispatchability of low-density, heterogeneous resources. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly enhances dispatchable capacity and PV energy absorption during daytime PV peak periods while maintaining stable profits, providing a feasible pathway for renewable energy integration and EV resource aggregation in frontier regions."

    "abstract": "In cancer surgery, accurately assessing surgical margins is critical for reducing the risk of tumor recurrence and ensuring complete resection. Intraoperative margin detection plays an important role, particularly in the context of minimally invasive surgery (MIS), where visualization and access are inherently constrained. Current methods, such as frozen section analysis and imaging modalities like fluorescence and optical coherence tomography, face limitations including time inefficiency, limited spatial resolution, and difficulty in integrating seamlessly with MIS workflows. To address these challenges, this study proposes a sensing probe aiming for non-invasive, real-time and onsite margin detection. Based on the electrical bioimpedance (EBI) modality, the proposed probe is designed as a multi-electrodes embedded suction cup, which ensures reliable electrodes-tissue contact and reduces the influence caused by superficial body fluids. Algorithm based on tetrapolar configuration and the Fresnel equation is also developed for calculating tissue resistivity and margin visualization. Experiments based on simulations, standard salines, and ex vivo animal tissues are conducted and demonstrate the high accuracy and strong noise resistance of the designed probe. Additionally, a pre-clinical study on ex vivo human brain tissues shows the system’s great potential for neurosurgical margin detection between glioma and healthy tissue."

    "abstract": "The need for automating agriculture has fueled a progress of intelligent robotics applications focused on streamlining repetitive and laborious work. In this paper, the authors describe AgriBot,\" a novel agricultural robot that is capable for automated driving and multiapplication in agriculture. The robot utilizes servo hexapod motion and ultrasonic and flame sensors to detect obstacles and monitor fire for ensuring safety and operational efficacy of the robotpolypedal robot in the agricultural fields. The hardware of the AgriBot comprise of 18 servos and maintains stable movement even on rough muddy lands, similar to the farming areas. The predefined motions such as forward, back and turning make the work be done effectively. The 15 cm ultrasonic sensor monitors obstacles causing the flight system to take corrective measures to avoid a collision and the flame sensor enables instantaneous fire detection to minimise crop damage. The robot is programmed with an Arduino microcontroller board and has a Python based Flask application that allows remote controlling via an HTML page. Commands can be invoked by users directly or by using a chatbot to send natural language commands, which makes it easier for non technical users to use the tool. Furthermore, the live video feed from the built-in IP camera enables real-time monitoring for high accuracy operations, such as crop inspection and irrigation scheduling. AgriBot is an affordable alternative for weed eradication, soil health monitoring, and early fire alerts. It is also a modular framework for future integration of ML algorithms for crop condition analysis and data-driven agriculture advice. The study demonstrates AgriBot's capability to increase productivity, save labor, and promote sustainable agriculture, connecting rural agriculture with automation machinery."

    "abstract": "The rapid evolution of smart cities has created a highly interconnected digital ecosystem where millions of Internets of Things (IoT) devices generate vast quantities of sensitive, high-dimensional data. Harnessing this data through machine learning enables intelligent decision-making in domains such as transportation, healthcare, and environmental monitoring. However, traditional centralized machine learning approaches are increasingly unsuitable for these environments due to the dual challenges of data privacy regulations and system scalability. While federated learning (FL) offers a decentralized alternative, conventional implementations often struggle with non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data, high communication overhead, heterogeneous resource availability, and susceptibility to adversarial manipulation. This paper introduces a Resilient Federated Learning Framework specifically designed for privacy-preserving smart city infrastructures. The proposed framework integrates four complementary mechanisms: differential privacy to protect local updates, secure aggregation to guarantee encrypted communication, adaptive client participation to balance load across heterogeneous devices, and Byzantine-resilient filtering to defend against poisoning and inference attacks. Together, these modules establish a secure and scalable pipeline that ensures compliance with stringent data protection regulations while maintaining learning efficiency. The framework is experimentally validated using three real-world datasets MIMIC-III for healthcare, municipal traffic flow records for transportation, and the UCI Air Quality dataset for environmental monitoring on a GPU enabled federated testbed with <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{1 0 0}$</tex> simulated clients. Results demonstrate that the proposed design achieves a 32 % reduction in communication overhead relative to baseline FedAvg, accelerates convergence by 12 %, and maintains over 90 % of model accuracy even with 15 % of clients acting maliciously. Privacy-utility trade-off analysis further confirms that meaningful privacy guarantees (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\varepsilon=1, \\delta=10^{-5}$</tex>) can be achieved with less than <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{4 \\%}$</tex> accuracy loss."

This work aims to develop an EEG-powered BCI model that translates neural signals associated with hand movements into control mechanisms for a 3D hand model simulation. This study focuses on developing a simulation environment where the 3D hand model reacts to cognitive commands based on pre-processed EEG data. The Emotiv EEG headset is used by the system to record raw brainwave data, with a special emphasis on motor imagery signals associated with hand movements. Nine volunteers, aged 20 to 22 years, had their brain waves captured using Emotiv EPOC X 14 channel EEG headset. Four different hand gestures—fist open, fist close, index and victory—were considered. A full processing pipeline was implemented, which included data collection, preprocessing, feature extraction and model creation for accurate classification. The EEG data was then mapped to a 3D hand model in Blender tool to simulate movement. The classification of EEG-based motor imagery gestures was done using Multilayer Perceptron that achieved a test accuracy of approximately 96.6 % and the KNN classifier that reached 97.63 % cross-validation accuracy, outperforming other traditional models. Future work will focus on real-time processing and implementation, integrating mechanical and robotic components for practical applications. By providing an intuitive, hands-free method for controlling virtual systems through cognitive commands, the project demonstrates the feasibility of BCI technologies in enhancing user interaction with digital environments."

    "abstract": "The Steiner Forest problem, also known as the Generalized Steiner Tree problem, is a fundamental optimization problem on edge-weighted graphs where, given a set of vertex pairs, the goal is to select a minimum-cost subgraph such that each pair is connected. This problem generalizes the Steiner Tree problem, first introduced in 1811, for which the best known approximation factor is 1.39 by [Byrka, Grandoni, Rothvoβ, and Sanità, 2010]. The celebrated work of [Agrawal, Klein, and Ravi, 1989], along with refinements by [Goemans and Williamson, 1992], established a 2-approximation for Steiner Forest over 35 years ago. Pioneering iterative rounding techniques by [Jain, 1998] later extended these results to higher connectivity settings. Despite the long-standing importance of this problem, breaking the approximation factor of 2 has remained a major challenge, raising suspicions that achieving a better factor might indeed be hard. In this paper, we break the approximation barrier of 2 by designing a novel deterministic algorithm that achieves a $\\mathbf{2} \\mathbf{- 1 0}^{\\mathbf{- 1 1}}$ approximation for this fundamental problem. As a key component of our approach, we also introduce a novel dual-based local search algorithm for the Steiner Tree problem with an approximation guarantee of 1.943, which is of independent interest."

To overcome these bottlenecks, we propose DeepRS, a training-free, LLM-driven Deep Reasoning Framework. This framework leverages the logical planning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to restructure the reasoning process into a hierarchical, iterative Reason-Observe-Re-reason cycle. Specifically, we construct a dynamic reasoning tree where the LLM recursively decomposes the problem into fine-grained queries, actively guiding the perception module to mine visual clues. Subsequently, a multistage reflection mechanism consolidates these multi-level contexts to derive the final conclusion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DeepRS significantly outperforms both single-VLM baselines and collaborative baselines in accuracy and robustness. Furthermore, our framework generates clear, traceable reasoning paths, substantially enhancing interpretability in complex remote sensing scenarios."

To alleviate the original model's shortcomings in multi-scale feature fusion and hard sample learning, MSAA module and ATFL function are incorporated. The MSAA module enhances multi-scale spatial feature representation and channel-wise information fusion through parallel spatial refinement and channel aggregation paths. Meanwhile, the ATFL adaptively adjusts the weights of hard samples, improving the model's ability to distinguish overlapping and morphologically abnormal cells. Experimental results on a blood cell detection dataset show that the improved model achieves mAP50 and mAP50:95 scores of 95.5% and 69.9%, respectively, representing improvements of 1.6% and 1.5% over the original YOLOv11s.

Traditional behavior-based scales (e.g., Coma Recovery Scale–Revised(CRS-R)) are highly subjective, creating an urgent need for objective, automated, and intelligent assessment methods. Resting-state electroencephalography (EEG) provides rich neural information but conventional power spectral density (PSD) methods fail to dissociate periodic from aperiodic activity.This study employed the Fitting Oscillations and One-Over-F (FOOOF) method to parameterize EEG spectra from 135 pDOC patients, extracting TotalPower, PeriodicPower, AperiodicPower, offset, and exponent. Four analyses were conducted: (1) correlation between EEG features and CRS-R scores; (2) group comparisons between vegetative state (VS) and minimally conscious state (MCS); (3) classification of consciousness states using support vector machine (SVM) models; and (4) prediction of CRS-R scores using ridge regression models.Results consistently demonstrated that AperiodicPower outperformed traditional spectral features across all tasks, exhibiting stronger correlations, better group separation, higher classification accuracy, and lower regression errors. These findings establish AperiodicPower as a robust biomarker and highlight its potential as a core feature for intelligent diagnostic systems.By embedding FOOOF-derived features into automated monitoring and decision-support platforms, this study lays the foundation for smart healthcare solutions such as real-time patient tracking, closed-loop rehabilitation robotics, and adaptive neuromodulation.The proposed framework not only advances EEG-based biomarker research but also provides methodological contributions to the development of automatic disease diagnosis systems in clinical neuroscience."

    "abstract": "Navigating without prior maps poses significant challenges for robots, especially in complex environments populated with pedestrians and obstacles. In such settings, achieving a balance between safety, socially compliant behavior, and path efficiency is critical. To address this, we propose a novel deep reinforcement learning-based approach, termed Coherent Risk-Aware Regulation (CRAR), tailored for Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs). Our method incorporates a risk prediction network that enables the robot to anticipate potential hazards arising from pedestrians or obstacles. Furthermore, by integrating risk assessment and correction mechanisms, CRAR facilitates rapid learning of avoidance strategies, thereby reducing training duration. Consequently, the robot can identify navigation paths that are both safer and more efficient. Simulation results demonstrate that, in open environments, CRAR achieves an average success rate improvement of 25.33% and reduces navigation time by 10.85% compared to baseline methods. In dense environments, these benefits are amplified, with a success rate increase of 30.46% and a navigation time reduction of 21.75%. Additionally, CRAR ensures greater safety margins from obstacles and smoother trajectories, underscoring its efficacy in navigating dense and dynamic settings. Finally, we validate the performance and practicality of the proposed method through real-world experiments.

The scenario involves a single attacker attempting to reach the target while multiple defenders coordinate to intercept it. Each agent is modeled using position-level single-integrator dynamics for high-level control design. The interaction is cast as a continuous-time zero-sum game with a quadratic cost functional, where optimal strategies are derived using a time-varying Riccati differential equation. To ensure safe coordination during close-proximity operations, collision avoidance is incorporated via repulsion-based augmentation of defender controls. Furthermore, the high-level control inputs are tracked using a low-level proportional-derivative (PD) controller within a realistic 6-DOF UAV dynamic model implemented in Simulink. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in achieving successful interception while maintaining defender safety and realistic trajectory tracking."

A two-phase potential-based reward structure first penalizes large angular rates and then enforces trimmed flight. After 6,000 simulated episodes, the policy generalities to unseen upset initializations. Results show that the learned policy successfully arrests the angular rates and stabilizes the angle of attack. The controller performance is observed to be satisfactory for recovery from spin condition which was compared with a state-of-the-art sliding mode controller.

    "abstract": "The extraction of buildings from high-resolution remote sensing images faces significant challenges due to complex urban scenes, including spectral ambiguities, geometric diversity, and boundary uncertainties. Despite progress in deep learning-based methods, buildings' varied shapes and sizes complicate edge extraction, making it difficult for existing approaches to balance the global context with local details and leverage edge priors effectively, especially for adjacent buildings. In response to these issues, we propose an edge-aware dual-stream dynamic fusion network called EA-DSFNet. It follows the encoder-decoder paradigm, where the encoding component utilizes a dual-path setup integrating convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformer modules. First, we design a feature reuse and fusion (FRF) module that dynamically integrates local information extracted by the CNN with global contextual features extracted by the Transformer at the encoder stage to achieve a comprehensive multi-scale feature representation. Second, a feature selection gate (FSG) is developed to adaptively emphasize discriminative features during cross-branch fusion while suppressing redundant information. Aiming to improve the model's utilization of building edge information, the decoder network introduces a multitask edge-directed decoder (MTEDD). This architecture optimizes edge extraction and segmentation tasks jointly through hierarchical supervision, enabling the decoder to fully assimilate edge information. Additionally, the foreground and background enhancement module (FBEM) explicitly utilizes geometric priors to guide segmentation, thereby improving the boundary accuracy of the segmentation results. We perform extensive testing across three standard reference datasets to assess the performance of our method. The experimental results demonstrate that EA-DSFNet surpasses current leading techniques in segmentation."

    "abstract": "This work investigates a deterministic transmit beamforming algorithm for sidelobe suppression under a predefined mainlobe gain loss. By enforcing the unit-norm constraint via the Lagrange multiplier method, the problem is formulated as a quadratic eigenvalue problem that yields a numerical solution without iterative optimization. The algorithm also supports asymmetric sidelobe control and null steering, offering flexible beampattern shaping. Simulation results under various gain loss constraints demonstrate that the proposed method achieves up to 28.70% relative reduction in the sidelobe power compared with classical tapering window functions and 16.13% compared with gradient-based algorithms, while achieving comparable peak sidelobe levels."

    "abstract": "Event cameras offer micro-second temporal resolution and thus excel in fast-hand-tracking scenarios where conventional RGB cameras suffer from motion-blur artifacts. However, the scarcity of annotated datasets for fast hand motion limits the development of learning-based event solutions. To overcome this data-shortage problem, we propose a unified framework that leverages knowledge distillation and transfer learning. We first release a real-world multimodal dataset with synchronized event and RGB streams. Our framework then employs two key strategies: (i) cross-modal knowledge distillation that trains an event-based student network using reliable RGB predictions on slow-motion sequences, and (ii) domain adaptation that transfers the learned features from slow to fast motion. Experiments on our fast-motion benchmark show improvements over both RGB-based and previous event-based approaches in fast hand tracking tasks. Beyond hand tracking, the proposed slow-to-fast distillation paradigm offers a generic pathway for dynamic-vision tasks that lack high-speed annotations. Code and dataset will be made publicly available"

Despite extensive historical research, existing demographic models lack accuracy in projecting future population trajectories under dynamic social and policy environments, creating a gap for sustainable urban planning. This study introduces a novel, AI-driven framework that leverages forecasting models, sensitivity analysis, and stochastic simulations implemented via Python to analyze historical demographic data and generate future projections. The results identify key demographic patterns, including aging populations, declining fertility rates, and the influence of socioeconomic factors. These findings provide actionable insights for policymakers and urban planners to optimize infrastructure, resource allocation, and social services. The primary contribution of this work is advancing demographic modeling through the integration of AI techniques, offering a practical and adaptable tool for guiding long-term urban sustainability in these rapidly evolving economies. This research not only fills a critical gap in demographic forecasting but also demonstrates the potential of AI applications in urban and social policy development."

    "abstract": "With the widespread application of distributed energy, the Grid-forming (GFM) control technology for islanded microgrids has garnered increasing attention. Traditional control strategies for islanded microgrids primarily rely on distributed energy sources with stable input power. Additionally, conventional black-start schemes often require large-capacity energy storage devices, resulting in poor system economy and limiting their practical application and promotion. To address those issues, this paper proposes a novel GFM strategy for islanded microgrids, which uses permanent magnetic synchronous generator (PMSG)-based wind turbines (WTs) as the main power sources. The droop control structure between the output power of the machine-side converter (MSC) and the DC voltage is presented, allowing multiple WTs to automatically allocate load capacity based on the droop coefficient. Moreover, the frequency of the microgrid bus can be automatically adjusted with changes of load capacity, enabling the WTs to perform primary frequency regulation in the microgrid. Based on the PSCAD/EMTDC simulation platform, the proposed control strategy is validated."

    "abstract": "Ad Hoc Network is wireless networks that get more attention from past to present. Mobile ad hoc network (MANET) is one of the types of ad hoc networks, it deployed rapidly because it infrastructure-less. A node in a mobile ad hoc network communicates through wireless links without wired channels. When source nodes want to communicate with the destination outside its transmission range it uses multi-hop mechanisms. The intermediate node forwards the data packet to the next node until the data packet reaches its destination. Due wireless links and lack of centralized administration device, mobile ad hoc network is more vulnerable for security attacks. The rushing attack is one of the most dangerous attacks in the on-demand routing protocol of mobile ad hoc networks. Rushing attack highly transmits route request with higher transmission power than the genuine nodes and become participate between source and destination nodes, after that, it delays or drop actual data pass through it. In this study, the researcher incorporates rushing attack in one of the most commonly used mobile ad hoc network routing protocols namely Ad hoc on-demand multipath distance vector and provides a rushing attack prevention method based on the time threshold value and random route selection. Based on the time RREQ arrives a node takes a decision, if the RREQ packet arrives before threshold value, the RREQ packet consider as came from an attacker and discarded else RREQ packet received then randomly select RREQ to forward. In this study performance metrics like packet delivery ratio, end-to-end delay and throughput have been evaluated using Network simulation (NS-2.35). As a result of simulation shows newly proposed prevention mechanism improves network performance in all cases than the network under attacker. For example, the average packet del"

LLMs, due to their ability to understand human language, can take into account existing conditions and preferences. This capability allows LLMs to be employed in decision-making to select the best approach without the need for mathematical or formulaic complexities.

This study proposed a human-in-the-loop control framework for a 3-DOF unilateral exoskeleton for the active assistance of a pediatric gait. The proposed HIL strategy incorporates the variable admittance control in the outer loop and non-singular terminal sliding mode (NSTSM) in the inner loop to enhance the trajectory tracking and offer safety and flexibility to the user. The variable admittance control modulates the admittance parameters of the exoskeleton using a simple adaptive law based on the human-exoskeleton interaction, while the NSTSM control provides a robust and accurate gait tracking at different walking speeds. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the HIL framework with variable admittance control effectively improves the safety and flexibility for pediatric users under human-exoskeleton interaction compared to the HIL framework with fixed admittance control. The fixed admittance parameters of stiffness (100 Nm/rad) and damping (2 Nms/rad) appear misestimated, as compliance modulation suggests varying parameters (65–95 Nm/rad and 1.8–2.7 Nms/rad) for improved adaptability to interactions."

The framework leverages sixth-generation (6G) communication technologies to achieve ultra-low latency, high reliability, and large-scale connectivity, ensuring seamless real-time interactions among EVs and grid entities. To model and forecast the dynamic energy demands of EVs, a Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)-based predictive model is utilized, which allows the smart grid to optimize energy allocation and maximize overall trading benefits. The blockchain layer ensures data immutability, transaction transparency, and tamper-proof trading records. A comparative performance analysis demonstrates that the proposed system significantly enhances latency, scalability, and profitability for both producer and consumer EVs when compared to conventional 4G/5G-based trading infrastructures.

    "abstract": "The rapid advancement of deep learning has intensified the need for comprehensive data for use by autonomous driving algorithms. High-quality datasets are crucial for the development of effective data-driven autonomous driving solutions. Next-generation autonomous driving datasets must be multimodal, incorporating data from advanced sensors that feature extensive data coverage, detailed annotations, and diverse scene representation. To address this need, we present OmniHD-Scenes, a large-scale multimodal dataset that provides comprehensive omnidirectional high-definition data. The OmniHD-Scenes dataset combines data from 128-beam LiDAR, six cameras, and six 4D imaging radar systems to achieve full environmental perception. The dataset comprises 1501 clips, each approximately 30-s long, totaling more than 450 K synchronized frames and more than 5.85 million synchronized sensor data points. We also propose a novel 4D annotation pipeline. To date, we have annotated 200 clips with more than 514 K precise 3D bounding boxes. These clips also include semantic segmentation annotations for static scene elements. Additionally, we introduce a novel automated pipeline for generation of the dense occupancy ground truth, which effectively leverages information from non-key frames. Alongside the proposed dataset, we establish comprehensive evaluation metrics, baseline models, and benchmarks for 3D detection and semantic occupancy prediction. These benchmarks utilize surround-view cameras and 4D imaging radar to explore cost-effective sensor solutions for autonomous driving applications. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our low-cost sensor configuration and its robustness under adverse conditions.

    "abstract": "Audit logs, crucial for service auditing and security, capture user and system activities, which can be effectively represented as multivariate time series data to enable efficient log analysis, such as behavior analytics for anomaly detection. However, it is technically challenging to analyze such data due to its high dimensionality and strong time correlation. To address these challenges and enhance predictive security for consumer applications, we propose an AI-driven anomaly detection model named HFLAD. This model comprehensively considers the feature and time correlation of multivariate time series data. It employs causal and dilated convolutions for encoding to capture multi-scale temporal dependencies, and utilizes an HVAE (Hierarchical Variational Autoencoder) generator for information reconstruction. Then, it identifies anomalies by leveraging the difference between the reconstructed data and the original data. By leveraging hierarchical fusion learning, HFLAD proactively detects deviations in consumer-related system activities and audit logs, aligning with modern security demands in smart devices, IoT, and online services. Experimental results demonstrate that HFLAD outperforms other existing techniques in identifying anomalies, thereby improving the effectiveness of predictive security measures for consumer systems."

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a Neural Network Augmented Koopman Explicit Model Following Control (NNKEMFC) framework designed for robust trajectory tracking of robotic manipulators that exhibit nonlinear and uncertain dynamics. The proposed method integrates an offline-identified extended-state Koopman operator within an Explicit Model Following Control (EMFC) framework to produce a data-driven feedforward control action while maintaining a model-following structure. To tackle modeling errors, friction effects, external disturbances, and parametric uncertainties, an online neural network control structure is integrated to estimate unmodeled dynamics in real time. The final control input includes the Koopman-based feedforward torque, a filtered tracking-error feedback term, neural network compensation, and a robustifying signal to enhance robustness. The proposed approach is evaluated using a multi-degree-of-freedom robotic manipulator in several scenarios that include friction, external loads, and parameter uncertainties. Simulation results indicate that the NNKEMFC outperforms the classical computed torque control and KEMFC and achieves notable reductions in joint-space RMS tracking errors, particularly in nonlinear conditions. These results highlight the advantages of incorporating a Koopman-based model followed by online neural residual learning to enhance the robust tracking of robotic manipulators."

    "abstract": "In this article, a novel filtering antenna based on a transversal topology is presented. The design incorporates both electric coupling (EC) and magnetic coupling (MC) feeding techniques. By leveraging their distinct phase characteristics, an out-of-phase condition is created in the stopband to generate out-of-band radiation nulls, while an in-phase condition is maintained in the passband to prevent radiation cancellation. The integration of both feeding schemes into the transversal layout yields a simple and compact structure without extra feeding circuits. Furthermore, λ/4-length patch elements are adopted, whose opened and shorted ends facilitate EC and MC feeding, respectively, allowing a single radiator type to support dual excitation and further simplify the geometry. A synthesis approach is applied to align the radiation quality factor of each element with the filter's external quality factor, enabling flexible adjustment of fractional bandwidth and radiation null locations. A third-order antenna prototype with dual stopband zeros is in final designed, fabricated, and measured, exhibiting well-defined filtering performance, a compact single-layer profile, and promising practicality for modern wireless systems."

A two-phase approach is typically employed in such applications, encompassing task planning and assignment among the robots, followed by motion planning to execute the assigned tasks. This work focuses on the motion planning phase, which facilitates the optimal navigation of multiple robots from their initial to desired goal configurations. A novel multirobot Bézier curve-based trajectory planner (MrBTP) is proposed. MrBTP generates optimal trajectories for multiple robots navigating in an unknown environment, including the polygonal characterization of the available open space. The optimization process is based on using a weighted objective function that combines the navigation time of each robot and the length of its trajectory, allowing for various path optimization strategies. The effectiveness of MrBTP has been evaluated in various scenarios, and its performance is compared with that of a selected trajectory planner based on three performance metrics. Over the three robots used in the test, MrBTP reduced the navigation time by 21%–49% and the trajectory length by 10%–18% compared to the selected benchmark trajectory planner.

    "abstract": "This study introduces a hybrid quantum-classical framework designed to mitigate electromagnetic interference (EMI) in network cables, with a focus on optimizing signal integrity through advanced computational techniques. 1 By integrating the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) with custom-engineered materials, we effectively reduce distortions arising from magnetic field coupling. The system is modeled using Maxwell's equations and rigorously validated through electromagnetic simulations and circuit-level analyses. Nonlinear phenomena, including permeability saturation and frequency-dependent losses, are quantified using both analytical and numerical models. Results demonstrate that QAOA achieves a significant reduction in bit error rate (BER), surpassing classical paper swarm optimization (PSO) by an order of magnitude and outperforming conventional methods by two orders. Notably, the QAOA framework converges in just 50 iterations—halving the computational effort required by PSO— while maintaining a probe power of 5 W. The implemented engineered materials contribute to a 30 50% reduction in signal distortion, showcasing substantial improvements in noise suppression. Although current quantum hardware limitations restrict immediate scalability, the inherent efficiency of QAOA in combinatorial optimization positions it as a transformative tool for critical applications demanding ultra-reliable communication, such as defense and medical systems. A comparative analysis highlights the limitations of classical methodologies in large-scale, high-interference environments. This research advocates for the integration of quantum-inspired strategies into industry standards and outlines pathways for developing robust communication infrastructures."

The design equations of a compact harmonic-controlled bias network (CHCBN) are derived, which can achieve inverse class-F amplifier load conditions with adjustable fundamental frequency impedance, this approach effectively improves the saturated and back-off efficiency of the DPA. An active second harmonic injection network (HIN) is proposed which utilizes the second harmonic components generated by the carrier and peaking devices for mutual injection to achieve the amplitude modulation of the DPA drain waveform in the saturated state, further improving the saturated efficiency of the DPA. To validate the methodology, a C-band high efficiency DPA MMIC is designed and fabricated in a 0.25 μm GaN-HEMT process. The measurement results show that the fabricated DPA exhibits the saturated output power (Psat) of 39.6 dBm–40.6 dBm, with a saturated drain efficiency (DE) of 53.9%–61.5%, and a 6-dB back-off DE of 51.4%–56.0% over the 4.8-5.4 GHz frequency band.

This study proposes a Forecast-Based Decision Support System (FDSS) to help farmers anticipate key actions and organize workflows more systematically.Using the DMADV (Define, Measure, Analyze, Design, Verify) framework, the research focuses on developing a modular system grounded in fieldwork. Semi-structured interviews with young longan farmers identified operational pain points, informing five core modules: (1) Data Ingestion, (2) Predictive Analytics, (3) Visualization, (4) Recommendation Engine, and (5) Knowledge Exchange. The system emphasizes low-barrier adoption, local relevance, and alignment with existing practices. Feasibility was assessed through complementary analyses, including SWOT, TOWS, and TAM-SAM-SOM frameworks, demonstrating strong potential for scalable deployment within the targeted smallholder context.This paper suggests how a user centered FDSS can transform fragmented data into timely, actionable insights. By aligning forecasting tools with farmers’ decision cycles, the system enhances planning without compromising autonomy. The findings offer design implications for modular, accessible decision support tools in small-scale agriculture."

The power receiving capacity of the regional power grids in Nagqu and Ngari has been enhanced. Before the operation, three sets of grid-forming SVG simulation tests and on-site tests were completed. At the 35kV outgoing line of the Saga substation, an artificial three-phase short-circuit test of the grid-forming SVG was conducted, verifying its reactive power and voltage support, transient inertia instantaneous response, and overload capacity of three times for 10 seconds. This paper analyzes the simulation test and on-site test results of the grid-forming SVG, summarizes the on-site system tests, and the tests achieved the expected goals and effects. The test results show that the dynamic characteristics of the grid-forming SVG meet the technical requirements of project design, and it can provide reactive power and voltage support as well as transient active power support for the power grid. During the power grid fault period, it can maintain the grid-forming characteristics and achieve the power grid support capability required by the project design."

This is achieved by introducing additional compensatory displacements of the manipulator working tool and continuously correcting its orientation based on real-time data about actual angular and linear deviations of the vehicle from its initial stabilized position. At the same time, the desired movement velocity of the working tool along the prescribed trajectory is dynamically adjusted in such a way that the manipulator can compensate for inevitable undesired displacements of the vehicle from stabilization point. The results of comprehensive MATLAB/Simulink simulations confirmed the efficiency of the proposed method and demonstrated its effectiveness in improving the operational accuracy of complex underwater manipulation operations."

Using stacking images is essential for enabling better diagnostic accuracy in orthopedics, dentistry, trauma, and oncology, as there is a great need to visualize complex diagnosis and treatment. While stitching offers up a more accurate image with fewer misregistration errors compared to other pan radiography composition techniques, stitching is also prone to errors of misalignment, which may simulate fractures, seams, or ghosting artifacts. Current techniques using stitching is mostly affected by not enough exposures, misaligned shooting, or object geometries or shapes. This project is built upon the features of extracting images, estimating homographies, and image blending method that should automate the X-ray image stitching project in Python using OpenCV. The proof of concept tool will hopefully support and minimize repeated imaging (and thereby patient exposure to radiation) while being easily/capably integrated into existing radiologist workflows in less time. In addition, it will provide an accurate and coherent visualization to assist in advancing patient care in the context of emergency, oncology, or veterinary hospital contexts for clinical decision making."

About 73 million individuals in India suffer from diabetes, underscoring the urgent need for early DR detection to stop visual loss. Conventional diagnosis techniques, which require in-depth retinal exams, are frequently resourceand time-limited. In order to create intelligent algorithms for effective fundus image analysis and DR diagnosis, this work investigates the use of cutting-edge Deep Learning (DL) technology. To find out how well five pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) detected different stages of DR, we tested them. According to our research, EfficientNetB4 performed exceptionally well in validation accuracy, whereas DenseNet201 obtained the best training accuracy. Despite issues such as data set imbalance resulting in overfitting, mobile-based designs, such as EfficientNets and MobileNets, showed higher performance. InceptionV3 had the lowest overfitting risk, whereas ResNet50 had the greatest. The best models for feature extraction and classification turned out to be EfficientNetB4 and Xception. In addition to outlining future research possibilities, such as the incorporation of attention mechanisms and model fine-tuning to further increase performance and prevent overfitting, this study highlights the promise of DL CNN architectures in improving DR detection."

    "abstract": "Good quality code is required in contemporary software development to prevent defects and maintain systems stable. Rules and guesses are not effective for intricate projects. In this research, a new approach is proposed through the application of Deep Learning (DL), Reinforcement Learning (RL), and BERT for enhancing defect prediction. DL studies past data like code changes, bug reports, and complexity. RL helps improve accuracy by adjusting strategies and picking key code areas to check or fix. The system learns over time and becomes smarter. Tests show better results in quality and fewer bugs with this smart approach."

    "abstract": "In the fifth-generation (5G) communication era, efficient transmitter operations are essential, with channel encoding and interleaving mitigating random and burst errors to ensure reliable communication. In military communications and spectrum surveillance systems, which operate in non-cooperative environments, and cognitive radio systems, encoder and interleaver parameters are often unknown, necessitating blind identification. While existing research focuses on separately identifying channel encoders and interleavers with high accuracy across various channels, their joint identification remains largely unexplored. We propose a joint identification framework for channel encoders and interleavers over Rayleigh and additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels. Our approach leverages advanced deep learning models, including hybrid convolutional neural network (CNN)-support vector machine (SVM), deep residual networks (DRN), and capsule networks (CapsNet), and compares their performance against standard CNN, dense neural network (DenseNet), recurrent neural network (RNN), CNN+attention, and autoencoder network models. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed models outperform the baselines, with CapsNet achieving the highest accuracy. Notably, we observe that increasing the input size from 1024 to 16,384 (in powers of two) significantly improves classification accuracy. We analyze classification time and model complexity, showing our joint model reduces latency by 26.6% compared to separate encoder and interleaver identification. We also perform an ablation study on the CapsNet model to determine its optimal architecture, achieving a balance between accuracy and classification time. Finally, we validate our models on a hardware setup using a universal software radio peripheral (USRP) B210-based GNU Radio companion interface. The hardware results closely align with the simulated outcomes, underscoring the robustness and practical applicability of our approach."

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) can benefit applications using Multi-Hop Drone Networks (MDNs), but their distributed and dynamic connectivity challenges model training and aggregation. Traditional FL assumes stable topology and central server access, whereas MDNs rely on peer-to-peer exchanges without continuous connectivity, making it hard to ensure local model contributions are meaningful and non-redundant. To address this, we present a distributed participant selection algorithm in the context of MDNs. Specifically, at the beginning of each FL round, drones first identify their neighbors and measure the quality of communication links. With the identified neighbors, the drones select a subset of them to participate in the FL process based on their own and their neighbors’ contributions to the data needed for FL. This is done in a distributed manner, ensuring that only valuable data, which incorporates full sensor and area coverage, contributes to the FL model. For the subset of drones selected, we found the best path for these drones to transmit the local model via a distributed Steiner Tree problem formulation. Our simulation studies show that our distributed participant selection converges in 13 communication rounds for networks of up to 160 drones and achieves utility scores within 10% of a centralized baseline. Over 150 FL rounds with a real-world dataset, the trained global model using our approach yields an RMSE of 26.8% higher than the best centralized model. These results demonstrate the potential of our approach to enable resilient and scalable learning in dynamic drone networks, thereby advancing FL applications in distributed environments."

    "abstract": "In neural architecture search (NAS) methods based on latent space optimization (LSO), a deep generative model is trained to embed discrete neural architectures into a continuous latent space. In this case, different optimization algorithms that operate in the continuous space can be implemented to search neural architectures. However, the optimization of latent variables is challenging for gradient-based LSO since the mapping from the latent space to the architecture performance is generally non-convex. To tackle this problem, the present paper develops a convexity regularized latent space optimization (CR-LSO) method, which aims to regularize the learning process of latent space in order to obtain a convex architecture performance mapping. Specifically, CR-LSO trains a graph variational autoencoder (G-VAE) to learn the continuous representations of discrete architectures. Simultaneously, the learning process of latent space is regularized by the guaranteed convexity of input convex neural networks (ICNNs). In this way, the G-VAE is forced to learn a convex mapping from the architecture representation to the architecture performance. Hereafter, the CR-LSO approximates the performance mapping using the ICNN and leverages the estimated gradient to optimize neural architecture representations. Experimental results on three popular NAS benchmarks show that CR-LSO achieves competitive evaluation results in terms of both computational complexity and architecture performance."

While it is well-known that a network coding advantage exists in directed graphs, the situation in undirected graphs is much less understood – in particular, despite significant effort, it is not even known whether network coding is helpful at all for unicast sessions.In this paper we study the multi-source multicast network coding problem in undirected graphs. There are k sources broadcasting each to a subset of nodes in a graph of size n. The corresponding combinatorial problem is a version of the Steiner tree packing problem, and the network coding question asks whether the multicast coding rate exceeds the tree-packing rate.We give the first super–constant bound to this problem, demonstrating an example with a coding advantage of $\\Omega(\\log k)$. In terms of graph size, we obtain a lower bound of $2^{\\tilde{\\Omega}(\\sqrt{\\log \\log n})}$. We also obtain an upper bound of $O(\\log n)$ on the gap.Our main technical contribution is a new reduction that converts locally-decodable codes in the low-error regime into multicast coding instances. This gives rise to a new family of explicitly constructed graphs, which may have other applications."

    "abstract": "Motivated by connections between algebraic complexity lower bounds and tensor decompositions, we investigate Koszul-Young flattenings, which are the main ingredient in recent lower bounds for matrix multiplication. Based on this tool we give a new algorithm for decomposing an $n_{1} \\times n_{2} \\times n_{3}$ tensor as the sum of a minimal number of rank-1 terms, and certifying uniqueness of this decomposition. For $n_{1} \\leq n_{2} \\leq n_{3}$ with $n_{1} \\rightarrow \\infty$ and $n_{3} / n_{2}=O(1)$, our algorithm is guaranteed to succeed when the tensor rank is bounded by $r \\leq(1-\\epsilon)\\left(n_{2}+n_{3}\\right)$ for an arbitrary $\\epsilon \\gt 0$, provided the tensor components are generically chosen. For any fixed $\\epsilon$, the runtime is polynomial in $n_{3}$. When $n_{2}=n_{3}=n$, our condition on the rank gives a factor-of- 2 improvement over the classical simultaneous diagonalization algorithm, which requires $r \\leq n$, and also improves on the recent algorithm of Koiran (2024) which requires $r \\leq 4 n / 3$. It also improves on the PhD thesis of Persu (2018) which solves rank detection for $r \\leq 3 n / 2$. We complement our upper bounds by showing limitations, in particular that no flattening of the style we consider can surpass rank $n_{2}+n_{3}$. Furthermore, for $n \\times n \\times n$ tensors, we show that an even more general class of degree- $\\boldsymbol{d}$ polynomial flattenings cannot surpass rank Cn for a constant $C=C(d)$. This suggests that for tensor decompositions, the case of generic components may be fundamentally harder than that of random components, where efficient decomposition is possible even in highly overcomplete settings."

    "abstract": "Derandomization is one of the classic topics studied in the theory of parallel computations, dating back to the early 1980s. Despite much work, all known techniques lead to deterministic algorithms that are not work-efficient. For instance, for the well-studied problem of maximal independent set-e.g., [Karp, Wigderson STOC’84; Luby STOC’ 85; Luby FOCS’88]-state-of-theart deterministic algorithms require at least $m \\cdot \\operatorname{poly}(\\log n)$ work, where m and n denote the number of edges and vertices. Hence, these deterministic algorithms will remain slower than their trivial sequential counterparts unless we have at least poly $(\\log n)$ processors. In this paper, we present a generic parallel derandomization technique that moves exponentially closer to work-efficiency. The method iteratively rounds fractional solutions representing the randomized assignments to integral solutions that provide deterministic assignments, while maintaining certain linear or quadratic objective functions, and in an essentially work-efficient manner. As example end-results, we use this technique to obtain deterministic algorithms with $m \\cdot \\operatorname{poly}(\\log \\log n)$ work and poly $(\\log n)$ depth for problems such as maximal independent set, maximal matching, and hitting set."

Accurate classification of these conditions is essential for timely intervention, yet current computer-aided methods often exhibit limited representational capacity, feature redundancy, and insufficient interpretability, restricting clinical applicability. We propose PASAformer, a Swin-Transformer-based framework for cerebrovascular disease classification on Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA). PASAformer incorporates a Pathology-Aware Sparse Attention (PASA) module that emphasizes lesion-related regions while suppressing background redundancy. Inserted into the Swin backbone, PASA replaces dense window self-attention, improving computational efficiency while preserving the hierarchical architecture. We further employ the MiAMix data augmenter to increase sample diversity, and incorporate a CombinedAdapter encoder that injects anatomical priors from the frozen Medical Segment Anything Model (MED-SAM) into early-stage representations, strengthening discriminative power under limited supervision. To support research in this underexplored area, we curate CDSA-NEO, a proprietary DSA dataset comprising more than 1,700 static images across four major cerebrovascular disease categories, constituting the first large-scale benchmark of its kind. Furthermore, an external cohort of angiographic runs with sequential, unselected frames is used to assess robustness in realistic temporal workflows. Extensive experiments on CDSA-NEO and public vascular datasets demonstrate that PASAformer achieves competitive precision and balanced accuracy compared to representative state-of-the-art models, while providing more focused visual explanations. These results suggest that PASAformer can support automated cerebrovascular disease classification on angiography, and that CDSA-NEO provides a benchmark for future method development and evaluation."

    "abstract": "This work is concerned with the asynchronous output feedback sliding mode control (SMC) of stochastic nonlinear Markov jump systems (MJSs) via Takagi–Sugeno fuzzy models. Due to some real-world environment limitations, the actual system modes that are not directly available for controller synthesis are known as hidden modes. Then the sliding surface/sliding mode controller modes are featured as observable modes, and the relationship between these two concepts is established by employing emission probabilities. As a two-layer stochastic process, the hidden Markov model (HMM) governs the jump parameters and characterizes the asynchronous mode switching phenomenon between the original plant and the sliding surface/sliding mode controller. By integrating the sliding surface with the dynamical features of fuzzy MJSs, the dynamics of the sliding motion are described by constructing a T–S fuzzy singular MJS. Under a unified convexification setup, novel dissipative performance and stochastic stability analysis results on the sliding motion are proposed. In view of the full MJS states also not measurable, a novel observed-mode-based asynchronous output feedback dynamic SMC synthesis approach is propounded to ensure the MJSs’ states are located in a vicinity of the sliding surface. Illustrative simulation examples are finally provided to validate the superiority and effectiveness of the developed scheme."

This study evaluates the performance of two deep learning models using two different optimizers for automatic screening and severity grading of DR from retinal fundus images. The models compared are a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a Residual Network (ResNet-50), trained with Adaptive Moment Estimation (ADAM) and Stochastic Gradient Descent with Momentum (SGDM). Two public datasets, APTOS and EyePACS, were used. Images were preprocessed using Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) for contrast enhancement and data augmentation for class balance. Performance was evaluated using accuracy, area under the curve (AUC), F1-score, recall, and precision. ResNet-50 with the ADAM optimizer achieved the best results, with an accuracy of 80.71% and an AUC of 0.9539 on the APTOS dataset. These results show that ResNet-50 with ADAM is an effective model for automated DR screening and can support early detection and prevention of diabetes-related vision loss."

A novel monocular re-initialization function and visual-loss reconstruction mechanism are designed to predict camera poses through IMU-encoder fusion when visual tracking fails, followed by rapid re-initialization once sufficient features reappear. Additionally, wall-following sensors are employed to construct wall-point constraint edges, ensuring geometric stability and improving mapping completeness. Experimental results on self-collected datasets under different illumination levels demonstrate that the proposed method achieves a trajectory error reduction of 75.9% compared with ORB-SLAM3, a re-initialization success rate of 97.2%, and a time-efficiency improvement of 40.01%.

In order to address the limitations of existing technologies, this paper develops an airborne high-voltage voltage verification device using a multi-rotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) as a carrier. This device can measure the spatial continuous electric field distribution along the flight path of adopted UAV. By setting an alert threshold, the state of transmission line (energized, de-energized, or in an induced voltage state) can be reliably determined. The use of this device eliminates the need for tower climbing, as operators can complete close-range voltage verification by controlling the UAV from the ground. The verification process is unaffected by geographical environmental conditions or voltage levels, making it significantly safer and more efficient compared to existing methods."

When an e-trailer is combined with an internal combustion engine (ICE) truck unit, the resulting system functions as a hybrid vehicle. This configuration offers reduced fuel consumption, which also lowers greenhouse gas emissions and fuel costs. Alternatively, combining an e-trailer with an electric truck unit increases the truck's capacity and driving range. This allows longer haulages and can reduce infrastructure needed for charging the truck’s batteries. The system has some drawbacks, such as the initial cost of the e-trailer and the increased mass.

    "abstract": "Resting tremor suppression stands as a major problem in rehabilitation engineering. Traditional techniques, like pharmacological therapies and invasive surgical operations, typically bring about severe side effects, variable efficacy, and financial pressures. Notably, stiffness-based exoskeleton systems fabricated for tremor attenuation tend to feature large mass and low integration with natural biomechanical movement. To subdue these limitations, this research assesses the viability of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) gel as a high-performance electroactive polymer for tremor suppression. Via the systematic experimental testing of the material's mechanical properties, displacement aspects, capability of output-force production, and dynamic response, the study brings forward some positive features: short response time, light weight, compact shape, and high energy efficiency. Notably, the response bandwidth has a cutoff at 9 Hz that fully covers the standard 4-6 Hz range of human resting tremor. Notably, the response bandwidth has a 9 Hz cutoff that fully spans the normal 4-6 Hz range of human resting tremor."

    "abstract": "Step-down circuits like the BUCK converter serve as essential power sources for a wide array of electronic devices and systems. It is of great importance to research and develop a method that can accurately diagnose and issue warnings when soft faults occur in these power supplies. The paper proposes a soft fault diagnosis method for power converters based on a dual-channel time-frequency transform and machine learning. The method is capable of accurately diagnosing and localizing faults in DC-DC converters, even in the presence of sensor noise. First, the output voltage curves of the converter are collected under normal and various soft fault conditions, taking the presence of sensor noise into account. Then, these output voltage curves undergo both Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) and Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) to extract their frequency-domain features, which are then combined into a dual-channel data format. Finally, this dual-channel data is used to train a Vision Transformer (ViT) model. The trained model is subsequently used to perform soft fault detection and localization."

    "abstract": "The remarkable success of Deep Learning approaches is often demonstrated on large public datasets. However, when applying such approaches to internal, private datasets, one frequently faces challenges arising from structural differences in the datasets, domain shift, and the lack of labels. This leads practitioners to face a cold-start problem: they cannot determine which model or configuration is reliable without labels. Alternatives such as manual annotation, heuristic thresholding, or blindly applying models are either costly or unreliable. In this work, we introduce Tabular Data Adapters (TDA), a method for generating pseudo-labels for unlabeled tabular data in outlier detection (OD) tasks. By identifying statistically similar public datasets and transforming private data (based on a shared autoencoder) into a format compatible with state-of-the-art public models, our approach enables the generation of weak labels. These labels provide a starting point for training, tuning, and calibrating OD models in label-scarce scenarios. It can thereby help to mitigate the cold start problem of labeling by basing on existing outlier detection models for public datasets. In experiments on 50 tabular datasets across different domains, we demonstrate that our method is able to provide more accurate annotations than baseline approaches while reducing computational time. Our approach offers a scalable, efficient, and cost-effective solution to bridge the gap between public research models and real-world industrial applications."

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) is a paradigm that enables collaborative machine learning without disclosing the local data of the participants. However, in real-world FL deployment scenarios, some unscrupolous clients may alter the training process to skew the global model towards their local optimum, unfairly prioritizing their data distribution. Their influence can degrade overall model performance for normal clients and reduce fairness in the system. We call this novel category of misbehaving clients “selfish”. This work proposes a Fair and Robust strategy for aggregation in the FL server to mitigate the effect of Selfish clients (FairRFL). FairRFL incorporates a novel technique to recover (or estimate) the true updates from selfish clients by using robust statistics, specifically the median of norms. The presented strategy, through the inclusion of the recovered updates in the aggregation process, is robust against selfish behavior. Through extensive empirical evaluations with WISDM-W and CIFAR-10 datasets, we observe that a selfish client can increase the model accuracy on its data by up to 39% and more than quadruple the accuracy variance among clients, which FairRFL can address perfectly and recover performance fairness across normal clients."

    "abstract": "Methamphetamine dependence poses a significant global health challenge, yet its assessment and the evaluation of treatments like repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) frequently depend on subjective self-reports, which may introduce uncertainties. While objective neuroimaging modalities such as electroencephalography (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) offer alternatives, their individual limitations and the reliance on conventional, often hand-crafted, feature extraction can compromise the reliability of derived biomarkers. To overcome these limitations, we propose NeuroCLIP, a novel deep learning framework integrating simultaneously recorded EEG and fNIRS data through a progressive learning strategy. This approach offers a robust and trustworthy data-driven biomarker for methamphetamine addiction. Validation experiments show that NeuroCLIP significantly improves discriminative capabilities among the methamphetamine-dependent individuals and healthy controls compared to models using either EEG or only fNIRS alone. Furthermore, the proposed framework facilitates objective, brain-based evaluation of rTMS treatment efficacy, demonstrating measurable shifts in neural patterns towards healthy control profiles after treatment. Critically, we establish the trustworthiness of the multimodal data-driven biomarker by showing its strong correlation with psychometrically validated craving scores. These findings suggest that biomarker derived from EEG-fNIRS data via NeuroCLIP offers enhanced robustness and reliability over single-modality approaches, providing a valuable tool for addiction neuroscience research and potentially improving clinical assessments."

    "abstract": "Satellite clustering has the potential to enhance inter-satellite cooperation, resist satellite malfunction, and enable more agile space-air-ground integrated applications. This paper investigates a promising model for clustered low Earth orbit (LEO) systems, in which one typical unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) can assist one satellite cluster to serve one random terrestrial user. Particularly, intra-cluster satellites can communicate user, while inter-cluster satellites are regarded as interference. Two types of satellites and users are randomly deployed at three visible spherical spaces by adopting three independent spherical Poisson point processes. In the modeling, an adaptive selecting mechanism is proposed to pick the strongest received signal between direct and cooperative transmissions. To facilitate a simpler analysis, we firstly transform the three spaces into the three planes through modifying their respective density. Next, assuming that the shadowed-Rician fading is employed in the satellite channel, two Gamma random variables are utilized to approximately express the aggregated power of interference and noise received by the UAV and user, respectively. Subsequently, the exact conditional user association and approximate Laplace transform of the accumulated signal power are derived to further investigate the conditional coverage probability. Finally, simulation results illustrate that: 1) Moderate satellite cluster sizes combined with a UAV altitude of about 200m are beneficial for achieving higher coverage probability; and 2) The adaptive selection mechanism generally achieves comparable or better performance than traditional transmissions by leveraging spatial diversity."

In online settings-where edges arrive one at a time and must be colored immediately-a simple greedy algorithm uses at most $2 \\Delta-1$ colors. Over thirty years ago, Bar-Noy, Motwani, and Naor [IPL’92] proved that this guarantee is optimal among deterministic algorithms when $\\Delta=O(\\log n)$, and among randomized algorithms when $\\Delta=O(\\sqrt{\\log n})$. While deterministic improvements seemed out of reach, they conjectured that for graphs with $\\Delta=\\omega(\\log n)$, randomized algorithms can achieve $(1+o(1)) \\Delta$ edge coloring. This conjecture was recently resolved in the affirmative: a $(1+o(1)) \\Delta$ coloring is achievable online using randomization for all graphs with $\\Delta=\\omega(\\log n)$ [BSVW STOC’24]. Our results go further, uncovering two findings not predicted by the original conjecture. First, we give a deterministic online algorithm achieving $(1+o(1)) \\Delta$-colorings for all $\\Delta=\\omega(\\log n)$. Second, we give a randomized algorithm achieving $(1+o(1)) \\Delta$ colorings already when $\\Delta=\\omega(\\sqrt{\\log n})$. Our results establish sharp thresholds for when greedy can be surpassed, and nearoptimal guarantees can be achieved - matching the impossibility results of [BNMN IPL’92], both deterministically and randomly."

Traditional software testing solutions are unable to track the changes in complexity when testing hybrid mobile applications that interface with both native and web components. In this paper, we present an approach for a Context-Aware Gray Box Framework (GBF) for hybrid mobile application testing that attempts to merge 'structural analysis' with behavioral modeling. Partial access to the source code and a simulated dynamic user interface (UI) at runtime are considered as part of the GBF in order to produce optimized test cases providing a blend of code-level precision and user-level coverage. Since the framework converges both white-box and black-box approach strategies, our approach improves automation and efficiency when testing hybrid mobile applications for error detection. Studies that were experimental found that the GBF had up to 94 % accuracy when studying bugs and up to 89 % coverage in buggy hybrid mobile applications using the Android ecosystem, and produced better results than existing tools such as Monkey Runner and Robolectric."

Utilizing a systematic literature review paired with grounded theory analysis, we identify the principal hurdles in SCF: operational bottlenecks, transparency issues, and regulatory constraints. The results emphasize that blockchain’s capacity for bridging the gaps in conventional financing models can catapult SMEs toward sustainable growth and more robust market strategies. By facilitating a transparent, efficient, and secure SCF environment, blockchain stands out as a transformative force, signaling a paradigm shift in SME financial operations.

However, the problem of poultry diseases is increasingly growing, causing much damage to the economy.

The problem of identification results may be high, but there is a lack of transparency and clarity for the results when diagnosing, which is called explanation. Therefore, the study proposes to use Explainable AI to explain the classification results of the VGG19 model and evaluate the explanation results by Intersection on Union. The results show that the model achieves an accuracy of about 86# on a dataset of healthy chickens and eight different diseases with several transformed images of more than 13,000.

This paper focuses on investigating the impact of the LLM task and its collaborative scheduling with robot task in EFEM and VM. A Petri net (PN) model is established to depict the coordinated operation of EFEM, VM, and LLM. Based on the proposed PN model, the situation in which the LLM-related circuit ratios become tool bottlenecks is analyzed. Accordingly, two algorithms are developed to rationally allocate the robot waiting times, thereby achieving optimal collaborative scheduling among the EFEM, LLM, and VM.

    "abstract": "Deep learning is reshaping healthcare across medical imaging, clinical text, time-series physiology, and genomics. This review synthesizes methods and applications with emphasis on model families (CNN/UNet/ViT; RNN/Transformers), datasets and evaluation practices (AUROC/AUPRC, Dice, calibration, external validation). We summarize benefits—earlier detection, consistent triage and personalized decision support—alongside persistent challenges including data quality and shift, fairness, interpretability, privacy and regulatory alignment. To support responsible translation, we propose a practical evaluation checklist covering robustness, calibration, subgroup performance and workflow integration. We conclude with near-term research priorities: self-supervised and federated learning for data efficiency and privacy, multimodal modeling for holistic patient state and prospective validation with post-deployment monitoring. This synthesis aims to guide researchers and practitioners toward clinically credible, trustworthy AI systems."

    "abstract": "In an era marked by heightened uncertainty, the increasing frequency and severity of emergency events pose significant challenges to societal stability and public safety. Situational awareness (SA) is a critical prerequisite for effective emergency decision-making in response to such major incidents. To address the current lack of systematic interpretation within existing SA theories and methodologies, this study proposes a unified “state-potential” representation framework to enhance the modeling of emergency scenarios. Grounded in a structured paradigm of “risk sources-risk exposures-mitigation factors–environment”, we extract key situational elements and formally define both the static “state” and dynamic “potential” of emergency events. A novel modeling approach is introduced to capture the current scenario characteristics and forecast its possible evolution. Experimental validation demonstrates the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed model, offering theoretical and practical support for improved emergency decision-making."

    "abstract": "Robotic coreless filament winding (RCFW) offers significant potential in sustainable lightweight construction. In the process considered here, resin-impregnated fibers are wound around pins of a winding frame using an industrial robot. An Autonomous Mobile Robot (AMR) delivers the winding frame to the robot. Due to the limited positioning accuracy of the AMR and the manufacturing tolerances of the winding frame, precise knowledge of the pin positions is essential for robot path planning and the robot-AMR collaboration. This paper presents a concept for camera-based detection of pin positions and automated generation and adaptation of the robot path. To this end, a vision system is integrated into an existing robot cell, the necessary processing algorithms are developed, and the accuracy achieved is examined. Furthermore, a control architecture is suggested that allows camera-based teach-in without changing the industrial robot’s controller and interfaces. As a result, manual teach-in is no longer required, the degree of automation of the winding process is significantly increased, and robot-AMR collaboration is enabled."

    "abstract": "An approach to assessing the speed of steady-state forward motion of an autonomous unmanned underwater vehicle relative to water based on the measured rotation frequency of the propellers of its propulsion units has been proposed and tested in practice. The approach is based on the analysis of the dependence of the AUV’s hydrodynamic resistance calculated using its 3D model and the rotation frequency of its propulsion units required for forward motion on the speed of the oncoming flow. These dependencies were determined for the MMT-3500 AUV developed at the IMTP FEB RAS based on the results of virtual testing of its 3D model, the analysis of which revealed the constancy of the relative pitch of the cruise thrusters propellers in the entire range of speeds of steady motion. In this case, to calculate the required rotation frequency of the propulsion units for the AUV’s movement, an analytical representation of the propeller thrust coefficient from the relative pitch was used. The speed of the oncoming flow is estimated based on the average rotation frequency of the four propulsion units, taking into account the constancy of the relative pitch of the propellers revealed during the computational experiment. During the analysis of the results of full-scale tests of the MMT-3500 AUV in steady-state motion mode, estimates of the effectiveness of the proposed approach were obtained."

    "abstract": "In recent years, ensuring maritime safety has been one of the most critical issues. During an incident, people falling into the sea are very difficult to detect with the eye, especially in adverse meteorological conditions such as strong winds, storms, high waves and low light conditions. Therefore, there is a need for new methods to support and apply Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the search and rescue process to ensure rapid and reliable results. This article proposes a method to detect drowning people based on the You Only Look Once (YOLOv11) deep learning model that combines data from Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensors, AI cameras and thermal cameras. Meanwhile, the intelligent human detection algorithm allows for calculating the estimated location, distance and condition of the victim to provide timely rescue plans. In addition, the Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV) model and maritime scenarios developed in Unity 3D can be tested to ensure the safety of human life. As a result, YOLOv11 achieved a higher mAP compared to previous YOLO versions and maintained real-time speed. The multi-sensor fusion method showed superior performance compared to single models when applied to the USV system in sea rescue operations, enabling rapid and accurate detection of victims or hazardous objects."

Four major themes emerged from the dataset: engagement, barriers (to technology and communication), instructional effectiveness, and feedback mechanisms. The major set of recommendations is aimed at overcoming barriers to communication bottlenecks and making the online learning experience more engaging for students. This set of recommendations includes the use of formative assessments and addresses problems identified with current e-learning platforms."

Unlike prior RGB-based methods, X-Change employs rule-based spectral supervision from bi-temporal Sentinel-2 data, enabling its shared encoder to internalize NDVI/NDWI-related cues for both captioning and segmentation tasks. Experiments on the MOSAIC-SEN2-CC dataset show that X-Change surpasses state-of- the-art RGB-based models and matches or slightly exceeds those trained on multispectral inputs, producing spatially consistent change and index maps. Overall, X-Change bridges the gap between RGB and MS modalities, offering an interpretable and practical framework for spectral-aware, multi-task, and explainable change captioning.

    "abstract": "Remote sensing image captioning (RSIC) aims to translate remote sensing images (RSIs) into textual descriptions, where Transformer-based approaches have attained remarkable performance. However, the prohibitive computational costs of self-attention and cross-attention on high-resolution features compel existing RSIC methods to rely on pre-trained backbones or prerequisite tasks to compress input RSIs, resulting in the loss of multi-scale semantic information and hindering end-to-end training and inference. To address this challenge, we propose an Attention Matrix Expansion Mechanism, which endows the approximation of large-scale global self-attention and cross-attention with negligible computational overhead (e.g., only +0.173 GFLOPs). Building on this mechanism, we design BoostTransformer, a RSIC framework constituted by two core components: BoostEncoder, a lightweight Transformer encoder that directly processes raw RSIs to achieve panoramic feature extraction, and BoostDecoder, a lightweight Transformer decoder that extensively integrates multi-scale encoder features, thereby boost the quality of generated captions. We further derive a training paradigm from experiments for end-to-end training RSIC model from scratch. Extensive experimental results demonstrate our end-to-end lightweight model achieves competitive performance without pre-training. The code will be available at https://github.com/ACT-WAVE/BoostTransformer."

However, its direct application to inverse RL problems is limited by its reliance on known cost functions. To overcome this limitation, we propose a modified Kleinman iteration algorithm that simultaneously estimates the cost weight and the value function matrix during policy evaluation without an additional update step for the cost weight, thereby improving computational efficiency and reducing the number of iterations. Moreover, we develop a data-driven inverse RL algorithm by introducing a piecewise constant, persistently exciting input during the data collection phase. This design avoids the use of Kronecker product operations by reducing the dimensionality of the matrices. The convergence properties and solution non-uniqueness of the proposed method are rigorously analyzed. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms is demonstrated through simulations on a power system model, with performance comparisons against existing approaches."

In this letter, we present MeG-DiffSAR, a diffusion-based network for synthesizing SAR sea–ship scenes. First, we introduce a localized generation strategy that formulates high-fidelity mixed-scene synthesis as an inpainting task, focusing primarily on the boundary regions between ships and the surrounding sea surface. In order to enhance the realism of synthesized images, then a mask-enhanced multi-head self-attention mechanism (MeMSM) is proposed to guide the network’s focus toward masked regions, thereby generating contextually consistent inpainting results. At last, a gradient-aware loss is incorporated to improve the textural fidelity and visual quality of synthesized images. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Especially, compared to the state-of-the-art method Ship-Go, MeG-DiffSAR reduces FID by 13.64 and improves PSNR by 14.17dB."

Different types of multilevel inverters exist, including diode-clamped, flying capacitor, and cascaded Hbridge inverters, each with its own specific characteristics and suitability different applications. However, their complex structure comprising numerous switches, capacitors, and DC sources makes them susceptible to faults that can disrupt performance or cause system failure.

The problem is formulated as a constrained multi-objective optimization model that simultaneously considers path length, constraint violations, and trajectory smoothness. To solve this, we propose the Genetic-Enhanced Nutcracker Optimization Algorithm (GNOA), a hybrid metaheuristic that integrates genetic algorithm operators into the Nutcracker Optimization Algorithm (NOA) to improve search diversity and convergence performance. GNOA introduces a crossover-enhanced foraging strategy, a mutation-driven cachesearch recovery mechanism, and adaptive boundary constraints to ensure feasibility. Experimental results demonstrate that GNOA achieves superior performance compared to existing algorithms in generating collision-free and energy-efficient trajectories in complex three-dimensional environments."

The overall voltage amplification can be adjusted by modifying the duty ratio of the switching device as well as the turn proportions of the coupled inductors, offering operational adaptability under various load or input conditions. The main attributes of this architecture include straightforward control with one active switch, reduced power dissipation due to lower switching and conduction losses, continuous current at the input side, and a shared ground reference for input and output terminals. Simulated evaluations on a 200-Watt laboratory prototype at 50 kHz, supplied by 20 V and delivering 160 V at the output, verify proper functionality and high efficiency of the converter, indicating its effectiveness for integration in clean-energy and renewable-source systems."

    "abstract": "Data centers are emerging as critical infrastructure in the digital era, providing the essential computing power needed to run smart applications within the modern communities. To meet the demands of these applications, data center must be designed as high-performance facilities, achieving both high energy efficiency and operational resilience. However, the growing volume of data collection and the need for real-time decisionmaking by applications running in the data center information and communication (ICT) devices, require an evolution of Data Center Management System (DCMS). The DCMS must be capable of optimizing the resilient operation of internal subsystems while seamlessly integrating external services. This paper introduces a conceptual framework for a next-generation DCMS, detailing its architectural layers, the inter-dependencies among subsystems, and integration with the application layer. The proposed framework is analyzed in the context of advanced artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, aiming to achieve key DCMS objectives such as minimizing energy consumption and carbon emissions, enhancing operational resilience, and optimizing resource allocation. Key challenges related to this integration are addressed, alongside an exploration of emerging trends and future research directions. This study provides a foundational framework for DCMS, highlighting the central role of data centers in enabling adaptive, efficient, and robust operation of the smart critical applications of today's digital society."

    "abstract": "Multi-phase interleaved LLC resonant converters have been introduced as a promising solution to meet the growing demands for high power density, reduced current rating of each module, and improved efficiency. However, operating multiple LLC modules at the same switching frequency often leads to significant current imbalance due to the component tolerances in the resonant tanks. This results in degraded output quality, output current imbalance, and reduced reliability. To overcome the stated challenges, a twophase LLC converter is demonstrated in this study, in which current balancing is achieved by independently adjusting a variable inductor to tune the frequencies associated with the resonances of individual modules and reduce the effects of component mismatch. Simulation results using ANSYS Maxwell and MATLAB Simulink confirm the effectiveness of the proposed technique in enhancing the performance of interleaved LLC converters."

    "abstract": "India's healthcare system is undergoing a significant transformation with the emergence of smart hospitals, driven by the integration of Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and automation. These technologies are enhancing patient care, streamlining clinical operations, and addressing long-standing challenges such as overcrowded wards, limited skilled personnel, and urban-rural healthcare disparities. This narrative review explores the current landscape and future prospects of smart hospitals in India, highlighting key implementations, enabling technologies, and barriers to widespread adoption. IoT-enabled solutions such as smart beds, continuous vital sign monitoring, and RFID-based asset tracking facilitate real-time data collection, remote monitoring, and automated clinical alerts. AI-driven tools support diagnostics in radiology and pathology, while robotic process automation (RPA) improves efficiency in scheduling, billing, and data management. Institutions like AIIMS Delhi, Narayana Health, and Apollo Hospitals have implemented these technologies to reduce hospital-acquired infections, optimize emergency resource allocation, and improve diagnostic accuracy. Government initiatives such as the Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission (ABDM) are promoting digital integration and interoperability across India's healthcare system. However, challenges persist, including high implementation costs, inadequate infrastructure in smaller cities, data privacy concerns, and limited digital literacy among healthcare workers. To fully harness the potential of smart hospitals, India must invest in public-private partnerships, capacity building, and robust regulatory frameworks. Smart hospitals hold the potential to build a future-ready, efficient, and inclusive healthcare system in India."

The results are strongest among unbanked and rural users. Policy implications emphasize expanding rural connectivity, enhancing digital literacy, and strengthening interoperability rather than prioritizing fee reductions. The study extends the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and Diffusion of Innovation (DOI) theory by integrating perceived financial cost and mobile experience into the Moroccan context. Limitations include the use of a convenience sample and reliance on self-reported measures; future research should employ nationally representative or longitudinal data."

    "abstract": "Stakeholders, through their vested interest in a project hold the key to project success. Therefore, the management of them is crucial and mandatory. However, tasks involved in stakeholder management is not that simple and thus require tools to perform them. The challenge is that some of the existing methods, techniques and tools are incapable to fulfil the performance of these tasks. The evolvement and sophistication of project stakeholders do not make the situation easier too. In an attempt to address this challenge, researchers have developed software tools for effective and efficient of management stakeholders. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a technology that permeates and revolutionizes almost every business sector in terms of automation of tasks and efficiency improvement. AI has also found usage in various areas in project management. Although there is a wealth of research on the benefits of AI, little is known about how using AI tools has assisted project managers to manage stakeholders better. This study sought to address this research gap by conducting a systematic mapping review. The study found that AI has benefited the stakeholder management knowledge area by improving stakeholder identification, analysis, classification, particularly with the use of unsupervised machine learning algorithms for this task and risk management processes. However, the study also established that there is a need for much research in certain research categories such as, evaluation, proposal solution, philosophical, opinion and experience papers pertaining stakeholder management."

This paper proposes an automated TB detection system based on CNN, classifying chest X-rays as either TB-positive or TB-negative. The model is preprocessed with the resizing, normalization, and augmentation stages for higher robustness. The CNN architecture mainly uses layers of convolution that extract the features, pooling layers to reduce the dimensionality of the feature maps, and fully connected layers to class the images. Optimization was achieved through regularization and early stopping with a validation accuracy of 97.5 %. This automated approach helps achieve a scalable solution to reduce overburdened healthcare systems and decrease diagnostic delay accuracy."

This paper proposes a face-iris continuous authentication framework, combining dual-camera live acquisition, an automatic scheduler with periodicity of 15 min, and presence detection, along with adaptive neural scorelevel fusion. Testing on public datasets with subject-disjoint splits and transfer across datasets shows that the system performs at an accuracy of 98.6 % and EER of 1.4 %, outperforming unimodal and recent multimodal baselines. The system gives an equal emphasis on security, user experience, and deployment feasibility, while at the same time drawing attention towards promising research avenues in visible-light iris, adaptive re-authentication intervals, spoof resilience, and privacy-preserving template protection."

Here, n and λ denote the number of nodes and the graph’s arboricity, respectively. The $\\tilde O(n/\\lambda )$ query complexity of our algorithm is nearly optimal. Our constant approximation settles a question of Eden, Mossel, and Ron [SODA’22], who achieved an O(log<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> n) approximation with the same query and time complexity and asked whether a better approximation can be achieved using near-optimal query complexity.A key technical challenge in the problem is due to recursive algorithms based on probabilistic samplings, each with a non-negligible error probability. In our case, many of the recursions invoked could have bad probabilistic samples and result in high query complexities. The particular difficulty is that those bad recursions are not easy or cheap to detect and discard. Our approach runs multiple recursions in parallel, to attenuate the error probability, using a careful scheduling mechanism that manages the speed at which each of them progresses and makes our overall query complexity competitive with the single good recursion. We find this usage of parallelism and scheduling in a sublinear algorithm remarkable, and we are hopeful that similar ideas may find applications in a wider range of sublinear algorithms that rely on probabilistic recursions."

We provide a finite procedure to answer this question, thereby settling a foundational, three-decade-old open problem in secure computation and information complexity.Beaver-Chor-Kushilevitz [11], [22], [8] answered this question for deterministic output functions. Basu et al. [3] recently gave a geometric characterization of randomized functions securely computable with bounded communication complexity. Randomized functions can have arbitrarily high communication complexity, even for fixed input-output sets [5]. Without an upper bound on the communication complexity, the decidability of the question of whether a given two-party function with randomized output is securely computable was a formidable challenge.We reduce answering this question to proving specific lamination hulls are semi-algebraic. Lamination hulls are an infinite union of recursively defined sets independently motivated by the hydrodynamics literature. We connect this technical objective to solving a system of linear inequalities over convex sets in high dimensions, where inequalities represent the natural containment relation. We present a Gaussian elimination-inspired algorithm to compute the smallest simultaneous solutions to such systems. After that, using these solutions, we prove that our lamination hulls are semi-algebraic.Our technical solution introduces a novel set operator called positive geometric join. In our application context, it characterizes algebraically well-behaved sets that generalize polytopes, which we call hemihedra. The positive geometric join operator and hemihedral sets should interest the broader mathematics and computer science community. These advancements should help further information complexity investigations more broadly via the recently established connection by Basu et al. [3]."

Processing of the dataset was done in stages, dealing with missing values, engineering features related to time and scaling numerical attributes to help the model perform well. Among each model, the results of AutoGluon were best, reaching an accuracy of 95 % which linked to its ability to identify difficult feature links and improve model parameters.

However, many successful side-channel attacks (SCA) against lattice-based post-quantum cryptography (PQC) have demonstrated their security vulnerabilities. Number Theoretic Transform (NTT) is the basic sub-block in latticebased cryptography and a common target for SCA. Unlike the heavy investment on NTT software implementation against SCA, there is little reported study of its hardware implementation. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised learning-based belief propagation attack to break the NTT operation by leveraging power leakages captured from NTT hardware implementations (on Xilinx Artix-7). Our attack only requires the collection of 5000 power traces for profiling and the building of four templates. Based on this, we are able to apply belief propagation with only 20 power traces to reveal half of the input of a 256 -point NTT. This allows the retrieval of the secret coefficients in lattice-based cryptographic protocols."

    "abstract": "A following control strategy is essential to ensure compliant and safe tracking for mobile robots. However, existing human-robot following control methods exhibit high sensitivity to external disturbances, resulting in sluggish closed-loop responses and susceptibility to oscillations. There remains room for improvement in control compliance and precision. To address these limitations, this study proposes a second-order nonlinear active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) strategy based on admittance control. First, a human-robot following motion model was established based on spatial human-robot interaction theory. Next, the motion model was integrated with an admittance control framework, where carefully tuned admittance parameters ensured compliant tracking behavior. Finally, a second-order nonlinear ADRC controller was employed to regulate positional deviations, effectively suppressing disturbances caused by unstructured terrains on human-robot distance maintenance. This approach significantly enhanced the control accuracy of the mobile robot when tracking a target pedestrian. Simulation results demonstrated that the proposed algorithm achieved a compliance index of 0.031 and a tracking accuracy of 0.049 under external disturbances, outperforming both admittance-PID and model predictive control (MPC). Physical experiments further validated the method, with the robot exhibiting superior compliance and precision metrics, thereby realizing safe, compliant, and user-friendly human following."

    "abstract": "Hardware-in-the-Loop (HiL) simulation is a well-established technique for system validation in automotive development. As autonomous vehicles become more prevalent, the ability to demonstrate the credibility of these HiL systems becomes increasingly important. A key factor influencing this credibility is the verification of the simulation models used as a subsystem within the HiL environment. The increasing complexity of vehicle software leads to more complex simulation models, which in turn significantly raises the effort required for their verification. At the same time, with the shift towards software-defined vehicles, the demand for faster and more frequent incremental software updates is growing. This trend presents a substantial challenge for providers of HiL simulation models, who must keep pace without impairing the ability to demonstrate and document the credibility of the simulation models for every release. In this context, regression testing plays a crucial role in incremental development processes of simulation models, as it ensures that newly introduced changes do not negatively impact existing system behavior. To address this, this paper introduces a regression-based test case selection method to increase the efficiency of the verification of HiL simulation models. The approach performs graph-based signal flow analysis, identifies differences between consecutive simulation model releases, and selects reusable vehicle-level test cases for regression testing of a new simulation model increment."

This study develops a mechanism model for a 300 MW CAES system using MATLAB/Simulink, which comprehensively covers core processes and accurately simulates thermodynamic and dynamic responses. Model validation shows that key parameters exhibit a relative error < 1% versus design values. Simulation analysis reveals the dynamic variations of pressure, temperature, power, and rotational speed during energy storage and release phases, and elucidates energy conversion mechanisms in multi-stage compression and expansion. Sensitivity analysis demonstrates that rotational speed regulation and inlet temperature optimization significantly impact system efficiency.

    "abstract": "Sensor selection is an often under-appreciated aspect of state estimator or Kalman filter design. The basic minimum requirement for the choice of a sensor set while designing Kalman filters is that all states are observable. In addition, the sensors should be chosen with a view towards estimating the states with a desired accuracy. Often observability is treated as true/false check during filter design. Beyond observability — the observability degree — which measures how observable the states are, has been used as the metric of choice to for sensor selection or placement applications. The higher the degree of observability, the better the possibility of designing Kalman filters that achieve the desired state estimation accuracy and consistency requirements. When a wide variety of sensors are available, sometimes with cost and physical constraints involved, sensor selection plays a crucial role in filter design. In such situations it is important to know the expected contribution of each sensor towards observability degree. Shapley values, developed in cooperative game theory for fair allocation of the payout of a multi-player game to individual players, are widely used in machine learning to assess feature importance. This paper shows that Shapley values can indeed be leveraged to quantify the expected marginal contribution of each sensor in any given sensor set towards the observability degree. This quantification of the fair contribution of each sensor towards the observability degree can be leveraged by filter designers for sensor selection, placement and filter (state estimator) design."

To mitigate the risk of violating material specifications, we develop a distributionally robust optimization (DRO) framework that combines the Wasserstein metric with a Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) risk measure. Alloying constraints are expressed in terms of scenario-wise violations, and a robust CVaR bound is imposed that holds for all probability distributions within a Wasserstein ball around the empirical sample distribution. The resulting convex program minimizes expected blending costs while explicitly controlling the risk of specification violations. Numerical experiments with synthetic data show that increasing robustness through the Wasserstein radius can compensate for limited training data and ensures feasibility even for out-of-sample scenarios that deviate from the assumed distributions. In contrast to existing chance-constrained or bounded-uncertainty approaches, the combined Wasserstein–CVaR formulation captures both distributional ambiguity and tail-risk behavior in a single convex program."

    "abstract": "With the continuous increase in the penetration rate of renewable energy and the large-scale popularization of electric vehicles, the randomness of Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) access and the volatility of new energy output pose challenges to the stability of distribution networks. Moreover, traditional static scheduling struggles to meet the dynamic regulation needs of the system. To address this issue, this paper proposes a multi-objective scheduling optimization method for distribution networks and constructs a system encompassing a regional smart grid model, a scheduling framework, and a V2G scheduling model.This method clarifies the coordinated operation relationship among multiple charging stations connected within the same distribution network area, classifies V2G charging and discharging entities into two categories —energy storage batteries and charging pile clusters within charging stations — and quantifies their power characteristics. Three objectives are set: \"maximizing the net profit of charging stations\", \"minimizing power grid fluctuations\", and \"minimizing equipment loss\". Meanwhile, constraints such as capacity, power balance, and total discharge volume are incorporated to ensure feasibility.The Multi-Objective Genetic Particle Swarm Optimization (MOGPSO) algorithm is adopted to solve high-dimensional problems, and Pareto optimal solutions are maintained through an external archive. Simulation verification based on typical daily power curves shows that this method can shift the power generation period of charging station clusters to flat periods and the charging period of electric vehicles to the early-morning valley period. It effectively mitigates the peak-valley difference of grid loads, improves the absorption capacity of renewable energy, and ensures V2G user benefits, thereby providing technical support for large-scale V2G aggregated scheduling and multi-agent collaborative operation of smart grids."

A Gaussian window function is applied to the incident LFM heat flux for spectral reshaping as a post processing technique to enhance defect detectability. The defect detection capabilities of pulse compression of Gaussian windowed LFM signal have been compared with the conventional pulse compression technique using Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) as a figure of merit.

Misalignment at the moment of contact can induce rotation about the contact point, often leading to perching failure or damage. To address this, we present a minimal-sensing control framework that uses a single forward-facing range sensor to estimate the wall angle in real time via a yaw sweep maneuver. The estimated angle is then used to regulate the quadrotor’s yaw and approach velocity, ensuring perpendicular alignment before contact. The method is implemented on a micro quadrotor and validated through docking experiments on vertical surfaces. Results show a significant improvement in the estimation of yaw angle and stable contact with the vertical surface. The proposed method achieves over 90% success rate and maintains estimation errors within ±2° compared to open-loop alignment. This work demonstrates that combining simple sensing with active control enables robust physical interaction in unstructured environments."

The Arrhenius–Normal model provides an excellent fit to the relationship between lifetime and temperature, enabling accurate extrapolation of service life under normal operating conditions. The analysis shows that although both the mean and standard deviation of lifetime decrease with increasing stress, their ratio—the coefficient of variation—remains constant, consistent with observations reported in recent literature."

    "abstract": "The use of Morse functions on the Lie group SO(3) of rigid body rotations as Lyapunov functions for rigid body attitude control leads to almost globally asymptotically stable (AGAS) control laws. A Morse function on SO(3) has four critical points. When used as a Lyapunov function, it leads to a globally continuous state-dependent feedback control scheme with the minimum as the AGAS equilibrium of the feedback system. It is known that Morse functions give the largest possible domain of convergence with state-dependent and globally continuous feedback control laws. In this work, we explore the use of time-varying Morse functions for rigid body attitude control. This strategy can be used to parametrically stabilize desired equilibria or destabilize undesired equilibria of the feedback system. The positive gains of this Morse function are each the sum of a constant and a sinusoidal function of time. Linearization of the dynamics around the equilibria of the feedback system leads to decoupled Mathieu oscillators. Careful selection of these control gains can give parametric stability of the equilibria while varying these gains can lead to interesting behavior like period-doubling bifurcations. Numerical simulations of the nonlinear feedback system with control gains selected according to the linearized analysis show that the trajectory for an initial state on the stable manifold of an unstable equilibrium of this feedback system can be successfully stabilized."

The primary objective of this study is to reduce dependency on the upstream network, minimize power losses, and improve the voltage profile in distribution networks. The proposed model is simulated using GAMS software on the IEEE 33-bus standard network. The performance of the model is analyzed under four different operational scenarios. In the first scenario, the network operates solely with renewable energy sources. In the second scenario, battery energy storage systems are integrated into the network. The third scenario includes CHP units, while in the fourth scenario, fuel cells are incorporated into the system. The findings indicate that, compared to the base case, the presence of battery energy storage systems reduces the power drawn from the upstream network by 12.76%, CHP units lead to a 95.96% reduction, and fuel cells result in a 28.22% reduction. These results demonstrate that integrating distributed generation and energy storage systems can significantly decrease dependency on the upstream grid and enhance the stability and efficiency of the power system. Moreover, the results reveal that CHP units have the most significant impact on reducing network losses, achieving an 87.96% reduction, while battery energy storage systems contribute to a 31.04% reduction in losses. These findings highlight the importance of optimally integrating energy resources to improve network efficiency."

    "abstract": "Battery-Integrated Modular Multilevel Converters offer numerous advantages for electric transportation and battery energy storage systems. However, practical implementations involve battery modules with non-uniform states of charge, which lead to voltage imbalances and increased circulating currents. These effects, in turn, compromise overall efficiency and reduce battery lifespan. Despite their significance, a comprehensive study of these challenges remains lacking in literature. This paper proposes a real-time control strategy that employs extended Kalman filter for precise SOC estimation and balancing. To this end, the converter power and control blocks are analyzed, with particular focus on the power flow between submodules as well as between arms and legs. Furthermore, the relationship between the state of charge and the circulating current is derived. The discrete model of battery is extracted, upon which parameter estimation using the extended Kalman filter is reviewed. The simulations are conducted with the system connected to a permanent magnet synchronous motor. The results indicate that the proposed method reduces the RMS circulating current by 5% and improves overall efficiency by 2% compared to the most recent literature. The system’s charge and operating times, defined as the duration from full charge until the batteries reach the minimum allowable level under constant load, are extended by 5%, thereby enhancing the driving range in traction applications."

In such settings—particularly in the absence of global positioning systems—exploration strategies become highly deployment-specific, and ensuring safety becomes a significant concern. Traditional grid-based mapping approaches are often sensitive to localization drift and inconsistencies in range measurements, limiting their reliability in real-world scenarios. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a robust exploration strategy that leverages a sparse topological representation to achieve reliable global exploration while ensuring safety. The proposed approach uses integrated planning and control with gap-based graph formation method to avoid trapping in dead-ends and other trap-like configurations—scenarios where purely reactive control is insufficient to guarantee safety. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the strategy in generating sparse, safety-aware topological maps that enable efficient and reliable navigation, rendering comparable results as conventional resolution-rich grid map-based methods in terms of feasibility and robustness.

    "abstract": "Multi-robot manipulator systems are increasingly used in industrial settings for tasks like coordinated assembly and pick-and-place operations. In such shared workspaces, multiple robotic arms must plan collision-free motions that account for each other’s movements. This multi-robot motion planning problem is computationally challenging, as the joint configuration space grows exponentially with the number of degrees of freedom (DoF). We study motion planning for a four-arm industrial cell (KUKA KR6, KUKA KR10, UR10, UR5) operating in a shared workspace under ROS/Gazebo/MoveIt. We compare a coupled planner in a 24-DoF composite space using OMPL RRT-Connect against a decoupled pipeline that plans per arm and then time-coordinates trajectories with a Detect-and-Pause heuristic. The heuristic discretizes the workspace into voxels, builds a spatio-temporal occupancy matrix, detects inter-arm conflicts in advance, and resolves them by pausing the robot with larger remaining execution time. To ensure a fair comparison, task allocation and grasp configurations are fixed across methods, and identical controller and planning parameters are used. Benchmarks span three clutter levels defined by minimum interobject distance d<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">min</inf> ∈{30,20,10}cm. We generate 10 randomized instances per level. Results show the decoupled approach dominates: 100% success at all clutter levels (vs. ∼81.7% for coupled), a −28.9% reduction in median planning time on average, and −26.1% median makespan on average. Gains are largest at 20cm, where interactions are frequent. These findings suggest that time-based coordination on fixed single-arm paths is a simple, robust, and scalable alternative to centralized planning for multi-arm manipulation in shared workspaces."

    "abstract": "The Polar Format Algorithm (PFA) is widely regarded as an efficient imaging algorithm, typically performing well when either the out-of-plane motion of the radar is negligible or the imaging scene is approximately planar. However, in Earth-based radar imaging of the Moon, these conditions are often violated. The unavoidable out-of-plane motion of the radar and the non-planar terrain of the lunar surface introduce space-variant phase errors that cause geometric distortion and defocus. To address this issue, an improved PFA with out-of-plane motion compensation is proposed in this Letter. First, an optimal focus plane is selected to eliminate the linear component of the out-of-plane motion and the resulting geometric distortion errors. Then, based on the mapping relationship of phase errors between the phase history domain and the wavenumber domain, space-variant filters are designed in the azimuth wavenumber domain to efficiently compensate for the space-variant defocus errors in PFA images. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is validated by the results obtained from experimental data."

    "abstract": "Weld defect detection is critical for maintaining the safe operation of natural gas pipelines. While computer vision-based approaches have emerged as a promising research focus, existing deep learning models inevitably face the problem of limited detection accuracy in multiscale welding defect detection, especially in recognizing tiny welding defects. To overcome the above challenges, this article proposes a novel DySample-guided lightweight feature aggregation fusion network (DyLFA-Net) for weld defect detection in natural gas pipelines, aiming to improve detection accuracy and computational efficiency while preserving a compact architectural design. The DyLFA-Net model consists of two key components. 1) The IB-SCSA module at the P5 layer, which enhances multiscale semantic extraction via spatial-channel attention. The IB module enhances feature expressiveness through channel expansion and depthwise convolution, supplying the SCSA mechanism with semantically enriched input features. 2) A high-resolution detection head at the P2 layer to improve tiny defect recognition. Experiments show that the proposed model achieves an mAP@0.5 of 89.9%, outperforming mainstream detectors. Additionally, with just 1.31 M parameters and 6.6 GFLOPs, the proposed model offers high accuracy and low complexity, enabling real-time deployment on resource-limited edge devices."

    "abstract": "Existing multi-view clustering methods often separate feature learning from clustering, leading to suboptimal preservation of global structure and increased reliance on heuristic post-processing. Recently risen tensor-based approaches better model cross-view correlations but still fail to fully capture intrinsic sample relationships. To tackle these shortcomings, we propose a unified one-step multi-view clustering framework (MCOC) that combines contrastive learning, tensor-based self-representation, and nonnegative symmetric matrix factorization. View-specific self-representation matrices are obtained via contrastive learning and arranged along the third mode to form a third-order tensor to capture global consensus across multiple views, then view-specific self-representation matrices are symmetrized to construct affinity graphs. Joint factorization of degree-normalized affinity matrices yields a shared nonnegative indicator matrix, enabling direct cluster assignment. Experiments on real-world datasets validate the superior clustering performance of the proposed method, effectively fusing local view-specific and global structural information."

    "abstract": "We establish two new direct product theorems for the randomized query complexity of Boolean functions. The first shows that computing n copies of a function f, even with a small success probability of $\\gamma^{n}$, requires $\\Theta(n)$ times the maximum distributional query complexity of f with success parameter $\\gamma$. This result holds for all success parameters $\\gamma$, even when $\\gamma$ is very close to 1/2 or to 1. As a result, it unifies and generalizes Drucker’s direct product theorem (2012) for $\\gamma$ bounded away from $\\frac{1}{2}$ and 1 as well as the strong direct sum theorem of Blais and Brody (2019) for $\\gamma \\approx 1-1 / n$. The second establishes a general list decoding direct product theorem that captures many different variants of “partial computation” tasks related to the function $f^{n}$ consisting of n copies of f. Notably, our list decoding direct product theorem yields a new threshold direct product theorem and other new variants such as the labelled-threshold direct product theorem. Both of these direct product theorems are obtained by taking a new approach. Instead of directly analyzing the query complexity of algorithms, we introduce a new measure of complexity of functions that we call discounted score. We show that this measure satisfies a number of useful structural properties, including tensorization, that make it particularly suitable for the study of direct product questions."

    "abstract": "In this paper, we study the stochastic probing problem under a general monotone norm objective. We are given a ground set $U=[n]=\\{1,2, \\ldots, n\\}$, where each element i is associated with an independent nonnegative random variable $X_{i}$ (with a known distribution). We may probe these elements adaptively, and upon probing an element i, its value $X_{i}$ is realized. The sequence of probed elements must satisfy a prefix-closed feasibility constraint $\\mathcal{F}$, such as a matroid, an orienteering constraint, or any other downward-closed constraint. We also have a monotone norm function $f: \\mathbb{R}_{\\geq 0}^{n} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}_{\\geq 0}$. Let $P \\subseteq U$ be the set of probed elements. Then the reward is $f\\left(X_{P}\\right)$, where $X_{P}$ is an n-dimensional vector whose i-th coordinate equals the realized value of $X_{i}$ if $i \\in P$ (i.e., element i is probed), and 0 otherwise. Our objective is to design a probing strategy that maximizes the expected reward $\\mathbb{E}\\left[f\\left(X_{P}\\right)\\right]$. We study the adaptivity gap of the problem, defined as the ratio between the expected reward of an optimal adaptive strategy and that of an optimal non-adaptive strategy. A small adaptivity gap allows us to focus on designing nonadaptive strategies, which are typically simpler to represent and analyze. Establishing tight adaptivity gaps is a central challenge in stochastic combinatorial optimization and has been studied extensively for stochastic probing problems with various objective functions. In this paper, we resolve a central open problem in this line of research, posed in [1], [2], by proving that the adaptivity gap for stochastic probing with general monotone norms is bounded by $O\\left(\\log ^{2} n\\right)$. With a refined analysis, we can further strengthen the bound to $O(\\log r \\log n / \\log \\log n)$ where r is the maximum length of a sequence in the feasibility constraint ($2 \\leq r \\leq n$). As a by-product, we obtain an asymptotically tight adaptivity gap $\\Theta(\\log n / \\log \\log n)$ for Bernoulli stochastic probing with binary-XOS objectives, matching the lower bound in [1]. We also obtain an $O\\left(\\log ^{3} n\\right)$ upper bound for Bernoulli stochastic probing with general subadditive objectives. Furthermore, for monotone symmetric norms, we prove that the adaptivity gap can be bounded by $O(1)$, answering an open question posed in [3] and improving upon their $O(\\log n)$ upper bound.

Namely, is it possible to construct interactive error-correcting codes that convert any protocol designed for the noiseless broadcast channel into one that works over the noisy broadcast channel and is not much longer than the original protocol?[12, STOC 2018] showed that such interactive codes with constant multiplicative overhead are possible under the assumption that the noiseless protocol being simulated is non-adaptive, meaning that it is restricted to have a pre-determined order of turns. Their noise resilient simulating protocols, however, require adaptivity, where each party can decide whether or not to broadcast given all the information available to them, including their input and received transcript. The question of whether such a simulation is possible for general, potentially adaptive, noiseless protocols was left open.We resolve this question negatively, proving that any interactive code that converts adaptive noiseless broadcast protocols into adaptive broadcast protocols resilient to stochastic errors must incur a multiplicative overhead of Ω(log n/ log log n), which is nearly tight."

    "abstract": "This paper focuses on cooperative speed planning for multiple connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) traversing along intersected fixed paths. Nominally, this task is formulated as an optimal control problem incorporating logical operators to represent collision-avoidance constraints. This formulation requires solving a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem, while handling non-differentiable integer variables remains challenging for gradient-based solvers. Instead of solving the MINLP, we propose a cosine-based method, a novel geometric strategy for formulating collision-avoidance constraints between CAVs. Constructing such a geometric model introduces potential approximation errors, which are mitigated by fitted correction terms designed to compensate for geometric deviations and refine the distance calculation. We propose a simulation-based planner to provide the speed profile with the globally optimal passing order, serving as a warm start for the solver. A lightweight iterative optimization strategy is also adopted to enhance robustness. Additionally, we propose a fault-tolerant strategy to ensure both system safety and operational efficiency. Extensive simulation results verify the proposed method, and comparative experiments demonstrate its efficiency."

    "abstract": "Human motor behaviors typically require coordination between lower-limb rhythmic tasks and upper-limb voluntary tasks. This study investigates the synergy strategies of human motion at the joint and muscle levels to explore the control mechanisms of cooperative tasks, such as grasping during walking or running. We designed novel motor experiments and analyzed kinematic characteristics, ipsilateral joint angles and EMG signals. Using principal component analysis on joint angle trajectories and non-negative matrix factorization on 16-muscle activities, we extracted kinematic primitives and muscle synergies to reveal underlying synergy mechanisms. The results demonstrate that the kinematic and muscle synergy mechanisms of cooperative tasks exhibit significant grasp-position dependence, and strong correlations exist between weight coefficients and specific kinematic characteristics. Additionally, cooperative tasks can be explained by integrating pre-existing muscle synergy patterns derived from lowerlimb rhythmic and upper-limb voluntary tasks. The activation components of lower-limb locomotion are almost preserved, whereas those of grasping tasks are partially obliterated in some cases. These findings indicate that cooperative tasks induce functional coupling between lowerlimb and upper-limb movements at both joint and muscle levels, exhibiting significantly stronger inter-limb coordination than individual voluntary tasks. This work introduces novel experimental paradigms to systematically study inter-limb coordination strategies, providing valuable insights into human motion control mechanisms."

Then, through the iterative sampling process of the diffusion model, these degraded portions are replaced with perceptually natural and high-quality speech segments. Experimental results indicate that Diffiner can recover a clearer harmonic structure of speech, which is shown to result in improved perceptual quality w.r.t. several metrics as well as in a human listening test.

For comparison, conventional proportional-integral (PI) and hysteresis controllers are also implemented. Simulation results show that the ANFIS controller can maintain both voltage and current in the range of 32–46 V DC and 1 A current more consistently than PI and hysteresis methods, minimize ripple, and reduce total harmonic distortion (THD) to 1.8%. Moreover, the ANFIS-based control scheme enhances system stability and robustness against input fluctuations, outperforming traditional control methods. Overall, the findings indicate that an adaptive controller such as ANFIS can improve power-quality metrics and enhance the stability of LED drivers under wide input-voltage variations."

Jalna district is located in a drought-prone area where low water availability is the most important factor affecting crop production. Therefore, decision-makers must plan for these resources. The study aims to develop a farm plan for the Jalna District by using Linear Programming to get maximum returns through the feasible cropping pattern. The results were obtained using LINGO 20.0."

    "abstract": "Accurate prediction of water quality parameters is essential for proactive environmental management and informed resource allocation. It also provides a scientific foundation for protecting aquatic ecosystems. Traditional prediction methodologies often struggle to capture seasonal fluctuations and longterm trends in water quality data. They also fail to effectively incorporate external factors such as precipitation. To address these challenges, this work proposes a novel model called Fusion Multimodal Patch Transformer (FMPT). This model improves water quality prediction accuracy through three innovative mechanisms: First, the model employs convolutional neural networks to process spatial precipitation patterns and Transformers to analyze temporal water quality data, enabling the extraction of spatio-temporal features. Second, FMPT applies patch-based decomposition to both modalities. This enhances the capture of local semantic information and expands the receptive field for more effective representation. Finally, it utilizes a low-rank multimodal fusion approach to integrate features from image and time series data, thereby obtaining a comprehensive representation of information from different modalities. Empirical validation was conducted using realworld hydrological datasets. The results show that the FMPT model performs better than existing state-of-the-art unimodal methods in water quality prediction tasks. It achieves an average improvement of 5.38 % in prediction accuracy compared to other benchmark models."

    "abstract": "Image denoising aims to remove additive Gaussian noise from an image and has been extensively studied in the past five decades. While deep-learning-based image denoisers have achieved state-of-the-art results, their large model size may prevent them from being used in resource-limited environments, such as space computers and IoT devices. This paper proposes a lightweight CNN model based on depth-wise convolution for image denoising. Besides the skip connection from the input to the output, the model comprises three modules: shallow feature extraction based on regular convolution, deep feature extraction, and image reconstruction based on regular convolution. The deep feature extraction module consists of a stack of modified ResNet blocks formed by replacing regular convolution with a combination of depth-wise and dilated depth-wise convolutions. Despite being a lightweight model with only about 1.2 M parameters, extensive experiments show that our model can perform similarly to state-of-the-art deep learning models for image denoising."

The outer friction pair is connected with the frame of the module to prevent small amplitude loads such as random vibration from entering the transmission chain. The inner friction pair is connected to the self-locking motor output shaft, and enters the slipping state to disconnect the transmission chain in case of overload. To characterize the performance boundary of the joint module, constraints governing the output torque and friction moment of the module are established based on the transmission relationship, screw preload, and contact pressure. Given the nonstandard clearance fit between the motor output shaft and the central hole of the friction disc, this paper establishes a shaft-hole contact force model for non-eccentric conditions based on Hertz theory and geometric relationships. The effects of output shaft shape, rounded corner radius, and clearance on moment transmission capacity are investigated. Transient dynamics simulations are conducted on a 3-DOF mechanical arm composed of three joint modules to both investigate discrepancies between theoretical and simulated friction moment values and concurrently demonstrate the module’s anti-vibration and overload protection capabilities."

In this paper, we designed the basic principles and proceeding of the two policies, and compared their performance through MatLab. From these results we can see, that both policies have comparable performance, and the running time of cycle policy is shorter than that of non-cycle one, but the designed complexity of inner compensating algorithm for non-cycle policy is less than that of cycle one.

This study analyzes the hazards of small current grounding faults and the identification challenges caused by the complexification of distribution network topology, and clarifies the limitations of traditional steady-state component methods, transient component methods, and traditional deep learning methods. It quantifies the constraints of STM32 microcontrollers in terms of computing capability and storage resources, and demonstrates the necessity of lightweight algorithms. An STM32-adapted VAE network architecture is designed, which includes a five-level convolutional encoder, a five-level transposed convolutional decoder, and a weighted loss function. Weakly supervised fault identification is realized through \"normal sample modeling - reconstruction error discrimination\", and fault location is completed by combining the \"partition locking - location refinement\" logic. This algorithm does not require in-zone fault sample training, and its parameter scale and computational load are compatible with the hardware capabilities of STM32, providing a feasible solution for the front-end real-time identification of small current grounding faults."

Finally, a twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) algorithm for HES DR optimization is designed to achieve adaptive control under uncertainty. Simulation results show that, on an i7-12700 processor, the proposed method reduces energy costs by 36.52% compared with non-DR schemes and converges within 553.4 s, requiring only one-third of the convergence episodes of PPO."

    "abstract": "This paper proposes an intelligent diagnosis method of photovoltaic (PV) module faults based on electrical information and image information. When the PV module operates normally or different faults occur in the PV module, power optimizers with the function of PV module level monitoring and the related intelligent PV safety controller are used to acquire power optimizer input voltage information, power optimizer output voltage information and string current information. Due to the deficiency of the above electrical information in diagnosing PV module faults, PV module surface image information, the Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG) feature extraction technology, principal component analysis (PCA) and other image processing technologies are further integrated in the diagnosis process to improve the fault discrimination ability. On the basis of the above, when the PV module operates normally or different faults occur in the PV module under multiple meteorological conditions, the electrical information and the PV module surface image information acquired through power optimizers and other devices are collected, and then features are obtained, so as to establish the sample set. This paper divides the sample set into the training set and the test set, and then obtains Training Set 1 and Training Set 2 from the training set. On the basis of Training Set 1, this paper acquires the PCA results. This paper combines the PCA results, Training Set 1, Training Set 2 and support vector machine (SVM) to establish the diagnosis model of PV module faults, which is composed of two SVM models, so as to complete the construction of the diagnosis method, and the diagnosis effect of this method is tested through the test set. The research results verify the proposed diagnosis method. The proposed diagnosis method can provide a basis for PV module on-site maintenance."

    "abstract": "As offshore wind resources become increasingly saturated, open-sea wind power generation technology is increasingly recognized. However, wind turbine generator system (WTGS) contains extensive power electronic devices, resulting in system with low inertia and weak grid characteristics. This makes it challenging for the generation side to maintain stable system frequency and voltage when subjected to disturbances such as wind speed or load abrupt change. Modular multilevel convertor (MMC) technology offers significant advantages in open-sea wind power generation. However, most of existing active support control schemes often rely solely on VSG control, neglecting the impact of submodule capacitors on system inertia. To address these problems, first the operation principles and steady-state characteristics of grid-forming MMC-based direct-driven permanent magnetic synchronous generator (PMSG) is analyzed. By utilizing submodule capacitor voltage as the intermediate DC link to simulate synchronous generator inertia, a submodule capacitor voltage-based grid-forming active support control strategy is proposed, which enhances voltage and frequency support for the onshore grid under disturbance conditions. Finally, simulations validate the active support performance of the proposed grid forming control scheme for open-sea wind power generation system during sudden changes in wind speed or loads."

This convergence time can be preassigned independently of the initial engagement geometry, which is an alluring feature of the proposed solution. The guidance law is inspired from deviated pursuit guidance, known for its implementation simplicity. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is demonstrated through numerical simulations across a diverse range of engagement scenarios."

In this paper, GROOT was used in a number of experiments to assess its performance to few-shot learning against spatial reasoning, logical reasoning and compound simulated tasks.

To address the limitations of traditional planning, such as high subjectivity and low efficiency, and the deficiencies of existing automated methods in satisfying engineering constraints and environmental adaptability, this paper proposes a path optimization method based on an adaptive cost model and an improved A-star algorithm. The method first constructs an adaptive composite cost model that dynamically adjusts grid resolution and slope evaluation criteria according to macro-geomorphic features. It also automatically interprets land-use types via a specially trained and validated high-accuracy PSPNet deep learning network to scientifically quantify economic, ecological, and policy-related costs. On this basis, the A-star algorithm is profoundly improved: firstly, by introducing an exponential elevation difference penalty function, the path can proactively avoid steep terrain; secondly, through a novel turning angle hard-constraint strategy, the minimum turning radius requirement is internalized as an algorithmic node expansion filtering mechanism, fundamentally ensuring the path's geometric smoothness. A case study demonstrates that the proposed method can automatically generate an optimized access road path in complex mountainous environments that strictly adheres to dual engineering constraints of slope and turning radius while effectively circumventing high-cost areas. This research provides a complete and efficient solution for the intelligent and fine-grained planning of substation access roads and other linear infrastructures."

While these algorithms achieve high accuracy, they require significant communication bandwidth and open access to each agent's object detection model design and parameters. Such requirements limit their applicability in real-time and real-world autonomous driving scenarios due to communication constraints and agents' need to preserve intellectual property rights over their solutions. To overcome this challenge, we propose a novel late collaborative framework for multi-detection fusion and multi-object tracking that only requires the 2 D bounding box category, size, position, and orientation in bird's-eye-view projection plane. We evaluate our solution using a custom collaborative dataset generated by adding noise to the ground truth annotations of the nuScenes database. This setup allows us to assess the impact of detection uncertainties on fusion and tracking performance in a constrained environment, evaluating the robustness of our approach in real-life scenarios where agents may provide varying levels of information quality. Our framework demonstrates robust quantitative and qualitative results compared to state-of-the-art methods, validating its effectiveness in realistic, noisy scenarios."

It is assumed that the aggregated feeder load is a weighted summation as linear combination of the representative load profiles of residential, commercial, and industrial consumers. Therefore, the estimated contributions of each load type are determined without intrusive metering or additional sensors, by solving a set of linear equations based on the measured feeder data. The proposed method is implemented in Python, and tested utilizing the simulated load data extracted from typical day consumption patterns. The results show that the estimated contributions for each load type are in complete agreement with their original values. Moreover, the reconstructed feeder load follows the measured data well, thus confirming the viability of the linear equation-based disaggregation technique. Further energy analyses indicate that the commercial sector constitutes the most portion in total daily energy consumption, followed by the industrial and residential sectors. Moreover, due to its simplicity and computational efficiency, and needless to complex measurement infrastructure, the proposed technique stands suitable in energy distribution observatories in smart cities for real-time feeder monitoring, demand analysis, and load management in smart city applications."

To address these challenges, a novel four-chamber valveless rotary pump is designed based on previous designs. Featuring a spherical shape, this pump is inspired by the conventional hydraulic gerotor pump architecture, where two relatively rotating \"gears\" alter the pumping chambers. This design provides a compact, spherical package ideal for a TAH, generates pulsatile flow similar to the human heart, eliminates the need for unidirectional prosthetic heart valves, and significantly reduces operating speed, potentially decreasing shear stress on blood. A detailed design methodology is presented, beginning with the derivation of fundamental mathematical equations governing the pump’s geometric shape. An analytical model is developed to size the pump and calculate the pumping chamber volume relative to the shaft angle, with validations from computer-aided design (CAD) simulations, which paves the foundations for future investigations."

    "abstract": "Developing sensorless control methods for motors is one of the effective ways to abandon traditional mechanical sensors and promote the further miniaturization of humanoid robot joint modules. However, in medium- and high-speed operating conditions, sensorless control methods still exhibit significant errors in speed and position control accuracy, making it difficult to meet the high-performance requirements of humanoid robot joint movements. For this purpose, a novel sensorless motor control model combining hyperbolic tangent function and dual low-pass filter is proposed. A permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) is used as an example for simulation analysis. First, a smooth hyperbolic tangent function replaces the traditional sign function to solve the chattering problem of the back electromotive force (back-EMF) signal. Second, a dual low-pass filter (LPF) is used rather than an LPF to remove high-frequency harmonics in the back-EMF signal. And a simulation model was built based on Simulink to verify the feasibility. Simulation data reveals that the proposed control model achieves error reductions of 86.2% in motor speed prediction and 75.1% in rotor position prediction compared to the traditional model. This research provides theoretical support for the future miniaturization of humanoid robot joint modules and the development of high-precision sensorless motor control."

Most current object detection methods rely on empirical object priors or learnable object queries, which are difficult to fully adapt to the complexity and diversity of the landslide. To address this, we propose a diffusion model-based landslide detection method (DMLD) for optical remote sensing images. This method maps the object detection task to a denoising process. It starts from randomly generated noisy boxes that contain no learnable parameters. Then, it gradually refines these boxes to obtain the bounding boxes. To suppress background interference, we propose a gated feature fusion module (GFFM), which dynamically generates adaptive weights for fusing multi-stage features. Considering that diffusion models are fundamentally iterative processes, we develop a corrected sampling module (CSM) to improve the fast sampling precision of diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs). Experimental results demonstrate that DMLD outperforms other detection methods, confirming its effectiveness for landslide detection.

The lightweight denim-based design maximizes comfort and enables integration into a bra without restricting daily activities. Sensor performance was evaluated under 21 healthy scenarios—including displacement within the bra cup, rotation, and tissue deformation induced by typical daily movements—combined with physiological variations such as menstrual cycle and perspiration to emulate realistic conditions. Furthermore, 68 tumor datasets were synthesized by randomly distributing tumors within breast tissue, following anatomical likelihoods characteristic of stages 0, I, and II. Full-wave electromagnetic simulations were conducted in CST Microwave Studio, and two fabricated prototypes were experimentally validated using a breast phantom. Analysis of S<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">21</sub> parameters yielded five statistical features, with one-way ANOVA identifying area difference as the most robust discriminator between tumorous and non-tumorous (physiological noise) conditions. Skewed Gaussian modeling, time-domain correlation analysis, and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) evaluation confirmed robust discrimination for Stage I–II tumors, achieving the highest classification confidence for stage II. However, detection of Stage 0 tumors requires further algorithm development. The dual-sensor configuration complied with IEC/FCC SAR limits (1.6–2 W/kg), supporting its safety for prolonged use. These results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed system as a safe, comfortable, and effective solution for continuous daily breast health monitoring."

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a tri-hybrid beamforming (THBF) architecture based on the radiation-center (RC) reconfigurable antenna array (RCRAA), including the digital beamforming, analog beamforming, and electromagnetic (EM) beamforming, where the EM beamformer design is modeled as RC selection. Aiming at spectral efficiency (SE) maximization subject to the hardware and power consumption constraints, we propose a tri-loop alternating optimization (TLAO) scheme for the THBF design, where the digital and analog beamformers are optimized based on the penalty dual decomposition in the inner and middle loops, and the RC selection is determined through the coordinate descent method in the outer loop. Aiming at energy-efficiency (EE) maximization, we develop a dual quadratic transform-based fractional programming (DQTFP) scheme, where the TLAO scheme is readily used for the THBF design. To reduce the computational complexity, we propose the Lagrange dual transform-based fractional programming (LDTFP) scheme, where each iteration has a closed-form solution. Simulation results demonstrate the great potential of the RCRAA in improving both SE and EE. Compared to the DQTFP scheme, the LDTFP scheme significantly reduces the computational complexity with only minor performance loss."

    "abstract": "This study presents a comprehensive energy management strategy designed for an off-grid agricultural microgrid that integrates a PV array, Home Battery Energy Storage (HBES), and Electric Tractor Battery Energy Storage (TBES). The proposed tractor-to-home (T2H) system coordinates power flows among renewable generation, stationary storage, household loads, and the electric tractor’s battery to maximize renewable energy utilization, extend system autonomy, and enhance operational reliability. Key contributions include a dynamic load prioritization mechanism that adaptively manages demand, and a refined Flexible Power Point Tracking (FPPT) algorithm to optimize solar energy harvesting under variable irradiance. The tractor power emulator is incorporated to realistically replicate traction motor dynamics for Processor-in-the-Loop (PIL). Experimental results obtained using the real-time MicroLabBox control platform confirm the effectiveness of the proposed energy management strategy in sustaining energy balance, minimizing battery degradation, and providing reliable support for both agricultural operations and household power needs over extended durations. Furthermore, the system consistently maintains voltage regulation errors below 0.5% and achieves efficiency levels exceeding 96% across all operating modes. Collectively, these findings demonstrate substantial progress toward sustainable electrification for rural farming contexts, offering a robust and environmentally friendly alternative to conventional off-grid energy solutions."

    "abstract": "We present a compact CMOS leaky integrate-and-fire neuron that operates natively in two regimes: subthreshold for ultra-low power and saturation for robust interfacing. This dual-mode functionality bridges the energy efficiency of the subthreshold operation with the connectivity advantage of saturation within a single circuit. The design leverages device-level parasitics and subthreshold conduction to minimize the energy consumption per spike and reduce silicon area. It also maintains sufficient headroom in the saturation region to drive or directly interface with non-subthreshold components and resistive memories. In addition to outlining the design methodology and sizing strategy that enable dual-mode operation without needing additional amplification stages, we introduce a mathematical model that captures the circuit dynamics. Under specified operating assumptions, this model allows us to predict the spiking frequency for various application targets. SPICE simulations validate the expected spiking dynamics and trade-offs between energy consumption and latency. We also compare our proposed neuron with recent CMOS implementations reported in the literature. While some earlier designs achieve lower absolute energy consumption, our approach features a significantly reduced transistor count and the ability to interface with other cells without dedicated amplification, offering a practical and integration-friendly solution. By converting unavoidable capacitive parasitics into advantages, thiswork presents a silicon-efficient method for low-power neuromorphic hardware, making both subthreshold efficiency and saturation-range connectivity key design objectives"

    "abstract": "Comprehensive functional verification at the System-on-Chip (SoC) level is a critical and time-consuming task. The growing adoption of open source RISC-V based cores with safety and security features has introduced new verification challenges that require scalable and reusable solutions. This paper presents a portable and hybrid verification framework using C and UVM for secure RISC-V SoCs. The proposed UVM based verification framework is designed to support both C/assembly level test cases and SystemVerilog based verification components, enabling a dual test strategy that enhances coverage and debugging capabilities. The VE includes verification components for core, cache and peripheral interfaces such as agents, predictors and scoreboards, making it applicable to a wide range of RISC-V standard extension cores. It also supports third-party VIP integration, regression analysis and functional coverage tracking for integer, multiplication, compressed and floating-point instruction sets of RISC-V core. As a case study, the framework is applied to a customized open source RISCV SoC enhanced with AES security features. The experimental results demonstrate that the framework achieves 90% functional coverage, 85% code coverage and 91% instruction coverage. The indigenously developed hybrid C/UVM test suites for UART, SPI and AES are easily configurable and reusable. In general, the proposed framework provides an automated, portable and extensible solution to verify secure RISC-V SoCs with reduced engineering effort and faster coverage closure. This work emphasizes practical integration of hybrid C/UVM testing across RISCV cores and peripherals and includes a comparative evaluation with existing platforms to highlight portability and reuse."

    "abstract": "The heart rate is a basic indicator of human body; it is significant to measure the heart rate uninterruptedly, consistently, and precisely. However, due to limitations in sensors measurement, it is difficult to measure the heart rate in diverse circumstances. To address this, we forecast inter beat intervals (IBI) to measure heart rate using various models. stochastic univariate time series models are used to forecast future times stamps on the learning from preceding time lags, assuming equally spaced intervals. Time series analysis is an important but challenging task in machine learning. In this study, we compared two methodologies applied to IBI data: stochastic processes (ARIMA models) and deep learning models. These approaches hold great assurance in time series analysis. The proposed model's performance was compared with stochastic models namely Naïve Bayes and ARIMA, as well as machine learning models such as CNN and KNN. Experimental results demonstrate that the ARIMA model achieved a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) 27 outperforming classic models in prediction accuracy. K-fold validation is used for all the models. Among deep learning models, proposed model given the lowest MAE of 0.054, surpassing advanced models like CNN and KNN. These results highlight that while stochastic models outperform the traditional models, the proposed model offers superior performance among deep learning approaches, achieving highest accuracy in IBI prediction"

A long line of prior work incurred a warm-start penalty of at least linear in the dimension, hitting a cubic barrier, even for the special case of uniform sampling from convex bodies. Our improvement relies on two key ingredients of independent interest. (1) We show how to sample given a warm start in weaker notions of distance, in particular q-Rényi divergence for $q=\\widetilde{O}$ (1), whereas previous analyses required stringent $\\infty$-Rényi divergence (with the exception of Hit-and-Run, whose known mixing time is higher). This marks the first improvement in the required warmness since Lovász and Simonovits (1991). (2) We refine and generalize the $\\log$-Sobolev inequality of Lee and Vempala (2018), originally established for isotropic logconcave distributions in terms of the diameter of the support, to logconcave distributions in terms of a geometric average of the support diameter and the largest eigenvalue of the covariance matrix."

The goal is to compute the starting positions of all fragments of T that can be obtained from P with edits of total cost at most k. PMwWE captures typical real-world applications more accurately than its unweighted variant (PMwE), where all edits have unit costs.Indeed, the textbook $\\mathcal{O}\\left( {nm} \\right)$-time algorithm of Sellers [J. Algorithms'80], devised in the context of bioinformatics, already accounts for weights. Surprisingly, the understanding of PMWWE has not advanced in the last 45 years. In contrast, significant milestones for PMwE include an $\\mathcal{O}\\left( {nk} \\right)$-time algorithm by Landau and Vishkin [STOC'86, J. Algorithms'89], an $\\mathcal{O}(n + {k^4} \\cdot n/m)$-time algorithm by Cole and Hariharan [SODA'98, SICOMP'02], and a recent $\\tilde {\\mathcal{O}}(n + {k^{3.5}} \\cdot n/m)$-time solution by Charalampopoulos, Kociumaka, and Wellnitz [FOCS'22].In this work, we examine whether these results can be lifted to PMWWE even though (1) the underlying algorithms rely on combinatorial properties specific to the unweighted edit distance, and (2) under standard fine-grained complexity assumptions, computing the weighted edit distance is strictly harder than computing the unweighted edit distance [Cassis, Kociumaka, and Wellnitz; FOCS'23]. We obtain three main results:•a conceptually simple $\\tilde {\\mathcal{O}}\\left( {nk} \\right)$-time algorithm for PMWWE, very different from that of Landau and Vishkin;•a significantly more complicated $\\tilde {\\mathcal{O}}(n + {k^{3.5}} \\cdot {W^4} \\cdot n/m)$ time algorithm for PMWWE under the assumption that the weight function is a metric with integer values between 0 and W; and•an $\\tilde {\\mathcal{O}}(n + {k^4} \\cdot n/m)$-time algorithm for PMWWE for the case of arbitrary weights.

    "abstract": "The objective of the project “Farm Defender Using Machine Learning” is to bring a simple, effective, automated method to detect plant diseases to help maintain the health of plants and contribute to sustainable agricultural practices. Access to data over the years has enabled the development of various plant detection systems for use in agriculture, environmental management, and biodiversity conservation. Plant identification using traditional methods is often tedious, requiring considerable manual labor and expert knowledge, and is therefore both time and cost- intensive. Utilizing ML techniques, image recognition models specifically, this plant identification system seeks to automate the identification and quality assessment of the plants. The system implements the use of a conventional neural networks (CNN's) that has been trained on mega sets of plant images, which merely capture salient visual features like leaf shape, color and texture to identify plant species and even recognize symptoms of diseases. Transfer learning enables the fine-tuning of pre-trained models to perform plant detection, reducing the time and resources needed for training. Data augmentation methods (rotation, scaling, color adjustment, etc.) can help the model be more robust and adaptable to different environmental conditions at the same time, which ensures higher model accuracy and reliability. Detecting diseases in crops is a crucial but often time-consuming and challenging part of farming. It demands great time and skilled labor. In this paper, an intelligent and effective method is proposed to detect crop disease based upon computer vision and machine learning techniques. To create a project that is different from the others, 3 datasets were combined to create one large dataset. The proposed system is capable of recognizing 38 different diseases across 5 commonly grown plants, with an impressive accuracy of 93%. The dataset is divided into 70,295 images for training, 17,572 images for validation, and 33 images for testing."

To pinpoint the physical origin of this anomaly, a combined approach integrating technology computer-aided design (TCAD) simulations and experimental characterizations was employed. The study first utilized off-state leakage measurements and breakdown analysis. These techniques ruled out gate leakage and buffer leakage as potential causes, and indicated that the dominant leakage path was source-to-drain leakage through the GaN channel layer. Subsequent temperature-dependent transfer characterization and high-voltage capacitance-voltage (HV-CV) profiling revealed the significant influence of donor-like trap ionization within the channel. Finally, the results were rigorously calibrated with two-dimensional drift-diffusion simulations, which conclusively verified that the “double-step” behavior originated from trap states located approximately 0.36 eV below the conduction band edge (Ec-0.36 eV), with a distribution at the AlGaN/GaN heterointerface and within the GaN channel region. This work thus provides key insights for mitigating the “double-step” anomaly, which is essential for developing high-performance GaN HEMTs with superior switching characteristics for next-generation power electronics."

In this work, the control of the steering wheel system and thus aspects of the steering feel are investigated. The considered control is realized using admittance control, to impose a designed mass-damper feel perceived by the driver. In addition, a feedback torque is provided to the driver based on a dynamic vehicle model. The subsequent velocity control to enable the admittance control is implemented using a model predictive controller. To analyze the frequency response of the system and to provide design guidance, the system is divided into a steering feel and a velocity tracking loop. The velocity tracking loop optimization weights of the linearized model predictive controller provide the desired stability margin and bandwidth for the application if chosen as recommended. Further, the importance of the rejection of the driver’s torque in the velocity tracking loop is illustrated using different non-rejected driver models. Knowledge of the driver’s torque enables the rejection of this uncertainty, as demonstrated to be a necessity. When designing the damping feel the driver perceives, with the objective of an electric power steering system as a benchmark, the analysis shows a trade-off between the felt damping and the frequencies to which the steering system feels responsive to the driver."

This impact is especially pronounced in confluence zones, where cold continental air masses interact with warm, moisture-laden air currents emanating from oceans or lakes. In this paper, an objective classification algorithm of cloud phase was suggested using K-means clustering algorithm based on PollyXT lidar method and a gradient based cloud identification algorithm, in order to determine depolarization ratio threshold for supercooled water, mixed-phase and ice clouds. The analyses of cloud phase characteristics and vertical structure were conducted for cold air outbreak events over the Shandong Peninsula, a region frequently affected by sea-effect snow disasters, using the winter period of 2024-2025 continuous observation data from the Eastern CHina cold-air OutbrEak Snowfall (ECHOES) campaign. The results show: the supercooled water clouds were predominantly located above the ice clouds in the mid-to-upper troposphere, implying heterogeneous ice nucleation processes; the analysis of diurnal variation reveals that the probability of occurrence of supercooled water clouds remains constant during the whole day because of the stable atmospheric conditions; synergy of lidar and radar observations clearly demonstrates their complementary detection abilities: radar outperforming lidar in lower troposphere and daytime conditions; the high coverage of the supercooled water in the lower troposphere poses a significant safety threat for aircraft icing. These results provide observational basis for improving the cloud microphysics parametric schemes in numerical weather prediction and aviation safety."

    "abstract": "Spiking neural networks (SNNs) demonstrate significant potential for energy-efficient neuromorphic computing, while trace-based spike-timing dependent plasticity (trace-STDP) serves as a biologically inspired learning rule to improve SNN temporal learning. Memristor-based implementations of trace-STDP SNN leverage device non-linearity to emulate synaptic dynamics, enabling highly energy-efficient computation. However, the mapping from trace-STDP to memristor arrays introduces inherent variations, which significantly degrade network accuracy, posing a critical challenge for the reliable deployment of memristor-based neuromorphic systems. To address this issue, efficient variation-tolerant strategies are essential. However, current approaches do not take the trace-STDP SNN characteristics into consideration, thereby limiting their algorithm-and hardware-level effectiveness. In this work, a variation-aware online learning framework for memristor-based trace-STDP SNN is proposed, with hierarchical simulations integrated across software, ASIC, memristor-array, and memristor-device levels. Through variation analysis experiments, it is observed that variations in near-zero trace values significantly impact network accuracy. To mitigate these effects, a tailored variation-tolerant strategy is developed, together with a configurable hardware clipping unit and an ASIC/memristor co-simulator. The proposed variation-tolerant design achieves up to a 16.97% accuracy improvement, with only a 0.02% extra power overhead and a 0.01% extra area overhead, while a parallel design ensures no additional latency overhead. Integrating the co-simulator into the proposed framework facilitates design space exploration, enhancing the robustness and efficiency of memristor-based neuromorphic computing."

While applying CRC error detection to candidate paths generated by multiple SC list decoders can improve performance, two critical issues arise. First, because a single CRC frame must cover the outputs of multiple SC list decoders, the number of path combinations grows exponentially, making exhaustive CRC error detection infeasible. Second, in optical fiber transmission systems without CRC-based error detection, the additional overhead introduced by CRC cannot be neglected. To mitigate the exponential growth of path combinations, we propose a method that limits the number of candidate path combinations by preferentially performing CRC error detection on less-reliable ones. Furthermore, we investigate the dependence on CRC parity length to identify suitable CRC codes for the polar-coded offload method. Numerical evaluations show that the proposed method suppresses the error floor of offloaded bit sequences not protected by SD-FEC to approximately one-tenth of that observed with a conventional SC decoder. This enables the application of various hard-decision FEC and SD-FEC codes with different overheads, thereby enhancing flexibility. We also evaluate the assignment of CRC parity bits in the optical transport network layer, showing that physical-layer overhead can be avoided."

The electrical grid under study is a 24-bus system capable of interacting with the upstream grid. Additionally, the gas network comprises a 15-node system that enables gas sales through branches for the system’s operator. The proposed framework incorporates the modeling of both electricity and gas networks and accounts for all operating constraints of these two networks. Given the nonlinearity of the gas flow model and the diesel generator’s cost function, the equation is linearized to yield a completely linear model. Additionally, considering the presence of uncertain parameters—including wind, demands, and the prices of electricity and gas markets—a stochastic programming model is introduced. The study is examined through two case studies. In the first Case Study, the system is analyzed under the assumption that the electricity network is not available, while in the second Case Study 2, the system is analyzed assuming that the electricity network is available. Finally, to ensure the robustness of the results, a sensitivity analysis is conducted on the model."

Through medical imaging, an appropriate diagnosis of brain tumor and numerous tissue irregularities is provided. A huge count of brain tumor detection techniques is available through Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI) images with a reminder of various challenges that include location findings and tumor size in image segmentation to distinguish the tumor through the image of the brain. This study presents an image segmentation procedure to determine or detect tumours from brain images attained through magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Although different thresholding techniques exist still, it results from other images. Therefore, it is essential to develop a method that detects the tumor distinctively.

Non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) is a method that disaggregates the total power consumption into the power consumption of each appliance. Most existing NILM algorithms require large amounts of prior data, including power consumption profiles of every appliance collected by submeters. This requirement creates an obstacle that prevents usage of these methods in real-life applications. The proposed unsupervised NILM method focuses on detecting the household fridge without using any prior knowledge. This work proposes a NILM approach that uses event detection, event clustering, and event pairing to detect the refrigerator in a household. The method is tested on house 1 of the REDD dataset, and is compared to a supervised method. The numerical results show 18.6% improvement in F1 score and 42.3% improvement in mean absolute error metrics."

    "abstract": "In the distributed triangle detection problem, we have an n-vertex network G = (V, E) with one player for each vertex of the graph who sees the edges incident on the vertex. The players communicate in synchronous rounds using the edges of this network and have a limited bandwidth of O(log n) bits over each edge. The goal is to detect whether or not G contains a triangle as a subgraph in a minimal number of rounds.We prove that any protocol (deterministic or randomized) for distributed triangle detection requires Ω(log log n) rounds of communication. Prior to our work, only one-round lower bounds were known for this problem.The primary technique for proving these types of distributed lower bounds is via reductions from two-party communication complexity. However, it has been known for a while that this approach is provably incapable of establishing any meaningful lower bounds for distributed triangle detection. Our main technical contribution is a new information theoretic argument which combines recent advances on multi-pass graph streaming lower bounds with the point-to-point communication aspects of distributed models, and can be of independent interest."

    "abstract": "Transformers, especially the decoder-only variants, are the backbone of most modern large language models. Yet, we have a very limited understanding of their limitations (i.e., what tasks they cannot solve) besides the simplest 1-layer case. Due to the difficulty of analyzing multi-layer models, all previous work relies on unproven complexity conjectures to show limitations for multi-layer Transformers. In this work, we prove the first unconditional lower bound against multilayer decoder-only transformers. For any constant L, we prove that any L-layer decoder-only transformer needs a polynomial model dimension $\\left(n^{\\Omega(1)}\\right)$ to perform sequential composition of L functions over an input of n tokens. As a consequence, our results give: (1) the first depthwidth trade-off for multi-layer transformers, exhibiting that the L-step composition task is exponentially harder for L-layer models compared to $(L+1)$-layer ones; (2) an unconditional separation between encoder and decoder, exhibiting a hard task for decoders that can be solved by an exponentially shallower and smaller encoder; (3) a provable advantage of chain-of-thought, exhibiting a task that becomes exponentially easier when the model is allowed to produce an intermediate sequence of tokens before outputting the final answer. On the technical side, we propose the multi-party autoregressive communication model that abstracts the key aspects of a decoder-only Transformer. In particular, lower bounds within this communication model imply lower bounds against decoder-only transformers, independent of their implementation details. To prove lower bounds in this communication model, we also introduce a new proof technique that finds a certain indistinguishable decomposition of all possible inputs iteratively. We believe our new communication model and proof techniques will be helpful to understand the computational power of transformers further."

    "abstract": "Hybrid DC circuit breakers featuring an ultrafast Thomson coil actuator are a key technology for enabling envisioned medium voltage DC grids. Particularly, the design of the actuator is considered challenging and has therefore been addressed in research for more than 20 years. These investigations have focused on actuators in conjunction with current injection type DC circuit breakers. However, these results cannot be transferred to arc commutation hybrid DC circuit breakers. For this breaker topology, the interaction between actuator parameters and breaker performance is not well understood, yet it is essential in order to define functional requirements for the actuator. This paper provides the first investigation of this interaction, by integrating an analysis of the commutation process into the design consideration. New insights regarding the contact separation time of the actuator and its implications to the overall circuit breaker performance are presented. Resulting feasible operating regions of the actuator are established—combining requirements to contact separation time and average velocity—and it is discussed how these are influenced by different fault current scenarios, grid voltages and relay times. Through a demonstration case, we exemplify that an optimal actuator design features a trade-off between velocity and contact separation time."

    "abstract": "Precision medicine requires cuffless blood pressure (BP) estimation technologies to achieve high accuracy levels suitable for healthcare monitoring. Recent advances, notably in personalized BP estimation methods utilizing transfer learning, have partially met these requirements. However, traditional personalized fine-tuning pipelines often ignore key physiological factors across age groups, thus limiting their effectiveness. This study identifies an important fine-tuning principle: target subjects benefit most when fine-tuned using a source model pretrained on an age-matched group. We introduce a novel two-level ensemble learning method, ATTE, which integrates multiple BP models for cuffless BP estimation based on pulse waves. It first performs feature-level ensemble learning (FEL) to combine age-group-specific fine-tuned models and enrich representations, then applies an optimized Bayesian model averaging (BMA) method that adaptively weights model outputs to boost accuracy and reduce model-selection uncertainty. Using only 50 transfer samples, ATTE improved systolic and diastolic BP estimation accuracy by 6.55% and 5.58% on a public dataset, compared to the traditional fine-tuning paradigm. It also achieved improvements of 5.10% and 8.30% on a self-collected dataset, which has been preliminarily validated in an elderly care scenario. Ablation and interpretability analyses validated the age-matched fine-tuning principle, the effectiveness of ATTE, and its model-agnostic generalizability. This work represents a pioneering step in optimizing personalized BP estimation and underscores its significant potential for real-world healthcare applications."

    "abstract": "While cloud computing offers a more scalable and resource-rich alternative against localized edge and IoT device data processes, it falls short in latency-sensitive, safety-critical applications due to delays caused by geographical distance. In domains like healthcare, where real-time analysis of patient vitals and emergency alerts is essential, and in VANETs, where vehicles must instantly exchange data for collision avoidance and traffic safety, such delays can have serious consequences. To address these limitations, fog computing architectures are increasingly adopted to enable proximate, low-latency data processing, ensuring timely and reliable responses in both healthcare and intelligent transportation systems. However, adopting fog computing introduces additional complexities related to task offloading, task scheduling, resource management, heterogeneity, and scalability. While these scientific fields of study have gained significant attention in the past few years, the existing widely used simulation tools, e.g., FogWorkflowSim, cannot effectively address critical issues such as supporting large-scale IoT networks, handling environment partitioning for parallel execution, and managing diverse resource management policies. Furthermore, since they are written in Java, they do not support many of the existing Python-based Machine Learning (ML) libraries, which are significantly attractive to many researchers. To address these limitations, this paper introduces FogZoneSim, an advanced modular fog computing simulator specifically designed to manage large-scale IoT environments. FogZoneSim effectively simulates scalable IoT ecosystems by clearly modeling IoT resources, brokers, and the infrastructure, supporting dependent workflows, providing customizable policies, partitioning environments, and scaling across numerous IoT devices. Also, its seamless integration with ML algorithms through Python libraries is another strong point. According to an extensive set of simulations, FogZoneSim has demonstrated its ability to significantly enhance researchers’ capabilities in analyzing and optimizing resource management strategies, energy efficiency, execution time, and overall system performance."

The heavy re-training overhead of LLMs for handling the dynamic features of wireless networks also poses a challenge. This paper presents a new LLM-empowered framework for intent-driven wireless resource allocation. The framework features a dual-expert LLM architecture, consisting of an instruction expert for generating resource allocation instructions and a policy expert for obtaining numerically-precise policies. Both experts encompass lightweight adapters and collaborate with the locally deployed LLM for resource allocation. Decoupling the generation of instruction and policy benefits efficient adaptation and generalization under diverse task requests and dynamic network states. We further propose a new two-stage fine-tuning protocol to enhance the adaptability of LLM-empowered resource allocation through distillation and reinforcement. Experiments on two major application cases demonstrate the superior adaptability and generalization abilities of the proposed LLM-empowered resource allocation framework with two-stage fine-tuning, compared to existing schemes."

If grid power is balanced, only all the network sensors work correctly to control health care instruments correctly, and the leading grid network operates in balanced conditions. Power system operation and control are always maintained and balanced in the distribution network. Still, an uncertain load connection (Power Theft) makes the system unbalanced in every aspect, affecting the voltage magnitude and creating deviations in all parameters. So, power system health monitoring is essential for detecting every parameter and taking corrective actions, which is the aim of our research. Here, we are taking two areas (Kalyani & Durgapur and Asansol of W.B.S.E.B) of West Bengal, which is a hub of the healthcare center of their district. First, we test normal loads with simulation and analysis of all the parameters essential to power stability analysis. After that, the same model is tested with additional uncertain loads and gives a comparative study of parameters, which will help determine corrective measurement actions and balance the system. Power theft is a vital issue to the redundant progress of the power system. The main aim of the power system is to supply power to the distribution section uninterruptedly, reliably, and with a quality supply."

After extensive experimentation, RoBERTa was opted for NER based on its higher inference accuracy, whereas NLTK was utilized for POS tagging in balancing efficiency with approximate accuracy. This layered approach enhances precision in distinguishing segments requiring transliteration, improving multilingual text processing. A key problem while undertaking this task was limited training data specifically related to domains. To solve this, a custom LLMbased synthetic data generation pipeline was created that uses an Agentic-AI approach, adaptive model swapping, and hyperparameter tuning to enhance diversity and reduce redundancy in generated text. This process allowed for the production of a high-quality dataset to train models with, guaranteeing strong performance at segment classification."

    "abstract": "Branch target buffer (BTB) is a central component of high performance core front-ends as it not only steers instruction fetch by uncovering upcoming control flow but also enables highly effective fetch-directed instruction prefetching. However, the massive instruction footprints of modern server applications far exceed the capacities of moderately sized BTBs, resulting in frequent misses that inevitably hurt performance. While commercial CPUs deploy large BTBs to mitigate this problem, they incur high storage and area overheads. Prior efforts to reduce BTB storage have primarily targeted branch targets, which has proven highly effective — so much that the tag storage now dominates the BTB storage budget. We make a key observation that BTBs exhibit a large degree of tag redundancy, i.e. only a small fraction of entries contain unique tags, and this fraction falls sharply as BTB capacity grows. Leveraging this insight, we propose LiteBTB, which employs a dedicated hardware structure to store unique tags only once and replaces per-entry tags in BTB with compact tag pointers. To avoid latency overheads, LiteBTB accesses the tag storage and BTB in parallel. Our evaluation shows that LiteBTB reduces storage by up to 13.1% compared to the state-of-the-art BTB design, called BTB-X, while maintaining equivalent performance. Alternatively, with the same storage budget, LiteBTB accommodates up to 1.125× more branches, yielding up to 2.7% performance improvement."

The robot has been developed with legacy, low-cost sensors, including an RPLiDAR C1 and a Kinect for Xbox 360 depth camera, chosen for their affordability and compatibility with the ROS ecosystem. It is also readily available in our laboratory. We detail the hardware configuration and the ROS 1-based software architecture that enable simultaneous localization, mapping, and autonomous navigation in both 2D and 3D environments. The performance of the proposed system is evaluated through simulation in the Gazebo environment and real-world experiments. Results demonstrate that the robot can operate effectively, generating accurate maps and following planned trajectories. In ten repeated real-world trials, the maximum deviation in the generated 2 D maps was measured at 1.06 % in length and 1.75 % in width. The proposed robot offers significant potential for educational and research applications in mobile robotics due to its affordability, flexibility, and reproducibility."

    "abstract": "Temperature anomalies are becoming more frequent and severe as climate change accelerates, endangering the stability of ecosystems and the economy, particularly in climate-sensitive regions such as northwest Bangladesh. With the aid of two cutting-edge unsupervised deep learning models-LSTM Variational Autoencoder (LSTM-VAE) and Anomaly Transformer-the proposed article aims to provide a state-of-the-art method for the identification and description of such temperature variations. We show how these models may be used to identify both rapid and slow climatic changes and provide fresh perspectives on the evolving nature of the global warming process by analyzing the temperature data gathered by Ishwardi and Rajshahi (19802024). Long-term and structural changes in temperature trends are best detected by the Anomaly Transformer, whereas high-intensity, impulsive, and short-term temperature spikes are best detected by the LSTM-VAE. Our findings show that, whereas temperatures in Rajshahi have fluctuated rapidly, those in Ishwardi have changed slowly, highlighting the growing need to address climate vulnerabilities. The research offers a robust multi-model framework for early warning systems and risk assessments, while also enhancing our understanding of climate change in the regions. This will enable policymakers and environmental planners to develop more knowledge-driven and proactive climate resilience agendas with the aid of such advanced models. The importance of forming new strategies for the uncertain and ever-changing future of the climate is highlighted in this essay."

The inherent complexity, variability, and heterogeneity of 3D heritage datasets often hinder the effectiveness of conventional segmentation models in terms of precision and generalization. To address these limitations, transfer learning and domain adaptation have gained prominence by enabling the reuse of knowledge from pre-trained models and mitigating domain shifts between source and target data. This review systematically categorizes and evaluates existing methodologies, with a particular emphasis on their application within the domain of cultural heritage. It encompasses a broad spectrum of topics, including 3D data acquisition techniques, the design and refinement of deep learning architectures, and the metrics employed for performance evaluation. Furthermore, the review discusses persistent challenges such as limited labeled data, variability in lighting conditions, material textures, and geometric scales. By integrating recent advances and synthesizing key contributions across the literature, this work aims to provide a foundational reference for researchers and practitioners seeking to improve the semantic segmentation of 3D cultural heritage objects and environments."

The LED, activated via the switch, signals the readiness for password input. If the LED is off, the system denies access and triggers an audible alert using the buzzer. Users enter the password through the keypad, and upon verification, the system unlocks the door by actuating the servo motor. Incorrect password entries or attempts to access the system when the LED is off also activate the buzzer. The LCD provides real-time feedback, displaying statuses such as “Enter Password,” “Access Granted,” and “Incorrect Password.” By combining embedded systems with fundamental security principles, this project demonstrates a cost-effective and efficient approach to access control. The integration of the switch-controlled LED mechanism ensures the password entry process is only enabled when necessary, enhancing both security and user control."

    "abstract": "Chennai urban transport systems in India are still tackling some issues, including poor ticketing procedures, the absence of real-time commuter information, and constant delays. Metropolitan Transport Corporation (MTC), which manages a fleet of 729 buses, mostly bases its operations on paper-based ticketing, which, when added to unpredictable traffic conditions and poor digital infrastructure, translates into decreased efficiency of operations and customer dissatisfaction. The given paper introduces Sprint Bus, a project to modernize the services of the MTC in terms of public buses using high technology and digital solutions. The suggested system includes digital e-ticketing, use of a QR code to validate the trip, AI-based optimization of routes, and real-time tracking of buses. One of the interesting details is offline QR validation ability; this is aimed at working well in poorly connected spaces. In the effort of establishing the needs of commuters and their readiness to adopt the new technologies, a survey was carried out online and offline, and it was noted that commuters were interested in these technologies as cashless ticketing, shorter waiting times, and proper arrival times. The solution was constructed utilizing a methodical four-phase way of building a prototype. The first results reveal great potential to enhance the passenger convenience, the clarity of the operations, and portability in the scope of urban transport networks. The present framework proves that the application of emerging technologies has the potential to solve the time-old problems of inefficiency in public transportation, as well as the general commuter experience present in the increasingly crowded metropolitan cities."

The IMOABC component, augmented by a Spherical Search (SS) mechanism, enhances global exploration and solution diversity. Concurrently, a Gradient Repair Method (GRM), formulated using the LevenbergMarquardt scheme with Broyden updates, reinstates the feasibility of infeasible solutions. An <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\epsilon$</tex>-constraint strategy is utilized for efficient constraint management. An Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) is employed as a post-Pareto analysis tool to enhance decision-making by identifying the Best Compromise Solution (BCS). The proposed hybrid underwent thorough testing on the IEEE 57-bus system, addressing multiple conflicting objectives such as the minimization of fuel costs, active power losses, and emissions. The comparative results indicate that the framework consistently exceeds both conventional and advanced algorithms regarding convergence speed, diversity preservation, and constraint satisfaction. The findings highlight the effectiveness, resilience, and scalability of the proposed IMOABC-NSGA-II framework as a decision-support tool for contemporary sustainable power system operation."

    "abstract": "The rapid emergence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has become one of the most pressing public health concerns of the 21st century, leading to a significant increase in treatment failures and mortality rates. Fungal infections pose a significant challenge to human health, agriculture, and food security. The emergence of antimicrobial resistance has exacerbated the problem, limiting the efficacy of currently available treatments. Natural sources, including medicinal plants, endophytic fungi, soil microorganisms, and marine organisms, offer promising avenues for discovering bioactive compounds with potent antimicrobial properties. This study aims to screen the microorganisms from the various natural sources like soils, waters from various locations. The screening has resulted in the successful isolation of antimicrobial compound-producing bacteria from rhizosphere of mint, which was identified as Bacillus velezensis by 16s RNA sequencing at NCIM, Pune. It was observed that Bacillus velezensis produces an antifungal compound by submerged fermentations (SMF), which shows activity against Candida albicans by agar-plate assay method and results in a zone of clearance of about 2.9 cm. The production medium will be further optimized by Taguchi DOE methodology, aiming to increase further the production of the extracellular antifungal compound. Further, the optimized medium will be validated by scaling up in the fermenter under a set of optimized physico-chemical environments. The purification of extracellular compound will involve the solvent-solvent extraction, column chromatography, upon further which the compound will be characterized to predict the structure by NMR and Mass spectrometry. Furthermore, the study will investigate the mechanism of action of these compounds and assess their potential for therapeutic applications in combating the fungal infections. The anticipated outcomes include the identification of novel antifungal compounds, improved understanding of their mechanisms, and the development of sustainable alternatives to synthetic antifungal agents. By contributing to drug discovery and agricultural disease management, this research aligns with global efforts to combat antifungal resistance and promote environmental sustainability."

However, despite their popularity and capabilities, LLMs face critical challenges that undermine trust in their efficiency and accuracy. One of the most significant challenges is hallucination, which stems from their strong generalisation abilities. This issue results in LLMs generating responses that lack evidence of correctness in reality.This paper analyses hallucinations in responses generated for robotic task planning. The NAO humanoid robot is selected as the platform for task planning experiments, and GPT-3.5, Llama 3.1, Gemma 3, and CodeX are used as the LLMs for response generation. The generated responses include YAML representations and Python 2 code. We introduce specific metrics to measure hallucinations in the context of robotic task planning.The core objective of this paper is to investigate how prompt engineering can mitigate hallucinations using these metrics. Experimental results demonstrate that incorporating prompt engineering—by providing additional context and information to the LLMs—reduces the occurrence of hallucinations in task planning responses."

    "abstract": "This paper addresses a mine dispensing problem, wherein multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) transport mines from a base to a set of desired target locations. Each UAV operates on a shuttle basis, returning to the base after each delivery to collect the next mine. The primary objective is to minimize the total mission time. Since this problem involves allocation, which is NP-hard, we propose a heuristic algorithm, Farther Target First (FTF), to efficiently generate feasible solutions. To benchmark the quality of the heuristic solutions, we also formulate the problem as a binary integer program and solve it using standard optimization tools. Further to allocation, we introduce a scheduling algorithm to regulate safe UAV movements during mine dispensing. The algorithm adopts an Air Traffic Control-like approach, dividing the battlefield into sectors and altitude layers or corridors. The scheduling algorithm ensures that no two UAVs occupy the same altitude corridor within the same sector concurrently. Together with the FTF allocation heuristic, this yields a two-stage solution, where we ‘first allocate and then schedule’. Finally, we give an integrated allocation and scheduling algorithm to solve the mine dispensing problem. Comprehensive simulations demonstrate that the integrated approach consistently outperforms the two-stage method across various mission scenarios."

Here, the triggering rule is constructed with fewer triggering parameters compared to the existing event-based ASTC design approaches ( [1]–[3]). Also, we have shown that the proposed approach reduces the practical sliding motion band size. Furthermore, the gain adaptation law is constructed here based on the sampled output information to determine the dynamic gain, which addresses the over-estimation problem in designing the control gain for unknown disturbance bound. Finally, an academic example is simulated to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, and the comparison study is also included with the periodic sampling strategy."

We apply Reinforcement Learning (RL) to control a full-body biomechanical model consisting of two arms, two legs and a torso with a pivoted pelvis. It consists of a total of 212 muscles and 220 tendons. We also apply this method to concurrently control four motor-actuated exoskeletons located at the elbows and knees. These components collectively control 107 joints. As this is a highly overactuated system, uncorrelated exploration strategies for RL are unable to converge to controllers with acceptable tracking performance in a computationally efficient manner. To mitigate this, we apply Differential Extrinsic Plasticity for generating correlated noise during RL exploration. We incorporate this RL-based control method into a motion capture pipeline, allowing real-time tracking of human body movements during industrial and daily activities at a granular musculoskeletal level, going beyond kinematic tracking typical for motion capture studies. We evaluate the position tracking errors for motion capture data in conditions with and without the exoskeletons attached, and compare the corresponding activations in major muscles."

When the blood flow to a portion of human brain is interrupted, cerebrum tissue is deprived of oxygen and nutrients, it results in a condition called stroke. Nevertheless, the brain cells begin to die in a matter of minutes. This research intends to infer a model condition for developing a stroke pre-analysis algorithm with the possibly modifiable risk factors. Ischemic embolic and haemorrhagic strokes represent the bulk of strokes. Consequently, the objective of the proposed research work is to apply the standards of Convolution Neural Network (CNN) over the huge existing datasets to predict the most likely life threatening risks that might follow the primary occurrence. Further the refinement in these algorithms could give immense utility in clinical settings and stroke treatment and furthermore provide more knowledge on the new advancements and utilization of CNN in neuroimaging focuses on analyzing the intense ischemic stroke and apply Le-Net CNN model to process the patient profile data."

    "abstract": "Trajectory generation forms a crucial bridge between high-level decision-making and low-level control in robotics, enabling precise, repeatable, and adaptive motion for complex tasks across domains such as medical robotics and industrial automation. Traditional methods, such as dynamic movement primitives (DMP), effectively generate robot trajectories but require careful hyperparameter tuning for optimal performance. While this helps to some extent, the combined approach still struggles with complex, non-linear motion patterns, takes a lot of time to train, and often becomes unstable during long tasks. To address these challenges, a dynamic adaptive trajectory radial network (DATRN) is proposed for real-time trajectory generation in robotic manipulation tasks. This approach leverages radial basis function neural networks (RBFN). Our experiments on four representative tasks, pick & place, stacking, lateral pushing, and surface wiping, demonstrate that DATRN achieves higher reduction in training time, higher trajectory fitting accuracy, and better stabilization on long-horizon trajectories."

    "abstract": "Confronting global environmental challenges, the urban energy landscape is undergoing a crucial transition toward sustainable models. This research employs a Complex Adaptive System of Systems (CASoS) approach grounded in Multi-Carrier Energy Systems (MCES) to examine the realization of seven fundamental principles in this energy transition, with the ultimate objective of enhancing smart grid efficiency in a bottom-up decentralized and people-centric approach. The investigation centers on seven interconnected pillars, each beginning with the letter D, that collectively drive this transformation: Decarbonization of energy sources, Digitalization of infrastructure, Decentralization of generation, Diversification of resources, Demand-side management strategies, accommodation of Dynamicity in energy flows, Democratization of energy systems. Together, these principles form a comprehensive framework for reimagining how cities can achieve a sustainable energy future through integrated smart grid solutions."

    "abstract": "Federated heterogeneity refers to the disparities in data distributions, model architectures, and communication capabilities across various devices or institutional entities. In real-world scenarios, statistical heterogeneity can often lead to ineffective aggregation, severely impacting generalization performance and resulting in biased or unstable model weights. Theoretically, distributional robustness analysis indicates that the generalization performance of a learning model can be bounded with respect to any heterogeneity distribution. This insight motivates us to reconsider the aggregation strategy in federated statistical heterogeneity scenarios, and we thus propose a new weighting aggregation protocol that considers the generalization bound disagreement of each local model. Specifically, we estimate the upper and lower bounds of the second-order origin moment of the shifted distribution for the current local model, and using these bound disagreements as the aggregation proportions for weights in each communication round. Our experiments demonstrate that this proposed aggregation protocol significantly improves the performance of several representative Federated Learning algorithms on benchmark datasets."

    "abstract": "Detecting anomalies in multivariate time series remains difficult when data distributions shift over time. Existing approaches often struggle to remain effective under such temporal drift. We present a Dual-Pass Autoencoder, a new architecture that directly addresses this issue by learning two complementary perspectives of the data: one from the raw sequence and another from its temporal context. These dual representations are fused through a drift-adaptation mechanism, enabling the model to distinguish true anomalies from natural distributional changes. Unlike conventional autoencoder-based methods, our design explicitly incorporates temporal self-attention and adaptive latent fusion, resulting in drift-aware embeddings that are both expressive and robust. The reconstructed feature vectors, supported by an auxiliary classifier, provide strong discriminative capacity for anomaly detection. Comprehensive experiments on diverse real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms leading baselines in both accuracy and robustness, establishing Dual-Pass Autoencoder as an effective solution for anomaly detection in evolving temporal environments."

This study investigates the integration of net metering with demand response (DR) as a solution for load balancing in microgrids. A case study is conducted for a commercial facility in Pavia, Italy, evaluating the technical and economic feasibility of a photovoltaic (PV) system utilizing net metering and DR. The HOMER software is used to simulate energy flows, considering solar radiation, load demand, and financial parameters. The results indicate that 67.7% of the facility's energy demand is met through on-site PV generation, with 32.9% of excess energy exported to the grid. Net metering significantly reduces reliance on the grid, enhancing energy self-sufficiency and cost-effectiveness. Additionally, demand response strategies contribute to peak demand reduction and grid stability. The findings highlight the economic viability of integrating net metering and demand response, emphasizing their role in optimizing microgrid operations. Moreover, the study demonstrates that a 98% power exchange balance between the grid and the consumer is achieved, ensuring an efficient utilization of energy and further reinforcing the benefits of net metering in microgrid management."

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of remote sensing technology, satellite remote sensing imagery has become an indispensable foundational data support for fields such as environmental monitoring, disaster early warning, resource management, and urban planning. Among them, water body information extraction holds critical scientific value and application significance in dynamic flood monitoring, refined water resource management, wetland ecological protection, and climate change research. However, water body recognition from satellite remote sensing imagery currently faces challenges due to the complexity of surface cover and the diversity of ground object spectra, which hinder effective characterization of the water body feature space. Differences in imaging conditions introduce noise that significantly reduces recognition accuracy. Traditional methods based on spectral thresholds or shallow machine learning struggle to achieve synergistic optimization of accuracy, efficiency, and generalization ability when processing high-resolution multi/hyperspectral data. To address these issues, this study constructs a U-Net deep learning framework integrated with multiple evolutionary algorithms. Through a hybrid search strategy combining multiple evolutionary computation algorithms, it achieves efficient optimization of network hyperparameter combinations, significantly improving the model's identification accuracy and anti-interference robustness for water body boundaries in complex scenarios. Furthermore, a Channel-Spatial Dual Attention Mechanism is embedded in the U-Net encoder-decoder structure. By adaptively learning feature weights in spectral and spatial dimensions, it effectively suppresses the spectral confusion effects of non-water ground objects and enhances the feature distinguishability between water bodies and background objects. Experiments using multi-source satellite datasets and evaluation metrics are conducted. Experiment Results show that the proposed model achieved significant advantages in key metrices, demonstrating superior feature representation capability, generalization performance, and convergence efficiency."

This paper investigates the performance of eleven classical pathfinding algorithms—including Dijkstra, Depth First Search (DFS), Floyd Warshall, Binary Search, and Prim’s MST on an Ackermann steered electric vehicle (EV) based AGV navigating six charging stations in a simulated urban environment. Algorithms are classified into By Station and By Edge , with implementations adapted to meet their specific routing requirements. AGV performance is evaluated using conventional metrics runtime, travel distance, cost, speed, and station visitation alongside a novel Energy Consumption Score (ECS) that balances operational efficiency with computational overhead. Results show that classical algorithms can efficiently handle static, predictable networks, though some prioritize cost over station coverage. ECS provides a unified framework to rank algorithm suitability. The obtained results shows, Based on the tested algorithms: Floyd Warshall achieved the best overall performance in terms of minimal cost and ECS. For maximizing station coverage, TSP and Prim’s MST were the most effective. Edge-based algorithms proved reliable for navigating predefined routes but were generally less efficient in terms of overall cost and energy consumption.Future work will explore heuristic and hybrid approaches, dynamic networks, multi AGV coordination, and energy aware routing for improved urban path planning."

    "abstract": "Safe autonomous navigation in pedestrian-rich environments demands more than collision avoidance—it requires the prioritization of pedestrian and other vulnerable traffic participants. In this paper, we present a real-time framework that enables vehicles to make decisions based not only on predicted Time-To-Collision (TTC), but also on the relevance of each pedestrian’s intention within a multi-hypothesis predictive model. The system builds upon a multi-pedestrian, multi-intention tracker that employs a Probability Hypothesis Density filter enhanced with a Generalized Potential Field Approach (PHD-GPFA) to estimate multiple future trajectories and intentions per pedestrian. Each trajectory hypothesis is associated with a belief weight that captures intention confidence. Unlike traditional risk assessment methods that rely solely on TTC, we propose a joint relevance metric that fuses TTC with belief-based intention likelihoods, enabling the vehicle to identify and respond to the most critical interactions in the scene. At every simulation timestep, vehicle speed is dynamically adjusted based on the most relevant pedestrian hypothesis. We evaluate the system in a SUMO-based simulation across multi-agent pedestrian scenarios, where it demonstrates proactive and context-sensitive responses to dynamic pedestrian behaviors. Our results highlight the advantages of integrating intention confidence into risk-aware planning."

Conventional estimation methods frequently disregard model and measurement uncertainties, offering point estimates that lack a quantitative assessment of their reliability. In order to address these limitations, the present paper proposes a sideslip angle estimator based on a zonotopic Kalman filter. This approach provides both an estimate and a guaranteed bound that accounts for system uncertainties. The approach under consideration explicitly models and propagates measurement noise and parametric uncertainties, resulting in bounded, reliable estimates over time. The validation process is executed through the implementation of co-simulations, employing CarSim, a high-fidelity vehicle dynamics simulator, which is integrated with MATLAB. The findings indicate that the estimated zonotopes consistently envelop the ground truth sideslip angle across a range of driving scenarios, thereby demonstrating the robustness and reliability of the estimator."

    "abstract": "Due to the benefit of separate torque management, distributed drive electric vehicles have great promise for vehicle dynamic control. However, the dynamic vertical load transfer brought on by large-angle pitch and roll motions on uneven roads is frequently too much for the current trajectory tracking controllers to handle, which lowers control performance. To address this issue, a hierarchical control approach is suggested in this work. Presenting an enhanced vertical load prediction model that specifically takes big pitch and roll angles into account is its primary contribution. The upper-level controller determines the front wheel angle for path tracking using model predictive control. In order to optimize torque distribution and improve stability, the lower-level controller uses a linear quadratic regulator to achieve differential steering control based on the estimated vertical load. The efficiency of the suggested approach is confirmed by the simulation results under the rapidly accelerated double-shifting line condition. The approach suggested in this research improves tracking accuracy and stability by reducing the maximum lateral deviation by 2.34% and the average yaw velocity deviation by 5.91% when compared to the conventional load transfer methods."

The latency-sensitive premium traffic is mission-critical, and each traffic packet is required to reach the user via multiple edge servers before a tight deadline. To reduce the packet loss due to queue blocking or channel fading, we apply MDS coding to the multipath transmission at the cost of slightly increasing the communication overhead. For homogeneous systems, we derive the optimal code parameter under the assumption of independent traffic at multiple paths. For heterogeneous systems, we propose greedy and greedy+ algorithms for load allocation. Simulation results show that with traffic dependency at multiple paths our proposed greedy+ algorithm outperforms equal allocation in most cases."

Two passive sensing receivers are deployed at different locations to detect the bistatic Doppler frequencies of the target UAV at different directions according to downlink signals transmitted from their corresponding BSs, such that the velocities of the UAV versus time can be estimated. Hence, the trajectories of the target UAV can be reconstructed. Although both the target UAV and the sensing receivers are around 200 meters away from the illuminating BSs, it is demonstrated by experiments that the tracking errors are below 50 centimeters for 90% of the complicated trajectories, when the distances between the UAV and sensing receivers are less than 30 meters. Note this accuracy is significantly better than the ranging resolution of LTE signals, high-accuracy trajectory tracking for UAV might be feasible via multi-angle bistatic Doppler measurements if the receivers are deployed with a sufficient density."

    "abstract": "Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP) remains one of the leading causes of blindness in children globally. Global screening for ROP is limited by the shortage of trained ophthalmologists and low access to care in resource-limited settings. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can be utilized to analyze medical images. However, VLMs also have limitations for ROP screening, including patient data privacy concerns, computational requirements for point-of-care devices, and the need for clinically interpretable predictions. In this study, we present TeleROP-VLF, a federated learning framework for VLM collaboration to train and perform analysis across multi-wearable retinal imaging devices while preserving sensitive patient data from leaving the hospital. TeleROP-VLF contributes three distinct innovations to the literature: 1) a lightweight VLM architecture that fits within wearable retina imaging devices through structured pruning and knowledge distillation; 2) a federated aggregation protocol with provable convergence; and 3) an explainable module that provides vessel geometry analysis with clinical meaning, aligned with established ROP diagnosis criteria including plus disease indicators, zone classification, and tortuosity. Using TeleROP-VLF in five neonatal intensive care units, we observe diagnostic performance comparable to expert ophthalmologists at 87.6% accuracy ultimately producing on-device inference that processes within 2.3 seconds on an autonomous edge computing platform while providing differential privacy guarantees and retaining a privacy budget of ϵ = 1.8. Coupled with clinical validation of explainable vascular geometric features, TeleROP-VLF aids clinician trust and facilitates early interventions to prevent vision loss for vulnerable premature infants."

    "abstract": "Burn injuries are the fourth most common type of injury; they are usually caused when the skin comes in contact with fire, hot water, radiation, or dangerous chemicals. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), an estimated 180,000 deaths occur every year due to burns. Different types of burn injuries require different medical procedures and medications; therefore, it is essential to diagnose a burn injury as early as possible to ensure that the patient receives proper treatment. Burns are usually diagnosed through visual inspection, which is subjective to the doctor’s experience and is usually only 50-70% accurate. A delay in diagnosis and precise treatment may lead to severe complications and, in worst-case scenarios, may also cause death. Unfortunately, in remote areas of Pakistan, where only basic dispensaries, clinics, or Primary Healthcare Units (PHUs) are available, and due to the lack of burn experts and the absence of Laser Doppler Imaging (LDI) equipment, such accurate diagnoses are not possible. As a result, many burn victims are either left untreated or given incorrect treatment, leading to complications. In this research, we propose a deep learning-based approach to assess the severity of acute burns in terms of burn degree and the affected Total Body Surface Area (TBSA%) from 2D images. The primary objective of our work is to determine the degree of a burn injury (first-degree, second-degree, third-degree, fourth-degree, and mixed-degree) and, based on the classification, estimate the TBSA% to advise on the appropriate medication required for the affected area. To achieve real-time diagnosis, an Android-based system has also been developed, allowing users to capture images and obtain instant results on acute burns detected in the image, including their severity, TBSA%, and recommended treatment."

    "abstract": "Autonomous path planning and collision avoidance (CA) in complex maritime environments are critical challenges for Maritime Autonomous Surface Ships (MASSs). This paper presents a novel hierarchical motion planning framework that integrates global and local path planning algorithms. For global path planning in static obstacle environments, a hybrid approach combining A*, Bezier curves, and particle swarm optimization (PSO) is proposed to enhance path search efficiency and ensure smooth trajectory optimization. For local path planning and collision avoidance with dynamic vessels, a multi-ship CA algorithm based on velocity prediction potential fields is introduced. A new collision-risk identification model is developed to ensure compliance with COLREGS and enable collaborative CA in complex multi-ship scenarios. The framework also addresses environments with both dynamic and static obstacles through a dynamic path planner that integrates global and local planning. A key innovation is the dynamic CA decision-making mechanism with alteration of course and/or speed (ACS), which provides robust real-time navigation strategies. Validation through simulations, real-ship model tests, and AIS-data analysis demonstrates the framework’s robustness and adaptability for MASS navigation. Compared to existing methods, the proposed approach significantly reduces collision-avoidance path length while maintaining safety, real-time performance, and COLREGS compliance. This work advances autonomous maritime navigation by addressing complex scenarios with a unified framework that balances efficiency, safety, and regulatory adherence."

Furthermore, reliance on centralized RAG architectures raises critical data governance concerns, as organizations and governments are reluctant to forfeit control of sensitive data, thereby centralizing economic benefits and exacerbating regional digital divides. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel framework that leverages a distributed network of specialized LLMs rooted in the principles of Distributed Retrieval-Augmented Generation (DRAG). Our proposed architecture eliminates the need for a centralized knowledge base, allowing data owners to retain full control over their assets. We detail an intelligent query-routing mechanism for efficient knowledge discovery within the network and, critically, propose a comprehensive incentive model to encourage the active participation of regional entities. By fostering a collaborative, yet decentralized, ecosystem, this framework facilitates equitable data governance and paves the way for a sustainable, regional data economy, empowering local communities and enhancing the accuracy of LLMs."

    "abstract": "This work investigates a multi-skill robot multi-objective hybrid disassembly line balancing problem (MRHD), aiming to maximize profit and minimize the difference in workstation operating times. Based on practical applications, we propose a disassembly line balancing model for robots with different skill sets, allowing optimized task scheduling according to robot capabilities to improve disassembly efficiency and reduce labor costs. Specifically, we build a mixed-integer programming model and find its precise solution via IBM's mathematical programming solver CPLEX, thereby validating the correctness of the proposed model. Additionally, an improved fireworks algorithm (IFA) is proposed to find approximate optimal solutions for sizable MRHD. The optimal solution obtained by IFA is compared with the exact solution from CPLEX through a disassembly task. Experimental results and analysis demonstrate the competitive performance of the developed approach in high solution speed and good adaptability for multi-objective optimization and large-scale disassembly line problems, providing effective decision support for real-world remanufacturing applications."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a high-performance gate driver IC for Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistors (IGBTs), fabricated in a 0.25μm Bipolar-CMOS-DMOS (BCD) technology. The driver addresses three critical challenges in modern power electronics: the need for high driving current, operation at 100% duty cycle, and robust noise immunity. The architecture features a dual N-channel LDMOS totem-pole output stage, delivering measured peak currents exceeding 9A/16A for rapid switching of large IGBTs. To overcome the limitations of conventional bootstrap circuits, a hybrid high-side supply is implemented, integrating a low-power charge pump that ensures stable gate voltage during 100% duty-cycle operation. A key innovation is the emitter-referenced negative turn-off scheme, which generates an effective -10V gate-emitter voltage by elevating the IGBT's emitter potential to +10V, thereby eliminating the need for a dedicated negative power supply rail and simplifying system design. Experimental results from the fabricated chip validate the high-current capability, full operational duty-cycle range, and the successful implementation of the negative biasing structure. The proposed driver offers a robust, highly integrated, and cost-effective solution for demanding industrial and automotive applications."

Trust is a dynamic, context-dependent construct that, when misaligned, can lead to misuse or disuse. To investigate trust formation in age-friendly human–robot interaction (HRI), we conducted a mixed-methods study with 22 community-dwelling older adults who interacted with two commercial pet robots (EMO and Loona) in a field setting. Participants engaged in naturalistic interactions supported by a facilitator who previewed upcoming actions, explained robot responses, and encouraged reflection on the robots’ behaviors. Building on the ‘Kansei of the Elderly’ framework, we derive robot-specific design implications for trust cues. Behaviors supporting legibility, reciprocity, pace-matching, and controllability; such as brief previews and explanations for the robot’s actions, timely acknowledgements, slightly longer response windows, and easy undo functionality, were consistently associated with higher engagement and fewer help-seeking events. Participants often laughed and felt comfortable during the sessions; notably, facilitator interpretations of the robot’s behaviors frequently prompted discussions among peers. We conclude by outlining design guidelines for AI-enabled pet companion robots that translate these insights into actionable features, and situate our contributions within trust-preserving human-in-the-loop assistance and legible interaction frameworks."

A multi-winding transformer connects the primary power source to multiple secondary battery modules, where each secondary winding is dedicated to one battery pack, thereby achieving voltage equalization during simultaneous charging. The proposed architecture features a wide input-voltage range, high scalability, low cost of expansion, and fully independent balancing channels. During system extension, no additional active switches are required, significantly simplifying the control-loop design. Furthermore, zero-voltage switching (ZVS) is implemented to enhance efficiency, and its realization process is described in detail. A simulation model for a three-cell balancing circuit is built to validate the proposed scheme. Two simulation cases with different initial battery states confirm the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed circuit."

The Arrhenius-Normal model exhibits an excellent fit to the stress–life relationship, enabling precise lifetime predictions under normal operating conditions. The analysis also confirms that while the mean and standard deviation of lifetime decrease with increasing stress, their ratio—the coefficient of variation—remains constant, aligning with findings in recent literature. The results are benchmarked against previously reported outcomes for validation and comparison."

The graphical user interface consists of interconnected modules: a central control panel with a query history, a workspace for displaying and editing the mission code, and a mapping module for graphical route design. An important component is an intelligent conversational interface based on neural network models. This assistant allows operators to set and edit mission programs through voice interaction. The proposed interface option simplifies the process of assigning missions to the vehicle, which significantly reduces the time needed to prepare for deployment and reduces the likelihood of human error. The system reduces the level of operators' specialized programming knowledge, increasing the availability and efficiency of AUV mission settings."

This paper proposes a multi-objective optimization approach using the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-III (NSGA-III) to determine optimal time multiplier settings (TMS), plug settings (PS), and relay characteristics for DOCRs. The method minimizes primary relay operating times, backup relay operating times, and coordination time interval (CTI) errors without requiring weighting factors. It accounts for DG impacts, near-end and far-end faults, and various relay characteristics per IEC standards. Tested on IEEE 3-bus and 8-bus systems, the approach is compared to NSGA-II. Results demonstrate reduced operating times and improved coordination, despite minor violations in larger systems. This enhances system reliability and mitigates DG-related protection issues."

    "abstract": "The existing control design for the tilt quadrotor often assumes that the derivative of the disturbance is zero and that the moment of inertia (MoI) is diagonal. However, in general the disturbance may be bounded but not constant. Also, due to the tilting of the rotors, the MoI may not be a diagonal matrix. To address this, we design a robust controller which handles the MoI matrix uncertainties and is capable of rejecting varying external disturbances. This proposed controller guarantees convergence to a desired bounded region in the existence of bounded external disturbances. In this work, we develop the first small-sized, over-actuated tilt quadrotor using 3D-printed parts. Using the proposed controller, experiments are performed on both conventional and tilt quadrotors. From these experiments, the tilt quadrotor demonstrates better response time, flight time, and lower energy consumption compared to the conventional quadrotor. Finally, the proposed controller’s robustness is validated for both position and attitude setpoints of the tilt quadrotor when subjected to wind.

To address these issues, we propose MCE-ERL, an ERL algorithm with multi-distribution critics. We uses a value group and multi-distribution sampling to better cover the sample space, leverages uncertainty for exploration, and applies importance sampling to filter low-quality samples. Experiments on continuous control tasks show that MCE-ERL achieves faster convergence and better performance than baselines, offering insights for reducing sample collection loss in real-world robotic applications."

    "abstract": "In multi-modal sea surface temperature (SST) prediction, a critical challenge lies in effectively modeling the temporal misalignments and complex dependencies across heterogeneous modalities. Traditional spatiotemporal models predominantly rely on point-wise self-attention or local convolutional operations, which are often insufficient to capture long-range, nonsynchronous interactions between modalities. To address this, we propose a frequency-aware fusion framework that transforms multi-modal spatiotemporal data into the frequency domain via discrete Fourier transform (DFT). This transformation enables the disentanglement of modality-specific periodic patterns, allowing for more structured and interpretable cross-modal fusion. We construct a hyper-variable graph where nodes represent spatial locations and temporal sequences, and we introduce a gated softmax mechanism based on spectral energy to adaptively weight each modality's contribution. Furthermore, a piecewise soft-thresholding operation is applied in the spectral domain to suppress low-energy noise while preserving informative signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior prediction accuracy, outperforming existing baselines on both MSE and MAE across multiple forecasting horizons."

Unlike existing methods that offer asymptotic or finite-time convergence without explicit control over convergence time, our framework guarantees that the UAV reaches a desired circular path around the target within a user-specified time bound. We design a Lyapunov-based guidance vector field in the target-relative frame to drive the radial tracking error to zero in predefined-time. To maintain a constant commanded airspeed while compensating for wind and target motion, we derive a scaling factor that adjusts the guidance vector field while preserving its Lyapunov-based convergence properties. A nonlinear program is solved at each timestep to ensure the UAV’s heading converges to the desired heading angle within the predefined-time while respecting actuator limits. Numerous simulation results depicting various cases are presented justifying the efficacy of the proposed methodology."

We first propose a square-root-Nyquist-filtered FMCW (SRN-FMCW) waveform to address limitations of conventional linear FMCW waveforms in ISAC systems. To better integrate with ODDM, we generate SRN-FMCW by embedding symbols in the DD domain, referred to as a DD-SRN-FMCW frame. A DD chirp compression receiver is designed to obtain the channel response efficiently. Next, we construct the proposed ODDM-FMCW waveform for ISAC by superimposing a DD-SRN-FMCW frame onto an ODDM data frame. A comprehensive performance analysis of the ODDM-FMCW waveform is presented, covering peak-to-average power ratio, spectrum, ambiguity function, and Cramér-Rao bound for delay and Doppler estimation. Numerical results show that the proposed ODDM-FMCW waveform delivers excellent ISAC performance in terms of root mean square error for sensing and bit error rate for communications."

The electromagnetic and thermal design methods of a partially high-temperature superconducting linear motor (HTSLM) are proposed to increase acceleration and reduce heat loss. The electromagnetic design is based on a two-dimensional (2D) analytical model and a three-dimensional (3D) finite element model (FEM), whereas the thermal design is performed using a thermal network model (TNM) and a 3D FEM, under steady-state conditions. In this paper, both the mover and the stator are placed in a cryostat to reduce the air gap and increase the acceleration up to 9 g. After the proposed HTSLM system reaches thermal equilibrium, the stator operates at 52 K. The electromagnetic thrust is analytically derived and decomposed into the fundamental and ripple components. The harmonic analysis indicates that the ripple originates from the coupling between the AC and the (6i<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\pm$</tex-math></inline-formula> 1)-order harmonics of the air-gap field. The TNM and the 3D FEM are used to analyze the heat flow paths and to calculate the heat losses. The parametric effects of the mover temperature and the heat loss are studied. The parameters of the TNM and the 3D FEM are then improved to optimize the thermal design and to guide the selection of a cryocooler. The 2D model proposed in this paper for electromagnetic design, as well as the TNM for thermal design, have certain generality and can be used in the design of planar and rotary motor systems."

These controllers are divided into two categories: FIR controllers and non-FIR ones. In this paper, it is proved that each plant, which is stabilizable by FIR controllers, can be also stabilized by non-FIR ones having integer characteristic polynomials. Furthermore, the validity of this statement is verified by numerical examples. The theoretical achievement of this paper reveals the existence of a degree of freedom to choose between FIR controllers and non-FIR ones, when the aim of the control system designer is to use a dynamic controller with integer characteristic polynomial in partially homomorphic encrypted environments for avoiding computational overflow."

To achieve $O(\\log n)$ query time (for computing the shortest path length), the previously best result uses $O\\left(n^{8+\\epsilon}\\right)$ preprcessing time and space [Aggarwal, Aronov, O’Rourke, and Schevon, SICOMP 1997], where $\\epsilon$ is an arbitrarily small positive constant.

In preliminary experiments, we evaluated the recognition accuracy of signs from drive recorder videos based on driving videos on motorways. As a result, it was determined that the recognition accuracy using the YOLOv8 model with 100 training cycles was the most suitable, and a comparison of the two methods was conducted using this weight file. The comparison results showed that both methods have the same recall (78%), but the precision is 41% for the conventional method and 19% for the proposed method, indicating that the use of a drive recorder often results in false positives."

This paper proposes an ROI-aware octree-based point cloud compression network tailored explicitly for object detection tasks. We introduce a ring-grid module to effectively eliminate redundant ground points, significantly reducing the data size and emphasising regions of interest (ROIs). Subsequently, we apply hierarchical octree encoding to the retained ROI points, utilising a contextual entropy model that integrates ancestor, neighbour, and sibling-child node information. This approach not only achieves a compact representation of the point cloud but also preserves essential semantic context for accurate object detection. Experimental evaluations on the KITTI dataset demonstrate that our method reduces bitrates by over 10% compared to state-of-the-art techniques while simultaneously enhancing object detection precision by approximately 1%, confirming its effectiveness in balancing efficient compression and high detection accuracy."

Since the majority of the PD-related mutations affected PINK1 activity, it was hypothesized that micro compounds that induce the activation of PINK1 would preserve mitochondrial quality control and provide beneficial neuroprotective effects. This paper uses a drug repurposing approach & utilizes the ZINC database to find novel PINK1 activators for possible PD treatment based on niclosamide, an FDA-approved anthelmintic drug which is a well-known PINK1 activator. To assess binding affinities and interactions, molecular docking was carried out against the structure of the PINK1 protein (8uyf). The physicochemical properties and drug-like characteristics of the top-scoring molecules were evaluated further. When compared to niclosamide, a number of potential candidates showed better predicted binding affinity and drug-like characteristics. We used the drug's ADME analysis to further confirm its pharmacokinetic characteristics."

We confirm this conjecture by showing that, for the hardcore model on random ∆-regular graphs, the Glauber dynamics mixes rapidly with high probability when $\\lambda = O\\left( {1/\\sqrt \\Delta } \\right)$, which is significantly beyond the uniqueness threshold λ<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">c</inf>(∆) ≈ e/∆. Our result establishes a sharp distinction between the hardcore model on worst-case and beyond-worst-case instances, showing that the worst-case and average-case complexities of sampling and counting are fundamentally different.This result of rapid mixing on random instances follows from a new criterion we establish for rapid mixing of Glauber dynamics for any distribution supported on a downward closed set family. Our criterion is simple, general, and easy to check. In addition to proving new mixing conditions for the hardcore model, we also establish improved mixing time bounds for sampling uniform matchings or b-matchings on graphs, the random cluster model on matroids with q ∈ [0,1), and the determinantal point process. Our proof of this new criterion for rapid mixing combines and generalizes several recent tools in a novel way, including a trickle-down theorem for field dynamics, spectral/entropic stability, and a new comparison result between field dynamics and Glauber dynamics."

    "abstract": "The widespread adoption of ad blockers has emerged as a disruptive force in the digital advertising ecosystem, fundamentally altering the dynamics between users, marketers, and publishers. Ad blockers empower users by enhancing their browsing experience—eliminating intrusive, irrelevant, and excessive advertisements—but simultaneously create significant challenges for advertisers and publishers. Marketers face reduced visibility for their campaigns, incomplete audience data, and higher costs to reach their target demographics. Publishers, on the other hand, grapple with declining ad revenue streams, threatening their ability to fund quality content and sustain operations. This paper delves into the complex relationship between ad blockers and digital advertising, highlighting the implications for the industry at large. It explores key drivers behind the rise of ad blockers, such as user dissatisfaction with invasive ads and privacy concerns, while analyzing their financial and operational impact on stakeholders. Furthermore, it investigates adaptive strategies that marketers and publishers can employ to counteract these challenges—ranging from ethical advertising practices that prioritize user experience to alternative monetization models such as subscription-based services or “ad-light” experiences. By striking a balance between respecting user preferences and innovating within advertising frameworks, this paper argues that marketers and publishers can not only mitigate the adverse effects of ad blockers, but also foster a more sustainable and mutually beneficial digital ecosystem. Ultimately, this study underscores the importance of rethinking traditional advertising approaches to align with evolving consumer expectations in an increasingly privacy-conscious era."

    "abstract": "We study error-detection and error-correction codes for computationally bounded adversarial channels. We consider seeded codes where the polynomial-time encoding and decoding procedures share a public random seed, but are otherwise deterministic. An adversarial channel gets this seed and can perform arbitrary polynomial-time computation to adaptively select both the message to be encoded and a bounded number of errors to be added to the resulting codeword. The goal is to detect or correct such errors with overwhelming probability, while achieving better trade-offs between rate and error tolerance than those possible for computationally unbounded channels. For large alphabets, prior work (ITCS ‘25) achieves essentially optimal parameters under minimal cryptographic assumptions. However, for the binary alphabet, prior works (TCC ‘20, EUROCRYPT ‘25) either only achieved a weaker notion of selective security under the learning with errors (LWE) assumption, or relied on non-standard cryptographic assumptions to get the full notion of adaptive security. In this work, we construct binary codes that achieve the full notion of adaptive security assuming trapdoor hashing, which can in turn be instantiated under a variety of standard cryptographic assumptions such as LWE, or Decisional DiffieHellman (DDH), or Quadratic Residuosity (QR), or Decisional Composite Residuosity (DCR). For error detection, our codes get essentially optimal rate $R \\approx 1$ and relative error tolerance $p \\approx \\frac{1}{2}$. For error correction, they can uniquely correct $p\\lt1 / 4$ fraction of errors with a rate R matching that of the best known list-decodable codes for this error tolerance. As a central technical tool of potentially independent interest, we construct multi-input correlation intractable hashing for “shifted output relations” under the standard cryptographic assumptions above."

The model trains four binary classifiers (associated with the MBTI dimensions: introversion/extraversion, sensing/intuition, thinking/feeling, and judging/perceiving) based on the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) models. In contrast to the earlier solutions resting on one data source or performing traditional machine learning tasks, this study combines and preprocesses two social media sources exhibiting different multifaceted nature PersonalityCafe and Reddit, emphasizing robustness and generalizable aspects. Class imbalance (like in lemmatization and context-aware data augmentation) can be used to obtain more semantic features. The results of the evaluation of the experiments show robust performance, especially in imbalanced datasets, computed using F1-score and AUC.

To address these challenges, we propose a hybrid convolutional framework that integrates ResNet50, MobileNetV2, and EfficientNetB0 features, fused through a dropout-regularized classification head. Un- like prior single-backbone detectors, our approach leverages complementary feature representations to improve robustness against compression and visual distortions. Experiments on the Celeb-DF v2 benchmark demonstrate that the fusion model achieves 97.03 % accuracy with strong generalization, while Xception serves as a competitive baseline for comparison.

    "abstract": "Kenya’s mobile-financial ecosystem, driven by M-Pesa and a mobile penetration rate above 133%, has advanced commerce and financial inclusion but also exposed users to SMS-based scams exploiting linguistic diversity, cultural trust, and psychological manipulation. Existing fraud-reporting mechanisms such as keyword filtering and manual reporting, remain reactive and inadequate against these evolving threats. To fill this gap, this study develops a culturally adapted, machine learning–driven approach to SMS scam detection tailored to Kenya’s multilingual environment. Using a crowdsourced dataset of 738 SMS messages (427 scams, 311 legitimate), XGBoost achieved 83.8% accuracy with strong precision and F1-scores, while Logistic Regression offered superior recall (91.8%) in detecting fraudulent content. SHAP analysis revealed urgency cues, code-switching features, and social proof language as the most influential predictors of scams. The proposed model, designed for integration via APIs into USSD platforms, enables real-time detection and fosters user confidence through explainable alerts. This study provides a scalable, context-aware framework for fraud prevention in mobile-first economies and actionable insights for telecom operators, fintech platforms, and policymakers seeking to strengthen digital trust."

However, traditional verification techniques face limitations in scalability and automation. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising opportunities for automating hardware security verification. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of emerging research that applies LLMs to secure hardware design analysis. Through objective evaluation, we find that current LLM-driven approaches are often developed under overly simplified scenarios and demonstrate unstable performance across diverse hardware designs. To address these issues, we outline three key directions for future research: developing standardized security-oriented benchmarks, advancing domain-specific semantic reasoning capabilities, and facilitating tighter integration with verification tools. This study provides essential insights for building scalable and fully automated LLM-driven hardware security verification."

Using technical manuals from a flour mill, textual data was extracted using MinerU. The data was processed using Natural Language Processing (NLP), embedded with \"Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B\" and entered into a PostgreSQL database using LangChain’s pgVector API. Our RAG pipeline integrated a tag extractor, three query expansion techniques (Multiquery, Decomposition, Step back) and one scoring algorithm (BM25), a PostgreSQL Database, a Reranker (mxbai-rerank-xsmall-v1), a Prompt template, and an LLM. We evaluated the BERTScore performance of five open-source LLMs (Gemma3:1B, Gemma3:4B, Llama3.1:8B, Llama3.2:1B, Llama3.2:3B) in this RAG pipeline. One key finding is that model performance is task-dependent: Llama3.1:8B excelled in precision, while Gemma3:4B excelled in recall. Smaller models can also outperform larger ones in specific cases—for example, Llama3.2:3B was more effective at identifying unanswerable questions, a crucial safety feature, and offered greater consistency, though with some trade-off in overall performance. This study provides a framework for selecting cost-effective, task-appropriate open-source LLMs in industrial applications and highlights the practical value of smaller parameter models, especially for compute-constrained businesses."

    "abstract": "This work studies information-computation gaps for statistical problems. A common approach for providing evidence of such gaps is to show sample complexity lower bounds (that are stronger than the information-theoretic optimum) against natural models of computation. A popular such model in the literature is the family of low-degree polynomial tests. While these tests are defined in such a way that make them easy to analyze, the class of algorithms that they rule out is somewhat restricted. An important goal in this context has been to obtain lower bounds against the stronger and more natural class of low-degree Polynomial Threshold Function (PTF) tests, i.e., any test that can be expressed as comparing some low-degree polynomial of the data to a threshold. Proving lower bounds against PTF tests has turned out to be challenging. Indeed, we are not aware of any non-trivial PTF testing lower bounds in the literature. In this paper, we establish the first non-trivial PTF testing lower bounds for a range of statistical tasks. Specifically, we prove a near-optimal PTF testing lower bound for Non-Gaussian Component Analysis (NGCA). Our NGCA lower bound implies similar lower bounds for a number of other statistical problems. Our proof leverages a connection to recent work on pseudorandom generators for PTFs and recent techniques developed in that context. At the technical level, we develop several tools of independent interest, including novel structural results for analyzing the behavior of low-degree polynomials restricted to random directions."

This paper delves into compiler architecture evolution under Industry 5.0 that addresses Qualcomm's approach to peak performance optimization between AI accelerators, DSPs, and multi-core processors. The case study discusses updates on machine learning aided optimization, adaptive compilation in real-time, and domain-specific languages, all fundamental for supporting interactive, contextually aware applications on the edge. The research also explores how Qualcomm uses these compiler breakthroughs to optimize the deployment of AI workloads in future IoT, automotive, and mobile platforms. Through this prism, we illustrate how Compiler Design 5.0 is not merely a technical imperative but a strategic catalyst in achieving the true promise of Industry 5.0.

Can the untrusted analyst prove that its assertion is correct to a verifier that does not have sufficient samples and computational resources to run the tester on its own? In this work, we are interested in proofs that can be generated very efficiently, with minimal overhead over running the distribution tester. In particular, since the distribution tester is sublinear (in the domain size), at the very least we also want the sample complexity for generating the proof to be sublinear. Do natural properties that have sublinear testers admit such proof systems?Our main result answers this question negatively for several natural properties. For these properties, if the verifier’s sample complexity is non-trivial (smaller than just running the tester on its own), then the (honest) prover must draw a linear number of samples. We show this result for the problem of testing whether the distribution is uniform over its support, for specifying the distribution’s k-collision probability (or its L<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">k</inf> norm), and for other natural properties.Our results shed light on a recent line of work showing that if we allow the prover to draw a quasi-linear number of samples, then many distribution properties have proof-systems with very efficient verification. Our negative results imply that the super-linear sample complexity of the prover in those proof-systems is inherent."

Prior hardware designs have addressed various aspects of MPKC signature generation. However, rejection sampling remains largely unexplored. This paper presents RejSCore, a lightweight hardware accelerator for rejection sampling in post-quantum cryptography. It targets the QRUOV scheme, which is a prominent candidate under the secondround of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) additional digital signature standardization process. The architecture includes an AES-CTR-128-based pseudorandom number generator. Moreover, a lightweight iterative method is employed in rejection sampling, offering reduced resource consumption and area overhead while slightly increasing latency. The performance of RejSCore is comprehensively evaluated on Artix-7 FPGAs and 65 nm CMOS technology using the Area-Delay Product (ADP) and Power-Delay Product (PDP). On Artix-7 and 65 nm CMOS, RejSCore achieves an area of 2042 slices and $464,866 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}^{2}$, with operating frequencies of 222 MHz and 565 MHz, respectively. Using the QR-UOV parameters for security level I ($q=127, v=156, m=54, l=3$), the core completes its operation in 8525 clock cycles. The ADP and PDP evaluations confirm RejSCore’s suitability for deployment in resource-constrained and security-critical environments."

Specifically, their hard function can be solved by a randomized protocol sending $O(1)$ bits, but requires $\\Omega\\left(\\log ^{1 / 3}(N)\\right)$ bits of communication with a deterministic (or non-deterministic) protocol. We show a stronger $\\Omega\\left(\\log ^{1 / 2}(N)\\right)$ lower bound for their construction. To achieve this, the key technical advancement is an improvement to the sifting argument for grid norms of (somewhat dense) bipartite graphs. In addition to quantitative improvement, we qualitatively improve over [14] by relaxing the hardness condition: while [14] proved their lower bound for any function f that satisfies a strong two-sided pseudorandom condition, we show that a weak one-sided condition suffices. This is achieved by a new structural result for cylinder intersections (or, in graph-theoretic language, the set of triangles induced from a tripartite graph), showing that any small cylinder intersection can be efficiently covered by a sum of simple “slice” functions."

We (re-)introduce two generalized families: quasi-regular distributions $\\mathbb{F}_{Q-r e g}$ and quasi-MHR distributions $\\mathbb{F}_{Q-M H R}$. Altogether, these four families form the following hierarchy: $\\mathbb{F}_{\\mathrm{MHR}} \\subsetneq\\left(\\mathbb{F}_{\\mathrm{reg}} \\cap \\mathbb{F}_{Q-\\mathrm{MHR}}\\right) \\subsetneq \\mathbb{F}_{\\mathrm{reg}}, \\mathbb{F}_{Q-\\mathrm{MHR}} \\subsetneq\\left(\\mathbb{F}_{\\mathrm{reg}} \\cup \\mathbb{F}_{Q-\\mathrm{MHR}}\\right) \\subsetneq \\mathbb{F}_{Q-\\mathrm{reg}}$ Likewise, the parameterized families of $\\lambda$-regular (a.k.a. $\\alpha$ strongly regular) distributions [CR14], [SS19], which smoothly interpolate $\\mathbb{F}_{\\text {reg }}$ and $\\mathbb{F}_{\\text {MHR }}$, generalize to $\\lambda$-quasi-regular distributions. The significance of our new families is manifold. Firstly, their defining conditions are immediate “economic” relaxations of the original defining conditions (e.g., regularity as monotonicity of the virtual value functions), capturing key economic intuitions. Secondly, they satisfy natural mathematical properties (about order statistics) failed for the original families, thus technically more tractable. Thirdly, numerous results (by [BK96], [HR09a], [CD15], [DRY15], [HR14], [AHN ${ }^{+}$19], [JLTX20], [JLQ ${ }^{+}$19b], [FLR19], [GHZ19b], [JLX23], [LM24] etc) known merely for the original families now can extend to our new families. Many of these extensions incur no quantitative loss, or even improve the state of the art for the original families. Finally, beyond the third point, our new families guide us to entirely new perspectives and thus entirely unknown results. For example, regarding revenue maximization for symmetric versus asymmetric regular buyers, we acquire $\\frac{1}{2}$ - versus 0.1908 -approximations for the (less-than-)one-sample prophet inequalities, respectively.

Earlier work therefore proposed a two-level stochastic model for the lateral movement of vehicles on highways, which was, however, limited to lane following maneuvers. Within this work, the model is extended towards a full lateral movement model for highway scenarios by extending it towards lane changes. The proposed complete model represents a consistent generalization of the previous lane following model, in sharing model components and parameters, and in maintaining a measurably high degree of realism and efficiency in simulation."

    "abstract": "Deformable linear objects (DLOs), such as cables and wires, often exhibit natural curvature that couples bending and twisting, making it difficult to assess whether the free end can achieve a feasible pitch angle under gravity before manipulation. This uncertainty directly hampers robotic planning for DLO insertion and routing tasks, where misjudging pitch reachability may cause the end to fail to align with the target axis. We propose an Equivalent Natural Bending Curvature (ENBC) within the discrete elastic rod (DER) framework, which transforms arbitrary bend–torsion curvature into a pitch-equivalent pure-bending surrogate by eliminating torsional ambiguity. This formulation enables consistent comparison of end-pitch feasibility across different DLOs without requiring material or length normalization. We formally define ENBC and validate it in simulation across multiple natural-curvature families (uniform, segmented, and smooth-gradient), evaluating both the preservation of feasible end-pitch intervals and the shape discrepancy relative to original rods. Results demonstrate that ENBC maintains pitch-equivalent behavior with only small deviations while producing visually consistent steady-state shapes. The method thus provides a lightweight tool for pre-manipulation feasibility analysis and for normalizing curvature effects in dataset generation for insertion-style tasks."

Accurate and timely production operation optimization is crucial for the production efficiency and product quality of hydrocracking. Heuristic evolutionary algorithms have been widely used due to their advantages of simple operation and high performance. However, traditional evolutionary algorithms carry too much mutation information due to individual mutation crossover operations and retain too little genetic information, which limits the algorithm's optimization ability and convergence speed. This article proposes a dual mutation improvement strategy for the traditional evolutionary algorithm family, which adjusts the dimensions beyond the range in the individual and introduces new mutation operations to enhance the inheritance ability of the population's genetic information. Finally, the proposed method was applied to the optimization of an actual hydrocracking production operation, and the results showed that the improved evolutionary algorithm family has better optimization ability and faster convergence speed."

    "abstract": "In medium-voltage distribution networks, harmonic currents generated by nonlinear loads tend to increase power equipment losses, shorten their service life, and even cause grid voltage distortion and reduced power supply reliability. To address the core contradiction of traditional active power filter (APF) where compensation accuracy and economic efficiency are difficult to balance. This paper proposes a medium-voltage grid-connected active power filter composed of the series connection of silicon carbide (SiC) power modules and silicon-based (Si-based) power modules. Whereas the Si-based power modules operate as voltage-bearing devices in a low-frequency modulation mode, they mainly generate a grid-similar voltage to provide synchronization support, thereby reducing the application quantity of high-cost SiC power modules. The SiC power modules act as harmonic compensation devices working in a high-frequency modulation mode, which mainly adopt current closed-loop regulation to compensate for harmonic currents in the medium-voltage distribution network. Meanwhile, they suppress voltage disturbances caused by the low-frequency modulation of Si-based power modules and provide damping. Through hybrid switching frequency modulation, the proposed device achieves reduced switching losses while maintaining fast dynamic response capability, offering a practical and feasible solution for power quality control in medium-voltage distribution networks."

However, it faces challenges including inaccurate receiver clock error modeling and increased susceptibility to observation faults. This paper proposes a novel solution using Between-Satellite Single Difference (BSSD) methodology combined with a Fault Detection and Exclusion (FDE) strategy. The established BSSD-based tightly coupled model accounts for GPS-BDS Inter-System Bias (ISB), effectively eliminating errors from receiver clock inaccuracies and enabling shared reference satellites across both systems. A specialized two-step FDE scheme was developed: the first step identifies and removes multiple faulty observations, including the reference satellite, while the second step implements comprehensive refinement. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed BSSD-based integration significantly enhances positioning accuracy, achieving up to 74.6% improvement over conventional tightly coupled approaches. Furthermore, the two-step FDE algorithm proved effective across various simulated fault scenarios, ensuring both precision and reliability for the integrated navigation system. The method effectively addresses key limitations in current multi-GNSS/INS integration while maintaining robust performance under challenging conditions."

In this paper, we propose a self-learning Random Forest framework designed to optimize headlamp power consumption under low-light driving conditions. We developed a balanced synthetic dataset composed of predefined, labeled use cases simulating diverse nighttime scenarios. To effectively increase our training data without additional manual annotation, we adopted a semi-supervised self-training approach, iteratively adding the model’s high-confidence predictions on unlabeled samples back into the training set. Additionally, specialized submodels were trained to resolve confusion between certain pairs of labels representing closely related nighttime driving scenarios (e.g., distinguishing between moderate dimming with and without beam narrowing), achieving an average accuracy improvement of approximately 2.7 % over the base model alone. Experimental results on synthetic datasets and real-world nighttime camera feeds demonstrate that this ensemble approach consistently outperforms the base model, particularly in differentiating similar lighting scenarios. Furthermore, our framework acts as a semi-automated annotator by flagging uncertain label transitions, significantly speeding up the annotation of real-world datasets, thus enabling faster availability of labeled nighttime driving data for various automotive applications. The proposed methodology therefore provides an effective and efficient approach to achieving energy-saving objectives without compromising driver safety or comfort."

Integrating an arbitrary style transfer method into the game pipeline is challenging due to the memory and speed requirements of games. We present <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">PQDAST</i>, the first solution to address this. We use a perceptual quality-guided knowledge distillation framework and train a compressed model using the FLIP evaluator, which substantially reduces both memory usage and processing time with limited impact on stylisation quality. For better preservation of depth and fine details, we utilise a synthetic dataset with depth and temporal considerations during training. The developed model is injected into the rendering pipeline to further enforce temporal stability and avoid diminishing post-process effects. Quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance in temporal consistency, with comparable style transfer quality, to state-of-the-art image, video and in-game methods."

    "abstract": "Sixth-generation (6G) networks are projected to include massive machine-type communication (mMTC), ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC), and enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) to offer immersive, diverse, and latency-critical services. These heterogeneous service requirements demand intelligent and autonomous slicing mechanisms that remain reliable under dynamic traffic, multimodal context variations, and cross-layer uncertainties. Existing machine learning (ML) approaches achieve strong predictive performance but lack built-in Service-Level Agreement (SLA) validation, while rule-based strategies ensure constraint adherence yet struggle with rapidly varying 6G conditions. To address these limitations, this article proposes an Agentic Intelligence–assisted ML Fusion Framework that combines ensemble prediction with autonomous agentic reasoning.For example, an agentic controller can independently override the choice and reallocate resources to avoid service failure if an ML model predicts a slice appropriate for URLLC traffic but the expected latency exceeds the SLA level. A stacked ensemble of Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM), Random Forest (RF), and Logistic Regression (LR) captures nonlinear and multimodal dependencies in 6G beamforming data, whereas an agentic overlay enforces throughput, latency, and energy constraints in real time. Evaluation on a public 6G IoT beamforming dataset demonstrates near-perfect accuracy (99.9%) with consistent SLA compliance, improved interpretability, and enhanced stability under fluctuating service demands. The hybrid design provides a scalable foundation for multimodal, semantic-aware, and multi-agent orchestration in next-generation 6G slicing ecosystems."

Electromagnetic calculation is the key link of connecting theoretical design, engineering realization and application, and its accuracy and efficiency directly affect the stealth performance evaluation and research and development cycle of aircraft. In order to solve the problem of high calculation cost of high precision radar cross section (RCS) in aircraft stealth design, a new multi-fidelity modeling method is proposed in this paper. The multi-fidelity non-linear mapping relationship is established by DNN, and the loss weight of trough region is given in the loss function, so that the model can strengthen the learning of radar stealth sensitive features. Ridge regression model is used to correct the system deviation of depth learning model, so as to achieve the prediction accuracy of radar stealth performance evaluation. The multi-fidelity modeling method is applied to the stealth characteristics of typical flying-wing layout. We introduce Gaussian process data enhancement strategy to break through the bottleneck of sparse and high-precision data of complex targets and realize the efficient fusion of low-precision big data and high-precision small samples. The results show that the omni-directional RCS prediction results meet the high-precision stealth characteristics of the aircraft, with higher prediction accuracy compared to the traditional Co-Kriging method and faster prediction efficiency compared to high- precision simulation method, which verifies its engineering applicability in complex electromagnetic environment and provides an efficient and reliable research method for aircraft stealth design."

    "abstract": "Partial discharge (PD) has been analyzed for many years; however, it is still difficult to understand clearly because it strongly depends on experimental conditions. To understand PD characteristics better, we directly measure fast-PD current waveforms on the order of nanoseconds instead of PD charge amounts. These fast-PD current peak measurements may provide us the deep understanding of the PD mechanism under different electric field strengths with different tip-radiuses and discharge gaps. Recent advances in high-speed oscilloscopes now enable nanosecond-scale pulse measurements under appropriate conditions. In this study, the PD measurement circuit is minimized to ensure accurate peak acquisition, reducing the total length of the circuit-flow path to less than 150 mm. A simple needle-plane electrode is used with discharge gaps ranging from 0 to 150 μm. The needle electrode has a diameter of 1 mm with several tip radii of 30, 100, 300 and 500 μm. An AC voltage with peak amplitudes of 2 kV at 50–1000 Hz is applied, and a 100-μm-thick polyimide film is employed as the insulating specimen. The measured new PD characteristics are the peak time that is the time interval between pulse detection to pulse peak and the half-maximum pulse widths of the fast PD current pulse. The peak time shows relatively small variation, between 4 ns and 6 ns across all electrode conditions. In contrast, pulse widths are approximately 5-15 ns, depending on conditions such as dischargegap length and needle tip radius. Moreover, the dependence of these times on AC voltage frequency is consistently small, suggesting that accelerated testing using higher AC frequencies up to 1000 Hz may be effective for estimating insulation lifetime under PD stress for this electrode configuration."

First, we introduce a self-supervised text–audio contrastive alignment (STA-CA) stage, which leverages large-scale unlabeled audio–text data to map heterogeneous modalities into a shared semantic space prior to fusion. Second, we design an audio-guided visual gating (AG-VR) mechanism, where emotionally salient acoustic cues dynamically modulate visual representations, suppressing redundant information while enhancing emotion-relevant patterns. Extensive experiments on the CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI benchmarks demonstrate that SADGR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across both regression and classification tasks, achieving superior performance in ACC-7, ACC-2, and F1-score while maintaining competitive correlation results. These results indicate that explicit self-supervised alignment combined with dynamic cross-modal gating provides an effective and practical solution for robust multimodal emotion recognition."

This work proposes an automated two-stage IGAPSO (improved genetic particle swarm optimization)-based framework that integrates neural-network-assisted offline optimization with rapid online fine-tuning on physical actuators, minimizing manual calibration while ensuring robust performance. Experiments demonstrate rapid and precise tuning of TCP control parameters: in step force control, convergence occurs within eight iterations with a 0.14 s settling time and 0.02% steady-state error; in step displacement control, tuning completes in three iterations with a 0.55 s settling time and 0.14% error. Zero-overshoot responses are realized by adjusting the optimization objective. The method further achieves robust waveform tracking (mean RMSEs of 1.90 mN force and 0.47 mm displacement), enables secondary retuning after long-term placement within seven iterations, and transfers effectively to TCPs with different spring indices. This work provides an efficient and generalizable strategy for accurate, robust, and adaptive TCP control, paving the way for broader integration in robotic systems."

Secondly, the relationship between available resources and stealthiness of cyber attack are revealed, where both dRAs and dPDAs can be with 0-stealthiness under different available resources. Thirdly, the relationship between available resources and destructiveness of cyber attack are revealed, where dRAs is not with ck-s-destructiveness (i.e., cyber attacks can achieve state trajectory destructiveness without disrupting consensus), because the state trajectory can only be driven to the historical one due to requiring historical measurements. Oppositely, dPDAs can be with ck-s-destructiveness, where the state consistency trajectory can be driven to any one designed by the attacker due to requiring agent parameter. Finally, numerical examples are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed attacks."

    "abstract": "Infrared (IR) small target detection faces two major challenges: single-frame-based methods are highly sensitive to random noise, while multi-frame-based approaches often neglect the dynamic nature of background scenes, resulting in high false alarm rates. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel ring local contrast measure weighted by spatial–temporal prior (WSTRLCM). WSTRLCM comprises two key modules: a spatial-temporally enhanced ring local contrast and a spatial-temporal weighting factor. Specifically, a spatial–temporal enhancement scheme is first applied to the original image sequence to boost target saliency, and the ring contrast computation is optimized for improved efficiency. For the weighting factor, a small target enhancement strategy based on image block gradients is introduced. By incorporating structure tensor analysis, effective back-ground suppression is achieved, resulting in a refined spatial-temporal enhancement sequence. Furthermore, a tailored multi-frame difference approach, designed according to target motion characteristics, is employed to generate the final weighting factor. The Hadamard product of the local contrast and the weighting factor is then computed, and adaptive thresholding is applied to obtain the final detection map. Experimental results on public datasets demonstrate that WSTRLCM achieves superior performance compared to several state-of-the-art methods, exhibiting enhanced target detection capability, strong background suppression.

In practical deployments, the control of RIS phase states is typically managed using finite codebooks, with configuration indices transmitted over low-latency, yet imperfect, wireless feedback channels. Even rare feedback bit errors can lead to significant mismatches between intended and applied RIS states, degrading system performance. This paper addresses the challenge of robust RIS codebook index assignment by formulating it as a combinatorial optimization problem, equivalent to the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), where codewords are “cities” and edge weights reflect SNR degradation under codeword confusion. A novel three-phase heuristic algorithm is proposed to solve this, consisting of a provision phase, a shotgun phase, and a fuzzy concatenation phase. Simulation results show that the method outperforms conventional indexing strategies and achieves near-optimal robustness to index errors, while also being scalable and hardware-agnostic for real-time deployment."

    "abstract": "Data augmentation is an effective technique for tackling data sparsity in sequential recommendation (SR). Existing methods generate new data during the model training to improve the performance. However, deploying them on a backbone model requires retraining, architecture modification, or introducing additional modules and learnable parameters. These processes are time-consuming and costly for well-trained models, especially when the model and data scales become large. In this work, we explore the test-time augmentation (TTA) for SR, which augments the input sequences during the inference phase and then fuses the model's predictions to improve final accuracy. It avoids the significant overhead associated with training-time augmentation. We first experimentally examine the potential of existing augmentation operators for TTA and find that the Substitute and Mask consistently achieve better performance. Further analysis reveals that these two operators retain the original sequential pattern while adding appropriate perturbations. Moreover, the random selection of augmentation positions creates suitable augmented samples from both semantic and temporal perspectives. Meanwhile, we find that the fixed operation ratio limits the diversity of augmented data, and the TTA may impair the model's performance on long sequences. In addition, the two operators still face time-consuming similarity-based item selection or interference from mask tokens. Based on the analysis and limitations, we present TNoise and TMask. The former injects uniform noise into the representation, avoiding the computational overhead of item selection. The latter blocks mask tokens from participating in model calculations (TMask-B) or directly removes interactions that should have been replaced with mask tokens (TMask-R). Further, we sample the augmentation ratio from a uniform distribution to improve the data diversity. For short sequences, we introduce a sequence smoothing and lengthening method based on inter-item interpolation. For long sequences, we set a threshold to avoid the negative effects of TTA. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency, and generalizability of our method."

    "abstract": "The growing importance of smart manufacturing requires advanced methods for instantly detecting and classifying defects, which steel production relies on heavily for quality purposes. In modern industrial environments, the accuracy, speed, and scalability needed are often more than traditional inspection methods, many that are manual or semi-automated, can handle. Our research puts forth a hybrid CNN-LSTM model that effectively integrates the spatial feature extraction power of CNNs with the strong temporal processing ability of LSTM networks. The innovation of this work consists of the fact that, in one deep learning framework, the model combines spatial and temporal learning: the CNN learns fine-grained defect features in terms of textures and edges, whereas the LSTM learns the dynamics of temporal dependencies in the sequences of production processes. The proposed hybrid CNN-LSTM model can process both the static spatial evidence and single-step temporal evidence to obtain real-time, multi-class steels defect classification with the accuracy of 98 percent in contrast to the previous comparable defect detection systems which only rely on the spatial structure or single temporal information. The challenge of achieving high precision and high inference speed in dynamic manufacturing is inherently hard to accomplish in a dynamic manufacturing environment and this integration achieves this in a remarkably efficient manner translating to a breakthrough to the Industry 4.0 quality control. As a result, the hybrid model is well-suited for real-time manufacturing because it can balance high accuracy with fast inference time. The core problem this work aims to solve is that conventional defect detection algorithms cannot handle both spatial and temporal information at the same time while keeping up with real-time demands on the factory floor."

    "abstract": "A wireless power high-speed data transmission system based on double tuned filters is proposed. By using double tuned filters to form data receivers at both ends, interference from the same data source can be greatly reduced. Considering the influence of the power channel on the data channel, a notch network is added to the power channel. By analyzing the transfer function of each part of the data transmission channel, the expression of the voltage gain is derived. In addition, the interference gain between power and data transmission channel is analyzed. On this basis, a design method of improving data transmission channel parameters is proposed to improve the signal-to-noise ratio and suppress crosstalk. In the case of well-designed parameters, the power is 5 kw, the forward Data transfer rate is 266.7 kbps, and the reverse Data transfer rate is 200 kbps. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by simulation."

A multi-system event-sequence analysis is used to connect ecosystem roles, platform governance, and standardization dynamics with firm-level technology related decisions. The review and expert synthesis reveal a fragmented landscape across sensing, controls, safety, and user experience. We identify four cross-cutting priorities for near-term progress: health- and state-informed assistance that leverages existing machine signals; digital-twin-in-the-loop validation to gate field trials; explainable shared control and clear authority handovers; and operator-centric metrics (workload, trust, safety-envelope adherence) as first-class requirements alongside productivity and energy. The study consolidates a taxonomy of human-machine interface and haptics for mobile machinery, maps ecosystem roles, and sets out a research agenda to bridge the lab-to-field gap and accelerate safe, human-centric deployment consistent with Operator 5.0."

    "abstract": "With the increasing number of electric vehicles (EVs), electrical loads have risen significantly across most regions. To alleviate the pressure on the power grid caused by EV charging demand, load forecasting and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) scheduling have become active areas of research. However, uncertain conditions make it difficult to obtain accurate forecasted loads through day-ahead forecasting. Therefore, this paper proposes a rolling forecast-scheduling framework that integrates rolling load forecasting and updated EV charging information, aiming to provide up-to-date data for real-time V2G scheduling. First, a rolling forecast-update mechanism is proposed to utilize the most recent actual load values as input for forecasting the remaining loads of the current day. EV charging information is submitted only when EVs connect to the grid and is continuously updated throughout the scheduling process. Then, a rolling forecast-scheduling framework is proposed to ensure that each V2G decision executed at each time period is optimal. Finally, comparative experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework enhances the performance of real-time V2G scheduling by leveraging real-time updated load values and EV charging information."

    "abstract": "In the field of wireless charging technology for electric vehicles, wireless charging methods have improved the convenience and safety of charging. However, in the initial dynamic stage of wireless charging, the system is prone to zero voltage switching (ZVS). Non ZVS startup can lead to increased switching losses and noise in the system, thereby reducing charging efficiency. This article deeply analyzes the topology characteristics of active rectification in the LCC-LCC electric vehicle wireless power transfer (EV-WPT) receiving end rectification system, which is difficult to achieve soft switching conduction during the initial dynamic stage. On this basis, an active rectification control method based on hardware frequency conversion is proposed. This method dynamically adjusts the operating cycle of the switching devices and the operating frequency of the rectifier bridge by detecting the input current at the front end of the rectifier bridge in real time and comparing it with a set threshold. The simulation results show that this method achieves full condition ZVS conduction during the charging process at the receiving end, constructs a frequency conversion closed-loop regulation mechanism, and significantly reduces the switching losses at the receiving end."

To address the inherent challenge posed by the coupling of linear trends with nonlinear fluctuations in carbon emission sequences, this paper proposes a combined prediction architecture integrating deep learning models with linear models under physical information constraints. First, a convolutional neural network-Bidirectional LSTM-Wasserstein self-attention (CNN-BiLSTM-WSA) and seasonal autoRegressive integrated moving average with exogenous regressors (SARIMAX) combined prediction model is constructed. This model not only captures linear trends and seasonal patterns but also extracts nonlinear features and temporal dependencies. Second, by introducing the Wasserstein self-attention mechanism, the similarity of data distributions across multiple time segments is measured, reducing the interference from volatility in individual sequence data. Finally, physical equations reflecting IES operational mechanisms are embedded as constraint terms within the loss function to correct model outputs, ensuring predictions adhere to physical properties. Case studies using real-world data demonstrate that this approach achieves a prediction accuracy of 98.96% and reduces mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) to 1.0092%, representing a 63.76% improvement over the optimal baseline model. This validates the method’s high precision and superiority."

    "abstract": "With the high penetration of distributed energy and flexible loads, distribution network data has become multi-source and heterogeneous, making traditional data processing and regulation methods insufficient for precise operation. To tackle issues like data heterogeneity, uncertainty and regulatory complexity under high-proportion distributed energy integration, this paper integrates multi-source measurement fusion, distributed robust control and two-layer scheduling theory to propose a complete technical framework. Firstly, through linear transformation and hierarchical fusion of measurement data, it achieves temporal-spatial alignment and noise suppression of PMU, SCADA and AMI data, building a high-precision state estimation model. Secondly, it realizes global optimization via dADMM and compensates data uncertainty with robust team decision theory, forming an \"optimization-correction\" two-stage control mechanism. Finally, a two-layer distributed scheduling architecture coordinates global and local control centers to realize collaborative regulation of energy storage, shiftable/curtailable loads and other multi-resources. Verification on IEEE node systems shows that the framework reduces voltage estimation error to 0.04% and controls frequency deviation within ±0.02Hz, significantly improving the reliability and economy of distribution network operation."

The experiment results show that the vision-based DDPG algorithm has a 70% success rate, confirming it can learn control policies directly from visual observations. In addition, the ABB robot exhibits more stable learning behaviour than the Panda robot. These findings support the use of vision-driven reinforcement learning for precise and dynamic robotic control."

    "abstract": "Chemical production environments are characterized by complex equipment, hazardous reactions, and tightly coupled processes, which significantly heightens the risk of catastrophic safety incidents. Human error is the main cause of accidents. Front-line operators often lack access to real-time process data, leading to low Situational Awareness (SA). Meanwhile, stepwise operations and complex safety protocols impose high cognitive demands, risking cognitive overload. To address these issues, this study proposes an intelligent assistance system grounded in Cognitive Load Theory (CLT) and SA principles. The system aims to reduce extraneous cognitive load and enhance perception, comprehension, and projection in field operations. It integrates three core modules: an equipment information module offering QR-based access to real-time visualized data, a task prompt module delivering stepwise, context-sensitive guidance, and an inspection assistance module with image/audio data collection and anomaly alerts. A digital coal-to-methanol factory was developed to safely validate system feasibility. Two scenario-based tests demonstrated the system's responsiveness, stability, and support for operator cognition in simulated environments. By addressing both situational awareness and cognitive load in an integrated manner, this work moves beyond fragmented tool-based solutions and offers a holistic, cognition-centered design approach for enhancing field safety in chemical operations."

    "abstract": "Social media plays a crucial role in shaping students’ academic productivity, both as an effective learning tool and as a source of confusion. However, most studies are limited to basic statistical analysis or a single machine learning model, which often lacks structured evaluation and interpretability. Such methods typically perform poorly on heterogeneous datasets and fail to provide sufficient insights for practical applications. To overcome these limitations, this study proposes a soft voting ensemble called Hybrid Productivity Prediction (HPrEd), which combines multiple machine learning (ML) models. Model-agnostic explainable AI (XAI) techniques LIME and SHAP are used to analyze the relationship between social media engagement and academic productivity. SMOTE is applied to reduce class asymmetry and RFE is used to select the best features. To select the appropriate model for HPrEd, a systematic comparison was made between three ML model families: tree-based, distance-based, and neural network-based, where Extra Trees, k-NN, and MLP were combined based on their complementary strengths. The robustness of the model was verified through 5-fold cross-validation. HPrEd achieved the highest recall of 98.25% and only 0.53% false alarm probability (PF). SHAP analysis showed that delay in starting studies, decreased attention to academic work, increased coursework distraction, and perceived productivity in the absence of social media were the most influential factors, with normalized SHAP values ranging from −1.2×10<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">−16</sup> to +1.6×10<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">−16</sup>. Additionally, the LIME-based local interpretation found that moderate levels of multitasking during study (0.62), significant feelings of time loss (1.59), high self-reported academic impact (1.67), and low ability to limit social media use (45) had the greatest impact on individual predictors, with class probability exceeding 99%. Overall, the results suggest that excessive social media use is associated with decreased academic productivity, but moderate levels of use may be helpful in increasing attention in some cases. These insights provide guidance for educators and policymakers and support future longitudinal research."

    "abstract": "Frequency diversity array multi-input multi-output (FDA-MIMO) radar has emerged as an effective solution for combating mainlobe jamming, which conventional suppression methods fail to address. However, in distributed target application scenarios for synthetic aperture radar (SAR), the accumulation of the cross-correlation energy from non-ideal orthogonal waveforms leads to a degradation in both image quality and performance of jamming suppression. Short-term shift-orthogonal (STSO)-waveform digital beamforming (DBF) is an effective method of achieving robust echo separation in the MIMO SAR system. Nevertheless, the performance of echo separation and jamming suppression utilizing STSO-waveform DBF in an FDA-MIMO radar system has not been sufficiently studied. Therefore, we establish the precise signal model of echoes obtained by transmitting STSO waveforms. By analyzing the signal model, we demonstrate the effect of carrier frequency increment on the time shift of different waveforms in an FDA-MIMO radar. Based on the analysis, we reformulate the traditional weight vector calculation to ensure accurate alignment of the beampattern nulls with the unwanted signal components, thereby modifying the traditional STSO-waveform DBF. The modified beamforming method achieves superior separation performance compared with both orthogonal waveforms and traditional DBF, providing signals with a lower level of unwanted components for the subsequent filtering process. Building upon the modified DBF method, the spatial filtering is performed in the range-Doppler domain without requiring any prior knowledge of the jammers. Simulation results demonstrate that the jamming suppression ratio (JSR) of the proposed method is significantly higher than that achieved utilizing traditional methods."

While early-phase alignment tools exist, few methods support shared sensemaking at the project’s midpoint— when shifting goals and emerging insights demand renewed alignment. This paper presents and evaluates an Experiential Analogy to Mid-Project Visioning, tested within a European rail innovation project. A Cooking-based Workshop was designed to help diverse consortium members reflect on project dynamics through a familiar, hands-on experience. The approach integrated Analogical Reasoning, Design Thinking tools, and Experiential Learning to spark creative insight, foster alignment, and enhance collaboration. The intervention produced three main outcomes: (i) a visual representation of the Shared project Vision; (ii) Strategic Insights that reinterpreted key project components; and (iii) Design Knowledge to inform subsequent development. The results underscore the potential of analogy-based experiences to support mid-course alignment, particularly in RDI settings. Future research should examine the applicability of alternative analogies to validate whether metaphors beyond cooking can yield similar benefits. It should also explore the benefits of integrating creative, experiential and empathic methods—such as those rooted in Design Thinking—into Project Management (PM) practices. This study contributes to PM literature by offering a novel, Human-Centered approach to fostering mid- project visioning in inter-organizational innovation settings."

Due to nonlinear radiometric differences and geometric distortions between SAR and optical images, existing methods struggle to extract homologous feature points, resulting in suboptimal registration accuracy. To address the mismatch issues in SAR-optical cross-modal image matching, a feature-based matching method named HFTM is proposed in this letter. Firstly, a hierarchical feature extraction network is applied on multimodal image pairs to extract global and local context information to obtain robust feature points. Consistent feature matching is then achieved in the local region through a Transformer-based attention mechanism and NeighConsensus (TNC) Matching network. The results of local matching are fed into the proposed global Position-encoded Probabilistic (P2) Matching network, which employs a detailed matching layer to generate an enhanced feature map, and predicts robust matching point pairs by a spatial expectation operator. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our method, achieving a single responsiveness estimation accuracy of 89.43% on QXS-SAROPT and 86.21% on SEN12MS at a 5-pixel threshold."

Due to its dynamic and heterogeneous nature, accurate QoS prediction is essential but remains difficult under data silos, privacy constraints, and limited trust among industrial entities. To overcome these limitations, this article proposes a robust and secure multiparty collaborative (RSMC) QoS prediction scheme for IIoT service recommendation. RSMC leverages a federated learning architecture with a secure aggregation strategy, facilitating joint model training across factories without exposing raw data. Specifically, a hybrid local time-aware prediction model integrating a temporal convolutional network with a bidirectional simple recurrent unit is employed to capture long-term dependencies and nonlinear dynamics in QoS time series. To ensure the security of collaborative training, a robust functional encryption mechanism is introduced to achieve secure parameter aggregation and effectively resist inference and collusion attacks. Experiments on real QoS datasets show that the proposed scheme achieves superior prediction accuracy compared with mainstream approaches, while preserving privacy and enabling large-scale collaboration."

The approach is appealing because training data collected while the system is in operation can be used to fine-tune the neural network, and MPC prevents unsafe behavior during those learning transients. This manuscript explains implementation challenges of Deep MPC, algorithmic way to distribute control authority and argues that a poor choice in distributing control authority may lead to poor performance.

    "abstract": "Nowadays, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are extensively applied in diverse fields, including surveillance, delivery, agriculture, mapping, and aerial photography. This study focuses on employing a data-driven control strategy for trajectory tracking in a quadrotor-type UAV, encompassing various trajectories such as circular and Lissajous types. The mathematical model of a quadrotor with an X-configuration is established using the Newton-Euler method. Simulations are conducted in MATLAB/Simulink to elucidate the quadrotor dynamics with data-driven control. The simulation results (obtained through analytical modelling) were refined through data-driven modelling, treating the quadcopter system as a black-box model to enhance trajectory-tracking accuracy. The application of data-driven modelling enhances trajectory tracking accuracy, showcasing the effectiveness of this technique."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel methodology to reduce computational burden of convex control techniques in single-input single-output systems, which rapidly grows as the number of nonlinearities increase. The proposal is based on partial feedback linearization to transform the nonlinear system into another one via a properly chosen local diffeomorphism. The transformed system has fewer nonlinearities than the original and a stabilizing control law can be then calculated as a feed-forward term cancelling some nonlinearities plus a feedback nonlinear one mimicking parallel distributed compensation. Simulation examples put our proposal at test and provide comparisons on numerical complexity which help the reader to assess the contribution."

    "abstract": "Seaweeds have emerged as valuable resources in biotechnological applications, driven by their rich diversity of bioactive compounds. While their consumption dates back to ancient civilizations, recent advances in research have shed light on the mechanisms and vast potential of these compounds, facilitating their incorporation into food, cosmetic, pharmaceutical, and nutraceutical industries. Notably, macroalgae-derived polysaccharides, such as alginates and carrageenans, offer remarkable health benefits and are instrumental in developing biopolymeric films and biodegradable packaging materials. This innovation is particularly significant in addressing the growing environmental crisis caused by the widespread dispersion of plastics and microplastics in marine ecosystems, which adversely affect aquatic life and biodiversity. Seaweed-derived biopolymers represent a sustainable alternative to conventional plastics, enabling the replacement of harmful plasticizers with eco-friendly, biodegradable materials. Such advancements contribute to environmental preservation and support the global transition toward sustainable practices. This review explores the potential of seaweeds in bioplastic production, particularly for food and pharmaceutical packaging, and underscores their role in mitigating plastic pollution. By integrating seaweed biopolymers into various industries, we can achieve a balance between technological progress and environmental stewardship, paving the way for a cleaner and more sustainable future."

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a simultaneous wireless power and data transfer system based on multi-level coupled filtering network. Using a multi-level coupled filtering network to form the receiving end for data on both sides can greatly reduce interference between the same side data source and the power transmission channel. Considering the impact of the power channel on the data channel, the first stage coupling filtering network at the data receiving end has a notch effect on the carrier frequency of the power channel, effectively ensuring the transmission of data. The second level coupled filtering network has a notch effect on the carrier frequency of the same side data source, reducing interference from the same side data source. By analyzing the transfer function of the data transmission channel, the expressions for SNR and gain are derived. Based on this, a method for designing a coupled filtering network is proposed. In addition, the interference between power and data transmission channels was analyzed, and methods for suppressing crosstalk were provided. The design of a full duplex system with a power of 57W, forward data transmission rate of 200kbps, and backward data transmission rate of 170kbps has been implemented, and the effectiveness of the proposed method has been verified through simulation."

    "abstract": "Short text topic recognition, as an important research field in natural language processing, has problems such as insufficient semantic expression of texts and ambiguity in the topic clusters that edge texts belong to. Based on this, this paper proposes a short text topic recognition model (CCLTE) based on contrastive learning and LLMs. Firstly, the semantic vectors of the original text and the keywords extracted by LLMs are concatenated; then, the edge texts with rich semantic value are screened out from the MLP clustering results, and positive and negative sample pairs are generated by combining LLMs, and unsupervised contrastive learning is introduced to optimize the sentence pre-training model; finally, LLMs are used to discriminate anomalies of edge samples, and TF-IDF is used to extract cluster topic features. In experiments on 4 text datasets, the model's average performance in terms of topic coherence (TC) and topic diversity (TD) is 9.62 % and 4.59 % higher than that of the suboptimal model, respectively. This indicates that CCLTE significantly improves the accuracy and robustness of short text topic recognition through the mechanism of multi-stage assistance from LLMs and contrastive learning."

First, we give a strict definition of hidden Markov tree models, and study their key properties and equivalent characterizations. In fact, hidden Markov tree models are closely related to the tree-indexed Markov chains, therefore, we also introduce the definition of tree-indexed Markov chains and their equivalent properties. We also establish a strong law of large numbers for hidden Markov tree models indexed by a Cayley tree. As corollaries, we obtain some strong laws of large numbers for the parameters and the AEP for these models."

    "abstract": "The rise of smart home systems has underscored the need for intelligent safety and resource monitoring solutions. This work focuses on real-time LPG cylinder management through an IoT-enabled embedded system. Traditional LPG monitoring relies on manual checks, often resulting in unexpected depletion and unsafe conditions during leaks. These shortcomings highlight the need for automation in both tracking and safety response. Conventional systems either lack automation or do not integrate both weight monitoring and gas leak detection. They often depend on user intervention or fail to take immediate safety actions. To address these limitations, a PIC16F877A-based system is proposed, combining a load cell and MQ6 gas sensor with a GSM module. The system automates refill alerts, leak detection, and initiates safety actions such as shut-off and ventilation. Simulation and hardware testing validated real-time leak detection within 2 seconds and refill alerts when gas dropped below 30 %. Realtime LCD display output such as “G: 28.45” and “L: -2” confirmed accurate monitoring. The system was implemented using Proteus for simulation and assembled on a PCB for realtime hardware evaluation. The GSM module and solenoid valve were tested under live conditions. Experimental results show that refill alerts were sent within 2.5 seconds and leak alerts within 3.1 seconds. The power supply delivered stable voltages: <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{5. 0 2 V}$</tex> (microcontroller) and 12.10 V (GSM module). In conclusion, the proposed system improves safety, eliminates manual tracking, and enables timely refill scheduling. It is highly suitable for domestic use and scalable for commercial LPG management."

With the integration of artificial intelligence techniques, multiple Quantum Neural Network (QNN) models have been proposed, including quantum convolutional neural networks, quantum long short-term memory networks, and quantum generative adversarial networks. Furthermore, optimization methods such as constrained optimization by linear approximation and simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation have been explored. Therefore, this study proposes Hybrid Quantum Swarm Intelligence (HQSI), which constructs a QNN model as a forward propagation neural network. After measuring quantum states and obtaining prediction results, a classical computer-based swarm intelligence algorithm is employed for weight optimization. The training process iterates between quantum and classical computing environments. During the experimental phase, the proposed HQSI method is evaluated using an online certificate status protocol request traffic prediction task. Comparative analysis against state-of-the-art quantum optimization algorithms demonstrates that the proposed HQSI approach achieves more than a 50% reduction in error."

Following data preprocessing, our analysis found that SVM was the most effective model, achieving a detection accuracy of 97.82 %. We identified Failed Transaction Count and Risk Score as the primary indicators of fraudulent activity. Transactions with high-risk scores and many failed attempts were strong signs of fraud. Fraud also tended to come from certain types of merchants and places. This study shows how powerful machine learning can be, especially SVM, for finding fraud in real time. This can make financial systems much safer. Future research will entail the evaluation of more resilient deep learning techniques and the adaptation to emerging fraud trends."

This study presents a method for designing a digital control unit for an active suspension setup using a quarter-car model, which simplifies the problem into a one-dimensional system made up of several springs and dampers representing one wheel out of four. The system uses PID and root locus control techniques to actively manage suspension behaviour. Although the method is straightforward and relatively new, the focus of this work is on the engineering aspects, including the design, development, and implementation of the experimental setup and control system. A nonlinear damping surface is introduced to help the vertical velocity of the vehicle converge quickly, effectively modifying how the system absorbs vibrations. The influence of the selected sliding surface on the system's behavior is also explored. The validation process has been completed successfully, and the findings demonstrate that the active suspension improves ride comfort significantly–reducing the vibration of the sprung mass by 20.8%. Additionally, the Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) method was applied to this quarter-car active suspension model. Details of the system design, analysis, and experimental results are also discussed. By incorporating PID and root locus control strategies, the active suspension enhances vehicle stability, safety, and driver control by minimizing the wheel movement caused by road irregularities."

    "abstract": "We study circuits for computing linear transforms defined by Kronecker power matrices. The best-known (unbounded-depth) circuits, including the widely-applied fast Walsh-Hadamard transform and Yates’ algorithm, can be derived from the best-known depth- 2 circuits using known constructions, so we focus particularly on the depth- 2 case. Recent work [Jukna and Sergeev’13; Alman, STOC’21; Alman, Guan and Padaki, SODA’23; Sergeev’22] has improved on decades-old constructions in this area using a new rebalancing approach, but it was unclear how to apply this approach optimally, and the previous versions had complicated technical requirements.We find that Strassen’s theory of asymptotic spectra can be applied to capture the design of these circuits. This theory was designed to generalize the known techniques behind matrix multiplication algorithms as well as a variety of other algorithms with recursive structure, and it brings a number of new tools to use for designing depth- 2 circuits. In particular, in hindsight, we find that the techniques of recent work on rebalancing were proving special cases of the duality theorem which is central to Strassen’s theory. We carefully outline a collection of obstructions to designing small depth- 2 circuits using a rebalancing approach, and apply Strassen’s theory to show that our obstructions are complete.Using this connection, combined with other algorithmic techniques (including matrix rigidity upper bounds, constant-weight binary codes, and a “hole-fixing lemma” from recent matrix multiplication algorithms), we give new improved circuit constructions as well as other applications, including:•The $N \\times N$ disjointness matrix has a depth-2 linear circuit of size $O\\left(N^{1.2495}\\right)$ over any field. This is the first construction which surpasses exponent 1.25, and thus yields smaller circuits for many families of matrices using reductions to disjointness, including all Kronecker products of $2 \\times 2$ matrices, without using matrix rigidity upper bounds.•Barriers to further improvements, including that the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis implies an $N^{1+\\Omega(1)}$ size lower bound for depth-2 linear circuits computing the WalshHadamard transform (and the disjointness matrix with a technical caveat), and that proving such a $N^{1+\\Omega(1)}$ depth2 size lower bound would imply breakthrough threshold circuit lower bounds.•The Orthogonal Vectors (OV) problem in moderate dimension d can be solved in deterministic time $\\tilde{O}\\left(n \\cdot 1.155^{d}\\right)$, derandomizing an algorithm of Nederlof and Wegrzycki [STOC’21], and the counting problem can be solved in time $\\tilde{O}\\left(n \\cdot 1.26^{d}\\right)$, improving an algorithm of Williams [FOCS’24] which runs in time $\\tilde{O}\\left(n \\cdot 1.35^{d}\\right)$. We design these new algorithms by noticing that prior algorithms for OV can be viewed as corresponding to depth- 2 circuits for the disjointness matrix, then using our framework for further improvements."

    "abstract": "Constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) are a natural class of decision problems where one must decide whether there is an assignment to variables that satisfies a given formula. Schaefer’s dichotomy theorem, and its extension to all alphabets due to Bulatov and Zhuk, shows that CSP languages are either efficiently decidable, or NP-complete. It is possible to extend CSP languages to quantum assignments using the formalism of nonlocal games. Due to the equality of complexity classes MIP* = RE, general succinctly-presented entangled CSPs are RE-complete. In this work, we show that a wide range of NP-complete CSPs become RE-complete in this setting, including all boolean CSPs, such as 3SAT, as well as 3-colouring. This also implies that these CSP languages remain undecidable even when not succinctly presented.To show this, we work in the weighted algebra framework introduced by Mastel and Slofstra, where synchronous strategies for a nonlocal game are represented by tracial states on an algebra. Along the way, we improve the subdivision technique in order to be able to separate constraints in the CSP while preserving constant soundness, construct commutativity gadgets for all boolean CSPs, and show a variety of relations between the different ways of presenting CSPs as games."

The input is given as a stream of updates to a frequency vector $x \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{\\geq 0}^{n}$, where the support of x defines a multiset of points in a fixed metric space $\\mathcal{M}=([n], \\mathrm{d})$. The goal is to estimate the diameter of this multiset, defined as max $\\left\\{\\mathrm{d}(i, j): x_{i}, x_{j} \\gt \\right. 0\\}$, to a specified approximation factor while using as little space as possible. In insertion-only streams, a simple $O(\\log n)$-space algorithm achieves a $\\mathbf{2}$-approximation. In sharp contrast to this, we show that in the dynamic streaming model, any algorithm achieving a constant-factor approximation to diameter requires polynomial space. Specifically, we prove that a c-approximation to the diameter requires $n^{\\Omega(1 / c)}$ space. Our lower bound relies on two conceptual contributions: (1) a new connection between dynamic streaming algorithms and linear sketches for scale-invariant functions, a class that includes diameter estimation, and (2) a connection between linear sketches for diameter and the minrank of graphs, a notion previously studied in index coding. We complement our lower bound with a nearly matching upper bound, which gives a c-approximation to the diameter in general metrics using $n^{O(1 / c)}$ space."

    "abstract": "There is a growing body of work on proving hardness results for average-case estimation problems by bounding the low-degree advantage (LDA) — a quantitative estimate of the closeness of low-degree moments — between a null distribution and a related planted distribution. Such hardness results are now ubiquitous not only for foundational average-case problems but also central questions in statistics and cryptography. This line of work is supported by the low-degree conjecture of Hopkins [1], which postulates that a vanishing degree-D LDA implies the absence of any noise-tolerant distinguishing algorithm with runtime ${n^{\\tilde {\\mathcal{O}}(D)}}$ whenever 1) the null distribution is product on ${\\{ 0,1\\} ^{\\binom{n}{k}}}$, and 2) the planted distribution is permutation invariant, that is, invariant under any relabeling [n] → [n].In this paper, we disprove this conjecture. Specifically, we show that for any fixed ε > 0 and k ⩾ 2, there is a permutation-invariant planted distribution on ${\\{ 0,1\\} ^{\\binom{n}{k}}}$ that has a vanishing degree-n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1−O(ε)</sup> LDA with respect to the uniform distribution on ${\\{ 0,1\\} ^{\\binom{n}{k}}}$, yet the corresponding ε-noisy distinguishing problem can be solved in ${n^{O\\left( {{{\\log }^{1/(k - 1)}}(n)} \\right)}}$ time. Our construction relies on algorithms for list-decoding for noisy polynomial interpolation in the high-error regime.We also give another construction of a pair of planted and (non-product) null distributions on ℝ<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">n×n</sup> with a vanishing n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Ω(1)</sup>-degree LDA while the largest eigenvalue serves as an efficient noise-tolerant distinguisher.Our results suggest that while a vanishing LDA may still be interpreted as evidence of hardness, developing a theory of average-case complexity based on such heuristics requires a more careful approach."

    "abstract": "Faculty turnover is a very pivotal question mark concerning the performance, sustenance, and academic quality of higher education establishments. This paper examines and reports on principal variables of faculty retention in private universities in Pune with special reference to job satisfaction, organisation culture and career growth. Although the growth in the field of education in India has been experiencing a booming trend, particularly, in areas such as Pune, the problem of faculty turnover is not going to go away. The research examines the institutional reports, accreditation feedback, HR analytics, and past literature whereby patterns that influence faculty stability can be revealed through a secondary data-driven approach. The University discovers that job satisfaction, including its elements of liberty, recognition, balance of workloads, and support by peers, is a prominent factor in influencing the results of retention. Indirectly in a similar way, the faculty commitment is influenced by the organizational culture which manifests itself in the leadership models, shared values, and decision-making procedures. Retention intentions are also reinforced by career growth in the form of mentorship, promotion as well as research opportunities. The study is based on the work of One-Factor Theory by Herzberg and Organizational Support Theory to support the conceptualisation. The results are expected to inform the work of educational policymakers and university administrators who are to work out the appropriate measures to achieve alignment between institutional practices and faculty expectations to increase the long-term retention. The paper provides a small contribution to a small body of literature on the pioneering region and highlight the requirement of contextsensitive retention policy in the higher education sector in the state of Pune, which is in the sphere of the private higher educational institutions."

In this article, the proposed TPMLL consists of the following parts: the outer stator, outer air gap, mover made of permanent magnets (PMs), inner air gap, and the inner stator. A magnetic equivalent circuit (MEC) method is established to analyze the electromagnetic characteristics and provide the basis for the structural design. To solve the MEC model, the Newton–Raphson method is adopted. By comparing the results of the finite element method (FEM) with the MEC model, it is found that the accuracy of MEC method has good accuracy in estimating the flux linkage of the proposed motor, which is very suitable to be used in the initial stage of the structural design."

Threat modeling is widely recognized as a process that helps assess security issues, especially architectural flaws, due to insecure design, thereby supporting the security-by-design mindset. While many research and industry sources advocate for threat modeling, others highlight issues such as the lack of motivation, its time-consuming nature, and practical difficulties, leading to questions about its overall effectiveness. <p xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">In this study, we conduct a comprehensive multivocal literature review to systematically examine the empirical evidence for the effectiveness of threat modeling. In short, by analyzing 109 sources from both white and gray literature, we did not encounter any direct, causal evidence (e.g., a controlled experiment) for the effectiveness of threat modeling as a technique to improve the security of a software application. This absence of causal evidence should not be interpreted as evidence that threat modeling is ineffective, though. The existing literature does describe several benefits and challenges related to threat modeling, as well as suggestions for improving the effectiveness of threat modeling activities. Studies on threat modeling often concentrate on benefits such as improved performance, effectiveness, efficiency, and usability of specific tools and methods. Recurring challenges, on the other hand, include a perceived lack of benefits, tool limitations, usability issues, and difficulties integrating threat modeling into the secure software development lifecycle. Suggestions for improvements include providing clear checklists or guidance, defining a clear scope, and involving different stakeholders during threat modeling activities.</p> <p xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Based on this review of the literature, researchers are invited to conduct rigorous empirical studies to address the underexplored aspects of threat modeling, thereby strengthening its evidence base and increasing its impact in the real world.</p>"

    "abstract": "Conventional three-dimensional (3D) inversion algorithms for the transient electromagnetic method (TEM) require time-domain discretization in both forward and adjoint modeling. These algorithms start from the initial time and compute the electric field iteratively at each new time step, which involve repeatedly solving large-scale systems of linear equations and thus cause a substantial computational cost. In contrast, the Krylov subspace-based model order reduction technique computes the 3D time-domain electromagnetic response with just a one-time reduction process, allowing for the electric field at any time to be obtained by solving only a small-scale matrix exponential problem, significantly improving the efficiency of forward modeling. However, this approach has not yet been widely utilized in 3D TEM inversion. In this study, the rational Krylov subspace-based model order reduction technique is applied to both forward and adjoint modeling. The data misfit residuals at each observation time channel are treated as virtual sources for the adjoint problem, enabling the use of the rational Krylov subspace method to solve the corresponding adjoint field. The gradient is evaluated using results from both the forward and adjoint modeling, and the model is updated via the L-BFGS method. Throughout the gradient calculation, only two matrix factorizations and a limited number of backward substitutions for right-hand sides are required in total for all necessary forward and adjoint modeling, which substantially reduces the computation burden. The proposed algorithm is validated using synthetic data. Results show that the presented 3D TEM inversion algorithm using the rational Krylov subspace technique achieves satisfactory inversion accuracy while significantly improving computational efficiency compared to inversion methods that employ conventional time-stepping approaches. Therefore, this work can provide valuable insights for further application of rational Krylov subspace methods in TEM data inversion."

We also present a feedback linearization based control design scheme that renders a partially unknown system incrementally input-to-state practically stable and safe with formal guarantees. To deal with the unknown dynamics, we utilize Gaussian process regression to approximate the model. Finally, we implement the controller synthesized by the proposed scheme on a manipulator example."

Using a comprehensive simulation framework, combined with real-world-like data generated via large language models and stochastic modeling, we tested these algorithms across various scenarios. Quantitative results reveal that, in peak demand situations, the ILP algorithm outperforms others by achieving up to <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{5 4. 9 \\%}$</tex> parking utilization and <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{7 1. 9 \\%}$</tex> equipment utilization, representing a <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{2 0 - 2 5 \\%}$</tex> improvement over FCFS and PRIO.

The system, driven by an external laser field with unknown atom-field coupling strength, is reformulated in the Bloch sphere representation, wherein the nonlinear dynamics of the spin variables are described. To estimate the unmeasured internal states and the unknown coupling parameter, we propose a cascaded strategy combining a nonlinear adaptive observer with the Dynamic Regressor Extension and Mixing (DREM) technique. The observer reconstructs the full Bloch vector from partial measurement (population difference), and the resulting regressors enable a scalar DREM formulation for the unknown parameter. Unlike traditional gradient-based identification, the DREM-based update ensures improved noise robustness and accelerated convergence even for scalar parameters. Numerical simulations confirm the accuracy and robustness of the proposed estimation strategy, demonstrating effective reconstruction of both the quantum state and the Hamiltonian parameter under realistic noisy measurements."

    "abstract": "Paraphrasing, the process of re-expressing text using different vocabulary and structures, plays a crucial role in various NLP tasks such as Summarization, Translation, and Question Answering. Especially in morphologically rich languages like Marathi, accurate paraphrasing requires a deep understanding of grammatical structures, supported by tools such as Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging. Although Paraphrasing research is extensively done for languages like English, French etc., Marathi remains underexplored due to its complex Morphology and limited linguistic resources. Efforts have mostly relied on rule-based approaches and synonym dictionaries, with recent tools like stanza improving POS tagging and morphological analysis. In NLP, paraphrasing involves three key tasks: generation, identification, and extraction, each enhancing system flexibility and human-like understanding. Techniques such as Transformation Paraphrasing and Synonym Replacement are crucial, where sentences are rewritten either by altering structure or substituting words without altering semantics. The proposed methodology for Marathi Paraphrasing involves systematic steps-extracting sentences from textbooks, POS tagging, identifying keywords, generating a dynamic synonym dictionary, performing semantic validation, and creating multiple paraphrased variants. A manually curated dataset is built, validated through semantic checks, ensuring grammatical correctness and preservation of meaning. Special attention is given to sentence transformation and synonym substitution, with semantic validation ensuring that paraphrasing maintains the intended context without distortion. This comprehensive approach not only enriches linguistic datasets for Marathi but also significantly supports broader NLP tasks for low-resource languages."

A technology is proposed for automatic UP inspection without navigational support from a surface vessel. In such cases, the support vessel may either:•be entirely absent; or•be present but, if lacking access to satellite navigation, determine its position relative to the AUV.Under these conditions, autonomous AUV navigation is carried out through onboard processing of optical and hydroacoustic images.The proposed technology relies on a method developed by the authors for recognizing characteristic technological elements (CTEs), which are regularly positioned along the communication line. In the case of UPs, anode protection devices are proposed as the CTEs. Since the coordinates of the CTEs are well known, their regular detection enables correction of the AUV's onboard navigation data. The report presents a CTE recognition method based on optical images, which includes:•an algorithm for tracking the UP by calculating its centerline;•an algorithm for direct detection of CTEs and evaluation of their condition (intact or destroyed) using a 3D point cloud derived from its geometric shape.Testing on both model and actual data demonstrated the promising potential of the method and the applicability of the proposed technology."

The approach first converts input discrete workspace points to joint space via inverse kinematics, so that it avoids parameter synchronization, then divides the points into substages (subpaths and transition paths) prone to generating large geometric errors. Each substage uses B-spline interpolation with boundary constraints, which enables more constraints to reduces geometric errors, and all substages are consolidated into an integral B-spline curve in sequence. Simulation results show that the method effectively generates a smooth path via discrete points without parameter synchronization and reduces geometric errors, verifying its feasibility in mitigating path deviation and generating a smooth path."

Researchers use intelligent data modeling and large data analytics to study the diets of postnatal women across various regions. A multi-regional survey provides robust statistical data for evaluation, while predictive statistical algorithms pinpoint nutritional trends and preferences. The community that was under research is highly inclined towards the use of some herbal products, and the result shows how traditional medicine is culturally relevant. Researchers are conducting an assessment of how socio-cultural situations influence dietary selection in the postpartum period. There is a need to have culturally sensitive and personalized nutritional therapies that consider advanced statistical models to estimate regional and socioeconomic differences. The socioeconomic background and access to healthcare affect food preferences after childbirth, where lower economic groups prefer more herbal supplements because of the lack of mainstream healthcare. The survey data depicts the demographic factor in postpartum dietary habits and disparities in health education and resource availability throughout India. A relationship can be observed between nutrition education and culturally appropriate diets, as portrayed by the journal cover of dietary management for chronic renal disease. As this abstract recommends, policymakers and health practitioners ought to incorporate indigenous knowledge systems in healthcare systems to meet the specific postpartum nutritional needs of women. The outcomes are expected to enhance both the mother's and child's health in India because of the diverse demographic needs and preferences. The present study is valuable to the literature on nutrition, health diversity competencies, and modern and traditional diets. The multiregional survey findings can be extended to future research on the nutritional requirements of postpartum women in different situations in society using herbal products."

There has been research indicating the influence of external variables such as oil and gas prices, and exchange rates on the stock market. However, research in direction has been scarce. In this work, we attempt to use external variables such as oil price, gas price and exchange rates in addition to historical values of closing price and volume traded, for predicting future stock prices. The research is carried out in an Indian context, by considering two popular Indian stocks. Experiments conducted suggest the usefulness of external variables for predicting future stock prices if the variables used have a moderate correlation with the stock prices. The inclusion of multiple external factors seems to improve system performance only if the variables themselves are not highly correlated with each other."

Although K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) achieved a comparable average MAPE (0.2243), Random Forest achieved the lowest average Testing MAPE (0.2201) and maintained higher stability and generalization capability. These results demonstrate that early-cycle data, structured through policy-based feature configurations, can reliably predict battery cycle life, providing a scalable, efficient, and cost-effective alternative to traditional long-term degradation testing. Unlike previous work such as the MIT early-stage forecasting study, this framework extends the analysis through policy-based feature grouping and multi-model comparison to assess generalization performance."

Sodium-ion batteries, which offer abundant sodium resources and excellent safety, have emerged as a highly promising alternative solution. Given the unique characteristics of sodium-ion batteries, such as the absence of a distinct voltage plateau, this paper constructs a third-order RC equivalent circuit model to describe their nonlinear characteristics. Three algorithms—the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, genetic algorithm, and particle swarm optimization algorithm—were employed for parameter identification. The results show that the L-M algorithm achieves an average absolute error as low as 2.21828 mV and a root mean square error of 3.78116 mV, with significantly higher accuracy than the other two algorithms, providing strong support for precise estimation of sodium-ion batteries."

    "abstract": "Momentum management is a critical function in spacecraft attitude control systems that utilize reaction wheels, particularly to prevent wheel saturation caused by the accumulation of angular momentum over time. Momentum management refers to the control strategy used to maintain reaction wheel speeds within specified operational limits. Conventional momentum management methods using magnetic torquers often introduce undesirable attitude disturbances, which are typically corrected through feedback control using the reaction wheels themselves. Although this feedback may direct the momentum change as intended, it can still lead to significant attitude errors—particularly detrimental for high-precision pointing missions. Moreover, traditional desaturation strategies do not guarantee proper wheel speed regulation in systems with redundant reaction wheel configurations. This paper presents a generalized framework for reaction wheel momentum management that minimizes attitude disturbance during desaturation and ensures adherence to wheel speed limits even in redundant configurations. The proposed method first computes the total desaturation torque required for momentum unloading. This torque is then decomposed into two orthogonal components: a null-space torque, which redistributes momentum among reaction wheels without affecting the spacecraft’s attitude, and a range-space torque, which reduces the spacecraft’s net angular momentum. The range-space torque implemented using magnetic torquers is also feedforward to attitude control system along with residual term. This approach enables efficient momentum unloading, maintains wheel speeds within desired bounds, and significantly reduces attitude disturbance—making it suitable for high-precision agile spacecraft operations."

    "abstract": "Safe navigation in unknown and dynamic environments remains a key challenge for autonomous multi-robot systems. Traditional methods often depend on global maps or fixed heuristics, limiting scalability and adaptability in complex, unstructured settings. In this work, we propose a risk-aware multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) framework for mapless navigation through static and dynamic obstacles. Each robot learns an independent policy using local LiDAR, goal, and velocity data, with centralized training and decentralized execution. To enhance safety, we introduce a sequence-based risk critic that predicts continuous risk for each action from recent state-action histories. Instead of binary collision labels, we generate soft risk labels using a two-threshold scheme on future LiDAR data, allowing agents to anticipate and avoid imminent danger. Integrating this risk critic into the reward function fosters nuanced, proactive avoidance. Experiments in ROS2-Gazebo with moving obstacles and unseen layouts show improved success and lower collision rates versus MADDPG. The lightweight networks support real-time onboard inference and sim-to-real deployment."

The goal was to increase the radar visibility of rockets with cylindrical fuselages, as these are difficult to detect at high angles of incidence due to their low monostatic radar cross section (RCS). The proposed solution employs passive, air-filled slotted waveguide (SWG) antennas realized through additive manufacturing and metallic coating. The structure meets the stringent requirements for weight, size, and mechanical stability. Experimental validation shows that the developed structure significantly improves radar detection compared to a simple cylindrical body."

In this article, a novel efficiency-oriented stepwise (EOS) optimization strategy for VFMM is proposed. This strategy can innovatively take the coil flux linkage directly as an optimization objective, which can flexibly regulate the operation envelopes and PM torques at different MSs. A 27-slot/4-pole VFMM with the magnetic circuit complementary (MCC) concept is taken as a design example. Firstly, the operation principle, multiple operation conditions, and key requirements of the VFMM are theoretically investigated. Then, the MCC-VFMM and the EOS optimization strategy are introduced and implemented respectively. Furthermore, the key electromagnetic characteristics of the initial and optimized VFMMs are comprehensively compared. Finally, an optimized prototype is fabricated and experimented to confirm the feasibility of the proposed optimization approach."

    "abstract": "Multivariate time series classification (MTSC) is an important research direction in data mining, providing fundamental support for data analysis and intelligent decision-making in complex dynamic systems. However, current methods often follow the temporal-channel mixing approach, where temporal and channel information are jointly processed in the feature space. This inevitably leads to feature confusion and information loss. Furthermore, the existence of distribution shift degrades the generalization capability of the model. To this end, we propose a Transformer-based framework for MTSC, named TCDformer, which improves classification effectiveness by decoupling the modeling of temporal and channel dependencies. TCDformer consists of two core modules: the Channel Independent Transformer Module (CITM) and the Patch Independent Transformer Module (PITM). CITM first captures the pure temporal patterns within each channel, while PITM further explores the inter-channel interactions within fine-grained temporal segments. Additionally, reversible instance normalization (RevIN) is introduced to mitigate the distribution shift in the feature extraction layers, thereby achieving robust performance. Experimental results on 25 UEA datasets show that TCDformer outperforms current competitive MTSC methods."

Building on a backscatter-based identification mechanism, the proposed approach introduces a secure, energy-efficient layer that operates independently of communication protocols and with minimal hardware modification. A rectifier-driven backscattering scheme embedded in battery-free sensing nodes enables authentication without activating conventional RF transceivers, thereby reducing power consumption while ensuring secure device identification. To assess robustness, replay attacks are emulated on standard LoRaWAN Activation By Personalization (ABP) encryption, highlighting vulnerabilities and demonstrating the relevance of the proposed solution. The approach is experimentally validated in a real Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) using LoRaWAN-compatible, battery-free sensing nodes equipped with compact, low-profile antennas, confirming both practicality and scalability for space-constrained IoT deployments. Results show that the method achieves secure identification, reliable energy harvesting, and data transmission with negligible impact on node autonomy. The proposed approach offers a practical, energy-efficient, and scalable security framework for SWIPT-enabled IoT systems, strengthening device authentication without altering existing communication protocols or compromising power autonomy."

However, silhouette-based methods are often affected by variations in clothing and carrying conditions. To address these challenges, we propose a novel multi-modal approach that integrates Gait Energy Images (GEI) and Skeletal Gait Energy Images (SkeGEI) to enhance recognition performance. GEIs capture appearance-based holistic motion patterns, while SkeGEIs, generated from normalized skeletal representations centred on the neck joint, provide robust structural features. Skeletal coordinates are extracted using HRNet for the CASIA-B dataset and AlphaPose for the OU-MVLP dataset, which are then used to generate SkeGEIs. Our composite fusion model effectively combines GEI and SkeGEI features through Cross-Alignment blocks (CAB), attention mechanisms, and Progressive Fusion Blocks (PFB). Extensive evaluations on the CASIA-B and OU-MVLP datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves superior performance compared to state-ofthe- art methods across diverse conditions. However, the model struggles with crossdataset generalization, particularly in varied clothing conditions. Additionally, an ablation study highlights the effectiveness of each component, validating the superiority of our integrated model."

    "abstract": "Non-stationary signals with rapidly evolving and overlapping spectral components present challenges for obtaining accurate time-frequency distribution (TFD). Conventional dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) extracts mode frequencies and damping information but struggles to represent the TFD of highly non-stationary signals. Multi-resolution DMD (MR-DMD) improves this but depends on a fixed embedding dimension, causing mode mixing and reduced resolution. This paper presents an adaptive multiresolution DMD (AMR-DMD) technique that automatically determines the embedding dimension at each decomposition level using a time-frequency resolution criterion obtained from the Heisenberg uncertainty principle for real-valued signals. The method is further extended to complex-valued signals by separating positive and negative frequency components for complete spectral characterization. Hilbert spectral analysis (HSA) is applied to the modes obtained from AMR-DMD to generate the TFD. Experimental results on real synthetic and complex signals show that the proposed AMR-DMD-based HSA technique provides improved TFDs, achieving sharper localization, lower reconstruction error, and higher quality reconstruction factor compared with empirical mode decomposition-based HSA, variational mode decomposition-based HSA, DMD-based HSA, and MR-DMD-based HSA methods."

However, applying LfD in industrial settings remains challenging due to limited demonstrations, variability in task executions, and the need to generalize across diverse scenarios. To address these issues, this paper presents a learning based hierarchical task and motion planning framework that integrates Behavior Trees (BT) for high-level task sequencing and Dynamic Motion Primitives (DMP) for low-level motion generation. Demonstration trajectories are segmented and actions are generated using an agentcentric, state-augmented segmentation strategy. Subsequently, relevant features are automatically extracted to define the pre-and post-conditions for each action for the construction of a modular BT. For motion execution, DMP are enhanced with a recovery mechanism for adaptive, obstacle-aware reproduction. A backchaining mechanism is also introduced for BT extension. Validation was performed through simulation and real-world experiments on multiple tasks. Comparative results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing LfD and planning baselines in task success rate, efficiency, and motion smoothness, highlighting its potential for flexible and scalable automation."

Existing Kubernetes scheduling approaches are not sophisticated enough to factor energy efficiency and infrastructure differences into the scheduling decisions. To address these shortages, we propose a novel scheduling system for Kubernetes clusters that considers infrastructure specifics and further task requirements. The system uses a benchmarking suite to model node performance, selects appropriate scheduling algorithms based on the number of tasks, and further optimizes cluster power consumption through re-scheduling. Our evaluation results show that the proposed approach achieves a power consumption reduction of18.46% compared to the Kubernetes scheduler."

System credibility within the Hardware-in-the-Loop setup is assessed against Vehicle-in-the-Loop tests. The results confirm the applicability of the proposed architecture. Moderate deviations in vehicle dynamics behaviour are observed, attributed to model simplifications.

The proposed scheme adaptively estimates unknown valve parameters to achieve effective compensation for diverse stiction characteristics of pneumatic valves. The stability of the controller is rigorously proven using Lyapunov theory. Furthermore, to mitigate the adverse effects of noise and measurement errors, an improved Levant differentiator is introduced, which effectively suppresses chattering and enhances robustness.

To date, high-density (HD) SRAM has been the conventional device of choice; however, with the slowing of transistor scaling, as reflected in the industry’s almost identical HD SRAM cell size from 5 nm to 3 nm, alternative solutions such as 3D stacking with advanced packaging (i.e., hybrid bonding) are pursued (as demonstrated in AMD’s V-cache). Escalating data demands necessitate ultra-large on-chip caches to decrease costly off-chip memory movement, pushing the exploration of device technology towards monolithic 3D (M3D) integration, where transistors can be stacked in the back-end-of-line (BEOL) at the interconnect level. M3D integration requires fabrication techniques compatible with a low thermal budget (<400°C). Among promising BEOL device candidates are amorphous oxide semiconductor (AOS) transistors, particularly desirable for their ultra-low leakage (<fA/μm), enabling persistent data retention (>seconds) when used in a gain-cell configuration. This paper examines device, circuit, and system-level tradeoffs made when optimizing BEOL-compatible AOS-based 2-transistor gain cells (2T-GC) for LLC. A cache early-exploration tool, NS-Cache, is developed to model caches in advanced 7 & 3 nm nodes and is integrated with the Gem5 simulator to systematically benchmark the impact of the newfound density/performance when compared to HD-SRAM, MRAM, and 1T1C eDRAM alternatives for LLC."

Various approaches have been proposed to realize collective perception; however, the Sensor2Sensor domain gap that arises from the utilization of different sensor systems in Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) remains mostly unaddressed. This is primarily due to the paucity of datasets containing heterogeneous sensor setups among the CAVs. The recently released SCOPE datasets address this issue by providing data from three different LiDAR sensors for each CAV. This study is the first to address the Sensor2Sensor domain gap in vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) collective perception. First, we present our sensor-domain robust architecture S2S-Net. Then an in-depth analysis of the Sensor2Sensor domain adaptation capabilities of state-of-the-art CP methods and S2S-Net is conducted on the SCOPE dataset. This study shows that, all evaluated state-of-the-art mehtods for collective perception highly suffer from the Sensor2Sensor domain gap, while S2S-Net demonstrates the capability to maintain very high performance in unseen sensor domains and outperforms the evaluated state-of-the-art methods by up to 44 percentage points."

    "abstract": "Real-world testing, whether through naturalistic or test-track driving, cannot generate the test coverage required to prove the safety of autonomous vehicles with acceptable statistical significance. Virtual Testing Environments (VTEs) offer a complementary solution by enabling the creation of challenging safety-critical test scenarios that are difficult to replicate in real-world conditions. To ensure that a VTE is a sufficient representation of the real-world, our previous work proposed the development of a VTE using a digital twin of an actual roadway environment. This VTE can generate synthetic LiDAR scans, which can then be compared to real-world scans used to create the digital twin. We employed chamfer distance and density-aware chamfer distance as the metrics for this comparison. In this study, we implemented this approach on a variety of roadway scenes to investigate how different scene compositions affect the comparison metrics. Our findings reveal that factors such as road surface smoothness, vegetation presence, and the LiDAR’s point of view (elevation) significantly influence the comparison results."

    "abstract": "Robotic grasping of diverse objects, particularly flat or smooth surfaces, remains challenging for conventional grippers. To address this issue, a bionic interlocking adhesive gripper inspired by the counter-adducting toe mechanism of geckos is proposed. The gripper integrates an angle-spreading joint, an adhesion/detachment joint, and bionic adhesive toes to achieve inward interlocking for enhanced adhesion and outward extension for low-impact detachment. Experimental validation shows that the interlocking behavior effectively doubles the normal adhesion force on planar surfaces compared to non-interlocking conditions. It also enables stable grasping of multiple objects with varied curvature, stiffness, and materials. The results demonstrate that multilevel cooperative design and interlocking biomimetic mechanisms can significantly improve the versatility and controllability of adhesion-based grippers for complex and resource-efficient robotic applications. Beyond performance enhancements, the energy-efficient and reusable nature of gecko-inspired dry adhesion supports broader aims of industry innovation and sustainable industrial technologies."

    "abstract": "The rapid growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) has enabled the development of intelligent transportation systems (ITS). However, missing data remains a common issue that hinders the effectiveness of ITS. Although many imputation methods have been proposed to handle missing values, they generally aim to improve the accuracy of final imputation results and often neglect the interpretability of the imputation process. This may cause limited trustworthiness and practical applicability in real-world metro management, where understanding the underlying metro data patterns is essential. To address this gap, this paper conducts an in-depth analysis and mining of the unique spatiotemporal structures inherent in metro flow data, aiming at both accurate and interpretable imputation. Specifically, an orthogonal-autoregression matrix factorization (OAMF) algorithm is proposed to discover two low-dimensional, complete spatial and temporal patterns from high-dimensional, incomplete data. By minimizing reconstruction error associated with these two patterns, OAMF ensures the accuracy of final imputation results. Furthermore, through simultaneous distinctive spatial representations modeling and predictive temporal modeling, OAMF encourages the two patterns with clear physical meaning that captures orthogonal spatial distributions and evolving metro flow trends over time, enabling the interpretability of the imputation process. Additionally, the above explicit temporal modeling further extends OAMF’s ability to predict futures. The proposed OAMF is validated using two real-world datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that OAMF not only extracts interpretable spatiotemporal patterns but also achieves superior accuracy in both imputation and prediction across various missing rates compared to existing methods."

    "abstract": "Self-supervised monocular depth estimation leverages photometric consistency across views as supervisory signals, yet inherently suffers from compromised geometric fidelity at object boundaries, surface smoothness, and cross-view consistency due to 3D structural information loss during 2D projection. This paper introduces Diff3D-Net, a novel framework integrating multi-level 3D geometric constraints to overcome these limitations. Key innovations include: a fixed-parameter RPM-Net point cloud registration module generating geometrically grounded supervision; a pose consistency constraint that directly optimizes the pose network using RPM-Net-refined transformations to suppress error accumulation; a dual-path photometric constraint adaptively fusing reconstructions from original and optimized poses to enhance low-texture robustness; and a multi-view 3D structural consistency constraint enforcing global point alignment via minimum residual selection. Evaluations on KITTI and DDAD show Diff3D-Net's state-of-the-art performance, achieving 0.094/4.220 Abs. Rel/RMSE on KITTI. The model also exhibits strong cross-domain generalization in zero-shot settings, outperforming competitors on Cityscapes, NYU Depth V2 and DrivingStereo datasets without fine-tuning, highlighting its IoT application potential. Despite higher training costs, its inference achieves an optimal speed-accuracy trade-off, with a lightweight variant reaching 51.73 FPS -sufficient to enable real-time applications such as UAV navigation on resource-limited IoT edge devices. Ablations confirm each constraint's contribution, and qualitative results demonstrate robustness in dynamic scenes and complex geometries."

    "abstract": "High-quality Deep Learning (DL) enabled by large-scale training data has found applications across various industries. However, when local data contains sensitive privacy information, the amount of data to be aggregated is limited, hindering sufficient training. Federated Learning (FL) and Split Learning (SL) enable collaborative training while protecting the privacy information of local data, but each approach faces distinct difficulties, such as computational load and limited parallelism. SplitFed Learning (SFL), a hybrid of SL and FL, provides a promising method to overcome these issues. However, when dealing with non-Independent and Identically Distributed (non-IID) datasets, a common scenario in real-world applications, SFL performance suffers considerably as a result of client drift and biased model updates. To address this problem, this paper proposes SplitFed-CKD, which integrates contrastive learning and knowledge distillation into SFL through the use of an auxiliary classifier that takes the outputs of client models as input. Specifically, SplitFed-CKD classifies the output of the global model into reliable positive and unreliable negative samples according to dynamic thresholds. Contrastive learning is then performed on the feature vectors of the auxiliary classifier using prototypes that represent averaged samples. This enables each client-side model to effectively learn global knowledge and mitigate biased training. Furthermore, knowledge distillation is performed by using the training model as a teacher and the client and auxiliary classifiers as students. Finally, comparisons with recent state-of-the-art approaches, together with five-run statistical significance tests, confirm that SplitFed-CKD achieves consistently higher accuracy with statistically significant gains in large-class non-IID settings where class diversity is high."

    "abstract": "Electrical stimulation of somatic nerves has long been used as a treatment method for a wide range of diseases by increasing activity on a target nerve. Electrical nerve block is an emerging therapy that can provide the same targeted treatment by decreasing activity on the nerve. Here, we demonstrate that both of these techniques can be applied synergistically via a single electrode to achieve precise control of an autonomic system. Two electrodes were placed on the right-side rat vagus nerve. The vagus proximal to the electrodes was crushed, and the left side was cut to isolate the system. The proximal electrode was used to give a perturbing stimulus ramp (0 Hz → 30 Hz → 0 Hz) over 10 minutes to roughly mimic the vagal activity seen in an episode of vasovagal syncope. The distal electrode was used to apply either stimulation or kilohertz-frequency electrical nerve block (KHFAC) to the vagus to keep the heart rate at a specified setpoint. The stimulation parameters were decided by a closed-loop fuzzy logic controller. Three different gains for the controller were tried. While each gain showed success in controlling the heart rate, lower gain was sometimes not responsive enough for effective control, and high gain was seen to induce oscillations in the heart rate; a medium gain was seen to be effective without either of these issues. This demonstrates that a single electrode can deliver bimodal neuromodulation of a single nerve, providing a powerful treatment tool against autonomic dysregulation."

A high-fidelity electrothermal inverter model generates synthetic discharge profiles across a broad range of operating conditions and degradation levels. To bridge the synthetic–experimental gap, we introduce a degradation-aware latent space structuring mechanism combining domain alignment and class ordering, optimized via an adaptive multi-task loss balancing strategy. Experiments on a three-phase traction inverter demonstrate robust degradation tracking with 98.9% classification accuracy, full recall for the most degraded state, and low computational cost suitable for embedded deployment. The method enables interpretable and deployment-ready capacitor monitoring without additional sensors or control-layer modifications."

However, this manual approach often suffers from low accuracy, inefficiency, and limited automation, posing challenges to efficiency and consistency in modern manufacturing processes. To achieve efficient, precise, and automated inspection of products in stacked packaging, this study proposes the RFBS model for developing optimized unpacking and inspection methods. First, the requirements, including functional, behavioral, and structural aspects, were defined within the RFBS model. Second, the requirement layer was translated into functional and behavioral layers, which were subsequently transformed into the structural layer. Meanwhile, a fully automated disassembly and inspection process has been developed, consisting of the following steps: outer box imaging inspection, outer box disassembly, inner box imaging inspection, inner box disassembly. Finally, a prototype was developed based on the RFBS method to achieve fully automated disassembly and inspection of the packaging system. Experimental results show that this automated process can automatically disassemble and inspect the stacked packaging with a reliability of 97% and a non-destructive rate of 99.8%, which provides a practical and efficient solution for the quality control of industrial production."

    "abstract": "State space models (SSMs), particularly Mamba, have garnered significant attention from researchers owing to their efficient balance between computational efficiency and model performance, and they also provide a performance breakthrough for accurate land cover classification of hyperspectral images (HSIs). However, HSI data feature high spectral dimensionality and dense spatial information, so efficiently constructing Mamba sequences that align with the structural characteristics of HSI data remains a critical unresolved issue. To address this challenge, we propose an efficient deformable spatial-spectral Mamba network (DSS-Mamba), which aims to efficiently mine valuable spatial-spectral features from HSIs. To achieve this goal, we design a two-branch architecture consisting of a spatial deformable Mamba and a spectral bidirectional Mamba: the spatial deformable scanning Mamba (SDSM) integrates a spatial deformable state space model (SD-SSM) and adaptively focuses on salient feature regions through a dynamic scanning strategy, while the spectral bidirectional scanning Mamba (SBSM) incorporates a spectral bidirectional state space model (SB-SSM) and fully exploits spectral dimensional information via a bidirectional scanning mechanism. During feature processing, we propose a spatial-spectral complementary fusion (SSCF) module, which refines feature weights by means of a dual-threshold enhancement unit (DTEU) to realize efficient processing and dynamic fusion of spatial-spectral features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DSS-Mamba effectively balances the fine-grained capture of spatial-spectral features and computational efficiency through the adaptive capture of spatial features by the deformable structure, the in-depth mining of spectral information via bidirectional scanning, and the complementary fusion of the spatial-spectral module. Consequently, it achieves superior classification accuracy in land cover classification."

    "abstract": "Bilateral trade models the task of intermediating between two strategic agents, a seller and a buyer, willing to trade a good for which they hold private valuations. We study this problem from the perspective of a broker, in a regret minimization framework. At each time step, a new seller and buyer arrive, and the broker has to propose a mechanism that is incentivecompatible and individually rational, with the goal of maximizing profit. We propose a learning algorithm that guarantees a nearly tight regret in the stochastic setting when seller and buyer valuations are drawn i.i.d. from a fixed and possibly correlated unknown distribution. We further show that it is impossible to achieve sublinear regret in the non-stationary scenario where valuations are generated upfront by an adversary. Our ambitious benchmark for these results is the best incentive-compatible and individually rational mechanism. This separates us from previous works on efficiency maximization in bilateral trade, where the benchmark is a single number: the best fixed price in hindsight. A particular challenge we face is that uniform convergence for all mechanisms’ profits is impossible. We overcome this difficulty via a careful chaining analysis that proves convergence for a provably near-optimal mechanism at (essentially) optimal rate. We further showcase the broader applicability of our techniques by providing nearly optimal results for the joint ads problem."

While such a zero is guaranteed to exist, finding it is known to be computationally intractable: it is PPAcomplete already for n = 2. In this work, we show that the problem remains just as hard even if the function is mapping from a higher to a lower dimensional space. Namely, we prove that it is PPA-complete to find a zero of $f: {\\mathcal{S}}^{k} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ for any constants $k \\geq n \\geq 2$. This result has very appealing consequences for other flagship PPA-complete problems such as Tucker, Consensus Halving, and Ham Sandwich. For example, in the Consensus Halving problem from fair division, we show that finding a partition that satisfies three agents with monotone valuations is PPA-complete, even if we allow any arbitrarily large constant number of cuts."

Three deep learning models are evaluated based on their accuracy before applying Explainable AI to the most effective one for attrition prediction. The models include Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), and Radial Basis Function (RBF) networks. CNN, originally designed for image processing, also proves effective for tabular data, achieving an accuracy of 95.93 %. RNN, known for handling sequential and time-dependent data, achieves 94% accuracy. Meanwhile, RBF, which specializes in capturing nonlinear relationships, reaches an accuracy of 87.40 %. Among these models, CNN outperforms the others in accuracy, while RNN and RBF yield comparatively lower results. To enhance interpretability, Explainable AI (XAI) is employed to identify key factors influencing employee attrition. The study uses the LIME technique to explain individual predictions, making the model's decision-making process more transparent and actionable for HR professionals.

    "abstract": "One important part of radiation treatment in cancer is making sure that the radiation dose reaches the tumours as evenly as possible while hurting as few healthy tissues as possible. Even though traditional methods work, they don't always get the doses to the right places, which could limit the treatment. New developments in artificial intelligence (AI) hold promise for improving the accuracy of how radiation doses are distributed in cancer. AI-based methods, especially deep learning and machine learning, could completely change the way treatment plans are made by allowing automated and accurate dose prediction models, making it easier to target tumours accurately, and making the best use of radiation delivery. Computer programs that are driven by AI can look at complicated medical images like computed tomography (CT) scans and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to make very accurate dose distributions and find important structures that need to be protected. AI can also help with adaptive radiation therapy by constantly changing treatment plans as the tumour size or the patient's body changes during the treatment. This makes sure that the treatment is more personalized and optimized on the fly. By learning from big datasets to guess the best radiation tactics, machine learning models, especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and reinforcement learning, can make treatments even more effective. This essay looks at different AI techniques used to spread radiation doses in cancer. It also talks about how these techniques affect the accuracy of treatment and the problems that might come up when AI methods are used in real life. When AI is added to radiation treatment, it is expected to greatly improve patient results, lower side effects, and make personalized cancer care possible."

    "abstract": "Model-Based Diagnosis (MBD), a prominent technique for identifying the causes of system malfunctions, is an important research area in reliability engineering. Existing MBD methods generate a large number of candidate diagnoses for fault localization, which requires extensive computational cost. This work introduces a novel fault propagation model to replace the model used in conventional MBD approaches, and proposes a novel diagnosis method upon this model to improve diagnosis performance. First, we generate fault propagation constraints to capture the logical relationships as faults propagate between two connected components, which can be used to narrow down some subsets of candidate diagnoses in the subsequent diagnosis phase. Second, we formally model fault propagation through Weighted Conjunctive Normal Form (WCNF), encoding it as a Maximum Satisfiability (MaxSAT) problem. Building on this model, we use RC2-an efficient MaxSAT solver-to compute only a subset of candidate diagnoses, thereby significantly reducing the computational cost of fault localization. Experimental evaluations using ISCAS-85 and ITC-99 benchmarks demonstrate that FPMBD achieves a reduction in the number of diagnoses typically ranging from 1 to 5 orders of magnitude, along with a reduction in diagnosis time ranging from 1 to 4 orders of magnitude in almost all of the test cases, compared to state-of-theart algorithms, including CMMO, HSD, One-SAT, and DiagDO."

Education is a field where ABSA really finds its footing-schools and colleges benefit from knowing what parts of a class, teacher, or style resonate with students. These reviews are also a very precious source of information for requirement engineers. But instruments and organizations are not very satisfied with the overall sentiment; they like fine-grained knowledge about student reviews. We focus on aspect-based sentiment analysis for college review to analysis student for the best college. Also colleges to identify their strength and weaknesses. We use SVM, Naïve Bayes, XG Boost, Gradient Boosting, and Random Forest for sentiment classification. Interestingly, in most cases the data showed that both XG Boost and Gradient Boosting hit over 96% accuracy-outperforming the others. Generally speaking, this points to the promise of using tailored domain-specific word banks to fine-tune results, especially in languages where resources are limited. The results demonstrate how supervised learning and lexicon-based methods for low-resource languages can be combined"

    "abstract": "Crack and fracture detection, if delayed or overlooked, might entirely endanger the safety of the tracks. The latest technological AIs, IoT, and sensors bring efficiency to fault-detection systems. This study reviews modern technologies such as acoustic analysis, ultrasonic sensors, and DT technology. Acoustic technology assesses vibrations to perceive abnormalities, while ultrasonic sensors use sound to detect internal defects. Meanwhile, DT technology helps in creating a virtual model of the physical tracks so that it can be monitored for predictive maintenance in real time. In this world of AI, monitoring systems can detect faults faster and more accurately, although some challenges still exist with environmental conditions and real-time data processing."

    "abstract": "Background: Integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) into critical care nursing holds the promise of enhancing clinical decision-making through real-time feedback and predictive notifications from physiological and behavioural signals. The clinical effectiveness and nurse-led uptake of AI in ICU environments are yet to be fully explored. This RCT will examine whether AI-enhanced nursing assessments improve early detection of patient deterioration, response times among nurses, and general patient outcomes in critical care. A parallelgroup, two-arm RCT was implemented at a tertiary ICU, recruiting 200 critically ill adults (100 in the control group and 100 in the AI-assisted intervention group). The intervention was the incorporation of an AI-powered decision support system that processed continuous physiological data to alert for clinical deterioration. Primary outcomes were time to detection, length of stay in the ICU, and 30-day mortality. Secondary measures included nurse response time, usability and acceptance of the system, measured with structured tools and qualitative interviews. The AI-supported group exhibited notable improvements on a number of important outcomes. The mean length of stay in the ICU was decreased by 1.8 days (p < 0.05), detection of deterioration time was shortened by 3.4 hours (p < 0.05), and 30-day mortality was reduced by 33% (p < 0.05). Intervention group nurses also registered quicker response times and had high system usability and acceptance ratings (mean System Usability Scale score of 86.5/100, perceived usefulness score of 4.4/5). Open-ended feedback noted that nurses perceived the AI system as an auxiliary tool that supplemented their clinical judgment instead of diminishing it. This research clearly demonstrates that AI-enabled nursing assessment tools can lead to meaningful improvements in clinical outcomes and response times, along with being easily adopted into current ICU nursing workflow. The positive sense of usability for nursing personnel and belief in the AI tool's ability to enhance clinical decision-making suggests that involving nurses when designing AI into health care systems has value. These contributions point to the possibility of optimization of critical care utilization of resources by adopting AI in big-way approaches to integrate AI in health care systems - especially considering the significant shortage of resources (including human ones) in care settings around the world. Further studies which are multi-center and longer-term are needed to confirm the findings of this study and the long-term influence of an AI integration to regulate health care systems."

    "abstract": "Stock market forecasting has long been regarded as one of the most challenging yet critical tasks in financial analytics, as it directly supports decision-making in investment strategies, risk mitigation, and economic planning. Accurate forecasting not only assists individual and institutional investors in optimizing their portfolios but also contributes to the stability and predictability of broader economic systems. Recent developments in deep learning, particularly in the fields of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), have created new opportunities for handling complex financial time-series data. These architectures enable the discovery of non-linear dependencies and hidden structures within large datasets that traditional machine learning approaches often fail to capture. However, despite these advances, a systematic comparative analysis of CNN and LSTM performance across multiple stock indices remains limited, thereby restricting model selection strategies within financial research and practice. In this study, we conduct an extensive evaluation of CNN and LSTM-RNN models by applying them to diverse stock indices, including the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI), NASDAQ, New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), Russell 2000, and S&P 500. The experiments reveal that LSTM-based models consistently outperform CNN architectures, achieving predictive accuracies of up to 90 %. The findings of this research highlight the strategic advantage of adopting LSTM-based frameworks for stock market prediction, offering investors, policymakers, and developers reliable tools to enhance predictive performance. Ultimately, the study provides a robust, data-driven comparison between CNN and LSTM approaches, delivering practical guidance for designing future forecasting systems and contributing to the advancement of financial decision-support technologies."

This research focuses on two core issues: (1) Regarding the algorithm, in response to the common problems such as premature convergence and insufficient computational efficiency in swarm intelligence algorithms, innovative methods such as the elite retention mechanism and cosine annealing inertia weight were adopted to enhance the convergence speed. Moreover, the advantages and disadvantages of these two algorithms were compared, along with their applicability in this project.

Yet, their adoption also introduces significant ethical, social, and regulatory challenges that extend far beyond technical deployment. This paper presents a multi-dimensional framework grounded in Rawlsian justice theory and Value-Sensitive Design to evaluate and guide the ethical integration of AVs into urban ecosystems. Drawing on empirical evidence and simulation using the Cityscapes dataset, we identify key areas of concern including perception bias, spatial inequity in AV deployment, data privacy risks, and surveillance implications. Our findings reveal that AV systems, if unregulated, may exacerbate digital redlining and reinforce socio-economic disparities. We propose ethical risk modeling and decentralized governance mechanisms to mitigate these risks and promote transparency, inclusivity, and sustainability. By combining theoretical ethics with technical simulation and policy analysis, this study offers a comprehensive roadmap for cities aiming to align AV innovation with principles of justice, trust, and resilience."

For this, charging docking stations must have energy sources capable of supplying energy for an unlimited time, or with periodic, but rather rare refueling. The energy supply of charging docking stations via cable lines, from renewable energy sources is considered: wind, wave, solar energy, energy of currents and temperature gradients in the ocean, nuclear energy sources, hydrogen fuel cells. The energy reserves at the charging dock station when using a hydrogen fuel cell battery depend on the capacity of the reagent storage system. The parameters of the system with fuel cell batteries and high-pressure gas cylinders produced in Russia are estiated.

However, high vehicle mobility poses a significant challenge to effective resource allocation. Most existing studies focus on offloading strategies while overlooking the impact of vehicle mobility. This work formulates a constrained single-objective optimization problem and proposes a hybrid metaheuristic algorithm-Genetic Simulated Annealing Particle Swarm Optimization (GSPSO)-to obtain near-optimal solutions. Experimental results show that GSPSO effectively minimizes energy consumption, achieving reductions of 47.84 % and 97.95 % compared to Genetic Algorithm and Simulated Annealing Particle Swarm Optimization, respectively."

Trajectory planning is carried out by generating spiral waypoints, ensuring that each horizontal segment covers an equal area and facilitates smooth control. The adaptive particle swarm optimizer is used to tune the parameters of sliding surfaces and control laws, thus improving convergence and maintaining robust performance against dynamic parameter variations. The robustness and performance of the proposed controller were evaluated through simulation studies on different trajectories. Comparative analysis with advanced control strategies confirms the effectiveness of the OBSMC approach in achieving precise UAV trajectory tracking."

This challenge can be resolved with the output-sampled MPPI (oMPPI) approach, which first augments the system with its inverse to generate inputs that account for the system dynamics and achieve accurate output tracking, and second applies the standard MPPI approach to the augmented system with the inverse. The main contribution of this work is to show that optimality of MPPI is preserved with the oMPPI formulation when sampling the system’s reference outputs — rather than sampling the inputs as in standard MPPI. This theoretical development validates experimental improvements shown in prior work on oMPPI."

Denoising diffusion models have emerged as the state-of-the-art for this task. However, leading methods often rely on complex latent diffusion frameworks or resource-intensive cascaded pipelines that operate in pixel space. This creates a need for simpler, more direct architectures that are computationally efficient.This paper introduces 5DVFI, a novel VFI method that utilizes a single, non-cascaded 3D U-Net architecture operating entirely in pixel space. This design prioritizes architectural simplicity and direct spatio-temporal modeling to provide an accessible alternative. Trained and evaluated under significant resource constraints, including a low training resolution (192p), the model does not yet match the perceptual metrics of state-of-the-art systems. However, it demonstrates exceptional efficiency, with an approximately 8x smaller parameter count (56M) and significantly faster inference speed compared to leading latent diffusion models. As a proof-of-concept, it establishes that lightweight, direct pixel-space diffusion models are a viable and promising direction for developing efficient VFI solutions."

    "abstract": "Fluctuations in electricity demand between peak and off-peak periods create significant challenges for modern power grids, including reduced operational efficiency, decreased reliability, and an increased risk of power outages. Peak demand conditions strain the transmission and distribution systems, while off-peak underutilization leads to inefficient resource allocation. This study proposes a machine learning–based dynamic subsidy and penalty framework to minimize demand fluctuations and enhance grid stability. Historical electricity consumption data are analyzed to identify peak and off-peak periods, and machine learning techniques are applied to forecast future demand with improved accuracy. Based on these forecasts, a real-time tariff adjustment scheme is designed, wherein subsidies are introduced during off-peak hours to encourage higher consumption, and penalties are applied during peak hours to discourage excessive demand. Additionally, the proposed approach is expected to smoothen the load curve, reduce grid stress during peak periods, and improve utilization of infrastructure during the off-peak periods. By influencing consumer behavior through adaptive pricing, the framework ensures an effective demand-side management strategy that enhances system reliability, stability, and efficiency in smart grid environments compared with existing approaches."

    "abstract": "To meet the growing electric vehicle (EV) charging demand, fast charging stations based on novel DC architecture are being widely deployed. However, the increasing number and expanding scale of EV fast charging stations introduce significant uncertainties and fluctuations, which can cause substantial disturbances to the power grid. It is necessary to design energy scheduling strategies that optimize system operation, achieving both load fluctuation mitigation and optimal economic efficiency. This paper proposes an innovative flexible energy scheduling strategy tailored for EV fast charging stations, utilizing a power forecasting model to reduce the uncertainty of scheduling and incorporating vehicle-to-grid (V2G) capabilities of EVs to reduce overall costs. An Informer forecasting model is developed to realize multi-timescale unified forecasting encompassing photovoltaic (PV) generation and EV loads with lower computing costs. On the other hand, the proposed method incorporates a certain proportion of EVs and flexible loads as virtual energy storage in system scheduling, thereby further optimizing operating costs. Finally, verification results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves high forecasting accuracy and significant cost reduction, thereby realizing optimized scheduling for EV fast-charging stations."

    "abstract": "To tackle the safety challenges encountered by small fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) operating in complex environments, we propose a deep learning model that integrates a temporal self-attention mechanism with a long short-term memory (LSTM) network for high-precision fault detection. The proposed method exploits the self-attention mechanism to explicitly capture long-range dependencies within sequential sensor data, while the LSTM network extracts dynamic temporal features, thereby enhancing the discriminative capability of fault types. Experimental results on real flight datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves over 97% accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, significantly outperforming conventional machine learning methods such as support vector machines. Moreover, ablation studies validate the effectiveness of integrating LSTM and self-attention, showing that the model substantially enhances robustness and performance in fault detection, thereby providing reliable technical support for the safe operation of small fixed-wing UAVs."

    "abstract": "Head pose estimation (HPE) is essential for understanding human behavior, bolstering interactions between humans and computers, and enhancing surveillance systems for safety. Fisheye lens, with its extensive field of view, outperforms the conventional perspective lens in applications that demand a broad visual scope. However, this advantage comes with significant image distortion, which may lead to the loss of crucial facial feature data and alterations in the relative positions of these features. This paper introduces a distortion-aware approach that jointly learns coarse- and fine-level distortion representations to enhance head-orientation estimation accuracy in fisheye image. Specifically, we design a distortion-aware branch to perceive coarse-grained distortion features by learning the position of the head center in the fisheye image. At the same time, the fine-grained distortion features of the head region are modeled by the coordinated attention. The proposed approach was benchmarked on fisheye-distorted variants of three widely used head-pose corpora: BIWI, 300W-LP, and AFLW2000. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches. Compared with the suboptimal method, our model achieves a 7.4% and 9.7% decrease in MAE on the AFLW2000-360 and BIWI-360 datasets, respectively."

The method separates the Standby and Backup modes based on the static switch status of the UPS and constructs corresponding augmented state-space models for each mode. Utilizing observable functions, the input-output data matrices are built. The finite-dimensional approximation of the Koopman operator is then solved via an optimization problem formulated using the extended dynamic mode decomposition principle. Subsequently, mode-dependent Koopman predictors are constructed for both operational modes. Based on these predictors, mode-specific Koopman predictive controllers are designed. The control law for each mode is generated in real-time by solving a quadratic programming problem. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in regulating the series-parallel converters of the UPS to mitigate various types of power quality issues."

    "abstract": "A catalytic machine is a space-bounded Turing machine with additional access to a second, much larger work tape, with the caveat that this tape is full, and its contents must be preserved by the computation. Catalytic machines were defined by Buhrman et al. (STOC 2014), who, alongside many follow-up works, exhibited the power of catalytic space (CSPACE) and, in particular, catalytic logspace machines (CL) beyond that of traditional space-bounded machines. Several variants of CL have been proposed, including nondeterministic and co-non-deterministic catalytic computation by Buhrman et al. (STACS 2016) and randomized catalytic computation by Datta et al. (CSR 2020). These and other works proposed several questions, such as catalytic analogues of the theorems of Savitch and Immerman and Szelepcsényi. Catalytic computation was recently derandomized by Cook et al. (STOC 2025), but only in certain parameter regimes. We settle almost all questions regarding randomized and nondeterministic catalytic computation by giving an optimal reduction from catalytic space with additional resources to the corresponding non-catalytic space classes. With regards to non-determinism, our main result is that CL = CNL and with regards to randomness we show CL = CPrL where CPrL denotes randomized catalytic logspace where the accepting probability can be arbitrarily close to 1/2. We also have a number of near-optimal partial results for non-deterministic and randomized catalytic computation with less catalytic space. We show catalytic versions of Savitch’s theorem, Immerman-Szelepscényi, and the derandomization results of Nisan and Saks and Zhou, all of which are unconditional and hold for all parameter settings. Our results build on the compress-or-compute framework of Cook et al. (STOC 2025). Despite proving broader and stronger results, our framework is simpler and more modular."

    "abstract": "In complexity theory, gap-preserving reductions play a crucial role in studying hardness of approximation and in analyzing the relative complexity of multiprover interactive proof systems. In the quantum setting, multiprover interactive proof systems with entangled provers correspond to gapped promise problems for nonlocal games, and the recent result MIP*=RE [1] shows that these are in general undecidable. However, the relative complexity of problems within MIP* is still not well-understood, as establishing gap-preserving reductions in the quantum setting presents new challenges. In this paper, we introduce a framework to study such reductions and use it to establish MIP*-completeness of the gapped promise problem for the natural class of independent set games. In such a game, the goal is to determine whether a given graph contains an independent set of a specified size. We construct families of independent set games with constant question size for which the gapped promise problem is undecidable. In contrast, the same problem is decidable in polynomial time in the classical setting. To carry out our reduction, we establish a new stability theorem, which could be of independent interest, allowing us to perturb families of aThis is a striking phenomenlmost PVMs to genuine PVMs."

    "abstract": "With the growing availability of digital content, the demand for efficient plagiarism detection has become exponentially high. The major challenge here is detecting semantic similarity and paraphrased text since traditional keywordmatching algorithms tend to fail in detecting conceptual rewording. This paper introduces an NLP-based plagiarism detection system that performs automated text extraction, comparison, and similarity analysis for scholarly and professional writings. The system supports uploading PDFs, extracting text data, and evaluating possible plagiarism using TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity. For better accuracy, it cross-checks extracted text with web sources via Google's Custom Search API. The method combines text preprocessing, feature extraction, and similarity measurement to provide a more accurate textual overlap evaluation. Based on a Flask-based framework, the system provides a user-friendly interface for effortless document analysis and result visualization. Addressing the shortcomings of conventional plagiarism detection techniques, this work sets the stage for further enhancements based on deep learning methodologies to enhance identification of subtle textual similarities. This work advances the development of automated plagiarism detection with a scalable and effective solution for content integrity validation. The contribution of this work is combining NLP similarity analysis with real-time web verification through the Google Custom Search API and the provision of a scalable Flask-based interface to detect plagiarism. The combination embodies current NLP methods and real-world deployment, thereby making the system both useful and usable by professionals and academics."

Primarily, to prevent the faulty unmanned helicopter from affecting other normal individuals, an upperlayer virtual agent system prescribed-time control protocol is developed based on the fully actuated system approach. Simultaneously, the artificial potential field is incorporated into the control protocol to establish a hierarchical interaction mechanism, enabling collision avoidance during flight missions. Subsequently, the newly presented prescribed-time sliding mode controller can enable the position subsystem to track the reference signals within the designer-defined time. In addition, a prescribed-time filter is constructed to generate the derivative of the attitude angle. Building upon this filter, the event-triggered mechanism, and fully actuated system approach, a prescribed-time fault-tolerant control tactic for the attitude subsystem is established to reduce the signal transmission burden. Finally, the theoretical results of the proposed control strategy are validated through a simulation example and a comparative experiment."

    "abstract": "On the way to attain energy security and mitigate the climate change related issues, many countries are shifting towards cleaner energy sources. Wind energy, in this regard, has become a promising resource due to its easy availability, cleaner production, and affordability. In studies of wind farm design and control, Wind Frequency Map (WFM) plays a crucial role for its direct involvement in the power calculations. WFM is a joint probability mapping between wind direction and speed considering their time series behavior. Limited amount of wind data, when used for forecasting as well as representing the WFMs, suppresses the ability to represent long term variabilities in wind. This leads to inaccurate estimation of WFM, which in turn results in unrealistic calculation of wind power, leading to non-optimal design and control. Hence, in this paper, Temporal Convolutional Neural Networks (TCNNs) are explored for accurate forecasting of WFMs. As determination of hyper-parameters are performed heuristically as a general practice, the novelty in the proposed formulation lies in determining these parameters through an optimization formulation while performing the network training simultaneously. Effectiveness of this approach, while developing realistic wind forecasting models, has been demonstrated further by showing its ability in accurate power calculations."

We propose a CPG– Muscle Synergy model that extracts muscle synergies from electromyography and classifies them into spinally driven and cortically driven modes based on activation timing. We use CPG synergy analysis to quantify their rhythmic characteristics and validate the classification with a temporal variability index, hypothesizing that spinal patterns are less variable than cortical ones. Our results confirmed significantly lower temporal variability in the spinally driven group. CPG analysis also revealed that spinal patterns had simpler structures with fewer activation peaks and distinct time–shift properties. These findings support a hierarchical control system where the spinal cord generates a stable, basal rhythm and the cortex provides complex, adaptive modulations. Our model provides a framework for evaluating these neural contributions, enabling a deeper understanding of gait pathologies and informing rehabilitation strategies."

    "abstract": "In the era of AI and cloud computing, customer data has become an integral part of modern business systems. As these data grow in volume and complexity, maintaining data quality, particularly managing duplicate records, remains a persistent challenge. Entity Resolution (ER) algorithms play a vital role in eliminating duplicates. However, developing, testing, and benchmarking these algorithms require large volumes of labeled data containing known duplicate records, which are rarely available in public datasets. The Synthetic Person Information Dataset for Entity Resolution (SPIDER) addresses this issue by providing 50,000 labeled person records, including 10,000 duplicates induced through seven rule-based transformations that simulate real-world duplicate variations. The dataset is available in JSON and CSV formats to ensure compatibility with standard software tools and includes a Python script for data generation to support reproducibility and extensibility. SPIDER offers a unified, person-level benchmark dataset with explicit duplicate lineage, advancing the capabilities of existing ER data-generation resources such as FEBRL and Magellan, and providing a reproducible foundation dataset for ER testing and evaluation."

This article designs an improved nonlinear disturbance observer-based command-filtered backstepping controller (INDOB-CFBSC) for EMB system, which tracks the clamping force using a clamping force estimator and effectively addresses the nonlinearity and uncertainty of the EMB system. Firstly, an EMB model including the torque motor, gearbox, flexibility-considered ball screw model, pressure-displacement relationship-considered clamping force model and friction is built. Particularly, a clamping force estimation method based on the extended least squares (ELS) is proposed, which transforms the clamping force tracking control into torque motor angular position tracking control. Then, a robust clamping force control strategy, INDOB-CDBSC, is proposed based on the command-filtered backstepping controller (CFBSC) and the improved nonlinear disturbance observer (INDOB). Finally, the test results under different operating conditions demonstrate that the INDOB-CDBSC strategy exhibits excellent tracking performance and robustness in the presence of nonlinearity and uncertainty in the EMB system."

CCAT features the 6-meter Fred Young Submillimeter Telescope (FYST), which will cover frequency bands from 210 GHz to 850 GHz using its first-generation science instrument, Prime-Cam. The detectors used in Prime-Cam are feedhorn-coupled, lumped-element superconducting microwave kinetic inductance detectors (KIDs). The telescope will perform wide-area surveys at speeds on the order of degrees per second. During telescope operation, the KIDs are exposed to changes in the magnetic field caused by the telescope's movement through Earth's magnetic field and internal sources within the telescope. We present and compare measurements of the magnetic sensitivity of three different CCAT KID designs at 100 mK. The measurements are conducted in a dilution refrigerator (DR) with a set of room temperature Helmholtz coils positioned around the DR.

    "abstract": "Designing an anthropomorphic robotic hand with few actuators while replicating the dexterous motion capabilities of the human hand remains a challenging problem. In this work, a kinematic synergy analysis method is proposed to identify joints with high motion independence and to quantify the synergistic motion characteristics of joints with strong motion dependence. Based on these findings, design principles for intra finger and inter-finger coupling–compliance mechanisms are developed, enabling the mechanical embodiment of joint kinematic synergies within and between fingers. Furthermore, a design principle for anthropomorphic robotic hands that reduces actuator count while retaining diverse motion functions is formulated. This principle is embodied in a 12-actuator, 21-joint prototype named SX-Hand, featuring a flexible thumb and an articulated palm. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that SX Hand achieves the maximum score in the Kapandji test, performs all 33 grasp types defined in the comprehensive GRASP taxonomy, and executes dexterous in-hand manipulations. The proposed approach provides an effective conceptual and technical route for reproducing rich motion functions with reduced actuation, offering valuable guidance for the development of efficient anthropomorphic robotic hands and other bionic systems."

This paper models occupant circadian state using four modalities: physiological, thermal, linguistic, and acoustic modalities. Moreover, it advances research by developing a fully non-contact pipeline to derive physiological signals from thermal imagery. Linguistic and acoustic features derived from speech are incorporated with the extracted physiological and thermal features to enhance circadian rhythm models and detect enervation states. The proposed approach leverages a multimodal dataset of 36 subjects captured across multiple channels. Comparative analysis between non-contact and contactbased channels reveals that physiological signals from thermal imagery, combined with linguistic and acoustic data, achieve accuracy comparable to or exceeding those of contact-based methods. This non-contact approach achieves accurate identification of energized versus enervated states, reaching 78.6% accuracy. These findings offer a novel framework for integrating unobtrusive sensing technologies in future automotive designs, facilitating next-generation occupant monitoring."

    "abstract": "Rydberg atoms enable ultrasensitive microwave detection through their exceptional polarizability, but their use as decoders in communications is limited by a scarcity of scalable frequency points, which arises from cross-modulation in multifrequency fields and narrow operational bandwidth of the sensor. This work introduces a digital communication framework that integrates orbital angular momentum (OAM) with frequency-division multiplexing (FDM). By mapping each FDM subcarrier to a distinct OAM, we construct a 2-D multiplexing space that combines the spectral dimension of FDM with the spatial-phase dimension of OAM. As a result, the theoretical channel capacity scales as the product of the capacities attainable in each individual dimension, thereby overcoming the inherent limit of conventional single-dimensional multiplexing. OAM features are mapped to Rydberg electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) spectra through quadrupole-gradient coupling, enabling simultaneous OAM identification and FDM demodulation using spectral templates, without separate detectors.

In this algorithm, each feature is associated with its own hyperparameter, which has traditionally been optimized in isolation. We show that jointly optimizing all parameters over the feature space leads to better performance due to the existence of multiple local optima. Furthermore, while independent tuning is more susceptible to the influence of outliers, joint optimization reduces these effects. We also introduce regularization and compare three approaches: independent optimization, joint optimization, and joint optimization with regularization. This combined method not only mitigates overfitting and enhances robustness against noise but also reduces computation by significantly narrowing the search space."

    "abstract": "Inverter-based resources (IBRs) are an intermittent source of energy, and their increased integration into power systems significantly reduces the physical inertia provided by synchronous generators, which account for about 20 % of gas emissions. This solution to global warming has created a problem of inertia response for the power system. The adequate control of these IBRs to provide virtual inertia should consider their percentage contribution capacity and existing grid energy storage, which are mostly battery energy storage systems (BESS). However, conventional control methods often fail to account for these critical features. This omission exacerbates the challenge of maintaining frequency stability in low-inertia grids, particularly in developing countries where centralized control architectures may be costly or impractical. This paper proposes a Hybrid Distributed Model Predictive Control (HD-MPC) strategy to coordinate 15 units of 100 kW flywheel energy storage systems (FESS) and 500 kW BESS, respectively, for virtual inertia support and fast frequency response in a two-area load frequency control (2A-LFC) system. The distributed framework enables each local area to operate semi-independently, thereby reducing communication burdens and enhancing resilience against delays or failures. Simulation results on MATLAB/SIMULINK of a 30 MW 2A-LFC model demonstrate that, in the event of 1 MW disturbances, the proposed HD-MPC approach outperforms conventional centralized MPC and uncontrolled cases by improving frequency nadir, reducing tie-line oscillations, and ensuring efficient BESS utilization. The results and validation of the mathematical model coding using Python highlight the viability of hybrid FESS–BESS coordination to improve frequency stability in inverter-dominated power systems, offering a scalable and practical solution for developing countries transitioning to IBR-dominated grids."

    "abstract": "Cloud-based DSS are critical for data-intensive decision-making but tremendously challenged by issues of scalability, security, and the optimization of resources. In general, optimization approaches such as GA, PSO, and ACO treat the problems of allocation and security enhancement of cloud resources very inadequately. Hence, the present work addresses developing a QIGA-based optimization framework for the performance optimization of cloud DSS. At its core, it utilizes quantum-like principles, such as superposition and probabilistic search, for resource optimization with respect to stability, security, and rapid convergence. Therefore, this underpinning framework comprises resource optimization, anomalous detection, and quantum-independent encryption through QIGA, which enhances the data security along with computational efficiency. The experimental results depict the performance efficiency of QIGA since its execution time, CPU, memory utilization requirements, and energy consumption are less while the task completion rate is higher and the security vulnerabilities are reduced in comparison to traditional optimization techniques. QIGA-based anomaly detection improves accuracy at the expense of response time, while its quantum-inspired encryption provides the best cryptographic security. Therefore, these results verify that QIGA is an efficient secured methodology for scalable cloud-controlled DSS, hence being a potential candidate for decision-making optimization in highly dynamic cloud environments."

The system automatically tracks the fluid level in the saline bottle using a load cell sensor and displays the status on an LCD.

However, these models are still very vulnerable to adversarial attacks where small changes can result in incorrect estimations ruining the precision of wireless networks. This paper offers an innovative way to reduce adversarial effects on deep learning-based channel estimation by the use of defensive distillation. Defensive distillation initially designed for increasing the robustness of neural networks, makes the models less prone to be affected by introducing a secondary model to be trained with softened outputs of primary model. Carrying out numerous simulations, we estimate the effectiveness of the proposed method in different attack scenarios, showing substantial improvements in accuracy and robustness as compared to standard models. Based on our results, we can conclude that the defensive distillation can be effectively implemented in the channel estimation schemes, strongly increasing the robustness against the adversarial interference facilitating a viable road to reliable and secure wireless connectivity."

Considering above issues, this study presents a vision-based approach that utilizes depth camera data to detect drunken individuals through gait analysis while maintaining passenger privacy. The Intel® RealSense™ D435i depth camera was employed to capture three-dimensional point cloud data, which were processed using DBSCAN clustering to isolate human figures and voxel downsampling to reduce data density. The refined 3D representations were converted into two-dimensional gait images and classified using a fine-tuned MobileNetV2 network pretrained on ImageNet weights. The proposed model achieved 97% accuracy and averages of 0.97 for precision, recall, and F1-score. The results demonstrate that the system provides high detection accuracy, reliable generalization, and enhanced privacy protection, suggesting its potential as a practical tool for real time safety monitoring on railway platforms."

This study proposes a day-type segmented forecasting approach, where two Multi-Head Attention Long Short-Term Memory (MHA-LSTM) models are independently trained on weekday and weekend data. This design is motivated by the clear differences in load patterns across day types, such as regular weekday peaks driven by commuting routines versus the more erratic weekend profiles. Modeling them jointly may obscure such trends and degrade scheduling outcomes. To further enhance trend recognition, a Load Relative Magnitude (LRM) feature is introduced, allowing the model to focus on deviations from daily averages. Results demonstrate that the segmented models consistently yield lower V2G-SVE scores, validating the benefit of day-type-specific modeling in improving practical V2G scheduling performance."

    "abstract": "Despite its tendency to fracture, concrete is frequently employed in the building industry. The stuff is fairly priced and accessible. As a consequence, self-healing materials have gained popularity over the past two decades, particularly those built from environmentally benign, sustainable concrete. Each research centre employs its own testing procedures to assess the efficacy of medicine, making it difficult to find the optimum approach. Self-healing concrete (SHC) distinguishes itself by its ability to mend itself and the reduced need for external assistance in recognising and repairing internal damage, including fractures. This technique not only improves durability but also reduces concrete degradation and reinforcing corrosion, resulting in cost savings. This research provides a comprehensive examination of SHCs while taking into consideration self-healing strategies and efficacy. The literature review reveals several application-based self-healing concrete systems. The most efficient method for determining the optimum self-healing strategy is to compare three distinct algorithms: the Multi-Criteria Decision Making Tool (MCDM), the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), and the Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process. Compared to the AHP methodology, the FAHP method produces more accurate and reliable results. Out of the five factors used to determine the best strategy, the Ease of Availability score received the highest rating, while the Performance Time meter received the lowest. The microbe-based technique ranks second, while the compound-based approach is the most essential of the four. Avoid using natural self-healing at any cost. Furthermore, we emphasise the strengths and areas for development of SHC, along with potential future applications and research avenues for further examination."

The application provides users with comprehensive information about popular Indian beaches, including current environmental conditions such as temperature, atmospheric pressure, and tidal heights. Initially, users receive an SMS outlining the safety conditions of a selected beach, and if hazardous conditions arise, automated alerts are sent. Additionally, the platform suggests nearby beaches and allows users to rate their experiences, further informing future visitors."

    "abstract": "Assessing the trustworthiness of network elements, including devices, communication links, and end-to-end paths, is critical for building secure and reliable networks. However, the heterogeneity of these components and the dynamic nature of their security states make trust assessment in large-scale networks highly challenging. This paper presents a configurable end-to-end network trustworthiness assessment scheme featuring a hierarchical, life-cycle-based architecture for evaluating trust from initial network deployment through long-term operation to retirement. In the proposed scheme, trustworthiness is assessed at three levels: device, link, and path. At the device level, a Dempster-Shafer evidence theory-based model integrates multi-dimensional trust attributes to quantify each device’s trustworthiness. At the link level, a dynamic multi-attribute model combines static and dynamic trust attributes and employs a clustering algorithm to calculate link trust scores. At the path level, a distributed fusion-based model uses fuzzy logic to evaluate end-to-end path trust by aggregating the trust levels of constituent devices and links. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme significantly improves both the accuracy and efficiency of trustworthiness assessment in large-scale networks."

    "abstract": "Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have recently demonstrated strong multimodal understanding, yet their fine-grained visual perception is often constrained by low input resolutions. A common remedy is to partition high-resolution images into multiple sub-images for separate encoding, but this approach drastically inflates the number of visual tokens and introduces prohibitive inference overhead. To overcome this challenge, we propose Pyramid Token Pruning (PTP), a training-free strategy that hierarchically integrates bottom-up visual saliency at both region and token levels with top-down instruction-guided relevance. Inspired by human visual cognition, PTP selectively preserves more tokens from salient regions while further emphasizing those most relevant to task instructions. Extensive experiments on 13 diverse benchmarks show that PTP substantially reduces computational cost, memory usage, and inference latency, with negligible performance degradation."

    "abstract": "Deep learning based face-swap videos, widely known as deepfakes, have drawn wide attention due to their threat to information credibility. Recent works mainly focus on the problem of deepfake detection that aims to reliably tell deepfakes apart from real ones, in an objective way. On the other hand, the subjective perception of deepfakes, especially its computational modeling and imitation, is also a significant problem but lacks adequate study. In this paper, we focus on the photorealism assessment of deepfakes, which is defined as the automatic assessment of deepfake photorealism that approximates human perception of deepfakes. It is important for evaluating the quality and deceptiveness of deepfakes which can be used for predicting the influence of deepfakes on Internet, and it also has potentials in improving the deepfake generation process by serving as a critic. This paper promotes this new direction by presenting a comprehensive benchmark called DREAM, which stands for Deepfake photoREalism AssessMent. It is comprised of a deepfake video dataset of diverse quality, a large scale annotation that includes 140,000 photorealism scores and textual descriptions obtained from 3,500 human annotators, and a comprehensive evaluation and analysis of 18 representative photorealism assessment methods, including recent large vision language model based methods and a newly proposed description-aligned CLIP method. The benchmark and insights included in this study can lay the foundation for future research in this direction and other related areas.

    "abstract": "In single DC-link current sensor control for permanent magnet synchronous motor drives, a sampling delay error (SDE) inherently exists due to the discrepancy between the sampling instants of the reconstructed phase currents and the ideal phase currents, which degrades current accuracy. The method of suppressing the SDE by calculating the online current slopes not only requires intensive computation but also depends on the accuracy of system parameters and the durations of voltage vectors. This article analytically demonstrates that the SDE exhibits a periodic disturbance correlated with the stator electrical frequency. Accordingly, an SDE suppression method based on a resonant extended state observer (RESO) is proposed without the need to calculate the current slopes. To address the resonance phenomenon in the conventional quasi-RESO (QRESO) caused by the coupling between disturbance attenuation capability and observer bandwidth, an improved RESO is proposed by redesigning QRESO while considering the quality factor that characterizes the frequency selection capability. Experimental results verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method."

These branches are integrated by an Interactive Multi-Scale Convolution (IMSConv) unit to enhance spatial context and feature diversity. In addition, an Enhanced Iterative Multi-Distillation (EIMD) module is designed to progressively distill and refine informative features through lightweight attention and spatial enhancement. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that SFPN achieves state-of-the-art performance in both PSNR and SSIM."

    "abstract": "Research on lane change prediction has gained a lot of momentum in the last couple of years. However, most research is confined to simulation or results obtained from datasets, leaving a gap between algorithmic advances and on-road deployment. This work closes that gap by demonstrating, on real hardware, a lane-change prediction system based on Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KGEs) and Bayesian inference. Moreover, the ego-vehicle employs a longitudinal braking action to ensure the safety of both itself and the surrounding vehicles. Our architecture consists of two modules: (i) a perception module that senses the environment, derives input numerical features, and converts them into linguistic categories; and communicates them to the prediction module; (ii) a pretrained prediction module that executes a KGE and Bayesian inference model to anticipate the target vehicle’s maneuver and transforms the prediction into longitudinal braking action. Real-world hardware experimental validation demonstrates that our prediction system anticipates the target vehicle’s lane change three to four seconds in advance, providing the ego vehicle sufficient time to react and allowing the target vehicle to make the lane change safely."

This paper presents a novel approach for their safety verification based on systematic situation extraction, probabilistic modelling and verification. We build upon the concept of a situation coverage grid, which exhaustively enumerates environmental configurations relevant to the vehicle’s operation. This grid is augmented with quantitative probabilistic data collected from situation-based system testing, capturing probabilistic transitions between situations. We then generate a probabilistic model that encodes the dynamics of both normal and unsafe system behaviour. Safety properties extracted from hazard analysis and formalised in temporal logic are verified through probabilistic model checking against this model. The results demonstrate that our approach effectively identifies high-risk situations, provides quantitative safety guarantees, and supports compliance with regulatory standards, thereby contributing to the robust deployment of autonomous systems."

    "abstract": "Maximal Independent Set (MIS) and Maximal Matching (MM) play a vital role in distributed symmetry breaking. Despite decades of research, the complexity of both problems in the standard LOCAL model remains unresolved, and several gaps between the best-known upper and lower bounds persist. For n-node graphs with maximum degree $\\Delta$, the best current upper bound for randomized algorithms is $O(\\log \\Delta+\\operatorname{poly}(\\log \\log n))$, shown by Barenboim, Elkin, Pettie, and Schneider for MM [FOCS’12, JACM’16], and by Ghaffari for MIS [SODA’16]. On the other hand, the best-known lower bound for the two problems is $\\Omega\\left(\\min \\left\\{\\sqrt{\\frac{\\log n}{\\log \\log n}}, \\frac{\\log \\Delta}{\\log \\log \\Delta}\\right\\}\\right)$, shown by Kuhn, Moscibroda, and Wattenhofer [PODC’04, JACM’16].In this work, we present an $\\Omega(\\min \\{\\log \\Delta, \\sqrt{\\log n}\\})$ lower bound for MM in $\\Delta$-ary trees against randomized algorithms. By a folklore reduction, the same lower bound applies to MIS, albeit not in trees. As a function of n, this is the first advancement in our understanding of the randomized complexity of the two problems in more than two decades. As a function of $\\Delta$, this shows that the current upper bounds are optimal for a wide range of $\\Delta \\in 2^{O(\\sqrt{\\log n})}$, answering an open question by Balliu, Brandt, Hirvonen, Olivetti, Rabie, and Suomela [FOCS’19, JACM’21].Moreover, our result implies a surprising and counterintuitive separation between MIS and MM in trees, as it was very recently shown that MIS in trees can be solved in $o(\\sqrt{\\log n})$ rounds. While MIS can be used to find an MM in general graphs, the reduction does not preserve the tree structure when applied to trees. Our separation shows that this is not an artifact of the reduction, but a fundamental difference between the two problems in trees. This also implies that MIS is strictly harder in general graphs compared to trees.Our main technical contribution is a novel technique in which we show that there is a self-reduction from a matching problem in r rounds to the same matching problem in r-1rounds (with slightly weaker probabilistic guarantees). Conceptually, this resembles the celebrated round elimination technique, which transforms an r-round algorithm for a problem $\\Pi$ into an (r-1)round algorithm for a different problem $\\Pi^{\\prime}$. However, our proof differs significantly from the round elimination framework in several fundamental aspects. One of the key concepts we analyze in achieving our result is vertex survival probability, where we show that after $r \\ll \\min \\{\\log \\Delta, \\sqrt{\\log n}\\}$ rounds, any algorithm that finds a matching must leave two surviving unmatched nodes that are adjacent."

    "abstract": "The recent successes of large language models (LLMs) have led to a surge of theoretical research into the properties of language generation. A recent line of work has proposed an abstract view of the question — called language generation in the limit — in which we view language generation as a game played between an adversary and an algorithm: the adversary generates strings from an unknown language K, known only to come from a countable collection of candidate languages, and after observing a finite set of these strings, the algorithm must generate new strings from the language K that it hasn't seen before. This formalism highlights an important tension: the trade-off between validity (that the algorithm should only produce strings that come from the language) and breadth (that the algorithm should be able to produce \"many\" strings from the language). This validity-breadth trade-off is a central issue in applied work on language generation as well, where it arises in the balance between hallucination, when models generate invalid utterances, and mode collapse, when models only generate from a very restricted set of feasible outputs. Despite its importance, this trade-off has been challenging to study quantitatively.In this work we develop ways of quantifying this trade-off, by formalizing the notion of breadth through measures of density. Roughly speaking, the density of one language L in another language L' is the limiting fraction of strings from L among the strings of L', where we take the limit over longer and longer finite prefixes of L'. Existing algorithms for language generation in the limit produce output sets that can have zero density in the true language K, in this asymptotic sense, and this represents an important failure of breadth that might seem necessary in any solution to the problem. We show here that such a failure is not in fact necessary: we provide an algorithm for language generation in the limit whose outputs have strictly positive density in the true language K. We also study the internal representations built by algorithms for this problem — the sequence of hypothesized candidate languages they iterate through as they perform generation — showing a precise sense in which the strongest form of breadth achievable is one that may need to \"oscillate\" indefinitely between hypothesized representations of high density and low density. Our analysis introduces a novel topology on language families, with notions of convergence and limit points in this topology playing a key role in the analysis."

Area-time product (ATP) and scalability are two critical metrics for evaluating accelerator designs. Different cryptographic backgrounds have different security parameters, and the diverse application platforms lead to different cost-performance tradeoffs and hardware constraints. We propose a flexible NTT accelerator design framework for LBC to meet the demand for performance and scalability, supporting various polynomial degrees, moduli, radices, and parallelism. Our hardware implementations show excellent ATP efficiency, with our interconnect achieving up to $6.7 \\times$ better LUT-ATP than other in-place designs under the same configuration. In-place computation demands complex memory access patterns, making the design for varying radices and parallelism tough. We propose an efficient, conflict-free memory mapping scheme that offers scalability for different configurations. Compared to other in-place architectures, our approach significantly reduces interconnect complexity. On average, the accelerators generated by our proposed framework are 65.1% more area-time efficient. Up to 34.9% area-time reduction over the state-of-the-art scalable NTT accelerator can be achieved for the same security parameters."

    "abstract": "Finding sparse vectors is a fundamental problem that arises in several contexts including codes, subspaces, and lattices. In this work, we prove strong inapproximability results for all these variants using a novel approach that even bypasses the PCP theorem. Our main result is that it is NP-hard (under randomized reductions) to approximate the sparsest vector in a real subspace within any constant factor; the gap can be further amplified using tensoring. Our reduction has the property that there is a Boolean solution in the completeness case. As a corollary, this immediately recovers the state-of-the-art inapproximability factors for the shortest vector problem (SVP) on lattices. Our proof extends the range of $\\mathbf{l}_{\\_} \\mathbf{p}$ (quasi) norms for which hardness was previously known, from ‘p at least one’ to ‘p at least zero’, answering a question raised by (Khot, JACM 2005).Previous hardness results for SVP, and the related minimum distance problem (MDP) for error-correcting codes, all use lattice/coding gadgets that have an abundance of codewords in a ball of radius smaller than the minimum distance. In contrast, our reduction only needs many codewords in a ball of radius slightly larger than the minimum distance. This enables an easy derandomization of our reduction for finite fields, giving a new elementary proof of deterministic hardness for MDP. We believe this weaker density requirement might offer a promising approach to showing deterministic hardness of SVP, a long elusive goal. The key technical ingredient underlying our result for real subspaces is a proof that in the kernel of a random Rademacher matrix, the support of any two linearly independent vectors have very little overlap.A broader motivation behind this work is the development of inapproximability techniques for problems over the reals. Analytic variants of sparsest vector have connections to small set expansion, quantum separability and polynomial maximization over convex sets, all of which appear to be out of reach of current PCP techniques. We hope that the approach we develop could enable progress on some of these problems."

    "abstract": "Aiming at the problems of insufficient tracking accuracy in automatic power generation control, frequent battery actions and discrete array charge states in the battery array-thermoelectric power system under the background of \"double carbon\" and high proportion of new energy grid-connectedness, we have studied a three-layer optimisation control strategy for the hybrid lithium titanate battery and lithium iron phosphate battery energy storage arrays to cooperate with thermoelectric power generators to participate in the secondary frequency regulation of the power grid. control strategy. The upper layer of the strategy uses wavelet packet decomposition to obtain the power command of thermal power and energy storage system, and then the middle layer evaluates the array frequency regulation capability and selects the least number of arrays to participate in frequency regulation, and the lower layer uses the fuzzy control based variable weight jellyfish search algorithm to improve the consistency of the charging state and reduce the frequent battery actions while ensuring the power following of the arrays. Finally, a simulation study is carried out based on the automatic power generation control instructions and the actual configuration of hybrid energy storage in a power plant in Zhejiang Province during a typical daytime period, and the research results show that the strategy in this paper improves the tracking accuracy and response speed of the combined fire-storage system, and the consistency of the charge state of the storage array is significantly improved, which reflects a good engineering implementability and generalisability."

    "abstract": "Haptic feedback is crucial for enhancing realism and immersion in XR applications, yet current implementations often lack consistency across devices and interaction types. In this paper, we propose a universal approach for designing real-time haptic feedback in the Meta Quest ecosystem, based on a modular architecture and an interaction- driven rule. Our key insight is that the timing of haptic feedback should depend on the semantics of interaction: feedback should be triggered upon physical contact if the object does not change its state, and upon state change otherwise. We implemented this principle in Unity using a layered architecture that decouples hand logic, application logic, and glove-specific hardware control. The framework supports both custom-built (Haptic CeTI Glove) and commercial (TactGlove DK2) gloves and has been validated in two XR applications: a juggling simulator and a latency testing interface. Our results demonstrate how architecture- level abstraction enables reusability and extensibility across use cases, while user testing highlights the importance of latency in perceived realism. The proposed rule provides a practical guideline for developers aiming to design intuitive and consistent haptic experiences in XR."

    "abstract": "The Gut microbiome analysis consider as a diagnostic and precision medicine tool for life style and gastrointestinal diseases. The accurate analysis of gut microbiota composition is dependent on the stability and integrity of the stool sample right from the point of collection to the downstream processing (sequencing). Post collection variables, such as storage conditions, preservation strategies are said to influence the structure of microbial community and also influence the diversity profiles. This will lead to hinderance in the reliability of microbiome studies. This study puts forth an evaluation of the functionality of two common preservation strategies with respect to stool sample collection- first is cold storage and second is the buffer based chemical preservation. The influence of these methods on the stability of gut microbiota profiles is analyzed with the help of metagenomic approach. The stool samples were collected from healthy individuals and preserved under both cold storage and buffered conditions, before proceeding towards DNA extraction and sequencing. For analyzing the diversity of the microbiome profile, Alpha diversity was computed to asses sample richness and evenness, between and within the samples. The study highlights the importance of selecting the optimal preservation strategy in order to maintain the fidelity and reproducibility of gut microbiome analysis."

A simple swap sequence for robot scheduling is introduced, supporting cyclic operations without disrupting priority wafer production. Necessary and sufficient conditions for scheduling CTs are provided for the first, along with the optimal PM configuration. An algorithm is developed for optimal cyclic scheduling.

    "abstract": "This paper presents an extension to the periodic autoencoder architecture for learning compact representations of locomotion gaits in legged robots. Unlike conventional time-series models that require storing full joint trajectories, our approach exploits the inherent periodicity of locomotion to encode motion patterns using a minimal set of Fourier parameters: frequency, amplitude, offset, and phase difference. The encoder-decoder framework employs 1D convolutional layers to transform high-dimensional joint angle sequences into low-dimensional latent embeddings, which are then decomposed via a differentiable Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) module. A carefully designed multi-term loss function enforces accurate trajectory reconstruction, sinusoidal consistency in the latent space, and consistency of Fourier parameters within each gait type. Experimental evaluation on the Loco-MuJoCo Unitree H1 dataset demonstrates that our method accurately reconstructs both walking and running gaits while significantly reducing storage requirements. The learned periodic representations effectively capture the coordination dynamics of legged locomotion and provide a compact foundation for efficient motion generation and control."

To mitigate the peak-to-valley disparity in electrical demand and enhance overall load profiling, a demand response (DR) scheme has been incorporated. The day-ahead scheduling model optimizes operational cost, emissions, and peak load using the NSGA-III algorithm. Electrical and natural gas network interactions are modeled through coupled power and gas flow analyses, including pressure drop effects. Uncertainties in renewable generation and load demand are handled via a scenario-based approach, with K-means clustering reducing 2000 scenarios to 30 for computational efficiency. Compared to MOSOA, the proposed method achieves superior performance, improving the energy efficiency index by 10.5% and reducing computation time. Results demonstrate enhanced system flexibility, reliability, and sustainability, highlighting the effectiveness of integrating P2G, storage technologies, and advanced optimization for robust IES management."

This study proposes a clinically practical rule to guide postoperative imaging decisions with improved efficiency and clarity. Leveraging a retrospective dataset of 25,113 ureteroscopy cases, we applied LASSO regression for feature selection, SMOTE to address class imbalance, and inverse probability weighting to mitigate bias from missing data. A decision tree constructed using four accessible predictors achieved a specificity of 85.9% and sensitivity of 24.1%, reducing imaging rates from 45.3% to approximately 15%. The proposed model demonstrates potential to improve imaging stewardship by supporting risk-stratified decision-making in postoperative care."

    "abstract": "this paper presents a novel machine learning–based framework for simultaneous fault detection, fault time estimation, and recovery time prediction in microgrids and active distribution networks. Leveraging the time–frequency localization properties of the Wavelet Transform, the proposed method extracts discriminative features from voltage and current signals to train supervised learning models capable of identifying network topology changes—specifically, the presence or absence of faults—and accurately estimating the precise instants of fault inception and subsequent system recovery. By relying solely on electrical signal measurements at strategic points in the network, the approach eliminates the dependency on extensive sensor infrastructure for topology monitoring, thereby significantly reducing capital and maintenance costs associated with conventional protection schemes. The methodology is validated using high-fidelity time-domain simulation of the ANSI 4-node distribution test system, where synthetic fault and recovery events are generated in ETAP (Electrical Transient Analyzer Program). Comparative experiments on a number of machine learning algorithms including support vector machines, random forests, and gradient-boosted decision trees demonstrate that the proposed pipeline achieves high accuracy in both fault classification and temporal localization, with sub-cycle accuracy in fault timing and good performance under different load conditions, fault types, and grid configurations. The results point to the potential of integrating signal processing with data-driven approaches for enhancing the resilience, automation, and self-healing capabilities of modern smart distribution systems."

Initially, all the three parameters of controller are tuned using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm separately. Furthermore, to achieve additional performance improvement, two parameters are retuned while keeping (K<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">p</inf>) fixed as obtained from the PSO algorithm. This refinement is carried out using the all stability region (ASR) method which is a graphical tuning technique that utilizes the concept of root crossing boundaries. Controller settings are obtained by computing the centroid of triangle inscribed in all stability region in the plane of controller parameters for stable plants with and without time delay. Obtained results demonstrate that idea of retuning based on combining PSO algorithm with all stability region method significantly enhances the performance of system as compared to recently reported strategies. The usefulness of the proposed tuning strategies is demonstrated by simulation study conducted on different classes of stable processes."

To reduce the actuator mechanical wear and enhance the system antiinterference capability, a hybrid threshold event-triggered control method is designed via the integration of a robust neural damping technique. This strategy dynamically adjusts the triggering thresholds during the transient response phase while maintaining fixed thresholds during the steady-state response phase. Moreover, the error transformation technique is incorporated to rigorously confine the output errors within predefined boundaries, effectively guaranteeing the tracking precision of the developed closed-loop control system in the navigation-constrained hazardous maritime zones. Through Lyapunov stability analysis, the semiglobal uniform ultimate bounded (SGUUB) convergence behavior of this system is validated. Ultimately, both the comparative simulation and physical experiment are conducted to demonstrate the superior performance and practical viability of the proposed algorithm."

However, the complex, dynamic, and nonstationary nature of GUR severely undermines the reliability of time-domain features, increases the risk of spurious regression, and reduces the efficiency of current deep-learning models. To address these challenges, this article presents a frequency-guided online sequential learning framework. The proposed framework incorporates a dual-layer feature extraction strategy designed to capture the underlying variation trends of GUR, which integrates multiscale dilated convolution and supervised principal component analysis to extract cross-frequency and multiresolution interactions in the frequency domain and long-term temporal dependencies in the time domain, respectively. Subsequently, a new online sequential kernel-based random vector functional-link network learning architecture is presented, which utilizes the extracted frequency-domain features as privileged information during training, mitigating time-domain feature limitations and improving model generalization. Furthermore, an adaptive forgetting factor adaptively adjusts the sensitivity to dynamic conditions, while ensuring computational efficiency. Experimental outcomes validate the effectiveness of the proposed model in GUR prediction across various forecasting horizons."

The CT scan based representations are separated by using a U-net simulation, and the split representation is then used to train and analyze the data by using the v3 simulator, which helps to differentiate the coronavirus infection and pneumonia infection and securely protect the resulting documents."

    "abstract": "As a core component of the maritime Internet of Things (IoT), the Automatic Identification System (AIS) continuously collects dynamic vessel navigation data, providing a solid foundation for addressing complex maritime traffic prediction tasks that support intelligent Vessel Traffic Services (VTS), such as vessel trajectory prediction and vessel arrival time (VAT) estimation. However, existing methods typically focus on single prediction objectives, falling short of meeting practical multi-task requirements. To address this gap, this study proposes a geospatial grid-constrained deep learning framework based on AIS data to simultaneously handle three key prediction tasks: vessel trajectory prediction, whether the vessel arrives within the specified time, and VAT. The framework incorporates a dynamic patch construction method and a Graph Soft Evolution (GSE) module to capture temporal correlations among observations under spatial grid constraints. An encoder-decoder architecture is introduced, where the encoder employs a Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) block to adaptively select feature channels, and the decoder models dependencies across both variable and temporal dimensions. In a case study of New York Harbor, the model achieved an R² of 0.8386 and RMSE of 0.0329 for latitude increment prediction, and an R² of 0.8432 with RMSE of 0.0322 for longitude increment prediction. It also attained 99.83% accuracy in arrival status prediction and an R² of 0.9350 with RMSE of 0.0701 for VAT prediction. The framework demonstrated effectiveness in port scheduling and robust generalizability in cross-validation experiments at the Port of Los Angeles, thereby demonstrating its substantial potential to enhance the operational efficiency of VTS within maritime IoT systems."

    "abstract": "Linear time-varying (LTV) systems model radar scenes where each reflector/target applies a delay, Doppler shift and complex amplitude scaling to a transmitted waveform. The receiver processes the received signal using the transmitted signal as a reference. The self-ambiguity function of the transmitted signal captures the cross-correlation of delay and Doppler shifts of the transmitted waveform. It acts as a blur that limits resolution, at the receiver, of the delay and Doppler shifts of targets in close proximity. This paper considers resolution of multiple targets and compares performance of traditional chirp waveforms with the Zak-OTFS waveform. The self-ambiguity function of a chirp is a line in the delay-Doppler domain, whereas the self-ambiguity function of the Zak-OTFS waveform is a lattice. The advantage of lattices over lines is better localization, and we show lattices provide superior noise-free estimation of the range and velocity of multiple targets. When the delay spread of the radar scene is less than the delay period of the Zak-OTFS modulation, and the Doppler spread is less than the Doppler period, we describe how to localize targets by calculating cross-ambiguities in the delay-Doppler domain. We show that the signal processing complexity of our approach is superior to the traditional approach of computing cross-ambiguities in the continuous time / frequency domain."

To allow continuous power flow to the load despite intermittent nature of power line current magnitude, an energy storage unit (rechargeable battery) is integrated into the system via an additional secondary winding, creating an AC-coupled, isolated hybrid energy system with completely decoupled battery and load voltages. The D-AMEH simultaneously harvests the maximum power from the current-carrying conductor and feeds the load with constant power, letting the battery to seamlessly match the difference between harvested and consumed power. Analytical expressions for system currents and voltages are developed, followed by conversion losses estimation. The revealed findings are accurately supported by experiments, demonstrating close matching with corresponding analytical predictions."

    "abstract": "Point clouds generated by Structure from Motion (SfM) are often affected by significant noise caused by plant movement, as well as missing ground points caused by canopy occlusion. This reduces the quality of canopy and terrain extraction and makes it challenging to accurately estimate the height of crops from Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) images. To overcome these limitations, this study introduces a Density Consistency Filtering (DCF) algorithm, which adaptively models local density continuity to distinguish between valid points and noisy points. It effectively preserves local canopy structures while removing clustered noise. Furthermore, a color-spatial interpolation scheme based on ExG-RANSAC is developed to reconstruct missing ground points under dense canopies. Evaluated on six datasets from May to June 2019 covering key stages of winter wheat growth, the method achieved an RMSE of 7.7 cm, MAE of 6.2 cm, and R² of 0.91. After the early stem elongation stage, the method achieved an RMSE of 4.9 cm. The approach significantly improves estimation accuracy of the late growth stages, demonstrating strong potential for precision agriculture applications."

    "abstract": "The integration of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) with cell-free massive MIMO (CF mMIMO) represents a compelling paradigm for satisfying the stringent reliability and latency demands of ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC). In this framework, distributed access points (APs) provide substantial macro-diversity gains, while dynamically controllable RIS elements facilitate enhanced signal propagation. This paper investigates a practical RIS-aided CF mMIMO system designed for URLLC applications, where communications occur through RIS-reflected links under realistic spatially correlated Rayleigh fading channels, with practical impairments such as RIS phase estimation errors and electromagnetic interference explicitly considered. To evaluate reliability in the short-packet regime, we adopt the decoding error probability (DEP) as the performance metric and derive its analytical expression based on user-side SINR. We formulate a non-convex optimization problem to minimize the maximum DEP among users by jointly optimizing AP beamforming, RIS phase shifts, and blocklength allocation. A hybrid solution framework is proposed, combining deep reinforcement learning for continuous variables with a differential evolution (DE) algorithm for discrete blocklength optimization. Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method over alternating optimization and genetic algorithm (GA) baselines. Notably, increasing the number of AP antennas and transmission blocklength improves network availability, although gains saturate due to inter-user interference and diminishing returns. Moreover, the proposed DE-based algorithm for blocklength optimization consistently outperforms the GA method in terms of both solution quality and computational efficiency."

To overcome this, a reliable automated hydroponics system is proposed in this paper. The main purpose of this project is to use machine learning algorithms for predicting the various parameters required for agriculture, and the predicted output will be useful for increasing the productivity of the crop. The detection algorithms used in this application is Convolutional Neural Network and Naive Bayes. These algorithms are designed to predict sensor values and perform comparison analysis. The algorithms are compared against each other in terms of accuracy for calculating the output in a very accurate manner. The testing of these algorithms is to make the correct prediction and to determine the algorithm which performs better than the other.

    "abstract": "The traditional route optimization policies of the urban networks are focused on distance or temporal efficiency without considering the dynamic safety risks of accident-prone locations, which exposes motorists to high risks. The paper analyzes a technique that minimizes the travelling time and detects risk-aversive paths on urban road networks. The analysis uses official UK government traffic and accident data from 2015-2024 to estimate regional accident risk indices and combines these in a graph optimization framework based on OpenStreetMap (OSM) to produce routes under differing safety-time trade-offs. Findings indicate a strong positive correlation between growing traffic levels and accident risk indices. In high-risk areas like Kent, risk-sensitive routing algorithms produce significantly safer travel suggestions compared to traditional shortest path algorithms, while low-risk areas show no significant variations between applications. These results explain why risk-sensitive routing is important in urban settings and serve as a practical foundation for studying next-generation navigation systems and advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). The study acknowledges shortcomings including lack of temporal, weather and intersection-level details, suggesting future studies should include real-time environmental data."

    "abstract": "Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are expected to revolutionize transportation by improving efficiency and safety. Their success relies on 3D vision systems that effectively sense the environment and detect traffic agents. Among sensors AVs use to create a comprehensive view of surroundings, LiDAR provides high-resolution depth data enabling accurate object detection, safe navigation, and collision avoidance. However, collecting real-world LiDAR data is time-consuming and often affected by noise and sparsity due to adverse weather or sensor limitations. This work applies a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM), enhanced with novel noise scheduling and time-step embedding techniques to generate high-quality synthetic data for augmentation, thereby improving performance across a range of computer vision tasks, particularly in AV perception. These modifications impact the denoising process and the model’s temporal awareness, allowing it to produce more realistic point clouds based on the projection. The proposed method was extensively evaluated under various configurations using the IAMCV and KITTI-360 datasets, with four performance metrics compared against state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. The results demonstrate the model’s superior performance over most existing baselines and its effectiveness in mitigating the effects of noisy and sparse LiDAR data, producing diverse point clouds with rich spatial relationships and structural detail."

Understanding how experienced drivers adapt their visual perception through gaze behavior under such conditions is critical for designing robust driver monitoring systems (DMS) and for informing advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). This case study investigates the eye gaze behavior of a driver operating the same highway route under both clear and rainy conditions. To this end, gaze behavior was analyzed by a two-step clustering approach: first, clustering gaze points within 10-second intervals, and then aggregating cluster centroids into meta-clusters. This, along with Markov transition matrices and metrics such as fixation duration, gaze elevation, and azimuth distributions, reveals meaningful behavioral shifts. While the overall gaze behavior focused on the road with occasional mirror checks remains consistent, rainy conditions lead to more frequent dashboard glances, longer fixation durations, and higher gaze elevation, indicating increased cognitive focus. These findings offer valuable insight into visual attention patterns under adverse conditions and highlight the potential of leveraging gaze modeling to aid design of more robust ADAS and DMS."

This study aims to determine which technologies are the most environmentally favourable under various conditions, particularly in the context of the global shift towards reducing greenhouse gas emissions. A systematic literature review (SLR) was conducted, drawing insights from diverse studies to evaluate the environmental performance of different propulsion systems. The analysis reveals that Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) are predominantly the most eco-friendly option across most scenarios, especially when powered by electricity derived from renewable sources. Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles (FCEVs) also present a viable alternative when hydrogen is produced via carbon-free methods. In regions where reliance on fossil fuels persists, Internal Combustion Engine Vehicles (ICEVs) remain relevant, while Compressed Natural Gas (CNG), especially when sourced from biomethane, is recommended for trucks due to its ecological benefits. The overarching conclusion emphasizes that the environmental impact of these technologies is significantly shaped by the energy sources powering them. This research provides a foundational understanding necessary for driving policy and industry decisions towards low-carbon transportation solutions."

However, a single estimate cannot capture pose uncertainty deriving from visual ambiguity, which can lead to unreliable behavior. Existing pose distribution methods rely heavily on color information, often unavailable in industrial settings.We propose a novel neural network-based method for estimating object pose uncertainty using only 3D colorless data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach that leverages deep learning for pose distribution estimation without relying on RGB input. We validate our method in a real-world bin picking scenario with objects of varying geometric ambiguity. Our current implementation focuses on symmetries in reflection and revolution, but the framework is extendable to full SE(3) pose distribution estimation. Source code available at opde3d.github.io"

Using a time-series dataset of N = 8,737 hourly observations, we investigated Power Quality signatures, customer segmentation, and model-based efficiency prediction for the proposed application. Experimental results show that the small model agents provide isolation while the large model agents show distinct advantages in accuracy and can address complex optimization strategies, clarify feature interactions, and provide contextual guidance to human operators."

    "abstract": "Time-frequency domain dual-path models have demonstrated strong performance and are widely used in source separation. Because their computational cost grows with the number of frequency bins, these models often use the bandsplit (BS) module in high-sampling-rate tasks such as music source separation (MSS) and cinematic audio source separation (CASS). The BS encoder compresses frequency information by encoding features for each predefined subband. It achieves effective compression by introducing an inductive bias that places greater emphasis on low-frequency parts. Despite its success, the BS module has two inherent limitations: (i) it is not inputadaptive, preventing the use of input-dependent information, and (ii) the parameter count is large, since each subband requires a dedicated module. To address these issues, we propose Spectral Feature Compression (SFC). SFC compresses the input using a single sequence modeling module, making it both input-adaptive and parameter-efficient. We investigate two variants of SFC, one based on cross-attention and the other on Mamba, and introduce inductive biases inspired by the BS module to make them suitable for frequency information compression. Experiments on MSS and CASS tasks demonstrate that the SFC module consistently outperforms the BS module across different separator sizes and compression ratios. We provide an analysis showing that SFC adaptively captures frequency patterns from the input."

To further boost voltage gain, the topology is combined with a voltage lift (VL) technique. The main merits of the proposed topology include high voltage conversion ratio, zero ripple input current, and common ground feature. Also, it benefits from simple control due to utilization of two switches with the same switching pattern. Furthermore, power switches with low on-state resistance are utilized as they can withstand less than one third of the output port voltage. The converter high voltage gain and zero input current ripple make it suitable for PV power application. The operation principle of the suggested converter is explained. Finally, the theoretical analysis is validated using PSIM software simulation results."

The main idea is to exploit the finite-horizon optimal control design in combination with ADT to guarantee stability even when the system switches between stable and unstable modes. In the unconstrained case, we prove that the system state converges exactly to the origin in a finite number of steps equal to the state dimension. For constrained systems, we establish recursive feasibility and asymptotic stability and show that finite-time convergence is recovered once the state enters an invariant terminal set where the constraints are inactive. A simulation study involving both stable and unstable subsystems demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed MPC-based approach in comparison with state feedback control."

This study modifies a P&O algorithm so that it can generate reference voltage instead of duty cycle, and then a PI controller signals the proper duty cycle. The validity of this technique is subsequently compared with two alternative techniques, and it is concluded that this method can track MPP accurately with fewer oscillations while it uses a simple, less expensive, and well-established control scheme."

The assistive robot uses the readings of a single worn Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) on the leg of the unimpaired side of the user to determine the target STS position for the assistive robot in real time. The controller allows the robot to follow a target STS path while having a compliant behavior in response to small tracking errors. The controller also allows changing the strength of robot assistance during STS by adjusting the virtual impedance parameters to provide assist-as-needed support. Simulations of the proposed control method showed that the amount of position error in response to a load applied on the robot could be adjusted using the virtual impedance parameters. The method was then implemented on a prototype of the STS assistive robot, and initial tests confirmed that it could adequately follow normal STS motion speeds with different impedance settings. The results also showed that the proposed controller responded as intended to applied external loads on the assistive robot while following a target STS path, with mean position error decreasing with increasing virtual stiffness. Future work will focus on testing the STS assistive robot with human subjects to evaluate how different assistance levels influence their STS motion and loading asymmetry."

However, physical-layer communications in LAE networks face critical challenges, including (i) achieving robust transmission over high-mobility scenarios, (ii) supporting massive connectivity for aerial and ground Internet of Things (IoT) devices, and (iii) increasing security threats due to the broadcast and openness of aerial channels. To address these challenges, this paper investigates the Affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM)-based waveform for reliable, scalable, and secure LAE networks. Leveraging chirp-based multicarrier modulation, AFDM provides strong resilience to Doppler impairments, supports massive access for aerial and IoT devices, and enables flexible physical-layer security and sensing capabilities. We first introduce the fundamental principles of AFDM and highlight its advantages for LAE networks, including enhanced robustness in high-mobility environments and inherent suitability for both physical-layer security (PLS) and sensing. Then, we present AFDM-based multiple access strategies to enable massive connectivity, followed by low-complexity transceiver designs tailored for power- and computation-constrained IoT devices. Finally, we explore PLS mechanisms customized for AFDM systems in LAE networks. This work may provide valuable insights into AFDM-based waveform design and implementation for future LAE communications."

Building upon this method, an electrically reconfigurable PRRS is further developed, enabling dynamic manipulation of the PR null for the first time. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed reconfigurable PRRS unit cell achieves wideband PR performance from 3.2 GHz to 12.9 GHz, with a dynamically tunable PR null ranging between 4.7 GHz and 10 GHz. A prototype consisting of 11×11 unit cells was fabricated, and radar cross section (RCS) measurements were conducted to validate its performance. Experimental results confirm the feasibility of dynamically adjusting the PR null."

    "abstract": "Increasing requirements for high switching frequency and high power density have driven the development of Gallium Nitride power transistors. Among them, some GaN transistors feature a non-insulating gate, such as gate injection transistors and Schottky-gate GaN transistors. Driving GaN transistors with a non-insulating gate is challenging, as a high gate current is required for rapid switching transitions, and a low continuous gate current is needed to maintain the device in the on-state and minimize losses. The conventional drive circuit for MOSFETs and IGBTs is not suitable anymore and the RC-type drive circuit recommended by manufacturers suffers from unstable turn-off voltage and inconsistent operation performance depending on the switching frequency and duty cycle. To address these issues, this work proposes an improved drive circuit designed with an active discharge path. This drive circuit can be easily implemented using standard commercially available driver ICs, requiring only one additional auxiliary switch without the need for additional control circuitry. It can drive non-insulating gate GaN transistors in the MHz range without performance degradation, enabling fast switching and ensuring a fixed turn-off voltage independent of operating points and transistor parameters. This feature enhances immunity to false turn-on, reduces losses and design complexity, and makes the circuit particularly suitable for high-frequency industrial applications. The drive circuit configuration and operation principle are introduced and its effectiveness is experimentally verified for two types of non-insulating gate transistors in a buck converter at a switching frequency of 5 MHz and 10 MHz respectively."

    "abstract": "Matching is a central problem in theoretical computer science, with a large body of work spanning the last five decades. However, understanding matching in the time-space bounded setting remains a longstanding open question, even in the presence of additional resources such as randomness or non-determinism. In this work we study space-bounded machines with access to catalytic space, which is additional working memory that is full with arbitrary data that must be preserved at the end of its computation. Despite this heavy restriction, many recent works have shown the power of catalytic space, its utility in designing classical space-bounded algorithms, and surprising connections between catalytic computation and derandomization. Our main result is that bipartite maximum matching (MATCH) can be computed in catalytic logspace (CL) with a polynomial time bound (CLP). Moreover, we show that MATCH can be reduced to the lossy coding problem for NC circuits (LOSSY[NC]). This has consequences for matching, catalytic space, and derandomization:•Matching: this is the first well studied subclass of P which is known to contain MATCH, as well as the first algorithm simultaneously using sublinear free space and polynomial time with any additional resources. Thus, it gives a potential path to designing stronger space and time-space bounded algorithms.•Catalytic space: this is the first new problem shown to be in CL since the model was defined, and one which is extremely central and well-studied. Furthermore, it implies a strong barrier to showing CL lies anywhere in the NC hierarchy, and suggests to the contrary that CL is even more powerful than previously believed.•Derandomization: we give the first class C beyond Logspace for which we exhibit a natural problem in LOSSY[C] which is not known to be in C, as well as a full derandomization of the isolation lemma in CL in the context of MATCH. This also suggests a possible approach to derandomizing the famed RNC algorithm for MATCH.Our proof combines a number of strengthened ideas from isolation-based algorithms for matching alongside the compress-or-random framework in catalytic computation."

    "abstract": "The traditional boost-type single-phase active power factor correction (PFC) suffers from issues such as high power switch voltage stress and difficulties in designing the subsequent DC-DC converter. To address these challenges, two buck-type single-phase active PFC circuit topologies and their control strategies are analyzed. The first topology utilizes a resonant filter to force the input capacitor voltage to zero, creating a discontinuous capacitor voltage at the front end of the buck converter, which allows zero voltage and rectification processes even near the zero-crossing point of the grid voltage. The second topology switches between Buck/Buck-Boost (or Buck/Boost) operating modes: when the instantaneous input voltage is lower than the output voltage, the system operates in Buck-Boost or Boost mode; when the instantaneous input voltage exceeds the output voltage, it operates in Buck mode. For both of these topologies, a dual closed-loop control strategy, involving both output voltage and input current, can be employed to achieve output voltage step-down and grid-side current waveform correction. The effectiveness of this approach has been verified through MATLAB/Simulink simulations."

    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly adopted in critical sectors such as healthcare, finance, and public administration, where it promises significant gains in efficiency, automation, and decision support. At the same time, these systems expose societies to serious risks, including bias, discrimination, safety failures, and privacy infringements. To document and learn from such failures, the Artificial Intelligence Incident Database (AIID) was created as a community-driven repository and collective memory of AI harms, designed to support research, best practices, and governance. As of 2025, the AIID contains more than 1,100 incidents, yet its unstructured, narrative reports make systematic analysis difficult and limit their policy value. This paper addresses that challenge by applying a Large Language Model (LLM) pipeline, guided by the OECD AI Incident Reporting Framework, to transform AIID reports into structured data and enable systematic analysis of recurring patterns in AI incidents. The analysis reveals a sharp rise in frequency and severity since 2020, with human and economic harms dominating, transparency and fairness most frequently violated, and ICT, finance, and public administration accounting for most cases. In terms of implications, the study provides insights to better inform AI governance. It also demonstrates how to use LLMs to transform unstructured dataset into structured data for analysis."

    "abstract": "In on-device NLP tasks, limited resources of embedded hardware, such as the Raspberry Pi 5, require efficient inference strategies. This paper introduces FrugalSOT (Frugal Search Over The Models), a resource-aware model selection architecture for on-device NLP inference. FrugalSOT estimates each request's complexity by extracting features such as prompt length, named entity density, and syntactic complexity. The request is first made to the least complex model that is likely to pass a relevance threshold. If the output of that model falls short of the threshold, the request is made to a more complex model. It is important to note that the relevance threshold undergoes continuous updates in the background. using past validation outcomes in an adaptation process using a low-pass filtering mechanism, thus imparting adaptation to changing input patterns. Experimental results achieved on a Raspberry Pi 5 show that FrugalSOT reduces average inference time and overall computational resource use to a significant extent compared to a single-model baseline approach, without compromising output relevance to the same extent as the most sophisticated model. These results confirm that adaptive model selection can enable efficient, high-quality natural language processing inference on limited devices."

    "abstract": "Everyone is curious to know how children learn and what their learning type and personality types are in today's world. Every individual is different and possesses some talents. It is best to find out these talents as early as possible. This determines interests at an early age so that they can use their potential to the maximum. It also determines personality traits to determine areas where they are most likely to excel. This paper attempts to make a long and cumbersome process simpler by automating the identification of personality and learning types. Our research suggests a new approach to determine learning types and personality traits from fingerprints. It is known that the way fingerprints are created and the way the brain is created are controlled by genes and the environment but happen at the same time during fetal development. Hence, by examining fingerprints, we can find out natural talents, different types of intelligences, and personality traits. The system proposed will have scanned fingerprints as input. These will be converted to black and white images and filtered. Then, other operations will be carried out, followed by filtering using Gabor filtering, dimension reduction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and training a Convolutional Neural Network, which classifies the fingerprints into seven classes accurately. The Grad- CAM algorithm will be employed to evaluate the system, which will provide a detailed report suggesting learning types and personality traits based on the output."

A cloud scheduler solves a chance-constrained model predictive control (MPC) program that shrinks feasibility according to identification residuals, while edge controllers translate power targets into implementable setpoints with anti-synchronization logic. Experiments on peak shaving and load following show improved tracking, fewer comfort violations, and reduced rebound compared with virtual-battery baselines, deterministic MPC, and duty-cycle heuristics, indicating a practical path to scalable air-conditioning virtual power plants (VPPs)."

    "abstract": "The core task of semantic segmentation is to assign predefined category labels to each pixel in an image, thereby distinguishing between different objects and backgrounds. Few-shot semantic segmentation (FSS) is a specialized semantic segmentation task that aims to accurately segment pixel-level targets of novel classes in query images, relying only on a limited number of annotated support samples to enable rapid adaptation to unseen categories without extensive labeled data. FSS in remote sensing imagery is a critical yet challenging task, primarily due to two intrinsic data characteristics: extreme scale variations among target objects and significant intra-class heterogeneity. These challenges severely degrade the performance of existing FSS methods, which often rely on single, global prototypes and are not explicitly designed for such variability. To address these limitations, we propose GlocalDualNet, a novel FSS framework tailored for remote sensing applications. GlocalDualNet integrates two core technical contributions. First, a multi-scale support prototype extraction module generates a set of heterogeneous local prototypes in addition to a conventional global prototype. This approach mitigates the spatial detail loss associated with global-only representations and provides a more comprehensive feature signature for matching. Second, a dual-branch segmentation network is designed to explicitly disentangle the feature learning process for large- and small-scale targets, thereby improving segmentation accuracy across disparate scales. Experimental validation on the iSAID-5<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">i</sup> benchmark dataset demonstrates that our proposed modules yield a notable 2.13% improvement in segmentation accuracy, establishing the efficacy of the GlocalDualNet framework."

In this article, a minimum-time torque control (MTTC) method is proposed from the perspective of flux trajectory optimization. First, a vertical projection iterative (VPI) algorithm is developed to estimate the minimum-distance flux trajectory in real time, which represents the optimal flux tracking direction for achieving the fastest torque response. Building on the VPI results, a generalized space vector synthesis (GSVS) algorithm determines a sequence of voltage vectors, maximizing voltage utilization within the hexagonal voltage boundary throughout the entire torque response process, to synthesize the minimum-time flux trajectory. Compared with state-of-the-art straight-line flux trajectories, the minimum-time flux trajectory enables the proposed method to achieve the theoretical minimum-time torque response, while ensuring safe operation by avoiding overcurrent, excessive flux weakening, and torque overshoot/undershoot. Experimental results validate the effectiveness and superior performance of the proposed MTTC method."

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) in vehicular networks offers the advantage of leveraging extensive distributed vehicle data while addressing data privacy and communication overhead concerns. However, conventional FL approaches encounter substantial difficulties due to the limited communication bandwidth and network dynamics in vehicular environments. To mitigate these challenges, this paper introduces a Semantic Communication-Enhanced U-Shaped Federated Split Learning (SC-USFL) framework tailored for image classification tasks in vehicular networks. The proposed framework incorporates a task-oriented semantic communication module, comprising semantic encoder/decoder and channel encoder/decoder components, to efficiently compress and transmit task-relevant features, thereby significantly reducing communication overhead. Additionally, a network status monitor (NSM) module is developed to dynamically adjust the compression ratio (CR) based on real-time network conditions, ensuring an effective balance between communication efficiency and classification performance. Extensive simulations on the CI-FAR10 dataset demonstrate that the proposed SC-USFL framework effectively manages the trade-off between communication overhead and classification accuracy. Furthermore, the results indicate robust performance over both additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and Rayleigh fading channel conditions, validating the effectiveness and adaptability of the proposed framework."

The traditional supervisory control techniques (SCTs) are generally not suitable for such large-scale systems. In this article, we propose a distributed control technique for AMSs with assembly operations to achieve a near-optimal liveness enforcement. Specifically, we define a type of decomposable system modeled by decomposable augmented marked graphs (AMGs) and create buffer-linked AMGs (BAMGs) by connecting each subsystem through buffers with specified capacities. Next, we construct the complemented subsystems to ensure structural completeness and simplify their structures to condense their reachability graphs. By conducting liveness analysis of BAMGs employing siphons, we demonstrate that the liveness of BAMGs depends solely on that of each individual subsystem. Finally, we design monitors for simplified subsystems utilizing reachability analysis and achieve distributed control of AMGs. Since the scale of reachable states is greatly reduced in simplified subsystems compared with the original AMGs, our method can save a significant amount of computation. An experimental study demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method."

    "abstract": "Computational cost poses a significant challenge in next-generation interferometric imaging systems. In these systems, the large number of antennas makes it impractical to process all measurements simultaneously due to computational capacity constraints. To reduce the computational burden while preserving image reconstruction quality, we propose a subarray switching strategy that utilizes fewer antennas and different antenna configurations. To take into consideration the influence of the image reconstruction algorithm on the design of the subarray switching pattern and to fully exploit the flexibility of the switching strategy, we propose a probabilistic deep learning-based method for designing antenna switching patterns, named by Probabilistic Antenna Switcher (PAS). In addition to the computational challenge, interferometric systems are also particularly sensitive to the presence of radio frequency interferences (RFI), which heavily affects imaging quality. In order to address this issue, we show that it is possible to combine the proposed PAS with a RFI detection module. Specifically, this module is a neural network that is trained to identify and minimize the impact of RFI-affected antennas in the subarray selection process. This results in a RFI-aware PAS (RaPAS), which balances computational efficiency, imaging quality, and robustness against RFI.

First, an ellipse center matching and verification algorithm is designed based on epipolar geometry and spatial data density distribution, achieving highly accurate ellipse center matching. Next, a re-constructed point verification step is introduced to filter out low-quality feature points, thereby improving reconstruction accuracy while eliminating redundant and unreliable information, which enhances reconstruction efficiency.

This paper presents the first large-scale study of how drivers respond to motorcycle encounters in African urban traffic. We analyzed 568 dashcam videos that contain 36,658 encounters in Kigali, Rwanda. Our analysis shows that six geometric encounter types reduce to three behavioral strategies: threat avoidance deceleration for crossing encounters (13. 8% speed reduction), traffic flow acceleration for stationary and overtaking scenarios (5.1% to 11.0% speed increase), and neutral maintenance for oncoming and following encounters (3.8% to 5.4% reduction). ANOVA confirms significant differences between types ((F(5,36651) = 8.742,p < 0.001). These findings help ADAS systems prioritize alerts by identifying crossing encounters as primary threat scenarios requiring intervention. Reaction times (0.33-0.86 seconds) provide baselines for autonomous vehicle calibration in mixed traffic environments. The behavioral simplification of six types of encounters into three strategies significantly advances the design of safety systems for complex urban environments."

Through systematic selection of object detection algorithms, YOLOv8s was chosen as the foundational framework. The vehicle type coefficient from the Guidelines for Design of Ventilation of Highway Tunnels was integrated with the BIT-Vehicle dataset classification to establish a 7-category vehicle type system for tunnel applications. Utilizing ETC gantry data from the Chengdu-Nanchong Expressway (ChengNan Expressway), the CNE-Vehicle dataset was constructed. A vehicle recognition line strategy was introduced to address blurred recognition for distant vehicles, enabling the model to achieve 95% overall accuracy and over 89% per-class accuracy at a confidence threshold of 0.5. Applying this model to analyze data from a 216-kilometer section of the ChengNan Expressway revealed a linear trend in NEV penetration across two dimensions: it increases with operational time but decreases with distance from the central city. A multivariate regression model differentiated by vehicle type was established. The results provide data support for precise highway traffic flow identification and prediction, establish a theoretical basis for dynamically reducing tunnel ventilation volume, and facilitate intelligent control of operational ventilation systems in highway tunnels."

However, the limited computational resources onboard UAVs pose a significant challenge to deploying complex models, while the accurate detection of small, occluded, or low-resolution targets remains a persistent problem. To address this trade-off between performance and efficiency, this paper proposes YOLOv8-GDC, a lightweight and effective object detector built upon the YOLOv8n baseline. Our core contribution is the novel Gaussian-Depthwise Convolution (GDC) module, a lightweight, implicit attention mechanism designed to enhance the feature representation capabilities for challenging targets. The GDC module strategically combines standard and depthwise convolutions with the GELU activation function to dynamically re-weight features, thereby improving sensitivity to small objects with zero additional parameters or computational overhead. We constructed a specialized dataset for emergency rescue scenarios, encompassing diverse disaster environments and challenging conditions, to validate our approach. Experimental results demonstrate that YOLOv8-GDC achieves a mean Average Precision (mAP50) of 53.2%, outperforming the baseline YOLOv8n by 4.0 percentage points and significantly improving recall by 4.0 points. Crucially, these accuracy gains are achieved with no increase in model parameters, GFLOPs, or significant inference latency, making YOLOv8-GDC a highly practical solution for deployment on resource-constrained UAV platforms in critical missions."

    "abstract": "In order to tackle the problem of ultra-short baseline(USBL) system-based positioning errors and outliers during the Autonomous Underwater Vehicle(AUV) docking process, which hinder precise estimate of the AUV motion state, a virtual on-board control combined with an extended Kalman filter is proposed. First, the proposed method establishes a virtual on-board controller and obtains the simulated rudder angle by simulating the AUV heading controller. And then, the rudder angle is input into the Kalman filter state model to acquire the predicted motion state of the AUV. Finally, a distance-based observation model is used to correct the predicted motion state, thereby obtaining the optimal estimation of the AUV’s motion state. The lake trial results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves a motion state estimation accuracy of 0.18 meters, representing an 84.6% improvement over traditional methods. The proposed method can effectively reduce USBL measurement errors, eliminate outliers, and thereby estimate the motion state of the AUV."

    "abstract": "The flexibility, scalability, and robustness of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) swarms make them highly adaptable to dynamic environments. However, these advantages also introduce a range of optimization challenges, including constraints on size, weight, and energy consumption, as well as less explored topics such as lightweight, secure communication and reliable mission completion. Inspired by the ant identification methods, we propose a decentralized solution to enhance communication security and ensure mission completion within UAV swarms. Unlike existing methods that rely on Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs), our solution introduces a PUF-less framework. Specifically, we define private IDs and group keys for individual UAVs, enabling secure communication while minimizing the risk of intrusion. The effectiveness of our method is validated through simulations, which highlight the importance of periodically updating the group key. Additionally, we address targeted attacks on private IDs by incorporating behavioral analysis and shared monitoring among swarm members. Our proposed approach paves the way for realizing the full potential of UAV swarms."

    "abstract": "The risk of hardware Trojans (HTs) in integrated circuits has grown with the globalized economy and increased reliance on third-party services. To counter this threat, Machine Learning (ML)-based detectors are widely used. However, recent studies show that adversaries can exploit ML vulnerabilities to create evasive HTs. These prior approaches, however, often require high circuit overheads, limiting their practicality. In this paper, we propose a novel method to generate evasive HTs with minimal or no circuit overhead, under realistic black-box assumptions. By relaxing the requirement for strict payload correctness from the attacker’s perspective, we define a new approximate adversarial design space. Our gradient-free framework leverages approximate gate replacements and uses a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm to balance HT evasiveness and approximation error. Unlike prior work assuming white-box access to detection models, we focus on the more practical black-box scenario, aligning with real-world constraints and enabling a more robust evaluation of detection strategies. Experiments show our attack reduces Trojan detector accuracy by an average of 91.6%, while maintaining functionality with only 35% approximation error."

The objective is transform one satisfying assignment into the other by repeatedly flipping the value of a single variable, while maximizing the minimum fraction of satisfied clauses of $\\varphi$ throughout the transformation. In this paper, we demonstrate that the optimal approximation factor for Maxmin Ek-SAT Reconfiguration is $1-\\Theta\\left(\\frac{1}{k}\\right)$. On the algorithmic side, we develop a deterministic $\\left(1-\\frac{1}{k-1}-\\frac{1}{k}\\right)$-factor approximation algorithm for every $k \\geqslant 3$. On the hardness side, we show that it is PSPACE-hard to approximate this problem within a factor of $1-\\frac{1}{10 k}$ for every sufficiently large k. Note that an “NP analogue” of Maxmin Ek-SAT Reconfiguration is Max Ek-SAT, whose approximation threshold is $1-\\frac{1}{2^{k}}$ shown by Håstad (JACM 2001). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reconfiguration problem whose approximation threshold is (asymptotically) worse than that of its NP analogue. To prove the hardness result, we introduce a new “non-monotone” test, which is specially tailored to reconfiguration problems, despite not being helpful in the PCP regime."

Information is stored on various external servers as opposed to the fixed servers used in traditionally located information capacity in distributed storage. All the information stored on various external servers leaves the client unattended, and no one knows exactly where the information is stored. Rejected by distributed storage vendors who claim they can protect your information, but no one trusts them. Information stored via the cloud and traveling in cleartext design within an organization is a security risk. This research study proposes a strategy for allowing clients to securely store and access information from distributed stores. This technology ensures the security and protection of information stored in the cloud. Another advantage of this strategy is that it is encrypted using cryptographic methods. In this technology, the files are encrypted using both symmetric and asymmetric algorithms, which is nothing but Hybrid Encryption and as a result the end user will get a pair of keys that will help in decrypting the files. If a data breach occurs the first layer of security will get damaged but the second layer of security helps in saving the files from data breach."

Collectively, this research establishes a practical framework for the development of HOT MWIR HgCdTe APD."

    "abstract": "Eddy trajectory prediction is crucial for understanding ocean dynamics and has practical implications in various fields. While existing sequential modeling approaches potentially introduce redundancy, this study reformulates oceanic eddy trajectory as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), assuming that the next position of an eddy can be predicted based solely on its current state, rather than on extended historical sequences. Under this framework, a simple Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model, optimized by minimizing the difference between predicted and actual eddy propagation velocities, achieves prediction accuracy comparable to that of more complex sequential modeling approaches. This not only validates the Markovian assumption, but also provides a computationally efficient alternative for eddy forecasting. Furthermore, we identify a critical issue in existing prediction evaluations on employing retrospective state variables as model inputs for intermediate forecast days. The problem is addressed by reusing the initial-day state variables throughout the entire forecast period, thereby establishing a more reliable benchmark for future research."

    "abstract": "Adversarial example detection has emerged as a prominent defense strategy owing to its efficiency in training and deployment. Nevertheless, existing detectors are typically developed under a single-step paradigm, where models become static after training on adversarial examples generated by a single attack. This paradigm is infeasible in dynamic real-world scenarios, since retraining from scratch for each newly encountered attack is impractical and computationally prohibitive. To address this limitation, we propose Continual Adversarial example Detection via Incremental Attack Configuration (IAC-CAD), which pioneers to exploit continual learning for adversarial detection within a knowledge distillation framework. IAC-CAD constructs a sequence of continuous detection tasks which require only a limited number of samples per task. Moreover, the proposed Incremental Attack Configuration (IAC) mechanism selects the representative attacks which maximally cover the entire adversarial feature space and optimizes their training sequence through the Memory-aware Attack Ordering. This design simultaneously mitigates catastrophic forgetting of known attacks and enhances generalization ability against unseen attacks. Extensive experiments verify the superiority and practicality of IAC-CAD."

Obtained results extend existing methods for solving the TLS problem in both constant tensor settings and constant and TV matrix settings. Two models are suggested to solve simultaneous perturbations in both tensor coefficient and right-hand vector inside TV TEs. The first model establishes a continuous-time neural network designed for solving the TLS of TV tensor equations (termed as NNTVTETLS), while the second (termed as discrete neural network for total-least-squares solution of time-varying tensor equations (DNNTVTETLS)) is developed as its discrete counterpart. Unlike existing gradient-based neural networks and least-squares methods, the proposed models address TLS perturbation in a high-order TV multilinear settings. A rigorous theoretical convergence analysis is provided, establishing local convergence for both continuous and discrete models. An efficient iterative scheme based on the DNNTVTETLS scheme is also developed. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate the efficacy of both continuous and discrete-time models. Numerical tests under various TV, constant, bounded vanishing, and bounded nonvanishing noise, confirm the rapid convergence, stability, and robustness of the proposed methods. The suggested framework is applied to solve the Bellman equation, which emerges in dynamic programming, economics, reinforcement learning, and optimal decision-making problems."

Previous algorithms with $\\hat{O}(m)$ work required $\\Omega(m)$ depth, even for special cases of min-cost flow with only edge capacities or max flow with vertex capacities. Our result generalizes prior almost-optimal parallel $(1+\\epsilon)$-approximation algorithms for these special cases, including shortest paths [1]–[3] and max flow with only edge capacities [4], [5]. Our key technical contribution is the first construction of length-constrained flow shortcuts with $(1+\\epsilon)$ length slack, $\\hat{O}(1)$ congestion slack, and $\\hat{O}(1)$ step bound. This provides a strict generalization of the influential concept of $(\\hat{O}(1), \\epsilon)$-hopsets [6], allowing for additional control over congestion. Previous lengthconstrained flow shortcuts [7] incur a large constant in the length slack, which would lead to a large approximation factor. To enable our flow algorithms to work under vertex capacities, we also develop a close-to-linear time algorithm for computing length-constrained vertex expander decomposition. Building on Cohen’s idea of path-count flows [8], we further extend our algorithm to solve $(1+\\epsilon)$-approximate k-commodity min-cost flow problems with almost-optimal $\\hat{O}(m k)$ work and $\\hat{O}(1)$ depth, independent of the number of commodities k."

We propose a method that reduces background information and allows human body parts to be focused on by detecting the bounding boxes of human regions using object detection techniques and then inputting the images with these regions expanded into the model. Furthermore, we propose a novel approach that extends the input from still images to video sequences and introduces a new loss function that imposes constraints along the temporal dimension, thereby enabling the model to learn temporal information effectively.

    "abstract": "The growing demand for reliable image transmission in noisy vehicular networks exposes the limitations of classical communication, which often suffers from bandwidth constraints and susceptibility to noise. Classical semantic communication addresses this by focusing on essential information, but it still struggles to maintain consistent image quality under adverse channel conditions. To address these limitations, this study proposes a quantum communication system for semantic communication-based image transmission by leveraging quantum superposition. The system first uses a semantic encoder to generate a compact latent representation. This representation is subsequently processed by a channel encoder and mapped into quantum superposition states using a quantum encoder. The resulting quantum states are sent through a noisy quantum channel, where they are measured and decoded at the receiver to recover the corresponding classical bitstream. The bitstream is then channel decoded to recover the latent vector, which is used by a semantic decoder to reconstruct the image. Results from the experiments confirm that the proposed system outperforms classical semantic communication systems, achieving a peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of up to 28.55 dB, a structural similarity index (SSIM) of up to 0.7996, a universal quality index (UQI) of up to 0.7836, and perfect classification accuracy at channel SNR levels as low as 6 dB, as evaluated by a convolutional neural network (CNN). These results highlight the system's effectiveness in task-oriented communication and show that combining quantum and semantic communication enhances image quality and reliability in challenging vehicular scenarios."

Traditional wound monitoring depends on in-person clinician visits, which are often difficult for rural residents and older adults. Artificial intelligence (AI) offers the potential to automate wound assessment, detect complications earlier, and enable home-based monitoring. Objective: To map existing Indian evidence on AI-enabled wound monitoring in home and telehealth contexts; to synthesize reported clinical, patient, health-system, and ethical/regulatory outcomes; and to identify priorities for research and policy. Methods: A scoping review was conducted following Joanna Briggs Institute methodology and PRISMA-ScR guidelines. PubMed, Scopus, CINAHL, IEEE Xplore, and Cochrane Library were searched from inception to August 2025, alongside Google Scholar and Indian grey sources including CDSCO, MoHFW, NRCeS, ABDM, and IndiaAI Mission. Eligible studies evaluated AI-enabled wound monitoring in India in home or telehealth contexts. Data were charted across study details, AI modality, outcomes, patient experience, and regulatory considerations. Narrative synthesis was structured into four domains: clinical performance, patient/caregiver perspectives, health-system outcomes, and ethical/regulatory issues. Results: Eight India-relevant studies were identified. These included smartphone-based computer vision platforms (DFUCare; AFSegGAN), an India-origin wound database with explainable AI, a smart infection/antimicrobial resistance-sensing dressing from BITS Pilani, a tele-podiatry case series from Pune, and ancillary imaging or IoT prototypes. DFUCare achieved mean average precision <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\sim \\text{0. 8 5}$</tex> for wound localization with <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$&lt;10 \\%$</tex> error compared to clinician tracings, and classified infection and ischemia with <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\sim 80 \\%$</tex> and <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\sim 95 \\%$</tex> accuracy respectively. AFSegGAN achieved Dice coefficients of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\sim \\text{9 3 \\%}$</tex> for segmentation and was packaged into a mobile/cloud workflow. Smart dressings demonstrated real-time infection and resistance detection but remain pre-clinical. Patients valued reduced travel and autonomy, though digital literacy, image quality, and data costs were barriers. Health-system outcomes were hypothesized but not quantified. Ethical and regulatory safeguards exist—Telemedicine Practice Guidelines (2020), Digital Personal Data Protection Act (2023), EHR Standards (2016), CDSCO regulation of software as a medical device—but few studies incorporated them. Conclusions: AI-enabled wound monitoring in India is feasible and culturally acceptable but supported only by small pilots. To scale, India needs multicentre pragmatic trials, diverse datasets inclusive of Indian skin tones, cost-effectiveness analyses, participatory design, and integration with ABDM and DPDP frameworks. With coordinated investment, India can lead globally in equitable and affordable AI-enabled wound care; without it, innovations risk remaining stalled at the prototype stage."

    "abstract": "Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) affects a child's ability to focus, retain information, and engage in structured learning environments, thus making conventional educational and therapeutic methods insufficient to accommodate their unique cognitive and behavioral needs. Gamified learning has emerged as a promising solution, using interactive and adaptive games to improve focus, engagement, and learning outcomes. This review explores existing gamified interventions for children with ADHD, examining their theoretical foundations, methods, and effectiveness. It also introduces MindPop, an innovative web-based platform that integrates artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), computer vision, and data analysis to customize learning experiences. MindPop dynamically adjusts game difficulty based on a child's attention and focus patterns, tracks engagement, and provides tailored support. The review also highlights research on how gamification can improve executive function, working memory, and impulse control in children with ADHD. While gamified learning has shown great potential, several challenges remain, including accessibility, age-appropriate design, balancing therapeutic and diagnostic goals, and ensuring long-term engagement without overuse – issues that MindPop aims to address. By combining findings from recent studies, this paper provides insights into the best practices for developing effective gamified learning applications, with the goal of expanding MindPop to support children with other neurodivergent conditions in the future."

    "abstract": "Traffic Generator (TG) aims to create a virtual traffic world for many different systems, such as the Driving Simulator (DS) or Motorbike Simulator (MS). Especially, TG can be utilized as a Traffic Accident Simulator (TAS) by inputting many scenario parameters (physics, vehicle location, etc.). For instance, the police can use TAS to analyze and report traffic crash results to the Procuracy for review and decision-making. Furthermore, TG can be \"zoomed out\" by converting to a Mesoscopic model for a Traffic-network Management Simulator (TMS). Due to the multiple purposes of TG, the process of TG development is varied. Hence, the quality assessment standard for the TG development cycle needs to combine multiple disciplines that must be related to the objectives of the TG project type. Nevertheless, current standards like CMMI and ISO cover either project management, traffic engineering or software engineering or other fields. This separation creates some challenges that only emerge when combining two or more disciplines. For instance, TAS requires realistic details to simulate the sequence of traffic accidents between vehicles and infrastructure, which demands a combination of not only traffic, software, and project management but also architecture and construction. Thus, this study proposes the Traffic Information Technology standard for developing the Traffic Generator project by utilizing our previous study of the 6R process, the APAS formula and the idea of TG-verse. In this research scope, we contribute the challenge list that our TIT standard can solve based on our perspectives, knowledge and experience in traffic, management, software, law and architecture."

    "abstract": "This paper presents BinBot, a sensor-driven smart waste management system designed to automate waste handling and segregation in hygiene-critical indoor environments. Conventional waste management methods rely on manual collection and basic segregation, which are labor-intensive, inconsistent, and unsuitable for sensitive spaces such as hospitals, old-age homes, business infrastructures, and residential complexes. BinBot overcomes these limitations through the integration of two core components: a mobile robotic rover and a smart underground dustbin. The rover autonomously navigates corridors using LiDAR, IMU, and proximity sensors for mapping, obstacle avoidance, and docking, while a load cell ensures capacity-aware operation. Once docked, the smart dustbin employs moisturebased sensing to segregate waste into wet and dry categories, reducing human effort and promoting hygienic disposal. A lightweight communication stack built on Node.js, MQTT, and React/React Native applications enables real-time monitoring and user control. A functional prototype was validated in residential and institutional corridors, demonstrating reliable navigation, waste transfer, and segregation. By combining robotics, sensing, and IoT-driven automation into a modular and scalable framework, BinBot contributes to sustainable and data-aware waste management tailored for smart indoor environments."

    "abstract": "Paillier and ElGamal are the two most commonly used partial homomorphic encryption algorithms. However, they suffer from the computational bottleneck commonly faced by most HE schemes. To accelerate them, many accelerators have been proposed, but the existing accelerators only support one algorithm and do not have side-channel protection. Therefore, this paper proposes a unified hardware accelerator for Paillier and ElGamal, named HAPE, which is also able to resist side-channel attacks. In HAPE, in order to alleviate side-channel leakage, Montgomery modular multiplication without conditional subtraction is adopted, and an improved randomized Montgomery ladder algorithm is proposed for modular exponentiation. In addition, HAPE also integrates both modulus masking and exponential masking to further protect HAPE. Experimental results show that the sidechannel attack resistance of HAPE is significantly improved at the cost of 11.29% area increase, 35.70% power increase and 3.14% performance degradation. Compared with other related works, HAPE not only achieves a performance improvement of $2.51 \\times$ to $75.61 \\times$, but also supports both Paillier and ElGamal algorithms, and has side-channel attack protection."

    "abstract": "The aim of camouflaged object detection (COD) is to discern concealed objects within the background. Due to issues such as high similarity to the surrounding environment, small size, occlusions, COD is considered a highly challenging task. In this paper, we propose a novel COD framework, named multi-clue sliding window attention network (MCSWA-Net), stressing in utilizing prior knowledge at different semantic levels to guide the detection of camouflaged objects via multi-scale sliding window attention (MSWA). To this end, we first devise the dynamic local detail capture (DLC) module and the global interactive decoder (GID) module to generate both local and global guidance clues. Particularly, each block of the DLC module produces local prior clue by processing corresponding image features at each stage from the encoder. And the GID module fuses all adjacent encoder features, generates global prior clue by combining fusion features of multi-semantic levels. Further, to make full use of prior clues guiding the detection of camouflaged objects at multi-semantic levels, we design the multi-scale guidance attention fusion (MAF) module and use two prior clues to refine the image features via the group fusion and the MSWA separately. Experiments conducted on four COD benchmark datasets, and results demonstrate that our MCSWA-Net is superior to state-of-the-art (SOTA) COD methods. In addition, we explore the detection capabilities of our MCSWA-Net for the downstream vision tasks related to COD, such as polyp segmentation, COVID-19 lung infection segmentation, and industrial defect detection. Experimental results show the proposed method has high degree of generality."

    "abstract": "Objective: Multiple limitations exist in current automated ECG analysis, including insufficient feature integration across leads, limited interpretability, poor generalization, and inadequate handling of class imbalance. To address these challenges, we develop a novel dual-branch framework that comprehensively captures spatial-temporal features for cardiac disease diagnosis. Methods: ECG-AuxNet combines a Multi-scale Transformer Attention CNN for spatial feature extraction and a GRU network for temporal dependency modeling. A Dual-stage Cross-Attention Fusion module integrates features from both branches, while a Feature Space Reconstruction (FSR) auxiliary task is introduced as a manifold regularizer to enhance feature discrimination. The framework was evaluated on PTB-XL (15,709 ECGs) and validated in real-world clinical scenarios (SXMU-2k, 1,673 ECGs). Results: For class-imbalanced disease recognition (NORM, CD, MI, STTC), ECG-AuxNet attained 78.34% F1-score on PTB-XL and 82.63% F1-score on SXMU-2k, outperforming 9 baseline models. FSR significantly improved feature discrimination by 11.7%, enhancing class boundary clarity and classification accuracy. Grad-CAM analysis revealed attention patterns that precisely match cardiologists' diagnostic focus areas. Conclusion: ECG-AuxNet effectively integrates spatial-temporal features through auxiliary learning, achieving robust generalizability in cardiac disease diagnosis with interpretability aligned with clinical expertise."

To find its feasible schedules in a short time, an autoencoder-aided bi-level evolutionary algorithm is proposed. In it, a customized autoencoder is developed to learn compact latent representations of task sequences, capturing complex dependencies and structural features. Coarse-grained evolutionary operators explore promising regions in a low-dimensional latent space, while fine-grained operators refine solutions in the original solution space. Various numerical experiments are performed to compare the proposed method with several classic heuristics and some recently-developed methods. The results show that our proposed approach achieves superior energy efficiency and takes less computational burden compared with its peers."

    "abstract": "Accurate state estimation in large-scale lithiumion battery packs is critical for ensuring safety, longevity, and optimal performance, particularly in electric vehicle applications. However, most existing estimators rely on simplified lumped models that overlook the complexities arising from cell-to-cell variations and interconnection effects in parallel-connected packs. This paper addresses these challenges by proposing a generalized equivalent circuit model formulated as a nonlinear discrete-time descriptor system. The model explicitly incorporates contact resistances to capture the uneven current distribution among cells. To enable state estimation under a reduced sensing scenario, where only pack-level voltage and current measurements are available, we propose an extended Kalman filter based on the maximum correntropy criterion. This enhancement improves robustness to non-Gaussian sensor noise commonly encountered in practice. The proposed filter accurately estimates both differential states (cell state-of-charges) and algebraic states (local cell currents), making it a promising solution for cell-level monitoring in parallel-connected lithium-ion battery packs under realistic operating conditions."

    "abstract": "Modern scientific exploration and Earth observation spacecraft missions across the globe have necessitated the assembly of large space structures in space. The urge for the design and development of such assembled spacecraft has increased all the more with the proposals of Indian space station and journey of heavy spacecraft to lunar orbits and outer space for interplanetary missions. This can be accomplished through docking of multiple spacecraft modules thereby giving rise to a coupled dynamics of the composite stack. This eventually requires attitude stabilization and control of the composite spacecraft through the controllers from primarily one module. However, the control authority of reaction wheel-based control from one module towards composite stack control falls short due to high composite inertia and poses challenge to the slew time and other mission requirements (like thermal, power etc) which also have to be met simultaneously. The current paper brings to light the scope of development of control algorithms and strategies for reaction wheel-based control of the composite stack during operation of the in-orbit large space structure in multi-module docked condition towards achieving greater mission goals. The formulations for such spacecraft control in normal mode with reaction wheels are classified into master-slave configuration-based control and Momentum augmented control of coupled spacecraft dynamics with joint participation of both system actuators. The simulations are carried out in MATLAB with inclusiveness of the factors which can impact the performance of such attitude control and results are discussed. Such algorithms widen the horizon of coupled spacecraft dynamics control and expand the spectrum of multi-stack on-orbit spacecraft operation without the need of transfer of actuation signals across the systems of the composite stack, thereby ensuring the robustness during actuator failure mode of operation as well."

Conventional fuzzy models offer robustness but lack adaptability to dynamic real-world variations, limiting their accuracy. This paper presents an adaptive fuzzy framework for real-time range estimation, integrating the interpretability of physics-based energy modeling with the flexibility of online fuzzy adaptation. The estimator processes six contextual inputs—state of charge, traction power, acceleration, road slope, ambient wind speed, and driver behavior index—capturing vehicle dynamics, environmental conditions, and driving behavior. By continuously adjusting its rule base and membership parameters, the system maintains high accuracy across varying slopes, loads, and driving styles without offline recalibration. Experimental validation on a closed-loop EV platform demonstrated prediction errors below 5%, confirming stable and efficient performance suitable for intelligent energy management and eco-driving systems."

The number of cases is developing among children but in case if it is analyzed at its prior stage at that point the survival rates will become exceptionally high. By using state-of-the-art image process techniques, a new framework has been proposed to identify and recognize melanoma from nevus. To begin with, Gaussian channel is utilized for evacuating clamor from the derm injury of the acquired images followed by utilizing the improved K-mean clump to area out the injury. A particular crossover super highlight vector is shaped by the extraction of textural and colour alternatives from the injury. The classification of derm tumor into melanoma is carried out by using Support Vector Machine (SVM). The main aim is to test the viability of the projected segmentation technique, extract the foremost appropriate options, and compare the categorized results with the opposite techniques present within the literature. The anticipated strategy is tried on the corium dataset. Our proposed methodology archives encouraging results."

    "abstract": "In a distinguishing problem, the input is a sample drawn from one of two distributions and the algorithm is tasked with identifying the source distribution. The performance of a distinguishing algorithm is measured by its advantage, i.e., its incremental probability of success over a random guess. A classic example of a distinguishing problem is the Planted Clique problem, where the input is a graph sampled from either $G(n, 1 / 2)$ - the standard Erdős-Rényi model, or $G(n, 1 / 2, k)$ the Erdős-Rényi model with a clique planted on a random subset of k vertices. The Planted Clique Hypothesis asserts that efficient algorithms cannot achieve advantage better than some absolute constant, say 1/4, whenever $k=n^{1 / 2-\\Omega(1)}$. In this work, we aim to precisely understand the optimal distinguishing advantage achievable by efficient algorithms on Planted Clique. We show the following results under the Planted Clique hypothesis:•Optimality of low-degree polynomials: No efficient algorithm can beat the advantage the optimal low-degree polynomial. Concretely, this means that the advantage of any efficient algorithm is at most $(1+o(1)) \\cdot k^{2} /(\\sqrt{\\pi} n)$, which is optimal in light of a simple edge-counting algorithm achieving this bound.•Harder planted distributions: There is an efficiently sampleable distribution ${\\mathcal{P}}^{*}$ supported on graphs containing k cliques such that no efficient algorithm can distinguish ${\\mathcal{P}}^{*}$ from $G(n, 1 / 2)$ with advantage $n^{-d}$ for an arbitrarily large constant d. In other words, there exist alternate planted distributions that are much harder than $G(n, 1 / 2, k)$.Along the way, we prove a constructive hard-core lemma for a broad class of distributions with respect to low-degree polynomials. This result is applicable much more widely beyond Planted Clique and might be of independent interest."

In contrast, there is no gap in undirected graphs; the optimal bound of Θ(kn) has been well-established since the 90s [3].We nearly close the gap for directed graphs; we prove that there exists a k-fault-tolerant connectivity preserver with O(k4<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">k</sup>nlogn) edges, and we can construct one with O(8<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">k</sup>nlog<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">5/2</sup> n) edges in poly(2<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">k</sup>n) time.Our results also improve the state-of-the-art for a closely related object; a k-connectivity preserver of G is a subgraph H where, for all i ≤ k, the strongly i-connected components of G and H agree.

This paper proposes an intelligent, vision-based traffic surveillance system designed to automatically detect and classify and report violations like red light jumping, speeding, helmet-less riding, lack of valid insurance, and non-compliance of pollution control. The system is utilizing a custom-trained state-of-the-art object detection algorithm, especially YOLOv12 (You Only Look Once). It integrates real-time object tracking with license plate extraction with vision-based models and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) while delivery of the challan is achieved via an API backend. Experimental testing and evaluations have an accuracy of 93.76 % overall across multiple test cases. The results showcase a potential to enhance traffic law enforcement and improve overall road safety."

    "abstract": "Hydrogen production without carbon dioxide emissions is possible with water electrolysis using electricity generated by renewable energy sources. The proposed energy source is the energy of salinity gradients (EGS), which can be obtained by reversibly mixing solutions of different concentrations. The most developed membrane methods for converting the energy of salinity gradients are considered: pressure-retarded osmosis on osmotic semipermeable membranes and reverse electrodialysis with ion-selective membranes in an electrodialysis battery. Reverse electrodialysis directly converts EGS into electricity. However, it is possible to combine the processes of reverse electrodialysis and water electrolysis in one battery, since gases are released on them when inert electrodes are used. This takes up some of the electricity received. The gases that are released depend on the solutions that are fed to the electrode chambers. When the alkali solution circulates in the electrode chambers, the hydrogen ions will be reduced at the cathode and hydrogen gas will be released."

This calibration takes into account the refraction of light on the refraction surfaces between media with different refractive coefficients (air-glass-water). The use of this method enables the accurate determination of the spatial straight line on which the observed object point is located in any region of the video camera frame, including areas at the edges of the frame where the greatest distortions due to distortion are observed. Through the use of video cameras calibrated with this method, it becomes possible to accurately perform the required manipulation and technological operations in an underwater environment using multi-link manipulators. The performance and effectiveness of the presented calibration method were confirmed through fullscale experiments."

    "abstract": "The increasing penetration of renewable energy and the growing demand for cross-border electricity transfer through interconnection pose significant challenges to voltage stability in modern smart grids operation. Among the various Flexible AC Transmission Systems (FACTS) devices in power system management, the Static Synchronous Compensator (STATCOM) has emerged as an effective solution for dynamic voltage regulation and reactive power control. This paper presents a review of STATCOM applications in smart grids operation, focusing on its role in maintaining voltage stability and enhancing power flow. To complement the review, a case study is developed on a 500 kV, 150 km British Columbia (Canada) and Washington (USA) grid interconnection line. A MATLAB/Simulink model is implemented to evaluate system behavior under normal operation and fault conditions, both with and without STATCOM. Simulation results demonstrate that STATCOM significantly improves voltage recovery, reduces oscillations, provides rapid reactive power support, and stabilizes the DC link voltage. These findings confirm the practical importance of STATCOM in smart grid operations, particularly in long-distance and high-voltage interconnections. Future directions are also highlighted, including advanced control strategies and renewable energy integration in Energy Management Systems of Smart Cities."

Enhancing the observable capabilities of distributed photovoltaic, especially through intelligent anomaly detection, is essential for ensuring reliable operation. To address this challenge, we propose DPAD, a novel anomaly detection framework that integrates a variational autoencoder, a bidirectional long short-term memory network, and a multi-head self-attention mechanism. Within the VAE framework, BiLSTM serves as the encoder to model the hidden-layer probability distribution of input data. The sampled latent variables are then refined via multi-head attention, enabling BiLSTM to reconstruct the hidden representations for robust anomaly detection. Experimental results demonstrate that the precision, recall and F<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</inf> score of the model in this paper reach 98.98%, 87.82% and 89.85%, which significantly improves the fault detection efficiency and operation and maintenance intelligence compared with the existing methods."

    "abstract": "The coordination of autonomous drone swarms for wildfire response presents a key problem in dynamic task and resource management. This paper presents a comparative analysis of coordination strategies for a resource-constrained multi-agent drone swarm. The evaluation is conducted within an agent-based simulation that includes a probabilistic Cellular Automata (CA) fire model with multi-directional wind and heterogeneous fuel loads. The drone agents operate under constraints, including a limited water payload or battery charge that requires periodic resupply. We implement and assess three strategies: a decentralized heuristic, a context-aware auction mechanism where bids reflect local fire intensity and predictive risk, and a reinforcement learning (RL) agent based on Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). The RL agent integrates an attention mechanism to extract relevant environmental cues and is informed by short-term fire spread forecasts to support proactive decision-making. The simulation results provide a quantitative comparison of these strategies based on fire containment, task completion time, and resource use. Although the auction mechanism offers robust performance, the predictive RL agent learns more proactive containment behaviors. This analysis quantifies the trade-offs across coordination strategies and informs the design of intelligent, resource-aware systems for autonomous wildfire response.

In this paper, a transient dynamic simulation model of the vacuum tube operating mechanism based on implicit nonlinear dynamics was first established in ANSYS. The Von Mises yield criterion and isotropic hardening model were used to calculate the equivalent stress of the model. Then, the overall stress distribution of the operating mechanism was analyzed through finite element method, and finally the stress distribution of the convex turntable was analyzed specifically."

The suggested approach is empirically compared with actual real-world datasets collected from 22 geographically distributed IoT air quality monitoring stations across the metropolitan area of Tehran. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves a 24.77% reduction in MSE and a 13.26% improvement in RMSE compared to the Stage-1 Federated XGBoost baseline. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework in discovering localized air pollution patterns with scalability and privacy.

The normalized advantage function (NAF) simplifies continuous control by modeling a quadratic action-value function, but its deterministic policy limits exploration capabilities. In this paper, a MaxEnt RL framework, termed as soft normalized advantage function (SNAF), is introduced. SNAF extends NAF by incorporating a stochastic policy, thereby enhancing exploration and mitigating the risk of converging to local optima without requiring additional sampling approximations. The performance of SNAF is evaluated on benchmark optimal control problems, which encompass pendulum stabilization, the Van der Pol oscillator, and a target control task, comparing its performance with soft actor-critic and the original NAF. Experimental results demonstrate that SNAF achieves improved sample efficiency, accelerated convergence, and enhanced robustness while maintaining computational simplicity. These findings underscore its potential for addressing high-dimensional continuous control tasks."

These genetic operating parameters can be optimised for different problems, generalizing the approach for a range of applications. In particular, the parameters can be adjusted during the processes as the algorithm approaches an optimal solution. In this research, we propose a variant of the genetic algorithm by using reinforcement learning to select and update a mutation parameter as the algorithm progresses. Specifically, we investigate the use of the Q-Learning algorithm to select the optimal configuration of the mutation factor in each iteration. The Bellman optimality mechanism is used to govern the selection of the optimal mutation configurations which in turns allows the model to switch between a wider global search and an intensive local search during the search process. A realworld railway platform allocation problem and a number of benchmark test functions are used to evaluate the proposed model with Q-Learning based optimal mutation rate selection. The results of the proposed model show improvement in 7 out of the 8 test functions over a set of 25 trials. It also shows great efficiency in solving railway platform allocation problems, in comparison with the original genetic algorithm with a fixed mutation factor."

Rather than relying on aggressive interpolation or synthetic reconstruction, the proposed method preserves the dataset’s natural temporal structure by assessing time continuity, channel consistency, and energy balance. All appliance and mains signals are aligned on a uniform 6-second grid, incomplete samples are removed, and channel activity is visually verified using presence scatter plots. Through iterative temporal-gap analysis, a continuous and minimally manipulated window is identified for House 1 of UK-DALE (September 1, 2013–March 1, 2014), comprising 32 active channels with minimal interruptions. The selected segment exhibits strong temporal stability and energy alignment within ±5%, providing a reproducible and trustworthy foundation for NILM model training. This framework enhances the reliability, fairness, and comparability of NILM research and can be extended to other datasets to promote standardized, data-consistent evaluation."

The approach involves constructing representative daily demand profiles, filtering outliers, and statistically identifying peak and valley periods using a thresholding technique based on mean and standard deviation. These time windows are then used to estimate the grid’s capacity to absorb or release power through V2G operations. A case study using Sri Lanka’s 2023 load data demonstrates that consistent nighttime and midday valleys are ideal for EV charging, while evening peaks offer significant discharging opportunities. The framework enables early stage feasibility assessments in data scarce regions and supports strategic planning for V2G integration."

However, limited flight endurance remains a critical constraint for these aircraft. This paper proposes a control strategy to enhance the operational endurance of power grid inspection drones by enabling them to perch on specific components of transmission towers using landing gear or support brackets. By lightly contacting these structural elements, the quadrotor can counteract part of its gravitational force, reducing hover energy consumption and extending mission time. Unlike conventional perching on flat surfaces or mounting on structures, this approach emphasizes maintaining attitude stability and operational capability during contact-based perching, where mechanical interaction with the environment is leveraged for energy efficiency. A method for estimating support forces and torques is developed, forming the basis of a feedforward compensation control strategy. Additionally, a disturbance observer(DOB) is designed to mitigate disturbances and enhance attitude stability. Simulations in the Simscape environment validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, demonstrating its potential to address endurance limitations in aerial robotic applications."

Our method is evaluated through Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO) and compared with several state-of-the-art TLC approaches.

The model’s output is used to identify the specific root causes of discomfort and translate them into clear, actionable advice, with the most effective communication method established through a comprehensive Human-Machine Interface (HMI) study. The second contribution is a semi-autonomous, closed-loop control system that performs direct interventions to enhance comfort. Crucially, this system uses the very same recommendations as a transparency layer for its automated actions; when a correction is made by the vehicle, the interpretable reason for the intervention is simultaneously communicated to the driver. The system’s efficacy is demonstrated in a comparative study, wherein a substantial reduction in high and moderate motion sickness scenarios and a significant increase in comfortable driving time are observed. Through this research, a practical framework is validated in which automated interventions are rendered transparent, proving that enhanced comfort can be achieved in synergy with driver understanding."

    "abstract": "The multi-UGVs formation safety is important when the UGV happens the serious actuator failure and has to break away from the formation. The formation fault-tolerant control method based on velocity-adaptive potential field for multi-UGVs is proposed to achieve the formation control and collision avoidance in this situation. Firstly, the formation model based on the leader-follower is built. Then, the Hungarian algorithm is used to implement the optimal formation reconstruction, when the follower UGV happens the serious actuator failure. And the velocity-adaptive potential field is proposed to achieve the formation control and enhance the collision avoidance capability with the dynamic faulted UGV and other formation members. The simulation result shows the proposed method is able to achieve the formation reconstruction and collision avoidance, when the follower UGV happens the serious failure."

As a core application platform, an IoT-enabled Segway is deployed and integrated with the proposed framework, serving as a practical micro-mobility solution within gated communities. The proposed system enables both Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication using ESP-NOW, and Vehicle-to-Infrastructure-to-Vehicle (V2I2V) communication using Wi-Fi-based UDP, implemented using ESP32-S3 and NodeMCU microcontrollers integrated with IMU, ToF, Ultrasonic, and GPS sensors. To evaluate performance, end-to-end latency is measured across varying distances under both Line-of-Sight (LoS) and Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) conditions. Along with the latency measurement, power profiling system is also implemented using the INA226 sensor, comparing the energy consumption of ESP-NOW and 4G-based communication. To extend this analysis, Simulation of Urban MObility (SUMO) simulation was performed. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in supporting reliable micro-mobility communication, offering a practical foundation for intelligent transport in localized smart environments. This work introduces a novel, energy-efficient, and infrastructure-independent V2X communication solution tailored for smart gated communities."

    "abstract": "Modern vehicles rely more and more on sophisticated sensor systems for navigation and dynamics monitoring, however most approaches depend on centralized, expensive sensor suites. This paper presents a novel approach to vehicle state estimation using strain sensors mounted on wheel rims. We demonstrate that strain patterns captured at the wheel-road interface contain rich information about vehicle dynamics that can be extracted using machine learning (ML) techniques. We collected high-resolution telemetry data from strain sensors mounted on all four wheels of a test vehicle, synchronized with ground truth generated from GPS signal for supervised training. Using ML methods, we successfully predicted vehicle speed and turning direction directly from the strain sensor data. Our results show that wheel-mounted strain sensors can serve as an independent, redundant source of vehicle dynamics information, with potential applications in sensor fusion, fault detection, and low-cost navigation systems. This work is a first step for future research into vehicle driving scenarios identification and road condition monitoring using the same sensor configuration."

To overcome these issues, this study proposes a hybrid two-layer Energy Management System (EMS). The deterministic layer ensures primary scheduling of resources while the fuzzy layer adaptively mitigates renewable and loads fluctuations to obtain stability of the microgrid. A 33-bus microgrid test case is used to evaluate the proposed approach under realistic operating conditions. Simulation results demonstrate that the fuzzy-supervisory EMS achieves significant improvements in frequency regulation, stability indices, and overall resiliency, while reducing operational costs compared to basecase. Moreover, the hybrid design offers computational efficiency which is suitable for real-time applications because it does not need several populations and iterations. The findings emphasize the potential of this framework for microgrid operations that are resilient, cost-efficient, and involve high utilization of renewable energies."

    "abstract": "This paper investigates Federated Learning (FL) within the framework of Stochastic Approximation (SA). FL is a decentralized approach to training machine learning models collaboratively across multiple clients, eliminating the need for centralized data storage. Each client updates a local model using its own data and periodically transmits the model parameters to a central server. The server aggregates these parameters and redistributes the aggregated model to the clients, who then continue training from the updated state. SA is an iterative optimization technique that employs noisy or approximate gradient estimates along with a diminishing step size to converge to a minimizer of a cost function. In the proposed approach, clients update their local model parameters using a stochastic approximation scheme. It is shown that the evolution of the aggregated model parameters closely follows the trajectory of an autonomous ordinary differential equation (ODE). Numerical experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of the method, with comparisons made to baseline algorithms such as FedAvg and FedProx. The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm exhibits enhanced robustness and yields more accurate parameter estimates."

    "abstract": "The increasing volume of video traffic presents significant challenges to network transmission, while edge computing accelerates video delivery by leveraging caching and computation to optimize content forwarding. However, as edge computing is generally deployed by service providers in a transparent manner, clients cannot perceive edge states, e.g., cache availability, potentially resulting in suboptimal bitrate decisions. This issue persists even with intelligent bitrate selection approaches on the client side, as the inaccurate estimation of network delivery capacity due to edge cache transparency remains unresolved. Meanwhile, single-edge servers or nodes, with limited cache space and computational capacity for a small number of users, can be more effective by aggregating into clusters to better serve users and optimize resource utilization. Therefore, we propose an edge-assisted bitrate re-adaptation scheme (<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">e-BitRead</i>) for adaptive streaming, utilizing neighbor edges to accelerate video deliveries. <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">e-BitRead</i> introduces three key innovations: (i) it employs a bitrate re-adaptation mechanism that intelligently selects alternative bitrates from edge servers instead of strictly responding with the requested bitrate, (ii) it utilizes collaborative caching across multiple edge servers to expand available bitrate options through coordinated resource sharing, and (iii) it enhances the learning efficiency through joint optimization of network architecture and reward design, which leverages actor-critic structure to fit into multi-edge bitrate adaptation. In experiments with an intelligent client ABR, <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">e-BitRead</i> demonstrates its superiority by achieving a 1.43x higher hit ratio compared to the baseline, while improving QoE by 1.93x over the scheme without smart bitrate matching and delivering a 33% gain over the single-edge re-adaptation approach."

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the distributed cooperative localization problem for mobile multi-UAV systems using set-membership estimation (SME). Unlike existing SME approaches relying on prior-known anchors or beacons, we consider a fully autonomous scenario where UAVs need to collaboratively derive guaranteed positional sets using only absolute measurements and relative range measurements from neighboring agents. To handle this problem, we first propose a law-of-total-range method to rigorously quantify the estimated sets from relative measurements, which fits the general form of relative measurements between pairwise UAVs. Based on this new method, a novel distributed SME framework is developed, where each UAV can obtain the guaranteed set containing its true state with only local measurements and communications. In addition, a distributed localization algorithm based on extended constrained zonotopes (ECZ) is designed with a proposed framework. Simulation results and field experiments verify that our proposed method efficiently improves the cooperative localization accuracy and outperforms the linearization-based extended SME method."

    "abstract": "Distribution estimation is a pivotal strategy in few-shot learning (FSL) to mitigate data scarcity by sampling from estimated distributions, utilizing statistical properties (mean and variance) transferred from related base categories. However, category-level estimation alone often fails to generate representative samples due to significant dissimilarities between base and novel categories, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this limitation, we propose Hybrid Granularity Distribution Estimation (HGDE), which integrates both coarse-grained category-level statistics and fine-grained instance-level statistics. By leveraging instance statistics from the nearest base samples, HGDE enhances the characterization of novel categories, capturing subtle features that category-level estimation overlooks. These statistics are fused through linear interpolation to form a robust distribution for novel categories, ensuring both diversity and representativeness in generated samples. Additionally, HGDE employs refined estimation techniques, such as weighted summation for mean calculation and principal component retention for covariance, to further improve accuracy. Empirical evaluations on four FSL benchmarks, including Mini-ImageNet, Tiered-ImageNet, CUB and CIFAR-FS, demonstrate that HGDE offers effective distribution estimation capabilities and leads to notable accuracy gains, with improvements of more than 1.8% in 1-shot tasks on CUB. These results highlight HGDE’s ability to balance mean precision and variance diversity, making it a versatile and effective solution for FSL."

    "abstract": "Accurate and efficient Radar Cross Section (RCS) computation for chaff clouds is critical in electronic warfare. This task is challenging due to the massive scale of these clouds, complex element distributions, and intricate electromagnetic interactions, particularly mutual coupling and screening. This paper proposes the Multiscale Chaff Cloud RCS (MCC-RCS) method, a framework for computationally efficient RCS prediction of large-scale chaff clouds. It is specifically developed for clouds with arbitrary spatial but statistically uniform orientation distributions, while the underlying framework is extensible to other orientation models and bistatic scenarios. Its high computational speed and modest resource demands make it suitable for standard desktop computers, enabling rapid iterative computations such as echo simulation or chaff mixture optimization. The method employs a hierarchical multiscale strategy. At the microscale, it utilizes Einarsson’s formulation for the RCS of a single chaff dipole. The mesoscale implements a model combining mutual coupling with an intra-cell screening model. At the macroscale, an octree-based spatial decomposition provides efficient management and systematic accumulation of inter-cell screening. Numerical simulations demonstrate that MCC-RCS computes the monostatic RCS for clouds of up to 10<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">6</sup> elements within tens of seconds on a standard desktop with low memory usage, representing a significant speedup of several orders of magnitude compared against reported performance benchmarks for reference methods. The method shows good agreement with full-wave Method of Moments (MoM) for sparse distributions, and its accuracy for large-scale clouds is comparable to established Vector Radiative Transfer (VRT) methods, exhibiting physically consistent behavior. While high-fidelity solvers like Sparsification via Neglecting Far-field Coupling (S-NFC) offer superior accuracy, MCC-RCS provides a faster, less resource-intensive alternative, ideal for rapid large-scale assessments with a calibrated and acceptable trade-off between speed and accuracy."

Extensive research has been conducted to develop emergency maneuvering systems for passenger vehicles. However, performing evasive maneuvers with semi-trailer trucks presents unique challenges that limit their maneuvering capabilities, such as restrictions on the power steering system. This paper presents a unified control approach for automatic evasive maneuvering that integrates steering and differential braking. Differential braking, applied within conservative limits, is used to generate an additional yaw moment to complement the steering, thus enhancing the lateral dexterity of the vehicle. A jerk-optimal quintic polynomial path generation approach is adopted. For path tracking, a linear-quadratic controller (LQR) is employed. The proposed system is evaluated via simulations in MATLAB/Simulink. The simulation results show a significant improvement in evasive performance based on our assessment criteria, the Last Point to Brake (LPTB) and the Last Point to Steer (LPTS)."

    "abstract": "As a core parameter within vehicle stability control systems, the vehicle sideslip angle (VSA) significantly influences both maneuverability and operational safety. However, the prevailing assumption in current research is that measurement noise is Gaussian distributed. In reality, factors such as sensor degradation, measurement anomalies, and external disturbances often result in heavy-tailed, skewed, and time-varying non-Gaussian noise characteristics. Under such conditions, conventional filters tend to diverge, resulting in significant degradation of estimation accuracy. To overcome these challenges, this study proposes a square-root cubature Kalman filter enhanced with the maximum mixture correntropy criterion (MMCC-SCKF) to improve vehicle speed and VSA estimation under non-Gaussian noise conditions. The proposed method maps observation data into a high-dimensional feature space via kernel functions, emphasizing samples with small errors near the mean while assigning lower weights to outliers or samples with large errors far from the mean. This method reconstructs the measurement noise covariance matrix and efficiently mitigates the impact of non-Gaussian noise on system performance. The hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) testing results under different road adhesion conditions demonstrate that the proposed algorithm maintains superior VSA estimation accuracy despite the presence of non-Gaussian noise. Specifically, compared to the SCKF algorithm, the proposed method reduces the RMSE of the VSA by 62.50% on high-adhesion roads and by 66.67% on low-adhesion roads. The outcomes demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves notable gains in estimation precision, robustness, and dependability."

    "abstract": "Coastal regions of Small Island Developing States (SIDS) face mounting risks from sea-level rise, storm surge, wave action and socio-economic pressure. Traditional vulnerability indices typically employ fixed, expert-defined weights for hazard and exposure layers, which may not adequately reflect local conditions, especially in SIDS where data scarcity and environmental variability are prevalent. This can lead to a misrepresentation of effectiveness of solutions for reducing vulnerability, particularly nature based ones that play a crucial role in these contexts. We propose a data-driven framework that leverages feature importance values derived from an XGBoost model to assign objective weights to geological and ecological features. The model was trained to predict significant wave height, and the resulting feature importance values illustrate a data-driven weighting approach that can enhance the design and refinement of coastal vulnerability indices. In addition, Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) values were also computed to gain deeper insights into the marginal contribution of each predictor and to validate the robustness of the feature importance results. This framework provides a way to capture the relative influence of key factors, improve the representation of nature-based solutions and support more informed adaptation planning in many countries especially SIDS."

To date, only a few studies have examined the vulnerability of skeleton-based neural networks to evasion and backdoor attacks. In this paper, we propose BadHMP, a novel backdoor attack that targets specifically human motion prediction tasks. Our approach involves generating poisoned training samples by embedding a localized backdoor trigger in one limb of the skeleton, causing selected joints to follow predefined motion in historical time steps. Subsequently, the future sequences are globally modified that all the joints move following the target trajectories. Our carefully designed backdoor triggers and targets guarantee the smoothness and naturalness of the poisoned samples, making them stealthy enough to evade detection by the model trainer while keeping the poisoned model unobtrusive in terms of prediction fidelity to untainted sequences. The target sequences can be successfully activated by the designed input sequences even with a low poisoned sample injection ratio. Experimental results on two datasets (Human3.6M and CMU-Mocap) and two network architectures (LTD and HRI) demonstrate the high-fidelity, effectiveness, and stealthiness of BadHMP. Robustness of our attack against fine-tuning defense is also verified."

    "abstract": "A new version of smart wearable system for individual use presents itself while delivering a complete assessment of contemporary cardiac arrest tracking systems. The proposed system implements hybrid computing with machine literacy capabilities to provide immediate cardiac arrest detection and faster interventions by substituting slower cloud-processed mobile systems. On-device data processing takes place exclusively on the wearable device or the ESP32 and Jetson Nano and TinyML edge computing platforms because the system operates independently. The system delivers practical emergency applications because it improves data collection speed and minimizes internet dependency combined with superior energy performance through its independent operation. The paper presents both a description of the system components and decision framework while exploring present techniques alongside innovative technologies and health detectors. Explaining that immediate medical response remains vital while the investigation shows that automated anomaly detection operated by machines would boost cardiac arrest survival rates. The research utilizes Smart Wearable System technology to monitor cardiac arrests in real-time through Hybrid Computing with access to a mobile free solution."

A typical scenario involves enabling a machine agent to automatically assemble IKEA furniture using the provided parts. This paper presents HiFormer, a novel Hierarchical Transformer with Box-packed Positional Encoding, designed for highly automatic 3D part assembly. Our method addresses three important issues commonly encountered in 3D part assembly: 1) How to mitigate the overfitting problem associated with Transformer-based feature learning for 3D point clouds? 2) How to effectively model the relationships between the intragroup and intergroup parts? 3) How to compute positional encoding and integrate it into the Transformer for parts with diverse geometric forms in the coarse-to-fine assembly process? These challenges are tackled through three key contributions: 1) a multi-task 3D Swin Transformer with a two-stage training strategy for feature extraction, 2) a novel hierarchical Transformer for capturing part relationships at flattening, intragroup, and intergroup levels, and 3) an innovative box-packed positional encoding that enhances the Transformer by incorporating query, key, and value information derived from relative box positions. On the PartNet benchmark, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art PWH-MP model on three representative categories-Chair, Table, and Lamp-, achieving average improvements of 2.84% in Part Accuracy (PA) and 3.72% in Connection Accuracy (CA) for diversity modeling (with noise), and 3.55% in PA and 3.21% in CA for deterministic modeling (without noise)."

This article attempts to design an actuator operation pattern switching-based faulty performance self-healing control (AOPS-based FPShC) scheme for the STP subject to multiple actuator faults. Therein, the total actuator operation patterns are established to provide a search library for the candidate actuator replacement, and the correlation entropy-based switching decision logics are designed for triggering the automatic switching between different actuator operation patterns. Through the implementation of residual transformation and performance function, the user-defined performance requirements imposed on the process output are realized, thereby restraining the continuous performance degradation caused by the delayed operation pattern switching. The low-pass filtering technique is invoked in the control design to deal with the coupled process dynamic. Then, the regulation performance analysis is carried out by a Lyapunov stability theorem to show the applicability of AOPS-based FPShC scheme. Finally, the experiment results testing on a STP platform validate that the proposed scheme can realize the operation pattern switching, user-defined performance requirements and faulty performance self-recovery."

In this paper, an innovative data fusion method is proposed, which integrates multi-source remote sensing data and adopts a forest coverage-based hierarchical optimization modeling strategy to construct a machine learning(ML) model for understory terrain estimation. Specifically, we utilize multi-modal spaceborne LiDAR data (GEDI and ICESat 2), Sentinel data, high-precision digital elevation models(DEMs), forest structural parameters, and topographic factors to build ML models following the forest cover hierarchical strategy. The experimental results show that among the evaluated ML algorithms, the Random Forest (RF) model achieves the optimal performance, improving the accuracy of understory terrain by 51% at the regional scale compared with FABDEM(RMSE reduction from 6.78m to 3.30m). In addition, the hierarchical modeling based on forest cover further enhances the accuracy by 13% (to 2.85m RMSE)in Oregon study area. The study also reveals that the accuracy of understory terrain is affected by forest types and soil properties; particularly, forest types with dense canopies and complex structures, as well as loose-textured soils susceptible to vegetation interference, exert a significant impact on the accuracy."

    "abstract": "With the advancement of smart grids, the reliable monitoring of operating mechanisms in GIS circuit breakers has become a key factor in ensuring the safe operation of power systems. This study proposes a condition monitoring method for spring operating mechanisms based on MEMS pressure sensors. A miniaturized MEMS sensor is innovatively embedded inside the breaker's operating mechanism to directly measure the closing spring force, enabling precise monitoring of the energy storage, closing, and opening processes. Compared with conventional indirect methods relying on coil current or motor current signals, the proposed approach provides more direct mechanical information and, through multi-signal collaborative analysis, allows for more accurate identification of key operating stages and state transitions. The method is systematically validated by theoretical modeling, ANSYS simulation, laboratory experiments, and field tests. The results demonstrate that the MEMS pressure sensor significantly improves monitoring accuracy and stability, while its miniaturized and non-intrusive design ensures negligible impact on the mechanism's structure and normal operation. Furthermore, experimental measurements show strong consistency with theoretical calculations and simulation results, confirming the engineering feasibility of the method. This work not only enhances the accuracy of operating mechanism condition identification but also provides new technical support for intelligent maintenance and fault prediction of GIS circuit breakers, offering important practical value."

In comparison with the conventional and finite-time prescribed performance control (PPC) methods subject to the initial value constraint, the proposed prescribed-time PPC scheme blends the FAS approach with the speed transformation, guaranteeing the full-state asymptotic tracking with prescribed-time prescribed performance. First, a basic fully actuated controller is introduced, yielding a closed-loop tracking error system with a linear dominant part. Second, the speed transformation is applied to the closed-loop system, converting the initial PPC problem into the asymptotic convergence problem of the transferred error system and completely eliminating the initial value constraint. Third, the auxiliary control input and adaptive law embedded with positive integrable time-varying functions are devised, ensuring the boundedness of all closed-loop signals and the desired performance. Simulation studies are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the presented control strategy."

    "abstract": "Functional brain network (FBN) analysis aims to enhance the understanding of brain organization and support the diagnosis of neurological and psychiatric disorders. Prior studies have shown that FBNs exhibit small-world topology, where brain regions form functional clusters, and abnormalities in these clusters are strongly associated with disease. However, current learning-based methods either ignore this special topological structure or impose it as a post-hoc step outside the learning process, limiting both performance and interpretability. In this paper, we propose Learning Optimal Spectral Clustering (LOSC), a new framework that integrates the FBN generation, clustering, and classification with a novel graph theory grounded loss to fully exploit the small-world topology. Firstly, LOSC learns brain connectivity in a nonlinear spatio–spectral embedding space, guided by our proposed Rayleigh Quotient Loss (RQL), to preserve the small-world properties in generated FBNs. Then, the FBNs are partitioned into clusters of functionally synchronized regions, and both intra- and inter-cluster relations are utilized for brain network classification. Our contributions are threefold: (1) Improved brain network classification accuracy: by leveraging small-world functional clusters, LOSC achieves consistent gains of 2.0%, 3.6%, and 2.6% on the ABIDE, ADHD-200, and HCP datasets compared with state-of-the-art models, respectively; (2) Theoretical grounding: with our proposed RQL, LOSC bridges the gap between the graph theory and learning-based FBN analysis; and (3) Interpretability: the discovered functional clusters align with known neuropathology and contribute to the discovery of new functional community biomarkers."

Vibration stimulation was applied to the left biceps brachii in six participants, and the amount of induced responses was evaluated under conditions where the skin surface temperature was varied within a range of 9° C to 40° C. The experimental results show that a decrease in skin surface temperature due to cooling stimulation was associated with an increase in the amount of induced TVR and KI. Conversely, an increase in skin surface temperature due to warming stimulation was associated with a decrease in the amount of induced TVR and KI. The results of this study suggest that the addition of thermal stimulation is promising as one of the control parameters for controlling the amount of TVR to generate the intended movement and the amount of KI to generate the moving sensation in robotic motor rehabilitation systems."

    "abstract": "This paper addresses bus-voltage regulation in a multi-converter DC microgrid feeding constant power loads (CPLs), where the negative incremental impedance of CPLs and the right-half-plane zero of boost converters reduce damping and may destabilize the system. The test system consists of four second-order boost converters supplying a 48 V DC bus and two CPLs regulated at 35 V and 40 V. A fractional-order PID (FOPID) controller is designed for the bus-voltage loop, and its five parameters are tuned via the Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) algorithm using bounded search ranges and time-domain performance indices. The fractional differ-integral operators are realized through a band-limited Oustaloup approximation, enabling digital implementation. Simulation results show that, compared with a GWO-tuned integer-order PID, the proposed FOPID–GWO scheme reduces bus-voltage overshoot from about 18.7% to below 3%, shortens the 2% settling time from 0.24 s to 0.08 s, and decreases the ITAE index by nearly 80% under nominal conditions. Under 50% load-step uncertainties and injected sensor noise, the FOPID controller maintains accurate tracking of the bus and CPL reference voltages and preserves high overall efficiency 93.4%. A numerical eigenvalue and sensitivity analysis confirms left-half-plane closed-loop poles and acceptable robustness margins, indicating a stable and robust solution for DC microgrids with CPLs."

Traditional linear and statistical models often fail to capture the complex, non-linear patterns inherent in these dynamic environments.

Five forecasting techniques namely Multiple Linear Regression, Support Vector Machine, XGBoost, ARIMA, and SARIMA are evaluated using a high-resolution dataset from the city of Tetouan. Through rigorous preprocessing and performance evaluation (RMSE, MAE, R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>), XGBoost emerges as the most accurate and context-sensitive model. The results highlight the importance of integrating socio-climatic variables and domain-specific features to improve forecasting performance in emerging contexts. This work offers a scalable, data-driven framework for informed energy planning, providing valuable insights for policymakers and infrastructure developers in emerging countries."

    "abstract": "Real-time anomaly detection is a crucial factor for keeping up the performance and safety of rapidly advancing optical systems. Often, centralized approaches face high latency and bandwidth limits, so they are not able to detect anomalies as soon as necessary. A new edge-computing architecture with deep learning is proposed in this work to offer fast and accurate anomaly detection in sophisticated optical settings. Unlike traditional methods, the proposed system relies on edge nodes to do local data processing, which greatly cuts latency and eases network pressure. With the use of CNN and RNN neural networks, the system can precisely spot anomalies in real-time optical signaling. To ensure fast responses, a compact model compression approach is used, keeping the detection accuracy high while lowering the computational costs. Experimental results show that the proposed framework detects more anomalies and responds faster than existing centralized systems, which points to its suitability for critical optical infrastructure use. The edge-based system makes anomalies easier to spot quickly while also making the system tougher, which is why it suits next-generation optical communications. This joint use of deep learning and edge computing is a major leap forward in meeting the latency and scalability needs of real-time monitoring in optical technology."

This paper establishes an asymmetric dynamic gap simulation model for Huaming OLTC transition contacts based on fluid-solid-electric coupling theory. It uses an improved SST k−ω turbulence model and Euler-Lagrange method to analyze flow field evolution and metal particle motion, and explores the effects of initial particle concentration and voltage on migration. Simulation results show that the \"inflow from wide gap, outflow from narrow gap\" flow field drives particles to accumulate on the narrow gap side, forming an inclined \"bridge\" and causing local electric field distortion. At 10 kV, fluid drag force dominates particle motion, and higher initial concentration accelerates \"bridge\" formation. The study provides a theoretical basis for OLTC transition contact insulation design and fault prevention."

It maintains these routes as long as they are needed by the sources. Additionally, SAODV forms trees which connect multicast group members. The trees are composed of the group members and the nodes needed to connect the members. Extensive simulations are conducted to study the power consumption, the end-to-end delay, and the network throughput of our protocols compared with existing protocols. Efficiently handling losses in wireless environments, therefore, has significant importance. Even under benign conditions, various factors, like fading, interference, multi-path effects, and collisions, lead to heavy loss rates on wireless links."

A multi-point mass based safety braking model (SBM) are established, taking into account the delay characteristics of air braking systems. A multi-modal safety protection model (SPM) incorporating various braking rates is constructed. By comprehensively considering coupler force constraints and safe stopping requirements, a multi-objective optimization model is formulated to solve the SPM. We test the proposed approach on a concrete heavy haul railway line in China. The results show that, compared with traditional fixed-rate braking models, the proposed method reduces the peak coupler force from 1650 kN to approximately 1250 kN, achieving a 24 % reduction."

Given an arbitrary linear program with d variables and n inequality constraints, Spielman and Teng proved that the simplex method runs in time O(σ<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">−30</sup>d<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">55</sup>n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">86</sup>), where σ > 0 is the standard deviation of Gaussian distributed noise added to the original LP data.

    "abstract": "A zero-knowledge proof demonstrates that a fact (like that a Sudoku puzzle has a solution) is true while, counterintuitively, revealing nothing else (like what the solution actually is). This remarkable guarantee is extremely useful in cryptographic applications, but it comes at a cost. A classical impossibility result by Goldreich and Oren [J. Cryptol. ‘94] shows that zeroknowledge proofs must necessarily sacrifice basic properties of traditional mathematical proofs - namely perfect soundness (that no proof of a false statement exists) and non-interactivity (that a proof can be transmitted in a single message). Contrary to this impossibility, we show that zero-knowledge with perfect soundness and no interaction is effectively possible. We do so by defining and constructing a powerful new relaxation of zero-knowledge. Intuitively, while the classical zero-knowledge definition requires that an object called a simulator actually exists, our new definition only requires that one cannot rule out that a simulator exists (in a particular logical sense). Using this, we show that every falsifiable security property of (classical) zero-knowledge can be achieved with no interaction, no setup, and perfect soundness. This enables us to remove interaction and setup from (classical) zero-knowledge in essentially all of its applications in the literature, at the relatively mild cost that such applications now have security that is “game-based” instead of “simulation-based.” Our construction builds on the work of Kuykendall and Zhandry [TCC ‘20] and relies on two central, longstanding, and well-studied assumptions that we show are also necessary. The first is the existence of non-interactive witness indistinguishable proofs, which follows from standard assumptions in cryptography. The second is Krajíček and Pudlák’s 1989 conjecture that no optimal proof system exists. This is one of the main conjectures in the field of proof complexity and is the natural finitistic analogue of the impossibility of Hilbert’s second problem (and, hence, also Gödel’s incompleteness theorem). Our highlevel idea is to use these assumptions to construct a prover and verifier where no simulator exists, but the non-existence of a simulator is independent (in the logical sense of unprovability) of an arbitrarily strong logical system. One such logical system is the standard axioms of mathematics: ZFC."

To verify the protocol performance, an experimental environment was built based on Raspberry Pi, and tests were carried out from two aspects of efficiency and communication overhead. In the communication link, the transmission time was shortened by an average of about 15%, and the communication overhead was reduced by an average of about 30% compared with traditional authenticated transmission.

The model utilizes 1D-CNN to automatically extract discriminative features from raw vibration signals, enhancing the feature extraction process with techniques like batch normalization, Dropout, and Gaussian noise injection. A fuzzy rule learning mechanism, based on Type 1 inference and K-means (K-means clustering), enables multi-rule weighted fuzzy classification. Evaluation results on the CWRU (Case Western Reserve University) and Jiangnan University bearing datasets show that CNN-T1FLS achieves 99.8% accuracy on the CWRU dataset, outperforming SVM (Support Vector Machine), KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors), 1D-CNN, WD-CNN (Wavelet Denoising Convolutional Neural Network), Bi-LSTM (Bidirectional Long-Short Term Memory Network), Bi-GRU (Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit), the standalone T1FLS (Type 1 Fuzzy Logic System) and MS-DSCNN-SA(Multi-Scale Depth wise Separable Convolutional Neural Network Integrated with Spatial Attention Mechanism)by 3%-13%.

    "abstract": "Driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI) remains a major contributor to traffic accidents worldwide, with risk increasing exponentially as blood alcohol concentration (BAC) rises. This study investigated 120 participants (80 men, 40 women; aged 18–65) in a controlled driving simulation. Each completed two sessions, one sober and one with a BAC between 0.6 ‰ and 1.0 ‰, to assess alcohol-related impairment. Subjective self-assessment was measured using pre- and post-driving questionnaires, while objective impairment was evaluated through baseline tests including reaction time, walk-and-turn, and time estimation. Breath alcohol concentration (BrAC) was recorded as a reference. Statistical analyses (t-tests, MANOVA, multiple regression) examined performance differences and associations between BrAC, test results, and self-assessments. Results revealed significant impairments in motor and cognitive performance under alcohol, with the walk-and-turn test showing the strongest correlation with BrAC. Self-assessments also reflected intoxication, suggesting awareness of impairment. Unsupervised k-means clustering identified three distinct impairment profiles, showing that functional impairment cannot be determined by BrAC alone. The findings provide a validated ground truth for developing detection algorithms based on behavioral indicators such as driving and gaze behavior. This study lays the foundation for data-driven approaches to DUI prevention and context-aware driver support."

    "abstract": "This study investigated the long-term effects of a voice-based stepwise driver-assistance system providing either real-time feedback alone or feedback plus advice. Ten experienced drivers completed six weekly drives on an urban route with two accident-prone areas. Weekly acceptance ratings and behavioral readiness metrics (stepwise score, mean speed, throttle-off count, foot-on-brake count, brake-on count, and lateral checks) were collected. Acceptance was analyzed via two-way ANOVA (Week × Group); behavioral retention in a pre feedback zone (Area 1) was assessed using linear mixed-effects models. Although both systems showed good acceptance, feedback with advice yielded significantly higher and more stable usefulness ratings. Advice recipients showed larger, sustained speed reductions (3.5–4.4 km/h from Week 4, p < 0.01) and persistent readiness-behavior improvements, unlike the feedback-only group, which showed limited improvement. Notably, in Area 1, advice-trained drivers maintained these improved behaviors without active feedback, indicating habit internalization. Thus, stepwise feedback and advice tailored to driver readiness may lower learning difficulty and psychological reactance to enhancing readiness behavior. Overall, this spaced-learning approach using feedback with advice appears effective for attenuating alert fatigue, maintaining acceptance, and transforming momentary corrections into lasting safe driving habits, even in experienced drivers."

    "abstract": "Modularization of large-scale space structures and assembling them on orbit can effectively overcome the constraints imposed by the limited payload capacity of rocket launches. Compared with a single manipulator, the collaboration of two manipulators provides advantages in handling complex assembly tasks and enhancing efficiency. However, the interaction between the manipulators must be considered during the path planning process. This paper addresses the path planning problem of dual 7-DOF space manipulators in on-orbit assembly scenarios. The master-slave planning mode and the artificial potential field method are used to achieve fast and safe path planning for the two manipulators. A distance calculation model between the two manipulators is proposed, enabling the slave manipulator to avoid collisions with the moving master manipulator dynamically. A variable joint angle increment method is introduced to reduce the number of planning steps. Finally, the path planning method is verified through simulation. The results demonstrate the applicability of the developed path planning method for dual space manipulators performing on-orbit assembly tasks."

    "abstract": "Grid resilience is severely challenged by the increasing frequency and intensity of hurricane impacts on distribution networks (DNs). To address this, a bilevel resilience-oriented planning model based on the system of systems (SoS) approach is introduced, where decentralized microgrid operators (MGOs) and a distribution system operator (DSO) share decision-making roles. At the upper level, the DSO uses the Uncertain Energy Supply Index (UESI) as a risk-based metric to allocate line hardening investments. At the lower level, MGOs invest in local assets to minimize their own costs while ensuring the resilience of their islanded operation. The framework is tested on a modified IEEE 33-bus test system and is formulated and solved as a MILP optimization problem. Results indicate that the coordinated SoS approach improves system resilience, increasing the System Adequacy Index (SAI) by 6.1% over centralized planning through a balanced mix of grid hardening and localized, risk-averse investments."

    "abstract": "Accurate inductor characterization is essential for high-density, integrated switch-mode power supplies (SMPS), as parameters such as core nonlinearity, amplitude permeability, apparent permeability, and air gaps have a strong impact on the performance of the converter. Existing measurement techniques for characterization of inductor often require bulky equipment or modifications to the SMPS circuit, limiting on the fly measurement. This paper introduces a novel method for inductor characterization, which enables direct extraction of amplitude permeability and average core loss under normal operating of SMPS circuit without the need for fast ADCs or circuit changes. As a practical demonstration, the method is applied to miniaturized planar inductors, revealing their dynamic permeability behavior across varying excitation and frequency. Experimental results confirm that the proposed method is accurate and can be seamlessly embedded into switching power supplies, enabling real-time extraction of inductor characteristics. This capability provides valuable information for improving converter control, enhancing efficiency, and ensuring reliable operation under varying load conditions."

    "abstract": "Lung cancer is one of the most common and serious diseases present around the world, which is observed in people of all age groups ranging from children to old people. Annually it costs a lot of money for the cure and diagnosis of people with lung cancer. The existing clinical techniques such as X-Ray and other imaging procedures require complex hardware and considerable expense. Thus the most important issue is the prediction to be accurate and to use a reliable method for that. This raises the need for (comparatively more effective and cheaper) machine learning models in medical diagnosis using medical data sets. Long-term tobacco smoking results in 85 percent of cases of lung cancer. About 10–15 percent of cases arise in people who never smoked. There are numerous methods and tools that are available now for data analysis and its computation. These technological advancements will be referred and used to develop prediction models in the project to predict the presence of lung cancer at an early stage in a patient.The study involves comparing various classification and ensemble models such as Support Vector Machine(SVM), K- Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Random Forest(RF), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and a hybrid model, Voting classifier. The performance of the various models is compared and evaluated in terms of their accuracy. Thus, it is easy to identify a patient with lung cancer at an early stage using various sophisticated technologies of today."

This paper investigates dynamic pricing mechanisms for grid-connected EV parking lots integrated into LECs with peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading. The proposed framework models the EV parking lot as both a flexible consumer and an energy storage system (ESS) through vehicle-to-grid (V2G) capabilities. Within the community, prosumers engage in bilateral energy exchanges to maximize mutual benefits, while user privacy is preserved using the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) algorithm. Simulation results on a representative LEC test system demonstrate that combining P2P trading with dynamic pricing reduces community energy costs, enhances renewable energy utilization, and mitigates peak demand. The findings highlight the potential of dynamic pricing to influence EV charging and discharging behaviors, thereby supporting grid flexibility and reliability in high-renewable environments."

A generalized averaging method is employed to model the converter and derive its SFG model, and a diagram is drawn to verify whether the theoretical issues raised are valid.

    "abstract": "Integrating rooftop wind turbines (RWTs) into urban environments presents a substantial opportunity for decentralized renewable energy. Still, it is hindered by the intricate aerodynamic interactions induced by urban structures. This investigation establishes an AI-assisted framework for planning the placement of RWTs in urban environments. The MiDaS depth estimation model is employed to convert 2-D satellite imagery into a detailed 3-D terrain model, which is necessary to analyze wind flow accurately. This process captures the geometries of buildings. Machine learning techniques are employed to analyze and generate wind data from NASA POWER at different hub heights, enabling accurate wind speed prediction. The prevailing wind patterns are identified through wind speed distributions and directional analyses. At the same time, the velocity deficits and disturbances caused by urban obstacles are quantified using an updated Jensen multiwake model. The proposed methodology has been applied and validated in two Indian cities, Barmer and Jaipur, Rajasthan, India. The results indicate that there were substantial power losses and reductions in wind speed. Building-induced wakes, modeled via the Jensen multiwake approach, reduced turbine output and caused significant seasonal fluctuations in capacity factors: Barmer—12.24% loss (2370→2080 kWh); Jaipur—17.53% loss (1540→1270 kWh). Comparative analyses underscore the critical impact of urban morphology on RWT performance. The proposed methodology is a data-driven, robust instrument for optimizing turbine placement, intending to improve the efficiency and reliability of urban wind energy systems. Consequently, it contributes to sustainable urban energy planning and decentralized power generation."

This letter presents a decomposed resistance, inductance, conductance and capacitance (RLGC) model to fast evaluate the impact of FWE on high-speed signals. The circuit model is generated directly from the physical dimensions of the transmission lines (TLs) and the parameters of the glass fiber. Compared to previous 3-D and 2-D physical modeling methods, the proposed method reduces computational complexity and saves a great deal of computing resources. The simulated results show high consistency with 3-D simulations by HFSS. The mean error of time skews of several glass types between HFSS, and the proposed model is 3.05%. The proposed method provides a promising method for fast FWE modeling."

This neglect may increase the risk of cardiovascular problems and subsequently diminish overall health. To address this, we develop a machine learning approach capable of detecting and categorizing stress into three classes: no stress, time pressure, and interruption. We compared the performance of several algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Gaussian Naïve Bayes (GNB), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). Our experiments showed that KNN provided superior accuracy for this classification task. The SWELL dataset contains recordings of heart rate variability (HRV), as well as accompanying measures such as facial movements, posture, ECG signals, and skin conductance. Our results indicate potential applications for individualized intervention strategies, real-time monitoring platforms, and preventive mental health care by enabling earlier recognition and prompt assistance for those under stress. Using the SWELL dataset, our system attained an accuracy of 99.48 %, demonstrating robust performance in differentiating stress categories."

    "source": "IEEE",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we present the first dynamic algorithms for Dyck edit distance and tree edit distance that achieve subpolynomial update times. Dyck edit distance measures how far a parenthesis string is from a wellparenthesized expression (i.e., the Dyck language), while tree edit distance quantifies the minimum number of node insertions, deletions, and substitutions required to transform one rooted, ordered, and labeled tree into another. These problems have been studied extensively since the 1970s, with recent advances in both algorithmic efficiency and fine-grained complexity lower bounds. Despite this progress, no prior work has addressed efficient dynamic algorithms for these problems, even though many real-world applications involve evolving structured data such as LaTeX, JSON, XML, HTML, hierarchical datasets, and RNA secondary structures. We take the first step in this direction by designing new approximation algorithms for Dyck and tree edit distances in the dynamic setting. Our key technical contribution is a set of novel reduction and decomposition techniques that transform instances of Dyck and tree edit distance into efficiently maintainable instances of string edit distance. Leveraging existing dynamic algorithms for string edit distance, we obtain an $n^{o(1)}$ approximation for Dyck edit distance with $n^{o(1)}$ update time. This builds upon and significantly extends prior work on Dyck language decomposition ([Saha, FOCS’14] and [Koucký & Saks; SODA’23]). For tree edit distance, we introduce a new static reduction that improves the best-known approximation bound from $O\\left(n^{3 / 4}\\right)$ [Akutsu, Fukagawa, and Takasu; Algorithmica, 2010] to $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{n})$. Moreover, while the previous result was restricted to constant-degree trees, ours holds for arbitrary trees. We then extend our reduction dynamically, yielding a dynamic tree edit distance algorithm with an approximation factor of $n^{1 / 2+o(1)}$ and update time $n^{o(1)}$. A core component of our approach is a new dynamic maintenance algorithm for heavy-light decomposition, a widely used technique in tree algorithms. Given its broad applicability, we believe this result is of independent interest. Finally, we introduce a novel static and dynamic decomposition method that achieves an $\\tilde{O}(k)$-approximation for tree edit distance when the tree edit distance is at most k; combined with the trivial bound $k \\leq n$, this yields a deterministic $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{n})$-approximation. While similar decompositions exist for strings, no prior work has successfully extended them to trees. Our approach breaks this barrier, improving the best-known approximations for tree edit distance both in the static and dynamic setting. In the static setting, our algorithm runs in $\\tilde{O}(n)$ time; in the dynamic setting, it only requires a polylogarithmic worst-case update time. The state-of-the-art near-lineartime static algorithm for tree edit distance previously achieved an $O(\\sqrt{n})$-approximation [Boroujeni, Ghodsi, Hajiaghayi, and Seddighin; STOC’19]."
