    "abstract": "The $α$ decay provides valuable constraints on nuclear structure and plays an essential role in identifying heavy and superheavy nuclei. We study $α$-decay half-lives of 178 even-even nuclei within a semi-classical WKB framework using a phenomenological Woods-Saxon $α$-nucleus potential. The potential depth is determined by imposing the Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization condition (BSQC), ensuring a physically consistent description of the quasibound $α$-daughter system. To facilitate large-scale calculations, a global parametrization of the BSQC-constrained potential depth is constructed. The resulting half-lives reproduce experimental data with comparable accuracy for both the direct BSQC approach and the fitted prescription, providing a first step toward a global and computationally efficient description of $α$ decay."

    "abstract": "Coronary artery stenosis is a leading cause of cardiovascular disease, diagnosed by analyzing the coronary arteries from multiple angiography views. Although numerous deep-learning models have been proposed for stenosis detection from a single angiography view, their performance heavily relies on expensive view-level annotations, which are often not readily available in hospital systems. Moreover, these models fail to capture the temporal dynamics and dependencies among multiple views, which are crucial for clinical diagnosis. To address this, we propose SegmentMIL, a transformer-based multi-view multiple-instance learning framework for patient-level stenosis classification. Trained on a real-world clinical dataset, using patient-level supervision and without any view-level annotations, SegmentMIL jointly predicts the presence of stenosis and localizes the affected anatomical region, distinguishing between the right and left coronary arteries and their respective segments. SegmentMIL obtains high performance on internal and external evaluations and outperforms both view-level models and classical MIL baselines, underscoring its potential as a clinically viable and scalable solution for coronary stenosis diagnosis. Our code is available at https://github.com/NikolaCenic/mil-stenosis."

    "abstract": "Multimodal foundation models integrate heterogeneous signals across modalities, yet it remains poorly understood how their predictions depend on specific internal feature groups and whether such reliance can be deliberately controlled. Existing studies of shortcut and spurious behavior largely rely on post hoc analyses or feature removal, offering limited insight into whether reliance can be modulated without altering task semantics. We introduce FiLoRA (Focus-and-Ignore LoRA), an instruction-conditioned, parameter-efficient adaptation framework that enables explicit control over internal feature reliance while keeping the predictive objective fixed. FiLoRA decomposes adaptation into feature group-aligned LoRA modules and applies instruction-conditioned gating, allowing natural language instructions to act as computation-level control signals rather than task redefinitions. Across text--image and audio--visual benchmarks, we show that instruction-conditioned gating induces consistent and causal shifts in internal computation, selectively amplifying or suppressing core and spurious feature groups without modifying the label space or training objective. Further analyses demonstrate that FiLoRA yields improved robustness under spurious feature interventions, revealing a principled mechanism to regulate reliance beyond correlation-driven learning."

Meeting these requirements demands low-latency, fixed-precision computation under strict memory constraints, a regime in which conventional Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) are both inefficient and numerically unstable. We identify key properties of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) that align with these constraints. Specifically, we show that: (i) KAN updates exploiting B-spline locality are sparse, enabling superior on-chip resource scaling, and (ii) KANs are inherently robust to fixed-point quantization. By implementing fixed-point online training on Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), a representative platform for on-chip computation, we demonstrate that KAN-based online learners are significantly more efficient and expressive than MLPs across a range of low-latency and resource-constrained tasks. To our knowledge, this work is the first to demonstrate model-free online learning at sub-microsecond latencies."

Introducing relaxation through a relaxation-time dissipator, we identify the quantum metric as the origin of the leading entropy production, providing a direct microscopic diagnostic of dissipation in both the extrinsic Drude response and an intrinsic nonlinear Ohmic contribution controlled by quantum metric. We further predict an entropy Hall effect arising from the Berry curvature and show that it obeys an Onsager reciprocal relation with the anomalous Nernst effect under a temperature gradient. Finally, we establish universal relations connecting entropy and charge currents under DC and AC driving, offering experimentally accessible probes of quantum geometry through nonequilibrium entropy flow."

In particular we will show how the intersection matrix can detect hidden linear dependencies of the iterated integrals resulting from an $\\eps$-factorized differential equation, which are difficult to find otherwise. Furthermore, we will explain how the intersection matrix can help in deriving (polynomial) relations between the transcendental functions occurring in the rotation to the canonical basis.

We introduce a gated communication mechanism that dynamically determines when communication is necessary based on environmental context and agent states. Experimental evaluation on challenging coordination tasks demonstrates that our method achieves 181.8% performance improvement over no-communication baselines while reducing bandwidth usage by 41.4%. Comprehensive Pareto frontier analysis shows dominance across the entire success-bandwidth spectrum with area-under-curve of 0.198 vs 0.142 for next-best methods.

Here, we demonstrate a broadband metasurface platform capable of performing diverse analog image processing operations on both amplitude- and phase-encoded inputs. This platform is realized using a single-layer dielectric metasurface designed through an end-to-end, task-driven inverse design framework. By tailoring the spatial-frequency components of incident image wavefronts, the metasurface implements analog operations such as edge detection and pattern recognition across a 200nm wavelength bandwidth in the visible spectrum. Furthermore, we develop a compact processor architecture that integrates imaging and computation within a reduced optical footprint. These results establish a flexible and compact metasurface-based optical processor with strong potential for integration into practical imaging and optical computing systems."

This system contains of a compressible Navier-Stokes system for the density and momentum of a fluid, and a transport equation for the potential temperature of the fluid. In stark contrast to the well-known Navier-Stokes-Fourier (NSF) system where the temperature satisfies a parabolic type equation providing dissipative effect for the temperature and the density, the temperature in our NST system enjoys a transport equation which precludes a dissipative mechanism for the density, leading to significant different effects to the whole system. We first establish the global well-posedness of strong solutions to the compressible NST system in critical Besov spaces over $\\mathbb{R}^d$ with $d \\geq 2$. Furthermore, by introducing the Mach number $\\varepsilon > 0$, we rigorously prove the low Mach number limit as $\\varepsilon \\to 0$, showing that the solutions converge to that of the incompressible inhomogeneous Navier-Stokes system. This singular limit holds globally in time, even for {\\it ill-prepared} initial data. To address the challenge posed by the lack of dissipation on the density and temperature, we develop a refined energy analysis and establish optimal time decay rates for strong solutions in $\\mathbb{R}^d$ with $d \\geq 3$. Notably, the density remains uniformly bounded in time, displaying asymptotic behavior fundamentally distinct from that in the NSF system, where the density possesses a dissipative structure via the momentum and temperature equations and exhibits temporal decay."

Existing mitigation approaches primarily rely on either external post-hoc verification or mapping uncertainty directly to abstention during fine-tuning, often resulting in overly conservative behavior. We propose VeriFY, a training-time framework that teaches LLMs to reason about factual uncertainty through consistency-based self-verification. VeriFY augments training with structured verification traces that guide the model to produce an initial answer, generate and answer a probing verification query, issue a consistency judgment, and then decide whether to answer or abstain. To address the risk of reinforcing hallucinated content when training on augmented traces, we introduce a stage-level loss masking approach that excludes hallucinated answer stages from the training objective while preserving supervision over verification behavior. Across multiple model families and scales, VeriFY reduces factual hallucination rates by 9.7 to 53.3 percent, with only modest reductions in recall (0.4 to 5.7 percent), and generalizes across datasets when trained on a single source. The source code, training data, and trained model checkpoints will be released upon acceptance."

Most existing DG approaches focus on learning domain-invariant representations under the assumption of conditional distribution shift (i.e., primarily addressing changes in $P(X\\mid Y)$ while assuming $P(Y)$ remains stable). However, real-world scenarios with multiple domains often involve compound distribution shifts where both the marginal label distribution $P(Y)$ and the conditional distribution $P(X\\mid Y)$ vary simultaneously. To address this, we propose a unified framework for robust domain generalization under divergent marginal and conditional distributions. We derive a novel risk bound for unseen domains by explicitly decomposing the joint distribution into marginal and conditional components and characterizing risk gaps arising from both sources of divergence. To operationalize this bound, we design a meta-learning procedure that minimizes and validates the proposed risk bound across seen domains, ensuring strong generalization to unseen ones. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance not only on conventional DG benchmarks but also in challenging multi-domain long-tailed recognition settings where both marginal and conditional shifts are pronounced."

Yet this capability also increases hallucinations, where the model generates content that is not supported by the input image or the question. To understand this failure mode, we identify \\emph{reasoning drift}: during clue gathering, the model over-focuses on question-irrelevant entities, diluting focus on task-relevant cues and gradually decoupling the reasoning trace from visual grounding. As a consequence, many inference-time localization or intervention methods developed for non-reasoning models fail to pinpoint the true clues in reasoning settings. Motivated by these insights, we introduce ClueRecall, a metric for assessing visual clue retrieval, and present ClueTracer, a training-free, parameter-free, and architecture-agnostic plugin for hallucination suppression. ClueTracer starts from the question and traces how key clues propagate along the model's reasoning pathway (question $\\rightarrow$ outputs $\\rightarrow$ visual tokens), thereby localizing task-relevant patches while suppressing spurious attention to irrelevant regions. Remarkably, \\textbf{without any additional training}, ClueTracer improves all \\textbf{reasoning} architectures (including \\texttt{R1-OneVision}, \\texttt{Ocean-R1}, \\texttt{MM-Eureka}, \\emph{etc}.) by $\\mathbf{1.21\\times}$ on reasoning benchmarks.

Recent approaches leverage generalizable models to generate 3D scenes using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) primitive.

To address this issue, we present SurfSplat, a feedforward framework based on 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) primitive, which provides stronger anisotropy and higher geometric precision. By incorporating a surface continuity prior and a forced alpha blending strategy, SurfSplat reconstructs coherent geometry together with faithful textures. Furthermore, we introduce High-Resolution Rendering Consistency (HRRC), a new evaluation metric designed to evaluate high-resolution reconstruction quality. Extensive experiments on RealEstate10K, DL3DV, and ScanNet demonstrate that SurfSplat consistently outperforms prior methods on both standard metrics and HRRC, establishing a robust solution for high-fidelity 3D reconstruction from sparse inputs.

A novel sequential metaphor, the position-aware generalized Chinese restaurant process, provides a constructive foundation for this theory and supports practical algorithmic design. Exchangeable random permutations offer flexible priors for a wide range of inferential problems centered on permutations. As an application, we develop a Bayesian model for graph matching that integrates a correlated stochastic block model with our novel class of priors. The cycle structure of the matching is linked to latent node partitions that explain connectivity patterns, an assumption consistent with the homogeneity requirement underlying the graph matching task itself. Posterior inference is performed through a node-wise blocked Gibbs sampler directly enabled by the proposed sequential construction. To summarize posterior uncertainty, we introduce perSALSO, an adaptation of SALSO to the permutation domain that provides principled point estimation and interpretable posterior summaries. Together, these contributions establish a unified probabilistic framework for modeling, inference, and uncertainty quantification over permutations."

Yet, training SNNs under fine temporal discretization remains a major challenge, hindering both low-latency responsiveness and the mapping of software-trained SNNs to efficient hardware. In current approaches, spiking neurons are modeled as self-recurrent units, embedded into recurrent networks to maintain state over time, and trained with BPTT or RTRL variants based on surrogate gradients. These methods scale poorly with temporal resolution, while online approximations often exhibit instability for long sequences and tend to fail at capturing temporal patterns precisely. To address these limitations, we develop spiking neurons with internal recursive memory structures that we combine with sigma-delta spike-coding. We show that this SpikingGamma model supports direct error backpropagation without surrogate gradients, can learn fine temporal patterns with minimal spiking in an online manner, and scale feedforward SNNs to complex tasks and benchmarks with competitive accuracy, all while being insensitive to the temporal resolution of the model. Our approach offers both an alternative to current recurrent SNNs trained with surrogate gradients, and a direct route for mapping SNNs to neuromorphic hardware."

Existing attempts to bridge this gap primarily rely on retrieving successful past trajectories as demonstrations. However, this paradigm faces two critical limitations. First, by focusing solely on success, agents overlook the rich pedagogical value embedded in failed attempts, preventing them from identifying and avoiding recurrent pitfalls. Second, continually accumulating textual experiences not only increases the time consumption during retrieval but also inevitably introduces noise and exhausts the largest context window of current LLMs. To address these challenges, we propose a novel self-evolving framework for LLM agents that introduces a complementary evolution mechanism: First, a contrastive reflection strategy is introduced to explicitly summarize error-prone patterns and capture reusable insights. Second, we propose a self-consolidation mechanism that distills non-parametric textual experience into compact learnable parameters. This enables the agent to internalize extensive historical experience directly into its latent space. Extensive experiments demonstrate the advantages of our method in long-term agent evolution."

Here we propose a framework for sustained human-AI interaction that rests on invariant features of human cognition and human--AI interaction and centers on three interlinked phenomena: entanglement between users and AI systems, the emergence of cognitive and behavioral drift over repeated interactions, and the role of metacognition in the awareness and regulation of these dynamics. As conversational agents provide cues (e.g., fluency, coherence, responsiveness) that people treat as informative, subjective confidence and action readiness may increase without corresponding gains in epistemic reliability, making drift difficult to detect and correct. We describe these dynamics across micro-, meso-, and macro-levels. The framework identifies four metacognitive intervention points and psychologically informed interventions that provide metacognitive scaffolding (boosting and self-nudging). Finally, we outline a long-horizon research agenda for scientific foresight."

    "abstract": "Large Language Models have recently shown impressive capabilities in reasoning and code generation, making them promising tools for natural language interfaces to relational databases. However, existing approaches often fail to generalize in complex, real-world settings due to the highly database-specific nature of SQL reasoning, which requires deep familiarity with unique schemas, ambiguous semantics, and intricate join paths. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel two-stage LLM-based framework that decouples knowledge acquisition from query generation. In the Exploration Stage, the system autonomously constructs a database-specific knowledge base by navigating the schema with a Monte Carlo Tree Search-inspired strategy, generating triplets of schema fragments, executable queries, and natural language descriptions as usage examples. In the Deployment Stage, a dual-agent system leverages the collected knowledge as in-context examples to iteratively retrieve relevant information and generate accurate SQL queries in response to user questions. This design enables the agent to proactively familiarize itself with unseen databases and handle complex, multi-step reasoning. Extensive experiments on large-scale benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly improves accuracy over strong baselines, highlighting its effectiveness and generalizability."

    "abstract": "Diffusion models have become widely popular for automated floorplan generation, producing highly realistic layouts conditioned on user-defined constraints. However, optimizing for perceptual metrics such as the Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) causes limited design diversity. To address this, we propose the Diversity Score (DS), a metric that quantifies layout diversity under fixed constraints. Moreover, to improve geometric consistency, we introduce a Boundary Cross-Attention (BCA) module that enables conditioning on building boundaries. Our experiments show that BCA significantly improves boundary adherence, while prolonged training drives diversity collapse undiagnosed by FID, revealing a critical trade-off between realism and diversity. Out-Of-Distribution evaluations further demonstrate the models' reliance on dataset priors, emphasizing the need for generative systems that explicitly balance fidelity, diversity, and generalization in architectural design tasks."

This enables highly dynamic interaction control while preserving the wide workspace of the robot. Traditionally, position control is assigned to the macro manipulator, while the micro manipulator handles the interaction with the environment, limiting the achievable interaction control bandwidth. To solve this, we propose a novel control architecture that incorporates the macro manipulator into the active interaction control. This leads to a increase in control bandwidth by a factor of 2.1 compared to the state of the art architecture, based on the leader-follower approach and factor 12.5 compared to traditional robot-based force control. Further we propose surrogate models for a more efficient controller design and easy adaptation to hardware changes. We validate our approach by comparing it against the other control schemes in different experiments, like collision with an object, following a force trajectory and industrial assembly tasks."

Understanding and ultimately mitigating these errors calls for real-time detection of quasiparticle tunneling events on individual devices. In this work, we simultaneously detect quasiparticle tunneling events in two co-housed, charge-sensitive transmons coupled to a common waveguide. We measure background quasiparticle tunneling rates at the single-hertz level, with temporal resolution of tens of microseconds. Using time-tagged coincidence analysis, we show that individual events are uncorrelated across devices, whereas burst episodes occur about once per minute and are largely correlated. These bursts have a characteristic lifetime of 7 ms and induce a thousand-fold increase in the quasiparticle tunneling rate across both devices. In addition, we identify a rarer subset of bursts which are accompanied by a shift in the offset charge, at approximately one event per hour. Our results establish a practical and extensible method to identify quasiparticle bursts in superconducting circuits, as well as their correlations and spatial structure, advancing routes to suppress correlated errors in superconducting quantum processors."

The complex spatio-temporal dependencies and nonlinear dynamics of urban mobility networks further complicate few-shot learning across different cities. This paper proposes MCPST, a novel Multi-phase Consensus Spatio-Temporal framework for few-shot traffic forecasting that reconceptualises traffic prediction as a multi-phase consensus learning problem. Our framework introduces three core innovations: (1) a multi-phase engine that models traffic dynamics through diffusion, synchronisation, and spectral embeddings for comprehensive dynamic characterisation; (2) an adaptive consensus mechanism that dynamically fuses phase-specific predictions while enforcing consistency; and (3) a structured meta-learning strategy for rapid adaptation to new cities with minimal data. We establish extensive theoretical guarantees, including representation theorems with bounded approximation errors and generalisation bounds for few-shot adaptation. Through experiments on four real-world datasets, MCPST outperforms fourteen state-of-the-art methods in spatio-temporal graph learning methods, dynamic graph transfer learning methods, prompt-based spatio-temporal prediction methods and cross-domain few-shot settings, improving prediction accuracy while reducing required training data and providing interpretable insights.

    "abstract": "Model serving costs dominate AI systems, making compiler optimization essential for scalable deployment. Recent works show that a large language model (LLM) can guide compiler search by reasoning over program structure and optimization history. However, using a single large model throughout the search is expensive, while smaller models are less reliable when used alone. Thus, this paper seeks to answer whether multi-LLM collaborative reasoning relying primarily on small LLMs can match or exceed the performance of a single large model. As such, we propose a lightweight collaborative multi-LLM framework, dubbed COLT, for compiler optimization that enables coordinated reasoning across multiple models within a single Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) process. A key contribution is the use of a single shared MCTS tree as the collaboration substrate across LLMs, enabling the reuse of transformation prefixes and cross-model value propagation. Hence, we circumvent both heavy internal reasoning mechanisms and conventional agentic machinery that relies on external planners, multiple concurrent LLMs, databases, external memory/versioning of intermediate results, and controllers by simply endogenizing model selection within the lightweight MCTS optimization loop. Every iteration, the acting LLM proposes a joint action: (compiler transformation, model to be queried next). We also introduce a model-aware tree policy that biases search toward smaller models while preserving exploration, and a course-alteration mechanism that escalates to the largest model when the search exhibits persistent regressions attributable to smaller models."

    "abstract": "Important quantum algorithm routines allow the implementation of specific quantum operations (a.k.a. gates) by combining basic quantum circuits with an iterative structure. In this structure, the number of repetitions of the basic circuit pattern is associated to convergence parameters. This iterative structure behaves similarly to function approximation by series expansion: the higher the truncation order, the better the target gate (i.e. operation) approximation. The asymptotic convergence of the gate error with respect to the number of basic pattern repetitions is known. It is referred to as the query complexity. The underlying convergence law is bounded, but not in an explicit fashion. Upper bounds are generally too pessimistic to be useful in practice. The actual convergence law contains constants that depend on the joint properties of the matrix encoded by the query and the initial state vector, which are difficult to compute classically. This paper proposes a strategy to study this convergence law and extract the associated constants from the gate (operation) approximation at different accuracy (convergence parameter) constructed directly on a Quantum Processing Unit (QPU). This protocol is called Numerical Error Extraction by Quantum Measurement Algorithm (NEEQMA). NEEQMA concepts are tested on specific instances of Quantum Signal Processing (QSP) and Hamiltonian Simulation by Trotterization. Knowing theexact convergence constants allows for selecting the smallest convergence parameters that enable reaching the required gate approximation accuracy, hence satisfying the quantum algorithm's requirements."

This work examines Langevin splitting schemes from the perspective of their internal trajectories and observation points, complementing existing generator-based analyses. By exploiting merging, splitting, and cyclic permutation of elementary update operators, formally distinct schemes can be grouped according to identical or closely related trajectories. Accuracy differences arising from momentum updates and observation points are quantified for configurational sampling, free-energy estimates, and transition rates. While modern Langevin integrators are remarkably stable under standard simulation conditions, subtle but systematic biases emerge at large friction coefficients and time steps. These results clarify when accuracy differences between splitting schemes matter in practice and provide an intuitive framework for understanding observation effects."

    "abstract": "Over the past years, embedding learning on networks has shown tremendous results in link prediction tasks for complex systems, with a wide range of real-life applications. Learning a representation for each node in a knowledge graph allows us to capture topological and semantic information, which can be processed in downstream analyses later. In the link prediction task, high-dimensional network information is encoded into low-dimensional vectors, which are then fed to a predictor to infer new connections between nodes in the network. As the network complexity (that is, the numbers of connections and types of interactions) grows, embedding learning turns out increasingly challenging. This review covers published models on embedding learning on multiplex networks for link prediction. First, we propose refined taxonomies to classify and compare models, depending on the type of embeddings and embedding techniques. Second, we review and address the problem of reproducible and fair evaluation of embedding learning on multiplex networks for the link prediction task. Finally, we tackle evaluation on directed multiplex networks by proposing a novel and fair testing procedure. This review constitutes a crucial step towards the development of more performant and tractable embedding learning approaches for multiplex networks and their fair evaluation for the link prediction task. We also suggest guidelines on the evaluation of models, and provide an informed perspective on the challenges and tools currently available to address downstream analyses applied to multiplex networks."

Results revealed a partnership paradox: human peers evoked stronger social presence, while AI peers provided steadier encouragement and more reliable working alliances. Humans motivated through authentic comparison and accountability, whereas AI peers fostered consistent, low-stakes support. These complementary strengths suggest that AI agents should not mimic human authenticity but augment it with reliability. Our findings advance human-agent interaction research and point to hybrid designs where human presence and AI consistency jointly sustain physical activity."

    "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01909v1",

    "abstract": "In marine towed-streamer seismic acquisition, the nearest hydrophone is often two hundred meter away from the source resulting in missing near-offset traces, which degrades critical processing workflows such as surface-related multiple elimination, velocity analysis, and full-waveform inversion. Existing reconstruction methods, like transform-domain interpolation, often produce kinematic inconsistencies and amplitude distortions, while supervised deep learning approaches require complete ground-truth near-offset data that are unavailable in realistic acquisition scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a self-supervised diffusion-based framework that reconstructs missing near-offset traces without requiring near-offset reference data. Our method leverages overlapping patch extraction with single-trace shifts from the available far-offset section to train a conditional diffusion model, which learns offset-dependent statistical patterns governing event curvature, amplitude variation, and wavelet characteristics. At inference, we perform trace-by-trace recursive extrapolation from the nearest recorded offset toward zero offset, progressively propagating learned prior information from far to near offsets. The generative formulation further provides uncertainty estimates via ensemble sampling, quantifying prediction confidence where validation data are absent. Controlled validation experiments on synthetic and field datasets show substantial performance gains over conventional parabolic Radon transform baselines. Operational deployment on actual near-offset gaps demonstrates practical viability where ground-truth validation is impossible. Notably, the reconstructed waveforms preserve realistic amplitude-versus-offset trends despite training exclusively on far-offset observations, and uncertainty maps accurately identify challenging extrapolation regions."

We quantify MDP complexity using a first-order quantity and several new data-dependent measures for the adversarial regime, including a second-order quantity and a path-length measure, as well as variance-based measures for the stochastic regime. To adapt to these measures, we develop algorithms based on global optimization and policy optimization, both built on optimistic follow-the-regularized-leader with log-barrier regularization. For global optimization, our algorithms achieve first-order, second-order, and path-length regret bounds in the adversarial regime, and in the stochastic regime, they achieve a variance-aware gap-independent bound and a variance-aware gap-dependent bound that is polylogarithmic in the number of episodes. For policy optimization, our algorithms achieve the same data- and variance-dependent adaptivity, up to a factor of the episode horizon, by exploiting a new optimistic $Q$-function estimator. Finally, we establish regret lower bounds in terms of data-dependent complexity measures for the adversarial regime and a variance measure for the stochastic regime, implying that the regret upper bounds achieved by the global-optimization approach are nearly optimal."

    "abstract": "We study noisy majority-rule dynamics on annealed hypergraphs to clarify how variability in group interaction sizes reshapes collective ordering. At each update, a group is sampled from a prescribed size distribution and either follows the strict within-group majority or, with probability $q$, updates independently under an external bias $p$. At the symmetric point $p=1/2$, we obtain an explicit analytical expression for the critical independence threshold $q_c$, which separates macroscopic ordering from a fluctuating mixed state and can be interpreted as the largest fraction of independent behavior that can be sustained without destroying order. Because $q_c$ is governed by group-size statistics through an effective majority leverage, broad and heavy-tailed size distributions enhance robustness by enabling rare large-group events to realign a substantial fraction of the population. We further derive analytical predictions, benchmarked against Monte Carlo simulations, for the leading finite-size behavior of relaxation: for narrow distributions the characteristic relaxation time typically grows logarithmically with system size, whereas sufficiently heavy-tailed power laws produce strong crossovers and make the large-system dynamics sensitive to how $q$ approaches the transition. In the pure majority-rule limit, we find a crossover from conventional logarithmic consensus times to rapid ordering driven by occasional macroscopic groups, and the exit probability near coexistence collapses onto a universal error-function form controlled by a single structural parameter."

The theory predicts a small-N operating regime of strongest non-trivial separability and clarifies how sequence length and sink similarity shape the metrics. Empirically, across LLaMA-2-7B, Gemma-7B, and Mistral-7B, measurements closely track the theoretical envelopes: top-N selection sharpens separability, sink similarity correlates with Recall. We also found that in LLaMA-2-7B heads specialize into three regimes - Retriever, Mixer, Reset - with distinct geometric signatures. Overall, attention behaves as a structured geometric classifier with measurable criteria for token selection, offering head level interpretability and informing geometry-aware sparsification and design of attention in LLMs."

Instead of enforcing a fixed reference at either the front or rear axle, the proposed method continuously interpolates between both, enabling smooth adaptation across driving contexts, including low-speed maneuvers and reverse motion. The lateral steering command is obtained by barycentric blending of two complementary controllers: a front-axle Stanley formulation and a rear-axle curvature-based geometric controller, yielding continuous transitions in steering behavior and improved tracking stability. In addition, we introduce a curvature-aware longitudinal control strategy based on virtual track borders and ray-tracing, which converts upcoming geometric constraints into a virtual obstacle distance and regulates speed accordingly. The complete approach is implemented in a unified control stack and validated in simulation and on a real autonomous vehicle equipped with GPS-RTK, radar, odometry, and IMU. The results in closed-loop tracking and backward maneuvers show improved trajectory accuracy, smoother steering profiles, and increased adaptability compared to fixed control-point baselines."

This study investigates the dynamics of an Oldroyd-B drop subjected to a uniform electric field using numerical simulations performed with the open-source solver Basilisk. Representative pairs of conductivity ratio ($σ_r$) and permittivity ratio ($ε_r$) are selected from six regions ($PR_A^+$, $PR_B^+$, $PR_A^-$, $PR_B^-$, $OB^+$, and $OB^-$) of the $(σ_r, ε_r)$ phase space. In regions where the first- and second-order deformation coefficients share the same sign ($PR_A^-$, $PR_B^-$, $OB^+$), deviations from Newtonian behavior are negligible. In $PR_A^+$, drops develop multi-lobed shapes above a critical electric capillary number, with elasticity reducing deformation and increasing the critical $Ca_E$ with Deborah number ($De$). In $PR_B^+$, drops form shapes with conical ends above the critical $Ca_E$, while steady-state deformation decreases with $De$ below this threshold, and critical $Ca_E$ shows non-monotonic variation. At high $Ca_E$ and $De$, transient deformation exhibits maxima and minima before reaching steady state, with occasional oscillations between spheroidal and pointed shapes. In $OB^-$, drops deform to oblate shapes and breakup above a critical $Ca_E$, with deformation magnitude increasing and critical $Ca_E$ decreasing with $De$; at low $Ca_E$ and high $De$, dimpling and positional oscillations are observed. These results elucidate viscoelastic-electric interactions and provide guidance for controlling drop behavior in practical applications."

These limitations hinder efficient and controllable image and video editing. To address these issues, we propose a hierarchical proxy-based parametric image representation that disentangles semantic, geometric, and textural attributes into independent and manipulable parameter spaces. Based on a semantic-aware decomposition of the input image, our representation constructs hierarchical proxy geometries through adaptive Bezier fitting and iterative internal region subdivision and meshing. Multi-scale implicit texture parameters are embedded into the resulting geometry-aware distributed proxy nodes, enabling continuous high-fidelity reconstruction in the pixel domain and instance- or part-independent semantic editing. In addition, we introduce a locality-adaptive feature indexing mechanism to ensure spatial texture coherence, which further supports high-quality background completion without relying on generative models. Extensive experiments on image reconstruction and editing benchmarks, including ImageNet, OIR-Bench, and HumanEdit, demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art rendering fidelity with significantly fewer parameters, while enabling intuitive, interactive, and physically plausible manipulation. Moreover, by integrating proxy nodes with Position-Based Dynamics, our framework supports real-time physics-driven animation using lightweight implicit rendering, achieving superior temporal consistency and visual realism compared with generative approaches."

    "abstract": "Log-Structured Merge-Trees (LSM-trees) dominate persistent key-value storage but suffer from high write amplification from 10x to 30x under random workloads due to repeated compaction. This overhead becomes prohibitive for large values with uniformly distributed keys, a workload common in content-addressable storage, deduplication systems, and blockchain validators. We present Tidehunter, a storage engine that eliminates value compaction by treating the Write-Ahead Log (WAL) as permanent storage rather than a temporary recovery buffer. Values are never overwritten; and small, lazily-flushed index tables map keys to WAL positions. Tidehunter introduces (a) lock-free writes that saturate NVMe drives through atomic allocation and parallel copying, (b) an optimistic index structure that exploits uniform key distributions for single-roundtrip lookups, and (c) epoch-based pruning that reclaims space without blocking writes. On a 1 TB dataset with 1 KB values, Tidehunter achieves 830K writes per second, that is 8.4x higher than RocksDB and 2.9x higher than BlobDB, while improving point queries by 1.7x and existence checks by 15.6x. We validate real-world impact by integrating Tidehunter into Sui, a high-throughput blockchain, where it maintains stable throughput and latency under loads that cause RocksDB-backed validators to collapse. Tidehunter is production-ready and is being deployed in production within Sui."

    "abstract": "Cross-partition edges dominate the cost of distributed GNN training: fetching remote features and activations per iteration overwhelms the network as graphs deepen and partition counts grow. Grappa is a distributed GNN training framework that enforces gradient-only communication: during each iteration, partitions train in isolation and exchange only gradients for the global update. To recover accuracy lost to isolation, Grappa (i) periodically repartitions to expose new neighborhoods and (ii) applies a lightweight coverage-corrected gradient aggregation inspired by importance sampling. We prove the corrected estimator is asymptotically unbiased under standard support and boundedness assumptions, and we derive a batch-level variant for compatibility with common deep-learning packages that minimizes mean-squared deviation from the ideal node-level correction. We also introduce a shrinkage version that improves stability in practice. Empirical results on real and synthetic graphs show that Grappa trains GNNs 4 times faster on average (up to 13 times) than state-of-the-art systems, achieves better accuracy especially for deeper models, and sustains training at the trillion-edge scale on commodity hardware. Grappa is model-agnostic, supports full-graph and mini-batch training, and does not rely on high-bandwidth interconnects or caching."

    "abstract": "Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) are essential for ensuring operational safety and consistency in industrial environments. However, retrieving and following these procedures presents unique challenges, such as rigid proprietary structures, condition-dependent relevance, and actionable execution requirement, which standard semantic-driven Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) paradigms fail to address. Inspired by the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) paradigm, we propose SOPRAG, a novel framework specifically designed to address the above pain points in SOP retrieval. SOPRAG replaces flat chunking with specialized Entity, Causal, and Flow graph experts to resolve industrial structural and logical complexities. To optimize and coordinate these experts, we propose a Procedure Card layer that prunes the search space to eliminate computational noise, and an LLM-Guided gating mechanism that dynamically weights these experts to align retrieval with operator intent. To address the scarcity of domain-specific data, we also introduce an automated, multi-agent workflow for benchmark construction. Extensive experiments across four industrial domains demonstrate that SOPRAG significantly outperforms strong lexical, dense, and graph-based RAG baselines in both retrieval accuracy and response utility, achieving perfect execution scores in real-world critical tasks."

Building on this framework, we develop an event-triggered hybrid system implementation using time-varying and state dependent threshold rules and derive minimum inter-event time guarantees and accuracy bounds that quantify the trade-off between estimation accuracy and communication effort."

We focus on classes of pointed Kripke models that are invariant under bounded unravellings, a natural locality condition satisfied by modal logics and by graph neural networks (GNNs). We show that preservation under embeddings coincides with definability in existential graded modal logic; preservation under injective homomorphisms with definability in existential positive graded modal logic; and preservation under homomorphisms with definability in existential positive modal logic. A key technical contribution is a structural well-quasi-ordering result. We prove that the embedding relation on classes of tree-shaped models of uniformly bounded height forms a well-quasi-order, and that the bounded-height assumption is essential. This well-quasi-ordering yields a finite minimal-tree argument leading to explicit syntactic characterisations via finite disjunctions of (graded) modal formulae. As an application, we derive consequences for the expressive power of GNNs. Using our preservation theorem for injective homomorphisms, we obtain a new logical characterisation of monotonic GNNs, showing that they capture exactly existential-positive graded modal logic, while monotonic GNNs with MAX aggregation correspond precisely to existential-positive modal logic."

    "abstract": "IMU-based Human Activity Recognition (HAR) has enabled a wide range of ubiquitous computing applications, yet its dominant clip classification paradigm cannot capture the rich temporal structure of real-world behaviors. This motivates a shift toward IMU Temporal Action Localization (IMU-TAL), which predicts both action categories and their start/end times in continuous streams. However, current progress is strongly bottlenecked by the need for dense, frame-level boundary annotations, which are costly and difficult to scale. To address this bottleneck, we introduce WS-IMUBench, a systematic benchmark study of weakly supervised IMU-TAL (WS-IMU-TAL) under only sequence-level labels. Rather than proposing a new localization algorithm, we evaluate how well established weakly supervised localization paradigms from audio, image, and video transfer to IMU-TAL under only sequence-level labels. We benchmark seven representative weakly supervised methods on seven public IMU datasets, resulting in over 3,540 model training runs and 7,080 inference evaluations. Guided by three research questions on transferability, effectiveness, and insights, our findings show that (i) transfer is modality-dependent, with temporal-domain methods generally more stable than image-derived proposal-based approaches; (ii) weak supervision can be competitive on favorable datasets (e.g., with longer actions and higher-dimensional sensing); and (iii) dominant failure modes arise from short actions, temporal ambiguity, and proposal quality. Finally, we outline concrete directions for advancing WS-IMU-TAL (e.g., IMU-specific proposal generation, boundary-aware objectives, and stronger temporal reasoning). Beyond individual results, WS-IMUBench establishes a reproducible benchmarking template, datasets, protocols, and analyses, to accelerate community-wide progress toward scalable WS-IMU-TAL."

    "abstract": "Infrared small target detection (IRSTD) is crucial for surveillance and early-warning, with deployments spanning both single-frame analysis and video-mode tracking. A practical solution should leverage vision foundation models (VFMs) to mitigate infrared data scarcity, while adopting a memory-attention-based temporal propagation framework that unifies single- and multi-frame inference. However, infrared small targets exhibit weak radiometric signals and limited semantic cues, which differ markedly from visible-spectrum imagery. This modality gap makes direct use of semantics-oriented VFMs and appearance-driven cross-frame association unreliable for IRSTD: hierarchical feature aggregation can submerge localized target peaks, and appearance-only memory attention becomes ambiguous, leading to spurious clutter associations. To address these challenges, we propose SPIRIT, a unified and VFM-compatible framework that adapts VFMs to IRSTD via lightweight physics-informed plug-ins. Spatially, PIFR refines features by approximating rank-sparsity decomposition to suppress structured background components and enhance sparse target-like signals. Temporally, PGMA injects history-derived soft spatial priors into memory cross-attention to constrain cross-frame association, enabling robust video detection while naturally reverting to single-frame inference when temporal context is absent. Experiments on multiple IRSTD benchmarks show consistent gains over VFM-based baselines and SOTA performance."

Multi-party computation (MPC) offers a promising technical foundation for compliant post-market fairness monitoring, enabling the secure computation of fairness metrics without revealing sensitive attributes. Despite growing technical interest, the operationalization of MPC-based fairness monitoring in real-world hiring contexts under concrete legal, industrial, and usability constraints remains unknown. This work addresses this gap through a co-design approach integrating technical, legal, and industrial expertise. We identify practical design requirements for MPC-based fairness monitoring, develop an end-to-end, legally compliant protocol spanning the full data lifecycle, and empirically validate it in a large-scale industrial setting.

While recent studies attribute this to \"training inference mismatch stemming\" from inconsistent hybrid engines, standard remedies, such as Importance Sampling, might fail during extended training runs. In this work, we analyze this instability through the lens of optimization, demonstrating that gradient noise and training-inference mismatch escalate in tandem as training progresses. Meanwhile, we find that the mismatch can be effectively suppressed by shrinking the update size. Taken together, we deduce that the mismatch is not merely a static numerical discrepancy, but a dynamic failure coupled with the model's optimization. Based on this insight, we propose a simple yet effective solution: a specialized Learning Rate (LR) scheduler. Instead of pre-defined decay schedule in traditional LR scheduler, our method dynamically triggers LR decay based on response length, which we identify as a reliable early-warning signal for impending instability. Empirical evidence suggests that by reducing the learning rate as gradient noise rises, we can consistently stabilize RL training and keep the training-inference mismatch at a safe level."

While established regional telcos and banks are leveraging proprietary data to develop digital loan products, algorithmic credit scoring is being transformed by new actors, techniques, and shifting regulations. Our findings show how practitioners construct alternative data using technical and legal workarounds, formulate risk through multiple interpretations, and negotiate model performance via technical and political means. We argue that algorithmic credit scoring is accomplished through the ongoing work of alignment that stabilizes risk under conditions of persistent uncertainty, taking epistemic, modeling, and contextual forms. Extending work on alignment in HCI, we show how it operates as a two-way translation, where models are made \"safe for worlds\" while those worlds are reshaped to be \"safe for models.\""

Here we show that the blow-up phenomenon can be suppressed by a Couette flow whose amplitude is large enough under a weak assumption on the anisotropic norm of the initial data. In particular, we construct examples with initial energy exceeding $8π$ that satisfy our assumptions."

However, in some extreme environments, such as high humidities and low temperatures, condensation on the surface is inevitable, which induces the loss of surface superhydrophobicity. In this study, we propose a freezing-melting strategy to achieve the dewetting transition from the Wenzel state to the Cassie-Baxter state. It requires freezing the droplet by reducing the substrate temperature and then melting the droplet by heating the substrate. The condensation-induced wetting transition from the Cassie-Baxter state to the Wenzel state is analyzed first. Two kinds of superhydrophobic surfaces, i.e., single-scale nano-structured superhydrophobic surface and hierarchical-scale micro-nano-structured superhydrophobic surface, are compared and their effects on the static contact states and impact processes of droplets are analyzed. The mechanism for the dewetting transition is analyzed by exploring the differences in the micro/nano-structures of the surfaces and it is attributed to the unique structure and strength of the superhydrophobic surface. These findings will enrich our understanding of the droplet-surface interaction involving phase changes and have great application prospects for the design of superhydrophobic surfaces."

Similarly, A bijection g from the union of edge set and vertex set of G to [n+m] is called a local antimagic total labeling of G, if for any two adjacent vertices u and v in G, The sum of the weight of u and the weights of its incident edges differs from that of v. Obviously, any local antimagic (total) labeling induces a proper vertex-coloring of G when every vertex v is assigned the color w(v)(w_t(v)). The local antimagic (total) chromatic number of G, denoted by X_la(G)(X_lat(G)) , is defined as the minimum number of colors taken over all colorings induced by local antimagic (total) labelings of G. In this paper, we present the local antimagic (total) chromatic number of firecracker graph F_n,k, obtained by the concatenation of n k-stars by linking one leaf from each. Then we give the local antimagic chromatic number of the edge-corona product of two graphs G and H, where the graph is constructed by taking one copy of G and |E(G)| disjoint copies of H one-to-one assigned to each edge of G, and for every edge uv of G, joining u and v to every vertex of the copy of H associated to uv. For the graph studied here, G is a star S_k or a double star S_k1,k2, and H is an empty graph with r vertices or a complete graph K_2."

We show that $ξ$ determines sample efficiency by controlling reward variance and the likelihood of informative trajectories. Our analysis reveals three regimes: in the \\emph{deficient} regime ($ξ\\to 0$), informative trajectories are rare and the sample complexity explodes; in the \\emph{balanced} regime ($ξ=Θ(1)$), informative trajectories occur with non-negligible probability and RL is maximally sample-efficient; and in the \\emph{ample} regime ($ξ\\to \\infty$), learning remains stable but marginal gains per iteration diminish. We further provide finite-sample guarantees for online RL that characterize learning progress across these regimes. Specifically, in a case study under idealized distributional assumptions, we show that the relative budget grows linearly over iterations. Our empirical results confirm these predictions in realistic settings, identifying a budget $ξ\\in [1.5, 2.0]$ that maximizes learning efficiency and coincides with peak reasoning performance."

Concretely, pretrained vision and text features form mismatched anisotropic regions, yielding a dominant \"gap\" direction that acts like a translation component and disproportionately steers early gradients under rank-1 constraints. Analyzing pretrained representations, we identify a modality-gap axis that dominates early gradient flow, while a random rank-1 initialization is unlikely to align with it, leading to weak gradients and training collapse. We propose Gap-Init, a geometry-aware initialization that aligns the rank-1 LoRA direction with an estimated modality-gap vector from a small calibration set, while keeping the initial LoRA update zero. Across multiple vision-language tasks and backbones, Gap-Init consistently stabilizes rank-1 training and can match or outperform strong rank-8 baselines. Our results suggest that at the extreme low-rank limit, initial alignment can matter as much as rank itself."

    "abstract": "Low-dimensional ice trapped in nanocapillaries is a fascinating phenomenon and is ubiquitous in our daily lives. As a decisive factor of the confinement effect, the size of nanocapillary significantly affects the critical crystallization pressure and crystalline structure, especially for multi-layered ices. By choosing square ice as a typical two-dimensional (2D) multi-layered ice pattern and using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, we further unveil the variation mechanism of critical crystallization pressure with the nanocapillary size. The results show a strong dependence of the critical crystallization pressure on the size of the graphene sheet for monolayer, bilayer, and trilayer square ice. The quasi-macroscopic crystallization pressure, the actual pressure of water molecules, and the freezable region between them are all strongly dependent on the nanocapillary width. As the size of the capillary becomes larger in all three directions, the critical crystallization pressure converges to the true macroscopic crystallization pressure, which is very close to the value of the crystallization pressure for bulk ice. A direct correlation is established between 2D square ice and three-dimensional (3D) bulk ice by the critical crystallization pressure. There is an unfreezable threshold for crystallizing spontaneously in practice when the quasi-macroscopic crystallization pressure is equal to the actual pressure, which can explain the limit of nanocapillary width for multi-layered ice."

Our interviews and field observations with data repairers and related stakeholders found that, alongside the scarcity of high-precision machinery and access to advanced software, data repair work is constrained by cross-language learning resources and the protective nature of documenting, curating, and sharing the experiences and knowledge among local peers. Repairers turning to external resources such as foreign forums and LLMs also revealed their frustrating experiences and the postcolonial ethical tensions they encountered. We noted that both anticipated technical labor and the emotionality of data were taken into account for pricing the data repair job, which contributed to their market sustainability strategies. Engaging with repair, infrastructure, and data poverty discourse, we argue that data repair practices represent a crucial challenge and opportunity for HCI in advancing global efforts toward data equity."

Many applications, including engineering design, involve variable and often nonparametric geometries, for which generalization to unseen geometries remains a central practical challenge. In this work, we adopt a kernel integral perspective motivated by classical boundary integral formulations and recast operator learning on variable geometries as the approximation of geometry-dependent kernel operators, potentially with singularities. This perspective clarifies a mechanism for geometric generalization and reveals a direct connection between operator learning and fast kernel summation methods. Leveraging this connection, we propose a multiscale neural operator inspired by Ewald summation for learning and efficiently evaluating unknown kernel integrals, and we provide theoretical accuracy guarantees for the resulting approximation. Numerical experiments demonstrate robust generalization across diverse geometries for several commonly used kernels and for a large-scale three-dimensional fluid dynamics example."

In computations, however, the geometric volume enclosed by the interface -- the region where the order parameter $φ$ is positive -- may drift at finite interface thickness, producing artificial shrinkage or growth even when the sharp-interface limit conserves volume. We revisit and extend the improved-conservation framework of Zhou et al., where one replaces classical mass conservation by the exact conservation of a designed monotone mapping $Q(φ)$ that more accurately approximates a step function. Building on this framework, we (i) carry out the matched-asymptotic analysis in the unscaled physical time formulation, (ii) derive a simplified representation of the first-order inner correction to the interface profile, and (iii) identify an integral-moment cancellation condition that controls the leading geometric-volume defect. This mechanism becomes a practical design rule: we select regularization kernels within parameterized families -- including exponential and Pade-type -- to reach effective higher-order behavior and satisfy the cancellation condition at moderate parameter values. As a result, the proposed kernels achieve formal third-order accuracy in geometric-volume conservation with respect to interface thickness. Finally, we describe an unconditional energy-dissipative numerical discretization that exactly preserves the discrete conserved quantity. Numerical benchmarks on multi-scale droplet coarsening and shape relaxation demonstrate that the moment-balanced kernels virtually eliminate artificial drift and prevent premature extinction of small droplets."

The population proportions of the two strategies may undergo perpetual fluctuations in finite, discrete, heterogeneous populations of imitators, conformists, and nonconformists. How these fluctuations evolve as population size increases was left as an open question and is addressed in this paper. We show that the family of Markov chains describing the discrete population dynamics forms a generalized stochastic approximation process for a differential inclusion--the continuous-time dynamics. Furthermore, we prove that the continuous-time dynamics always equilibrate. Then, by leveraging results from the stochastic approximation theory, we show that the amplitudes of fluctuations in the proportions of the two strategies in the population approach zero with probability one when the population size grows to infinity. Our results suggest that large-scale perpetual fluctuations are unlikely in large, well-mixed populations consisting of these three types, particularly when imitators follow the highest earners."

In this paper, we introduce a previously unexplored power side-channel vulnerability that exploits sleep-induced power spikes to extract ECDSA nonces. Unlike conventional power-based side-channel attacks, this vulnerability leverages power fluctuations generated during processor context switches invoked by sleep functions. These fluctuations correlate with nonce-dependent operations in scalar multiplication, enabling nonce recovery even under constant-time and masked implementations. We evaluate the attack across multiple cryptographic libraries, RustCrypto, BearSSL, and GoCrypto, and processor architectures, including ARM and RISC-V. Our experiments show that subtle variations in the power envelope during sleep-induced context switches provide sufficient leakage for practical ECDSA nonce extraction, recovering 20 bits of the nonce. These results establish sleep-induced power spikes as a practical cross-platform side-channel threat and highlight the need to reconsider design choices in cryptographic systems."

However, LAR has remained somewhat of a \"black box,\" where some basic behavioral properties of LAR output are not well understood, including an appropriate termination point for the algorithm. We provide a novel framework for inference with LAR, which also allows LAR to be understood from new perspectives with several newly developed mathematical properties. The LAR algorithm at a data level can viewed as estimating a population counterpart \"path\" that organizes a response mean along regressor variables which are ordered according to a decreasing series of population \"correlation\" parameters; such parameters are shown to have meaningful interpretations for explaining variable contributions whereby zero correlations denote unimportant variables. In the output of LAR, estimates of all non-zero population correlations turn out to have independent normal distributions for use in inference, while estimates of zero-valued population correlations have a certain non-normal joint distribution. These properties help to provide a formal rule for stopping the LAR algorithm. While the standard bootstrap for regression can fail for LAR, a modified bootstrap provides a practical and formally justified tool for interpreting the entrance of variables and quantifying uncertainty in estimation. The LAR inference method is studied through simulation and illustrated with data examples."

Moreover, theory shows that specific QSB characteristics observable in tunneling to an s-wave superconductor can distinguish between chiral and non-chiral ITS order parameter $Δ_k$. To search for such phenomena in $\\text{UTe}_2$, s-wave superconductive scan-tip scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) imaging was employed. It reveals an intense zero-energy Andreev conductance maximum at the $\\text{UTe}_2$ (0-11) crystal termination. Development of the zero-energy Andreev conductance peak into two finite-energy particle-hole symmetric conductance maxima as the tunnel barrier is reduced, then signifies that $\\text{UTe}_2$ superconductivity is non-chiral. Quasiparticle interference imaging (QPI) for an ITS material should be dominated by the QSB for energies within the superconductive energy gap $|E| \\le Δ$, so that bulk $Δ(k)$ characteristics of the ITS can only be detected excursively. Again using a superconducting scan-tip, the in-gap quasiparticle interference patterns of the QSB of $\\text{UTe}_2$ were visualized. Specifically, a band of Bogoliubov quasiparticles appears as a characteristic sextet $q_i$ :$i = 1-6$ of interference wavevectors showing that QSB dispersions $k(E)$ occur only for energies $|E| \\le Δ_{max}$ and only within the range of Fermi momenta projected onto the (0-11) crystal surface.

Recent measurements of the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect and stacks of X-ray emission from optically selected galaxy clusters suggest that feedback from Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) is more efficient at expelling gas from low-mass clusters than previously thought. The measurement of the cross-correlation between cosmic shear and diffuse X-ray emission provides a new probe of the distribution of gas in groups and clusters. We use the FLAMINGO cosmological, hydrodynamical simulations to examine the X-ray--cosmic-shear cross-correlation. The cross-correlation is most sensitive to the distribution of gas in haloes with masses $10^{14}\\leq M_{200\\mathrm{c}}/\\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}\\leq10^{15}$. It is sensitive to the strength of feedback, but the effects of variations in cosmology and baryonic physics are largely degenerate. We compare the FLAMINGO predictions with the cross-correlation between cosmic shear from the Dark Energy Survey and ROSAT all-sky X-ray maps. We find that, if we neglect the X-ray emission from AGN that would remain unresolved by ROSAT, then the fiducial FLAMINGO model is in excellent agreement with the data, while models with stronger or weaker feedback are ruled out. However, if we account for unresolved AGN, either using the direct FLAMINGO predictions or by abundance matching to the observed (extrapolated) AGN luminosity function, then models with stronger feedback are preferred. We conclude that to exploit the potential of the X-ray--lensing cross-correlation, it will be necessary to resolve fainter AGN, and to use external constraints to break the degeneracy between baryonic feedback and cosmology."

Using temporal supply-demand analysis and moral foundations scoring (eMFD), we examine the dynamics of key electoral issues. Three key findings emerge. First, moralization patterns diverge dramatically by platform: TikTok's algorithm enabled viral spread of moralized abortion and immigration content despite lower supply, while Instagram amplified economic discourse that aligned supply and demand. Second, traditionally \"pragmatic\" economic issues became moralized-cryptocurrency discourse invoked loyalty and authority foundations more strongly than any other topic, framing regulation as government overreach. Third, platforms responded to different events: TikTok surged after Harris's nomination across all topics (96% reduction in supply volatility), while Instagram spiked around cryptocurrency policy developments. Semantic network analysis reveals TikTok's circular topology enables cross-cutting exposure while Instagram's fragmented structure isolates Harris from economic discourse. These findings demonstrate that understanding political moralization requires examining platform-specific ecosystems where architecture, demographics, and content strategy interact to determine which issues get moralized and how moral content spreads."

We aim to improve the distance estimates of Yellow Hypergiants (YHGs) and Yellow Supergiants (YSGs) by identifying possible cluster and association memberships. Using these distances, we derived updated luminosities and revised their positions in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. Methods. We compiled from the literature a sample of 35 luminous yellow massive stars (YHGs and the most luminous YSGs). We used Gaia DR3 astrometry to identify possible membership in clusters and OB associations. We derived distances by combining the parallaxes of nearby co-moving stars. We independently validated these distances by comparing the stellar radial velocities to the Galactic H I kinematic map. We combined angular diameters and effective temperature values from the literature with the new distances to estimate luminosities. Results. We improved the distance estimates for 28 of the 35 stars through association with co-moving stellar groups. For an additional six stars, we provided distance estimates based on the H I kinematic map. For one star, the distance remains unclear. Most YSGs are members of young stellar populations, while the environments of the YHGs are more diverse, and for some of them, their origin populations remain unclear. We derived updated luminosities for a subset of 20 stars. Most YHGs have luminosities above log L/L = 5.4, while YSGs occupy a wider range of luminosities and the most luminous YSGs have luminosities similar to YHGs."

To obtain explicit finite-sample guarantees for the last iterate, we develop a coupling argument that compares the discrete-time process to a limiting Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. Our analysis applies to algorithms driven by general noise conditions, including martingale differences and functions of ergodic Markov chains. Complementing this result, we handle the convergence rate of the Polyak-Ruppert average through a direct analysis that applies under the same general setting. Assuming the driving noise satisfies a non-asymptotic central limit theorem, we show that the normalized last iterates converge to a Gaussian distribution in the $p$-Wasserstein distance at a rate of order $γ_n^{1/6}$, where $γ_n$ is the step size. Similarly, the Polyak-Ruppert average is shown to converge in the Wasserstein distance at a rate of order $n^{-1/6}$. These distributional guarantees imply high-probability concentration inequalities that improve upon those derived from moment bounds and Markov's inequality. We demonstrate the utility of this approach by considering two applications: (1) linear stochastic approximation, where we explicitly quantify the transition from heavy-tailed to Gaussian behavior of the iterates, thereby bridging the gap between recent finite-sample analyses and asymptotic theory and (2) stochastic gradient descent, where we establish rate of convergence to the central limit theorem."

    "abstract": "Experiments suggest that nuclear spins play a significant role in the quantum Hall effect (QHE) near integer and fractional QHE spin transitions, but many of these phenomena still remain to be understood. Here we study theoretically the dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) in the two-dimensional electron liquid near a quantum point contact (QPC) or a domain wall between spin polarized and unpolarized phases induced by electrostatic gating in the fractional QHE at a filling factor 2/3 and analyze the dependence of the spin transition on temperature and the magnitude of the flowing current. We demonstrate that nearly all nuclear spins in the QPC or in the domain wall can be polarized by the electric current. The Overhauser effective magnetic field from the DNP can be strong enough to induce (or modify) a phase transition between polarized and unpolarized phases. This changes the gate voltages and magnetic fields required for the spin transitions, and leads to the reconstruction of the boundary between two phases and a domain wall and a current path displacement. The spread of nuclear spin polarization and the domain wall displacement are strongly asymmetric with respect to the direction of the current flow. Equilibration due to hyperfine interactions and its role on the nuclear spin polarization, domain wall displacements and spin transitions is studied. Back and forth oscillatory transitions between polarized and unpolarized phases near a source contact are discussed. Hyperfine interactions of nuclear spins provide a route for observation and control of the parafermion zero modes that can be induced when the domain wall between the polarized and unpolarized regions is placed in the proximity of a superconductor"

One example is twisted THH which is an invariant of $C_n$-equivariant ring spectra developed by Angeltveit, Blumberg, Gerhardt, Hill, Lawson, and Mandell. In this paper, we study the algebraic structure of twisted THH, and perform some computations. Specifically, we compute $C_2$-twisted THH of the Real bordism spectrum and show that the $C_p$-twisted THH of geometric ring $C_p$-spectra reduces to a computation of classical THH. We extend the algebraic structure of twisted THH to the twisted Bökstedt spectral sequence of Adamyk, Gerhardt, Hess, Klang, and Kong. We show that, under appropriate flatness conditions and for $R$ a commutative ring $C_p$-spectrum, the $C_p$-twisted Bökstedt spectral sequence is a spectral sequence of commutative $\\underline{E}_\\star(R)$-algebras."

    "abstract": "Object rearrangement planning in complex, cluttered environments is a common challenge in warehouses, households, and rescue sites. Prior studies largely address monotone instances, whereas real-world tasks are often non-monotone-objects block one another and must be temporarily relocated to intermediate positions before reaching their final goals. In such settings, effective multi-agent collaboration can substantially reduce the time required to complete tasks. This paper introduces Centralized, Asynchronous, Multi-agent Monte Carlo Tree Search (CAM-MCTS), a novel framework for general-purpose makespan-efficient object rearrangement planning in challenging environments. CAM-MCTS combines centralized task assignment-where agents remain aware of each other's intended actions to facilitate globally optimized planning-with an asynchronous task execution strategy that enables agents to take on new tasks at appropriate time steps, rather than waiting for others, guided by a one-step look-ahead cost estimate. This design minimizes idle time, prevents unnecessary synchronization delays, and enhances overall system efficiency. We evaluate CAM-MCTS across a diverse set of monotone and non-monotone tasks in cluttered environments, demonstrating consistent reductions in makespan compared to strong baselines. Finally, we validate our approach on a real-world multi-agent system under different configurations, further confirming its effectiveness and robustness."

However, these web-scale corpora inevitably contain large amounts of noisy data due to unregulated web content or randomness inherent in data. Although LLM pretrainers often speculate that such noise contributes to instabilities in large-scale LLM pretraining and, in the worst cases, loss divergence, this phenomenon remains poorly understood.In this work, we present a systematic empirical study of whether noisy data causes LLM pretraining divergences and how it does so. By injecting controlled synthetic uniformly random noise into otherwise clean datasets, we analyze training dynamics across model sizes ranging from 480M to 5.2B parameters. We show that noisy data indeed induces training loss divergence, and that the probability of divergence depends strongly on the noise type, amount of noise, and model scale. We further find that noise-induced divergences exhibit activation patterns distinct from those caused by high learning rates, and we provide diagnostics that differentiate these two failure modes. Together, these results provide a large-scale, controlled characterization of how noisy data affects loss divergence in LLM pretraining."

We conduct a discourse analysis of 31 episodes from five popular data visualization podcasts. Podcasts are public-facing and inherently performative: guests manage impressions, articulate values, and model \"good practice\" for broad audiences. We use this performative setting to examine how legitimacy, identity, and practice are negotiated in community talk. We show that \"inspiration talk\" is operative rather than ornamental: speakers legitimize what counts, who counts, and how work proceeds. Our analysis surfaces four adjustable evaluation criteria by which inspiration is judged-novelty, authority, authenticity, and affect-and three operative metaphors that license different practices-spark, muscle, and resource bank. We argue that treating inspiration as a boundary object helps explain why these frames coexist across contexts. Findings provide a vocabulary for examining how inspiration is mobilized in visualization practice, with implications for evaluation, pedagogy, and the design of galleries and repositories that surface inspirational examples."

We formalize two representational hypotheses: (1) a representation in the product space of all factors, whose dimension grows exponentially with the number of parts, or (2) a factored representation in orthogonal subspaces, whose dimension grows linearly. The factored representation is lossless when factors are conditionally independent, but sacrifices predictive fidelity otherwise, creating a tradeoff between dimensional efficiency and accuracy. We derive precise predictions about the geometric structure of activations for each, including the number of subspaces, their dimensionality, and the arrangement of context embeddings within them. We test between these hypotheses on transformers trained on synthetic processes with known latent structure. Models learn factored representations when factors are conditionally independent, and continue to favor them early in training even when noise or hidden dependencies undermine conditional independence, reflecting an inductive bias toward factoring at the cost of fidelity. This provides a principled explanation for why transformers decompose the world into parts, and suggests that interpretable low dimensional structure may persist even in models trained on complex data."

By systematically varying problem sources, generation methods, and model configurations, we create diverse problem-proof pairs spanning multiple difficulty levels, linguistic styles, and error types, subsequently filtered through hierarchical human review for label alignment. Utilizing these data, we train a proof-checking RM, incorporating additional process reward and token weight balance to stabilize the RL process.

    "abstract": "Combining human and artificial intelligence (AI) is a potentially powerful approach to boost decision accuracy. However, few such approaches exist that effectively integrate both types of intelligence while maintaining human agency. Here, we introduce and evaluate the hybrid confirmation tree, a simple aggregation strategy that compares the independent decisions of both a human and AI, with disagreements triggering a second human tiebreaker. Through analytical derivations, we show that the hybrid confirmation tree can match and exceed the accuracy of a three-person human majority vote while requiring fewer human inputs, particularly when AI accuracy is comparable to or exceeds human accuracy. We analytically demonstrate that the hybrid confirmation tree's ability to achieve complementarity -- outperforming individual humans, AI, and the majority vote -- is maximized when human and AI accuracies are similar and their decisions are not overly correlated. Empirical reanalysis of six real-world datasets (covering skin cancer diagnosis, deepfake detection, geopolitical forecasting, and criminal rearrest) validates these findings, showing that the hybrid confirmation tree improves accuracy over the majority vote by up to 10 percentage points while reducing the cost of decision making by 28--44$\\%$. Furthermore, the hybrid confirmation tree provides greater flexibility in navigating true and false positive trade-offs compared to fixed human-only heuristics like hierarchies and polyarchies. The hybrid confirmation tree emerges as a practical, efficient, and robust strategy for hybrid collective intelligence that maintains human agency."

We introduce a multi-agent prompting framework that breaks down the evaluation process into transcript refinement and criterion-specific scoring. Using 3-shot in-context learning with a large instruct-tuned model, our approach outperforms specialised fine-tuned baselines (Avg QWK 0.62 vs 0.32) and achieves reliability comparable to human experts. We further demonstrate the generalisability of our framework on the ASAP benchmark, where it rivals domain-specific state-of-the-art models without additional training.

We quantify its sensitivity to dynamical dark energy by studying the evolution of $J(a)$ and its derivatives $Γ_1(a)$ and $Γ_2(a)$ across three parameterisation schemes: CPL, JBP, and BA. We determine the characteristic redshift $z_{NG}$, marking the epoch of maximal non-Gaussian structure formation, and the turnaround redshift $z_{TA}$, when information production transitions due to dark-energy domination, finding $z_{NG}\\sim0.81$ and $z_{TA}\\sim0.18$ for $Λ$CDM. Our diagnostics clearly discriminate between thawing and freezing quintessence models and phantom dark energy at low redshifts. Thawing models show small departures from $Λ$CDM, freezing models display higher $z_{TA}$, while phantom models exhibit lower $z_{TA}$, reflecting late-time evolution. We provide a practical prescription for measuring negentropy from discrete galaxy distributions, establishing a framework that can be applied to simulations and observations. This information-theoretic approach offers a robust and complementary tool for probing dark energy dynamics, enabling sensitive discrimination between evolving and cosmological-constant scenarios."

This design is misaligned with generative recommendation objectives: semantic embeddings are weakly coupled with collaborative prediction, and generic quantization is inefficient at reducing sequential uncertainty for autoregressive modeling. To address these, we propose ReSID, a recommendation-native, principled SID framework that rethinks representation learning and quantization from the perspective of information preservation and sequential predictability, without relying on LLMs. ReSID consists of two components: (i) Field-Aware Masked Auto-Encoding (FAMAE), which learns predictive-sufficient item representations from structured features, and (ii) Globally Aligned Orthogonal Quantization (GAOQ), which produces compact and predictable SID sequences by jointly reducing semantic ambiguity and prefix-conditional uncertainty. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments across ten datasets show the effectiveness of ReSID. ReSID consistently outperforms strong sequential and SID-based generative baselines by an average of over 10%, while reducing tokenization cost by up to 122x.

We study a controlled setting in which Llama-3.2 generates samples from a normal distribution by implicitly inferring its parameters (mean and standard deviation) given only samples from the distribution in context. We find representations of curved \"belief manifolds\" for these parameters form with sufficient in-context learning and study how the model adapts when the distribution suddenly changes. While standard linear steering often pushes the model off-manifold and induces coupled, out-of-distribution shifts, geometry and field-aware steering better preserves the intended belief family. Our work demonstrates an example of linear field probing (LFP) as a simple approach to tile the data manifold and make interventions that respect the underlying geometry. We conclude that rich structure emerges naturally in LLMs and that purely linear concept representations are often an inadequate abstraction."

Here, we present a new framework for spiking neural networks - Spark - built upon the idea of modular design, from simple components to entire models. The aim of this framework is to provide an efficient and streamlined pipeline for spiking neural networks. We showcase this framework by solving the sparse-reward cartpole problem with simple plasticity mechanisms.

Q1: Does TAUT have (p-)optimal proof systems? Q2: Does QBF have (p-)optimal proof systems? Q3: Are there arbitrarily complex sets with (p-)optimal proof systems? Recently, Egidy and Glaßer (STOC 2025) contributed to these questions by constructing oracles that show that there are no relativizable proofs for positive answers of these questions, even when assuming well-established conjectures about the separation of complexity classes. We continue this line of research by providing the same proof barrier for negative answers of these questions. For this, we introduce the SPARSE-relativization framework, which is an application of the notion of bounded relativization by Hirahara, Lu, and Ren (CCC 2023). This framework allows the construction of sparse oracles for statements such that additional useful properties (like an infinite polynomial-time hierarchy) hold. By applying the SPARSE-relativization framework, we show that the oracle construction of Egidy and Glaßer also yields the following new oracle. O1: No set in PSPACE\\NP has optimal proof systems, $\\mathrm{NP} \\subsetneq \\mathrm{PH} \\subsetneq \\mathrm{PSPACE}$, and PH collapses We use techniques of Cook and Krajíček (J. Symb.

    "abstract": "Classical game theory is a powerful framework to analyze the strategic interactions among rational players. However, in many real-life scenarios, players choose actions based on their inherent natural tendencies rather than deliberate reasoning. In this paper, we develop an analytical framework to study large population games with an alpha-fraction of rational and (1-alpha)-fraction of herding players. We introduce a new notion of equilibrium called alpha-Rational Nash Equilibrium (in short, alpha-RNE) and discuss its interpretations. Some classical equilibria may disappear, and some new ones may emerge, but only for smaller alpha >0. Interestingly, rational players benefit from the presence of herding and may even achieve utility exceeding the socially optimum. Even more strikingly, in some cases, the herding players also benefit, attaining utility close to the social optimum. We further study the effect of the herding fraction on system performance using measures such as the Price of Anarchy (PoA). In transportation networks, a well-known paradox first studied by Pigou and later by Braess typically arises from rational decision-making: adding an extra link can reduce overall efficiency. Our analysis leads to a different conclusion. When a substantial fraction of users exhibit herding behavior, introducing a new link can increase efficiency, provided herding choices can be suitably influenced. The gains are larger when the herding fraction is higher and/or congestion is lower. By contrast, when herding decisions cannot be influenced, the added link may become detrimental. We also study a bandwidth sharing game in which herding tendencies improve system efficiency. Finally, we discuss the mechanism or influence design in the presence of herding, highlighting both opportunities and risks."

Scaling relations attempt to link the He I signal to XUV irradiation, mass loss, and bulk planetary parameters. We test these relations with a comparative analysis of HD209458b, HD189733b, HD149026b, and GJ1214b using a 1D hydrodynamic, multi-species, full-atmosphere escape model. For the benchmark HD209458b, our previously validated solution reproduces the observed He I and Ha transit depths without imposing composition constraints. HD189733b exhibits comparable He I depths, but the broadest reported profiles require ~12 km/s of additional non-thermal broadening, whereas more recent measurements are narrower, consistent with our predictions. For HD149026b, despite similar system properties, our model shows that higher gravity suppresses escape and enhances diffusive separation, depleting helium at high altitudes and yielding extremely weak He I absorption. For the sub-Neptune GJ1214b, H/He-only models overestimate He I absorption; including H2 and its ions (H2+, H3+, HeH+) lowers the escape rate and modifies the ion/electron balance, reducing the metastable helium densities. Compared against scaling relations, HD189733b observations and our HD149026b prediction fall below the trend, whereas some observations of HD209458b and GJ1214b are consistent; however, the observed transit depths are variable. Across all targets, we find diffusive separation of helium and hydrogen, which may explain why sub-solar He/H ratios are often required in simplified models. We conclude that interpreting He I and Ha absorption requires first-principles models that include self-consistent temperature and velocity profiles, multi-species transport, and molecular chemistry."

    "abstract": "Spatial epidemiology identifies the drivers of elevated population-level disease risks, using disease counts, exposures and known confounders at the areal unit level. Poisson regression models are typically used for inference, which incorporate a linear/additive regression component and allow for unmeasured confounding via a set of spatially autocorrelated random effects. This approach requires the confounder interactions and their functional relationships with disease risk to be specified in advance, rather than being learned from the data. Therefore, this paper proposes the SPAR-Forest-ERF algorithm, which is the first fusion of random forests for capturing non-linear and interacting confounder-response effects with Bayesian spatial autocorrelation models that can estimate interpretable exposure response functions (ERF) with full uncertainty quantification. Methodologically, we extend existing methods set in a prediction context by propagating uncertainty between both the ML and statistical models, developing a new stopping criteria designed to ensure the stability of the primary inferential target, and incorporating a range of different ERFs for maximum model flexibility. This methodology is motivated by a new study quantifying the impact of air pollution concentrations on self-rated health in Scotland, using data from the recently released 2022 national census."

However, LAMs face a critical challenge in disentangling action-relevant features from action-correlated noise (e.g., background motion). Failing to filter these distractors causes LAMs to capture spurious correlations and build sub-optimal latent action spaces. In this paper, we introduce MaskLAM -- a lightweight modification to LAM training to mitigate this issue by incorporating visual agent segmentation. MaskLAM utilises segmentation masks from pretrained foundation models to weight the LAM reconstruction loss, thereby prioritising salient information over background elements while requiring no architectural modifications. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on continuous-control MuJoCo tasks, modified with action-correlated background noise. Our approach yields up to a 4x increase in accrued rewards compared to standard baselines and a 3x improvement in the latent action quality, as evidenced by linear probe evaluation."

Utilizing a unified information-geometric framework, we introduce (Kalman)-Wasserstein-based KL analogues by replacing the Fisher-Rao geometry in the dynamical formulation of the KL with transport-based geometries, and we derive closed-form values for common distribution families. These divergences remain finite under support mismatch and yield a geometric interpretation of regularization heuristics used in Kalman ensemble methods. We demonstrate the utility of these divergences in KL-regularized optimal control. In the fully tractable setting of linear time-invariant systems with Gaussian process noise, the classical KL reduces to a quadratic control penalty that becomes singular as process noise vanishes. Our variants remove this singularity, yielding well-posed problems. On a double integrator and a cart-pole example, the resulting controls outperform KL-based regularization."

    "abstract": "Understanding the impact of treatment effect over time is a fundamental aspect of many scientific and medical studies. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach under a continuous-time reinforcement learning framework for testing a treatment effect. Specifically, our method provides an effective test on carryover effects of treatment over time utilizing the average treatment effect (ATE). The average treatment effect is defined as difference of value functions over an infinite horizon, which accounts for cumulative treatment effects, both immediate and carryover. The proposed method outperforms existing testing procedures such as discrete time reinforcement learning strategies in multi-resolution observation settings where observation times can be irregular. Another advantage of the proposed method is that it can capture treatment effects of a shorter duration and provide greater accuracy compared to discrete-time approximations, through the use of continuous-time estimation for the value function. We establish the asymptotic normality of the proposed test statistics and apply it to OhioT1DM diabetes data to evaluate the cumulative treatment effects of bolus insulin on patients' glucose levels."

    "abstract": "Hallucination remains a fundamental challenge for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). While Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is a key alignment framework, existing approaches often rely heavily on costly external evaluators for scoring or rewriting, incurring off-policy learnability gaps and discretization loss. Due to the lack of access to internal states, such feedback overlooks the fine-grained conflicts between different modalities that lead to hallucinations during generation. To address this issue, we propose IRIS (Implicit Reward-Guided Internal Sifting), which leverages continuous implicit rewards in the native log-probability space to preserve full information density and capture internal modal competition. This on-policy paradigm eliminates learnability gaps by utilizing self-generated preference pairs. By sifting these pairs based on multimodal implicit rewards, IRIS ensures that optimization is driven by signals that directly resolve modal conflicts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IRIS achieves highly competitive performance on key hallucination benchmarks using only 5.7k samples, without requiring any external feedback during preference alignment. These results confirm that IRIS provides an efficient and principled paradigm for mitigating MLLM hallucinations."

    "abstract": "The quadratic complexity and indefinitely growing key-value (KV) cache of standard Transformers pose a major barrier to long-context processing. To overcome this, we introduce the Collaborative Memory Transformer (CoMeT), a novel architecture that enables LLMs to handle arbitrarily long sequences with constant memory usage and linear time complexity. Designed as an efficient, plug-in module, CoMeT can be integrated into pre-trained models with only minimal fine-tuning. It operates on sequential data chunks, using a dual-memory system to manage context: a temporary memory on a FIFO queue for recent events, and a global memory with a gated update rule for long-range dependencies. These memories then act as a dynamic soft prompt for the next chunk. To enable efficient fine-tuning on extremely long contexts, we introduce a novel layer-level pipeline parallelism strategy. The effectiveness of our approach is remarkable: a model equipped with CoMeT and fine-tuned on 32k contexts can accurately retrieve a passkey from any position within a 1M token sequence. On the SCROLLS benchmark, CoMeT surpasses other efficient methods and achieves performance comparable to a full-attention baseline on summarization tasks. Its practical effectiveness is further validated on real-world agent and user behavior QA tasks. The code is available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/comet-B00B/"

Existing paradigms face a fundamental trade-off: optimization-based methods require computationally prohibitive queries, while alignment-based approaches hinge on the unrealistic assumption of accessible in-domain training data. These constraints render them ineffective in strict black-box and cross-domain settings. To dismantle these barriers, we introduce Zero2Text, a novel training-free framework based on recursive online alignment. Unlike methods relying on static datasets, Zero2Text synergizes LLM priors with a dynamic ridge regression mechanism to iteratively align generation to the target embedding on-the-fly. We further demonstrate that standard defenses, such as differential privacy, fail to effectively mitigate this adaptive threat. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks validate Zero2Text; notably, on MS MARCO against the OpenAI victim model, it achieves 1.8x higher ROUGE-L and 6.4x higher BLEU-2 scores compared to baselines, recovering sentences from unknown domains without a single leaked data pair."

By predicting collision possibility as a distribution, we extract both risk and uncertainty to guide the robot's actions. The uncertainty term encourages active perception, enabling simultaneous manipulation and information gathering to resolve occlusions. When combined with confidence maps that capture observation reliability, our approach enables safe navigation despite severe sensor occlusion. Extensive experiments across varying object sizes and obstacle configurations demonstrate that CURA-PPO achieves up to 3X higher success rates than the baselines, with learned behaviors that handle occlusions. Our method provides a practical solution for autonomous manipulation in cluttered environments using only onboard sensing."

    "abstract": "Pseudospectral analysis is fundamental for quantifying the sensitivity and transient behavior of nonnormal matrices, yet its computational cost scales cubically with dimension, rendering it prohibitive for large-scale systems. While existing research on scalable pseudospectral computation has focused on exploiting sparsity structures, common in discretizations of differential operators, these approaches are ill-suited for machine learning and data-driven dynamical systems, where operators are typically dense but approximately low-rank. In this paper, we develop a comprehensive low-rank framework that dramatically reduces this computational burden. Our core theoretical contribution is an exact characterization of the pseudospectrum of arbitrary low-rank matrices, reducing the evaluation of resolvent norms to eigenvalue problems of dimension proportional to the rank. Building on this foundation, we derive rigorous inclusion sets for the pseudospectra of general matrices via truncated and randomized low-rank approximations, with explicit perturbation bounds. These results enable efficient estimators for key stability quantities, including distance to instability and Kreiss constants, at a cost that scales with the effective rank rather than the ambient dimension. We further demonstrate how our framework naturally extends to data-driven settings, providing pseudospectral analysis of transfer operators learned from nonlinear and stochastic dynamical systems. Numerical experiments confirm orders-of-magnitude speedups while preserving accuracy, opening pseudospectral analysis to previously intractable high-dimensional problems in computational PDEs, control theory, and data-driven dynamics."

    "abstract": "With the increasingly use of multi-modal data, semantic query has become more and more demanded in data management systems, which is an important way to access and analyze multi-modal data. As unstructured data, most information of multi-modal data (text, image, video, etc) hides in the semantics, which cannot be accessed by the traditional database queries like SQL. Given the power of Large Language Model (LLM) in understanding semantics and processing natural language, in recent years several LLM-based semantic query systems have been proposed, to support semantic querying over unstructured data. However, this rapid growth has produced a fragmented ecosystem. Applications face significant integration challenges due to (1) disparate APIs of different semantic query systems and (2) a fundamental trade-off between specialization and generality. Many semantic query systems are highly specialized, offering state-of-the-art performance within a single modality but struggling with multi-modal data. Conversely, some \"all-in-one\" systems handle multiple modalities but often exhibit suboptimal performance compared to their specialized counterparts in specific modalities. This paper introduces Meta Engine, a novel \"query system on query systems\", designed to resolve those aforementioned challenges. Meta Engine is a unified semantic query engine that integrates heterogeneous, specialized LLM-based query systems. Its architecture comprises five key components: (1) a Natural Language (NL) Query Parser, (2) an Operator Generator, (3) a Query Router, (4) a set of Adapters, and (5) a Result Aggregator. In the evaluation, Meta Engine consistently outperforms all baselines, yielding 3-6x higher F1 in most cases and up to 24x on specific datasets."

CMAFNet consists of a Semantic Recomposition Module that performs dictionary-based feature purification via a learned codebook to suppress modality-specific noise while preserving defect-discriminative information, and a Contextual Semantic Integration Framework that captures global spatial dependencies using partial-channel attention to enhance structural semantic reasoning. Position-wise normalization within the purification stage enforces explicit reconstruction-driven cross-modal alignment, ensuring statistical compatibility between heterogeneous features prior to fusion. Extensive experiments on the TLRGBD benchmark, where 94.5% of instances are small objects, demonstrate that CMAFNet achieves 32.2% mAP@50 and 12.5% APs, outperforming the strongest baseline by 9.8 and 4.0 percentage points, respectively.

Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for mental health support, yet the model safeguards -- particularly refusals to engage with sensitive content -- remain poorly understood from the perspectives of users and mental health professionals (MHPs) and have been reported to cause real-world harms. This paper presents findings from a sequential mixed-methods study examining how LLM refusals are experienced and interpreted in mental health support interactions. Through surveys (N=53) and in-depth interviews (N=16) with individuals using LLMs for mental health support and MHPs, we reveal that refusals are not isolated, single-turn system behaviors, but rather constitute dynamic, multi-phase experiences: pre-refusal expectation formation, refusal triggering and encounter, refusal message framing, resource referral provision, and post-refusal outcomes. We contribute a multi-phase framework for evaluating refusals beyond binary policy compliance accuracy and design recommendations for future refusal mechanisms. These findings suggest that understanding LLM refusals requires moving beyond single-turn interactions toward recognizing them as holistic experiential processes embedded within the entire LLM design pipeline and the broader realities of mental health access."

    "abstract": "Realization of ferromagnetic ferroelectricity, combining two ferroic orders in a single phase, is the longstanding problem of great practical importance. One of the difficulties is that ferromagnetism alone cannot break inversion symmetry $\\mathcal{I}$. Therefore, such a phase cannon be obtained by purely magnetic means. Here, we show how it can be designed by making orbital degrees of freedom active. The idea can be traced back to a basic principle of interatomic exchange, which states that an alternation of occupied orbitals along a bond (i.e., antiferro orbital order) favors ferromagnetic coupling. Moreover, the antiferro orbital order breaks $\\mathcal{I}$, so that the bond becomes not simply ferromagnetic but also ferroelectric. Then, we formulate main principles governing the realization of such a state in solids, namely: (i) The magnetic atoms should not be located in inversion centers, as in the honeycomb lattice; (ii) The orbitals should be flexible enough to adjust they shape and minimize the energy of exchange interactions; (iii) This flexibility can be achieved by intraatomic interactions, which are responsible for Hund's second rule and compete with the crystal field splitting; (iv) For octahedrally coordinated transition-metal compounds, the most promising candidates appear to be iodides with a $d^{2}$ configuration and relatively weak $d$-$p$ hybridization. Such a situation is realized in the van der Walls compound VI$_3$, which we expect to be ferromagnetic ferroelectric."

    "abstract": "Visual tracking aims to automatically estimate the state of a target object in a video sequence, which is challenging especially in dynamic scenarios. Thus, numerous methods are proposed to introduce temporal cues to enhance tracking robustness. However, conventional CNN and Transformer architectures exhibit inherent limitations in modeling long-range temporal dependencies in visual tracking, often necessitating either complex customized modules or substantial computational costs to integrate temporal cues. Inspired by the success of the state space model, we propose a novel temporal modeling paradigm for visual tracking, termed State-aware Mamba Tracker (SMTrack), providing a neat pipeline for training and tracking without needing customized modules or substantial computational costs to build long-range temporal dependencies. It enjoys several merits. First, we propose a novel selective state-aware space model with state-wise parameters to capture more diverse temporal cues for robust tracking. Second, SMTrack facilitates long-range temporal interactions with linear computational complexity during training. Third, SMTrack enables each frame to interact with previously tracked frames via hidden state propagation and updating, which releases computational costs of handling temporal cues during tracking. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that SMTrack achieves promising performance with low computational costs."

    "abstract": "Loop closure detection (LCD) is a core component of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM): it identifies revisited places and enables pose-graph constraints that correct accumulated drift. Classic bag-of-words approaches such as DBoW are efficient but often degrade under appearance change and perceptual aliasing. In parallel, deep learning-based visual place recognition (VPR) descriptors (e.g., NetVLAD and Transformer-based models) offer stronger robustness, but their computational cost is often viewed as a barrier to real-time SLAM. In this paper, we empirically evaluate NetVLAD as an LCD module and compare it against DBoW on the KITTI dataset. We introduce a Fine-Grained Top-K precision-recall curve that better reflects LCD settings where a query may have zero or multiple valid matches. With Faiss-accelerated nearestneighbor search, NetVLAD achieves real-time query speed while improving accuracy and robustness over DBoW, making it a practical drop-in alternative for LCD in SLAM."

    "abstract": "In finite-dimensional quantum systems, temperature cannot be uniquely defined. This, in turn, implies that there are several ways to define entropy production in finite-dimensional quantum systems, because the classical entropy production depends on temperature. We propose a unified definition of entropy production based on the difference in quantum relative entropy with respect to reference states characterized by effective temperatures. We demonstrate that the proposed definition naturally decomposes into a Clausius-type entropy production and an additional contribution arising from the time dependence of the effective temperature. Furthermore, we show that requiring the entropy production rate to take the conventional form as the sum of the entropy change and the heat flow constrains the effective temperature to be either constant or equal to a specific energy-matching effective temperature. For general initial states, entropy production can become negative, in which case we derive lower bounds on entropy production and establish sufficient conditions for its non-negativity using the trace distance."

    "abstract": "Long-term multivariate time series forecasting (LTSF) plays a crucial role in various high-performance computing applications, including real-time energy grid management and large-scale traffic flow simulation. However, existing solutions face a dilemma: Transformer-based models suffer from quadratic complexity, limiting their scalability on long sequences, while linear State Space Models (SSMs) often struggle to distinguish valuable signals from high-frequency noise, leading to wasted state capacity. To bridge this gap, we propose ASGMamba, an efficient forecasting framework designed for resource-constrained supercomputing environments. ASGMamba integrates a lightweight Adaptive Spectral Gating (ASG) mechanism that dynamically filters noise based on local spectral energy, enabling the Mamba backbone to focus its state evolution on robust temporal dynamics. Furthermore, we introduce a hierarchical multi-scale architecture with variable-specific Node Embeddings to capture diverse physical characteristics. Extensive experiments on nine benchmarks demonstrate that ASGMamba achieves state-of-the-art accuracy. While keeping strictly $$\\mathcal{O}(L)$$ complexity we significantly reduce the memory usage on long-horizon tasks, thus establishing ASGMamba as a scalable solution for high-throughput forecasting in resource limited environments.The code is available at https://github.com/hit636/ASGMamba"

An author who generates text with AI, constructs intermediate document states post-hoc, and signs each hash produces a signature chain indistinguishable from genuine composition. We address this gap between cryptographic integrity and process provenance. We introduce proof-of-process, a primitive category for evidence that a physical process, not merely a signing key, produced a digital artifact. Our construction, the jitter seal, injects imperceptible microsecond delays derived via HMAC from a session secret, keystroke ordinal, and cumulative document hash. Valid evidence requires that real keystrokes produced the document through those intermediate states. We propose the Adversarial Collapse Principle as an evaluation criterion: evidence systems should be judged by whether disputing them requires a conjunction of specific, testable allegations against components with independent trust assumptions. We present Witnessd, an architecture combining jitter seals with Verifiable Delay Functions, external timestamp anchors, dual-source keystroke validation, and optional hardware attestation. Each layer forces allegations at different capability levels; disputing authentic evidence requires coordinated claims across independent trust boundaries. The system does not prevent forgery: a kernel-level adversary can defeat it, and typing AI-generated content produces valid evidence. The contribution is converting vague doubt into falsifiable allegations. We evaluate across 31,000 verification trials with deterministic rejection of invalid proofs."

    "abstract": "Bandit algorithms have recently emerged as a powerful tool for evaluating machine learning models, including generative image models and large language models, by efficiently identifying top-performing candidates without exhaustive comparisons. These methods typically rely on a reward model, often distributed with public weights on platforms such as Hugging Face, to provide feedback to the bandit. While online evaluation is expensive and requires repeated trials, offline evaluation with logged data has become an attractive alternative. However, the adversarial robustness of offline bandit evaluation remains largely unexplored, particularly when an attacker perturbs the reward model (rather than the training data) prior to bandit training. In this work, we fill this gap by investigating, both theoretically and empirically, the vulnerability of offline bandit training to adversarial manipulations of the reward model. We introduce a novel threat model in which an attacker exploits offline data in high-dimensional settings to hijack the bandit's behavior. Starting with linear reward functions and extending to nonlinear models such as ReLU neural networks, we study attacks on two Hugging Face evaluators used for generative model assessment: one measuring aesthetic quality and the other assessing compositional alignment. Our results show that even small, imperceptible perturbations to the reward model's weights can drastically alter the bandit's behavior. From a theoretical perspective, we prove a striking high-dimensional effect: as input dimensionality increases, the perturbation norm required for a successful attack decreases, making modern applications such as image evaluation especially vulnerable. Extensive experiments confirm that naive random perturbations are ineffective, whereas carefully targeted perturbations achieve near-perfect attack success rates ..."

This paper investigates the integration of SIM into multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems to enhance physical layer security. A novel system architecture is proposed, wherein each base station (BS) antenna transmits a dedicated single-user stream, while a multi-layer SIM executes wave-based beamforming in the electromagnetic domain, thereby avoiding the need for complex baseband digital precoding and significantly reducing hardware overhead. To maximize the weighted sum secrecy rate (WSSR), we formulate a joint precoding optimization problem over BS power allocation and SIM phase shifts, which is high-dimensional and non-convex due to the complexity of the objective function and the coupling among optimization variables. To address this, we propose a manifold-enhanced heterogeneous multi-agent continual learning (MHACL) framework that incorporates gradient representation and dual-scale policy optimization to achieve robust performance in dynamic environments with high demands for secure communication. Furthermore, we develop SIM-MHACL (SIMHACL), a low-complexity learning template that embeds phase coordination into a product manifold structure, reducing the exponential search space to linear complexity while maintaining physical feasibility. Simulation results validate that the proposed framework achieves millisecond-level per-iteratio ntraining in SIM-assisted systems, significantly outperforming various baseline schemes, with SIMHACL achieving comparable WSSR to MHACL while reducing computation time by 30\\%."

    "abstract": "While large language models have become the prevailing approach for agentic reasoning and planning, their success in symbolic domains does not readily translate to the physical world. Spatial intelligence, the ability to perceive 3D structure, reason about object relationships, and act under physical constraints, is an orthogonal capability that proves important for embodied agents. Existing surveys address either agentic architectures or spatial domains in isolation. None provide a unified framework connecting these complementary capabilities. This paper bridges that gap. Through a thorough review of over 2,000 papers, citing 742 works from top-tier venues, we introduce a unified three-axis taxonomy connecting agentic capabilities with spatial tasks across scales. Crucially, we distinguish spatial grounding (metric understanding of geometry and physics) from symbolic grounding (associating images with text), arguing that perception alone does not confer agency. Our analysis reveals three key findings mapped to these axes: (1) hierarchical memory systems (Capability axis) are important for long-horizon spatial tasks. (2) GNN-LLM integration (Task axis) is a promising approach for structured spatial reasoning. (3) World models (Scale axis) are essential for safe deployment across micro-to-macro spatial scales. We conclude by identifying six grand challenges and outlining directions for future research, including the need for unified evaluation frameworks to standardize cross-domain assessment. This taxonomy provides a foundation for unifying fragmented research efforts and enabling the next generation of spatially-aware autonomous systems in robotics, autonomous vehicles, and geospatial intelligence."

    "abstract": "With limited high-quality data and growing compute, multi-epoch training is gaining back its importance across sub-areas of deep learning. Adam(W), versions of which are go-to optimizers for many tasks such as next token prediction, has two momentum hyperparameters $(β_1, β_2)$ controlling memory and one very important hyperparameter, batch size, controlling (in particular) the amount mini-batch noise. We introduce a theoretical framework to understand how mini-batch noise influences the implicit bias of memory in Adam (depending on $β_1$, $β_2$) towards sharper or flatter regions of the loss landscape, which is commonly observed to correlate with the generalization gap in multi-epoch training. We find that in the case of large batch sizes, higher $β_2$ increases the magnitude of anti-regularization by memory (hurting generalization), but as the batch size becomes smaller, the dependence of (anti-)regulariation on $β_2$ is reversed. A similar monotonicity shift (in the opposite direction) happens in $β_1$. In particular, the commonly \"default\" pair $(β_1, β_2) = (0.9, 0.999)$ is a good choice if batches are small; for larger batches, in many settings moving $β_1$ closer to $β_2$ is much better in terms of validation accuracy in multi-epoch training. Moreover, our theoretical derivations connect the scale of the batch size at which the shift happens to the scale of the critical batch size. We illustrate this effect in experiments with small-scale data in the about-to-overfit regime."

As a consequence, the empirical measure converges to the McKean--Vlasov equation in negative Sobolev topologies at the canonical $N^{-1/2}$ scale. We also establish a Gaussian fluctuation limit for the fluctuation measure, where the sequential architecture produces an explicit feedback correction in the limiting linear SPDE. Our proofs rely on a Girsanov representation, a martingale-difference replacement of predecessor empirical measures by average conditional measures, and an upper-envelope argument."

Hallucinations are modeled as stochastic constraint violations, and we show that confidence-based selective prediction does not, in general, imply probabilistic risk guarantees. To enforce chance constraints efficiently, we propose a sequential, anytime-valid inference procedure that adaptively certifies feasibility or infeasibility using finite samples, avoiding conservative fixed-sample bounds. Experiments on questions inspired by NaturalQuestions and controlled multi-hop question answering demonstrate reliable risk control, early detection of intrinsically infeasible inputs, and safe composition under repeated use, while confidence-based baselines fail to provide consistent guarantees."

    "abstract": "Retargeting human motion to robot poses is a practical approach for teleoperating bimanual humanoid robot arms, but existing methods can be suboptimal and slow, often causing undesirable motion or latency. This is due to optimizing to match robot end-effector to human hand position and orientation, which can also limit the robot's workspace to that of the human. Instead, this paper reframes retargeting as an orientation alignment problem, enabling a closed-form, geometric solution algorithm with an optimality guarantee. The key idea is to align a robot arm to a human's upper and lower arm orientations, as identified from shoulder, elbow, and wrist (SEW) keypoints; hence, the method is called SEW-Mimic. The method has fast inference (3 kHz) on standard commercial CPUs, leaving computational overhead for downstream applications; an example in this paper is a safety filter to avoid bimanual self-collision. The method suits most 7-degree-of-freedom robot arms and humanoids, and is agnostic to input keypoint source. Experiments show that SEW-Mimic outperforms other retargeting methods in computation time and accuracy. A pilot user study suggests that the method improves teleoperation task success. Preliminary analysis indicates that data collected with SEW-Mimic improves policy learning due to being smoother. SEW-Mimic is also shown to be a drop-in way to accelerate full-body humanoid retargeting. Finally, hardware demonstrations illustrate SEW-Mimic's practicality. The results emphasize the utility of SEW-Mimic as a fundamental building block for bimanual robot manipulation and humanoid robot teleoperation."

The core objective is to enable agents to understand, predict, and interact with complex environments. However, current research landscape remains fragmented, with approaches predominantly focused on injecting world knowledge into isolated tasks, such as visual prediction, 3D estimation, or symbol grounding, rather than establishing a unified definition or framework. While these task-specific integrations yield performance gains, they often lack the systematic coherence required for holistic world understanding. In this paper, we analyze the limitations of such fragmented approaches and propose a unified design specification for world models. We suggest that a robust world model should not be a loose collection of capabilities but a normative framework that integrally incorporates interaction, perception, symbolic reasoning, and spatial representation.

We study the simplest possible way to exploit this redundancy: training only a randomly selected subset of parameters at extreme sparsities. Empirically, we find that training just 1\\% of parameters matches or exceeds full-parameter RLVR finetuning across 3 models and 2 task domains. Moreover, different random masks show minimal overlap ($\\leq 0.005$ Jaccard similarity) and yet all succeed, suggesting pretrained models contain many viable sparse subnetworks rather than one privileged set.

Recently, the emerging state-space model, namely Mamba, has shown great potential in balancing global receptive fields and computational efficiency. As a solution, we propose Saliency Mamba (Samba), a pure Mamba-based architecture that flexibly handles various distinct SOD tasks, including RGB/RGB-D/RGB-T SOD, video SOD (VSOD), RGB-D VSOD, and visible-depth-thermal SOD. Specifically, we rethink the scanning strategy of Mamba for SOD, and introduce a saliency-guided Mamba block (SGMB) that features a spatial neighborhood scanning (SNS) algorithm to preserve the spatial continuity of salient regions. A context-aware upsampling (CAU) method is also proposed to promote hierarchical feature alignment and aggregation by modeling contextual dependencies. As one step further, to avoid the \"task-specific\" problem as in previous SOD solutions, we develop Samba+, which is empowered by training Samba in a multi-task joint manner, leading to a more unified and versatile model. Two crucial components that collaboratively tackle challenges encountered in input of arbitrary modalities and continual adaptation are investigated. Specifically, a hub-and-spoke graph attention (HGA) module facilitates adaptive cross-modal interactive fusion, and a modality-anchored continual learning (MACL) strategy alleviates inter-modal conflicts together with catastrophic forgetting. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Samba individually outperforms existing methods across six SOD tasks on 22 datasets with lower computational cost, whereas Samba+ achieves even superior results on these tasks and datasets by using a single trained versatile model. Additional results further demonstrate the potential of our Samba framework."

However, instead of explicitly performing temporal interaction through self-attention, linear models implicitly perform it based on stacked MLP structures, which may be insufficient in capturing the complex temporal dependencies and their performance still has potential for improvement. To this end, we propose a Lightweight Sparse Interaction Network (LSINet) for TSF task. Inspired by the sparsity of self-attention, we propose a Multihead Sparse Interaction Mechanism (MSIM). Different from self-attention, MSIM learns the important connections between time steps through sparsity-induced Bernoulli distribution to capture temporal dependencies for TSF. The sparsity is ensured by the proposed self-adaptive regularization loss. Moreover, we observe the shareability of temporal interactions and propose to perform Shared Interaction Learning (SIL) for MSIM to further enhance efficiency and improve convergence. LSINet is a linear model comprising only MLP structures with low overhead and equipped with explicit temporal interaction mechanisms. Extensive experiments on public datasets show that LSINet achieves both higher accuracy and better efficiency than advanced linear models and transformer models in TSF tasks.

In this article, we present a new criterion for the absolute irreducibility of hypersurfaces defined by multivariate polynomials over finite fields. Our criterion does not require testing for irreducibility in the ground or extension fields, assuming that the leading form is square-free.

The Homogeneous Wall Lemma says that there exists a function $h$ that, given non-negative integers $q$ and $k$ and an $h(q,k)$-wall $W$ where each brick is assigned a, possibly empty, subset of $\\{ 1, \\ldots , q \\}$ contains a $k$-wall $W'$ as a subgraph such that, if one assigns to each brick $B$ of $W'$ the union of the sets assigned to the bricks of $W$ in its interior, then $W'$ is homogeneous. It is well-known that $h(q,k) \\in k^{\\mathcal{O}(q)}$. The Homogeneous Wall Lemma plays a key role in most applications of the Irrelevant Vertex Technique where an exponential dependency of $h$ on $q$ usually causes non-uniform dependencies on meta-parameters at best and additional exponential blow-ups at worst.

We summarize these concerns and analyze groundly their inherent limitations: i.e. the irreconcilable conflict between single (or few similar) domains SOTA and generalizability over general domains for time series forecasting neural network architecture designs. Moreover, neural networks architectures for general domain time series forecasting are becoming more and more complicated and their performance has almost saturated in recent years. As a result, network architectures developed aiming at fitting general time series domains are almost not inspiring for real world practices for certain single (or few similar) domains such as Finance, Weather, Traffic, etc: each specific domain develops their own methods that rarely utilize advances in neural network architectures of time series community in recent 2-3 years. As a result, we call for the time series community to shift focus away from research on time series neural network architectures for general domains: these researches have become saturated and away from domain-specific SOTAs over time. We should either (1) focus on deep learning methods for certain specific domain(s), or (2) turn to the development of meta-learning methods for general domains."

    "abstract": "Language models (LMs) are a central component of modern AI systems, and diffusion-based language models (DLMs) have recently emerged as a competitive alternative. Both paradigms rely on word embeddings not only to represent the input sentence, but also to represent the target sentence that backbone models are trained to predict. We argue that such static embedding of the target word is insensitive to neighboring words, encouraging locally accurate word prediction while neglecting global structure across the target sentence. To address this limitation, we propose a continuous sentence representation, termed sentence curve, defined as a spline curve whose control points affect multiple words in the sentence. Based on this representation, we introduce sentence curve language model (SCLM), which extends DLMs to predict sentence curves instead of the static word embeddings. We theoretically show that sentence curve prediction induces a regularization effect that promotes global structure modeling, and characterize how different sentence curve types affect this behavior. Empirically, SCLM achieves SOTA performance among DLMs on IWSLT14 and WMT14, shows stable training without burdensome knowledge distillation, and demonstrates promising potential compared to discrete DLMs on LM1B."

    "abstract": "Lindbladian quantum master equations (LEs) are the most popular descriptions for quantum systems weakly coupled to baths. But, recent works have established that in many situations such Markovian descriptions are fundamentally limited: they cannot simultaneously capture populations and coherences even to the leading-order in system-bath couplings. This can cause violation of fundamental properties like thermalization and continuity equations associated with local conservation laws, even when such properties are expected in the actual setting. This begs the question: given a physical situation, how do we know if there exists an LE that describes it to a desired accuracy? Here we show that, for both equilibrium and non-equilibrium steady states (NESS), this question can be succinctly formulated as a semidefinite program (SDP), a convex optimization technique. If a solution to the SDP can be found to a desired accuracy, then an LE description is possible for the chosen setting. If not, no LE description is fundamentally attainable, showing that a consistent Markovian treatment is impossible even at weak system-bath coupling for that particular setting. Considering few qubit isotropic XXZ-type models coupled to multiple baths, we find that in most parameter regimes, LE description giving accurate populations and coherences to leading-order is unattainable, leading to rigorous no-go results. However, in some cases, LE description having correct populations but inaccurate coherences, and satisfying local conservation laws, is possible over some of the parameter regimes. Our work highlights the power of semidefinite programming in the analysis of physically consistent LEs, thereby, in understanding the limits of Markovian descriptions at weak system-bath couplings."

However, conventional methods for controlling birefringence typically rely on engineering the optical crystal structure or applying external stimuli such as electric fields, mechanical stress or thermal variations, which are often constrained by limited tunability, challenges in integration with compact photonic devices or slow response time. Here, we introduce a new degree of freedom to manipulate the birefringence of light propagation in optical crystals through programming the spatiotemporal spectral phase of the incident light wave. We demonstrate this approach achieves continuous tuning of birefringence across a spectrum more than 100 times broader than that achievable with conventional birefringence tuning, spanning from positive through zero to negative values, irrespective of the crystal's optical sign and without inherent physical limitations. This unique optical behavior provides a versatile platform for investigating the complex dynamics of wave flow in anisotropic media, while the broad tunability of this space-time birefringence will spur innovations in ultrafast optical manipulation, optical computation, and quantum information processing-applications that demand rapid and flexible device reconfiguration."

With proper control, such instability can be harnessed to enable the formation of sophisticated nanostructures with nanometric precision. These self-organization phenomena are not limited to thermal stimulation alone but can also be triggered by other external stimuli. In this work, we investigate the morphological evolution of thin films composed of evaporated C60 and sputtered nickel mixtures, focusing on how external stimuli influence both their structural and electrical properties. Thin films were prepared under controlled deposition conditions, and their surface morphology was analyzed using advanced characterization techniques. Progressive changes in film morphology were observed as a function of composition and external treatment, highlighting the interplay between metallic and molecular components. In particular, it was observed that, due to the annealing treatment, the sample undergoes strong phase separation, with the formation of structures tens of microns in diameter and an increase in electrical resistance, exhibiting insulating behavior. These findings provide insights into the mechanisms governing hybrid thin film formation and suggest potential applications in electronic, optoelectronic, and energy-related devices."

However, the substantial computational overhead of existing dense Transformerbased models significantly hinders real-time deployment. To address this efficiency-performance bottleneck, we introduce DDP-WM, a novel world model centered on the principle of Disentangled Dynamics Prediction (DDP). We hypothesize that latent state evolution in observed scenes is heterogeneous and can be decomposed into sparse primary dynamics driven by physical interactions and secondary context-driven background updates. DDP-WM realizes this decomposition through an architecture that integrates efficient historical processing with dynamic localization to isolate primary dynamics. By employing a crossattention mechanism for background updates, the framework optimizes resource allocation and provides a smooth optimization landscape for planners. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DDP-WM achieves significant efficiency and performance across diverse tasks, including navigation, precise tabletop manipulation, and complex deformable or multi-body interactions. Specifically, on the challenging Push-T task, DDP-WM achieves an approximately 9 times inference speedup and improves the MPC success rate from 90% to98% compared to state-of-the-art dense models. The results establish a promising path for developing efficient, high-fidelity world models. Codes will be available at https://github.com/HCPLabSYSU/DDP-WM."

However, this is hard to decide, because costs can vary drastically: a simple parameter tweak may take seconds, while fabricating hardware consumes material and energy. Such asymmetries, can discourage a designer from exploring the design space. In this paper, we present an extension of cost-aware Bayesian optimization to account for diverse prototyping costs. The method builds on the power of Bayesian optimization and requires only a minimal modification to the acquisition function. The key idea is to use designer-estimated costs to guide sampling toward more cost-effective prototypes. In technical evaluations, the method achieved comparable utility to a cost-agnostic baseline while requiring only ${\\approx}70\\%$ of the cost; under strict budgets, it outperformed the baseline threefold. A within-subjects study with 12 participants in a realistic joystick design task demonstrated similar benefits. These results show that accounting for prototyping costs can make Bayesian optimization more compatible with real-world design projects."

    "abstract": "We study the phenomenology of a light charged Higgs boson in the framework of the Alternative Left--Right Symmetric Model (ALRM). In this model, stringent flavor constraints are evaded due to a non-conventional fermion spectrum in which the right-handed up-type quarks are paired with the exotic down-type quarks rather than the Standard Model down-type quarks, leading to the absence of tree-level flavor-changing neutral currents. Furthermore, a specific assignment of the global $U(1)_S$ symmetry and the resulting emergent $R$-parity prevent mixing between the right- and left-handed charged gauge bosons, $W_R$ and $W_L$, providing additional suppression of flavor-violating effects. The ALRM accommodates potentially viable dark matter candidates, both fermionic and scalar ones. In this context, an associated charged Higgs state, $H_2^\\pm$, belonging to the dark sector can naturally acquire a sub-TeV to TeV-scale mass without conflicting with any experimental constraints. We focus on scenarios in which $H_2^\\pm$ behaves as a long-lived particle due to a sub-GeV mass splitting with the dark matter candidate. We identify regions of parameter space consistent with the observed dark matter relic density and other experimental constraints. A detailed analysis of disappearing track signatures is performed, including realistic tracklet reconstruction efficiencies, and the existing ATLAS search are recast to assess the current limits and future sensitivities. We find that the HL-LHC has limited sensitivity to TeV-scale charged Higgs bosons in this scenario, while the 27 TeV HE-LHC can effectively probe the relevant parameter space, with a 100 TeV collider offering substantially enhanced discovery potential."

For positive admissible-level string functions for the affine Kac--Moody algebra $A_{1}^{(1)}$, very little is known. Here we apply the notion of quasi-periodicity to a generalized Euler identity of Schilling and Warnaar for the affine Kac--Moody algebra $A_{1}^{(1)}$. For integral-level string functions the classical periodicity reduces the infinite sum of string functions in the generalized Euler identity to a finite sum of string functions with theta function coefficients. For admissible-level, we similarly reduce to an analogous finite sum of string functions, but we also gain an additional finite sum of the form \\begin{equation*} \\sum_{i}Φ_{i}(q)Ψ_{i}(q), \\end{equation*} where the $Φ_i(q)$'s are modular and depend only on the spin and the $Ψ_{i}(q)$'s are (mixed) mock modular Hecke-type double-sums and depend only on the quantum number. For levels $1/2$, $1/3$, and $2/3$, we shall also see that the $Ψ_{i}(q)$'s give us families of mock theta conjecture-like identities for symmetric Hecke-type double-sums. Our work here focuses on evaluating the $Ψ_{i}(q)$'s, and our expressions utilize Ramanujan's second-order mock theta function $μ_2(q)$ and third-order mock theta functions $f_{3}(q)$, $ω_3(q)$, $ψ_{3}(q)$, and $χ_3(q)$."

    "abstract": "Telemetry streams from large-scale Internet-connected systems (e.g., IoT deployments and online platforms) naturally form an irregular multivariate time series (IMTS) whose accurate forecasting is operationally vital. A closer examination reveals a defining Sparsity-Event Duality (SED) property of IMTS, i.e., long stretches with sparse or no observations are punctuated by short, dense bursts where most semantic events (observations) occur. However, existing Graph- and Transformer-based forecasters ignore SED: pre-alignment to uniform grids with heavy padding violates sparsity by inflating sequences and forcing computation at non-informative steps, while relational recasting weakens event semantics by disrupting local temporal continuity. These limitations motivate a more faithful and natural modeling paradigm for IMTS that aligns with its SED property. We find that Spiking Neural Networks meet this requirement, as they communicate via sparse binary spikes and update in an event-driven manner, aligning naturally with the SED nature of IMTS. Therefore, we present SEDformer, an SED-enhanced Spiking Transformer for telemetry IMTS forecasting that couples: (1) a SED-based Spike Encoder converts raw observations into event synchronous spikes using an Event-Aligned LIF neuron, (2) an Event-Preserving Temporal Downsampling module compresses long gaps while retaining salient firings and (3) a stack of SED-based Spike Transformer blocks enable intra-series dependency modeling with a membrane-based linear attention driven by EA-LIF spiking features. Experiments on public telemetry IMTS datasets show that SEDformer attains state-of-the-art forecasting accuracy while reducing energy and memory usage, providing a natural and efficient path for modeling IMTS."

Static tests measured detection range across distances of 1-7 meters and viewing angles of 0-75 degrees horizontally. Dynamic tests examined the impact of motion by varying walking speed from slow (0.8 m/s) to very fast (1.8 m/s) and comparing three camera mounting positions: head-mounted, shoulder-mounted, and hand-held. We evaluated both a smartphone and smart glasses, using the phone's main and ultra-wide cameras. Four OCR engines were benchmarked to assess accuracy at different distances and viewing angles: Google Vision, PaddleOCR 3.0, EasyOCR, and Tesseract. PaddleOCR 3.0 was then used to evaluate accuracy at different walking speeds. Accuracy was computed at the character level using the Levenshtein ratio against manually defined ground truth. Results showed that recognition accuracy declined with increased walking speed and wider viewing angles. Google Vision achieved the highest overall accuracy, with PaddleOCR close behind as the strongest open-source alternative. Across devices, the phone's main camera achieved the highest accuracy, and a shoulder-mounted placement yielded the highest average among body positions; however, differences among shoulder, head, and hand were not statistically significant."

We present ECHO-2, a distributed RL framework for post-training with remote inference workers and non-negligible dissemination latency. ECHO-2 combines centralized learning with distributed rollouts and treats bounded policy staleness as a user-controlled parameter, enabling rollout generation, dissemination, and training to overlap. We introduce an overlap-based capacity model that relates training time, dissemination latency, and rollout throughput, yielding a practical provisioning rule for sustaining learner utilization. To mitigate dissemination bottlenecks and lower cost, ECHO-2 employs peer-assisted pipelined broadcast and cost-aware activation of heterogeneous workers.

We reveal that DLLMs can effectively absorb alignment knowledge from AR-LLMs through simple weight scaling, exploiting the shared architectural structure between these divergent generation paradigms. Crucially, our approach circumvents the high variance and computational overhead of direct DLLM alignment and comprehensive experiments across diverse preference alignment tasks demonstrate that AR-MAP achieves competitive or superior performance compared to existing DLLM-specific alignment methods, achieving 69.08\\% average score across all tasks and models.

Two complementary EFT approaches are developed: (1) A low-energy theory near the $B \\bar D$ ($J=0$) and $B^* \\bar D$ ($J=1$) thresholds, where coupled-channel effects are integrated out; (2) A coupled-channel formulation, where all relevant momentum scales are treated as soft, incorporating contact interactions and one-pion exchange (OPE). Importantly, OPE contributes to the lowest channels only through off-diagonal transitions, thus resulting in the appearance of the left-hand cut from two-pion exchange. The two approaches yield mutually consistent results, supporting the existence of shallow bound states in both channels, in agreement with the lattice findings. The finite-volume spectra and extracted pole positions show a near-degeneracy in $J=0$ and $J=1$ channels, consistent with heavy-quark spin symmetry (HQSS). Using HQSS, we predict additional shallow bound states near the $B \\bar{D}^*$ and $B^* \\bar{D}^*$ thresholds, which are accessible to future lattice simulations. The effect of OPE on the finite volume spectra is found to be small, with only moderate impact on HQSS partners."

Existing methods generate images with insufficient diversity and controllability, suffering from issues such as monotonous texture features and distorted anatomical structures. Therefore, we propose a two-stage generative adversarial network (TSGAN) to enhance the diversity and spatial controllability of synthetic data by decoupling the morphological structure and texture features of lung nodules. In the first stage, StyleGAN is used to generate semantic segmentation mask images, encoding lung nodules and tissue backgrounds to control the anatomical structure of lung nodule images; The second stage uses the DL-Pix2Pix model to translate the mask map into CT images, employing local importance attention to capture local features, while utilizing dynamic weight multi-head window attention to enhance the modeling capability of lung nodule texture and background. Compared to the original dataset, the accuracy improved by 4.6% and mAP by 4% on the LUNA16 dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that TSGAN can enhance the quality of synthetic images and the performance of detection models."

    "abstract": "Recent advances in visual reasoning have leveraged vision transformers to tackle the ARC-AGI benchmark. However, we argue that the feed-forward architecture, where computational depth is strictly bound to parameter size, falls short of capturing the iterative, algorithmic nature of human induction. In this work, we propose a recursive architecture called Loop-ViT, which decouples reasoning depth from model capacity through weight-tied recurrence. Loop-ViT iterates a weight-tied Hybrid Block, combining local convolutions and global attention, to form a latent chain of thought. Crucially, we introduce a parameter-free Dynamic Exit mechanism based on predictive entropy: the model halts inference when its internal state ``crystallizes\" into a low-uncertainty attractor. Empirical results on the ARC-AGI-1 benchmark validate this perspective: our 18M model achieves 65.8% accuracy, outperforming massive 73M-parameter ensembles. These findings demonstrate that adaptive iterative computation offers a far more efficient scaling axis for visual reasoning than simply increasing network width.

Unlike low-rank alternatives, VQRound minimizes the element-wise worst-case error under $L_\\infty$ norm, which is critical for handling heavy-tailed weight distributions in LLMs. Beyond reparameterization, we identify rounding initialization as a decisive factor and develop a lightweight end-to-end finetuning pipeline that optimizes codebooks across all layers using only 128 samples. Extensive experiments on OPT, LLaMA, LLaMA2, and Qwen3 models demonstrate that VQRound achieves better convergence than traditional adaptive rounding at the same number of steps while using as little as 0.2% of the trainable parameters. Our results show that adaptive rounding can be made both scalable and fast-fitting. The code is available at https://github.com/zhoustan/VQRound."

Each question can be answered in both modalities (image and text), enabling a symmetric evaluation of a model's bidirectional inference capability and cross-modal consistency. Experiments reveal a persistent gap between the two directions across a wide range of UMMs with different architectures, suggesting that current models achieve only surface-level unification rather than deep cognitive convergence of the two. To further explore the underlying mechanism, we conduct an empirical study from the perspective of knowledge manipulation to illustrate the underlying limitations. Our findings indicate that knowledge within UMMs often remains disjoint. The capability emergence and knowledge across modalities are unsynchronized, paving the way for further exploration."

However, manually designing piecewise deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents cannot keep pace with frequent dynamics shifts and service-level agreement (SLA) changes of an evolving DC. This specification-to-policy lag causes a lack of timely, effective control policies, which may lead to service outages. To bridge the gap, we present DCoPilot, a hybrid framework for generative control policies in dynamic DC operation. DCoPilot synergizes two distinct generative paradigms, i.e., a large language model (LLM) that performs symbolic generation of structured reward forms, and a hypernetwork that conducts parametric generation of policy weights. DCoPilot operates through three coordinated phases: (i) simulation scale-up, which stress-tests reward candidates across diverse simulation-ready (SimReady) scenes; (ii) meta policy distillation, where a hypernetwork is trained to output policy weights conditioned on SLA and scene embeddings; and (iii) online adaptation, enabling zero-shot policy generation in response to updated specifications. Evaluated across five control task families spanning diverse DC components, DCoPilot achieves near-zero constraint violations and outperforms all baselines across specification variations. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of LLM-based unified reward generation in enabling stable hypernetwork convergence."

Specifically, we propose a generalized two-step codebook construction (TSCC) method that leverages two-dimensional angular-domain decoupling to transform planar array beamformer design into two independent one-dimensional linear array beamformer design problems, efficiently solved via the Gerchberg-Saxton algorithm and our proposed majorization-minimization-based proximal distance (PDMM) algorithm. We further develop a two-stage coded-sliding beam training (TSCSBT) method for low-overhead and high-accuracy beam training, where error-correcting codes are embedded in the first-stage training to enhance robustness against noise, and sliding sampling is subsequently performed around the matched angular samples to improve angular resolution. The proposed framework is further extended to multi-path user channels. Finally, a variable decoupling-based block successive upper bound minimization (VD-BSUM) algorithm is proposed to directly solve the QoS-constrained sum-rate maximization problem through closed-form iterative updates with substantially reduced computational complexity. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods in achieving precise beam pattern realization, improved beam training accuracy and angular resolution, and enhanced sum-rate performance."

We present a training-free conditional diffusion model framework for learning stochastic flow maps of parameter-dependent SDEs, where both drift and diffusion coefficients depend on physical parameters. The key technical innovation is a joint kernel-weighted Monte Carlo estimator that approximates the conditional score function using trajectory data sampled at discrete parameter values, enabling interpolation across both state space and the continuous parameter domain. Once trained, the resulting generative model produces sample trajectories for any parameter value within the training range without retraining, significantly accelerating parameter studies, uncertainty quantification, and real-time filtering applications. The performance of the proposed approach is demonstrated via three numerical examples of increasing complexity, showing accurate approximation of conditional distributions across varying parameter values."

In contrast to the weaker notion of external regret minimization - a problem which is fairly well understood in the literature - achieving no-swap regret with a polylogarithmic dependence on $N$ has remained elusive in combinatorial bandits. Our paper resolves this challenge, by introducing a no-swap-regret learning algorithm with regret that scales polylogarithmically in $N$ and is tight for the class of combinatorial bandits.

In this perspective, scaling, intermittency and extremes are not peripheral imperfections around a well-behaved equilibrium; they are the very texture of economic and financial fluctuations. This naturally shifts attention from exogenous narratives to endogenous dynamics: interactions, feedback loops, and collective amplification mechanisms that can make systems intrinsically {\\it fragile}.

We investigate the optical response of Mie voids under both plane-wave and dipolar excitation. For plane waves, the voids preferentially scatter light in the forward direction. Under dipolar excitation, the resulting radiation emission towards the void and beyond is suppressed due to destructive interference between the dipole field with the directional scattered field of the void. These findings identify Mie voids as versatile broadband directional sources, opening pathways for antenna design and energy harvesting at the nanoscale."

The Dirac interactions are constructed from the real and imaginary parts of breather solutions of the DS II system. In this framework, the SKT effect arises when the energy is tuned to match the constant background of the soliton, while the resulting Dirac Hamiltonians simultaneously support bound states embedded in the continuum. By imposing the SKT boundary conditions, we employ Darboux transformations to construct a general three-parameter family of DS II breather solutions that can be mapped to Dirac Hamiltonians. At the initial soliton time, the corresponding Dirac systems form a massless two-parameter family of Hermitian models with nontrivial electrostatic potentials. As the soliton time evolves, the systems become $\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric and develop a nontrivial imaginary mass term. Finally, when the soliton time is taken to be imaginary, the construction yields Hermitian Dirac systems that lack time-reversal symmetry. In all cases, we identify the emergence of quasi-symmetry transformations that preserve the SKT subspace of states while not commuting with the full Hamiltonian."

Weak integrability breaking from interatomic dipolar couplings is directly detectable within experimentally accessible times in the dynamics of non-local observables. In particular, magnetization fluctuations are highly sensitive to the breaking of fragile conservation laws and exhibit anomalous growth, which we observe experimentally; similar signatures appear in a semilocal string observable. Numerical simulations on substantially longer chains and a simplified classical stochastic model reproduce those features.

    "abstract": "The theory of free-choice Petri nets is an established field, initiated in the 1970s by Commoner and Hack at MIT. We revisit well-formed free-choice nets (those admitting markings that are both live and bounded) and provide a new characterization by introducing semi-T-components. This notion is dual to that of semi-S-components, which in turn correspond to the well-known minimal siphons. By highlighting the symmetry between these dual concepts, we derive the classical coverability theorems for T- and S-components, as well as the duality theorem -- stating that a free-choice net is well-formed if and only if its reverse-dual is also well-formed -- using arguments that are as symmetric as possible."

Given far field observations of the scattered fields corresponding to plane wave incident fields for all possible incident and observation directions we study the inverse problem to recover the support of the scatterer. We propose a qualitative monotonicity-based regularization scheme which combines monotonicity-based shape reconstruction with one-step linearization to reconstruct a discrete approximation of the shape of the scatterer from noisy far field data. The purpose of the one-step linearization is to stabilize the monotonicity approach to shape reconstruction. We show that the monotonicity-based regularization scheme recovers the correct shape of the scatterer for noise-free data. Furthermore, we establish that the solution of the monotonicity-based regularization converges to the exact solution as the noise level tends to zero. We present numerical examples to illustrate our theoretical findings."

Although the associated mean-field objective admits a unique mixed Nash equilibrium, the long-time behavior of the original MFL-DA for general nonconvex-nonconcave payoffs has remained largely open. Answering an open question posed by Wang and Chizat (COLT 2024), we provide a partial resolution by proving that this equilibrium is locally exponentially stable: if the initialization is sufficiently close in Wasserstein metric, the dynamics trends to the equilibrium at an exponential rate. The key to our analysis is to establish a coercivity estimate for the entropy near equilibrium via spectral analysis of the linearized operator. We show that this coercivity effectively reveals a local displacement convex-concave structure, thereby driving contraction. This result settles the local stability and quantitative rate questions of Wang and Chizat, leaving global convergence as a remaining open challenge."

In particular, a halo-like structure has been suggested for the $1^+$ state of $^{22}$Al based on the large isospin asymmetry observed in the $^{22}$Si/$^{22}$O mirror Gamow-Teller transitions. Recent mass measurements further indicate that the ground state of $^{22}$Al is weakly bound, with a single-proton separation energy of about 100 keV. To investigate how the continuum affects the structure and decay properties of this proton-dripline nucleus, we employ the state-of-the-art Gamow shell model. This approach utilizes valence-space effective interactions and operators derived from chiral forces. Our calculations identify the ground state of $^{22}$Al as a $4^+$ state, with a $3^+$ state as the first excitation. Despite their diffuse nature under weak binding, the Thomas-Ehrman shift for these states is found to be negligible due to their small $s$-wave components. In contrast, the excited $1_1^+$ state possesses a significantly larger $s$-wave component, resulting in a more pronounced halo-like structure."

In contrast to diverse and controversial results that compare models and data for the \\emph{luminosity} evolution of galaxies -- reported in an abundance of recent papers, we find very good, unambiguous agreement in the more fundamental quantity of stellar mass - measured from JWST observations - and Galacticus predictions. Specifically, we find good agreement for the shape of the integrated stellar mass as a function of redshift without any adjustment of parameters, and in \\emph{amplitude} as well, when 'feedback' is lowered by a factor of 3 compared to that required to match later-universe models and data. This result emerged from detailed investigation of the claim by Dressler et al. that bursts of star formation dominated the growth in stellar mass, specifically, that half of the galaxies with stellar mass growth of $M_* > 2\\times10^8 \\mathrm{M}_\\odot$ in the epoch $8<z<6$ had less than $M_*<\\times10^8 \\mathrm{M}_\\odot$ prior to $z = 8$. Here too we find agreement between models and data, namely that these ~100 Myr 'bursts' had strong in situ growth at $z\\le8$, or showed (in Galacticus) substantial stellar and/or gas-rich mergers, and 30-40 Myr 'starbursts' as are common in $z<3$ galaxies. We note that, if a theoretical simulation is unable to pass the test of matching the growth of stellar mass, any success in reproducing the luminosity function is meaningless."

The method discretizes the redshift space into ordered bins and optimizes the Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS), which respects the ordinal nature of redshift and naturally provides uncertainty quantification. Unlike traditional regression approaches that output single point estimates, our method can capture multi-modal posterior distributions arising from color-redshift degeneracies. We apply this method to the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys Data Release 10 (LSDR10) and Pan-STARRS Data Release 2 (PS1DR2), using an unprecedented spectroscopic training sample from DESI DR1 and SDSS DR19. Our method achieves $σ_{\\mathrm{NMAD}} = 0.0153$ and $η= 0.50\\%$ on LSDR10, and $σ_{\\mathrm{NMAD}} = 0.0222$ and $η= 0.34\\%$ on PS1DR2 combined with unWISE infrared photometry. The NNC method outperforms Random Forest, XGBoost, and standard neural network regression. We demonstrate that DESI DR1 significantly improves photo-$z$ performance at $z > 1$, while the combination of deep optical photometry and mid-infrared coverage is essential for achieving high precision across the full redshift range. We provide a unified photometric redshift catalog combining LSDR10 and PS1DR2 with a hierarchical model selection strategy based on available photometry. The well-calibrated PDFs produced by our method are valuable for cosmological studies and can be extended to next-generation surveys such as CSST, Euclid, and LSST."

    "abstract": "Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) offer a promising framework by embedding partial differential equations (PDEs) into the loss function together with measurement data, making them well-suited for inverse problems. However, standard PINNs face challenges with time-dependent PDEs due to the high computational cost of space-time training and the risk of convergence to local minima. These limitations are particularly pronounced in hemodynamic analysis, where 4D-flow magnetic resonance imaging (4D-flow MRI) yields temporally sparse velocity snapshots over the cardiac cycle. To address this challenge, we propose a PINN framework that reconstructs instantaneous flow fields from transient velocity snapshots by inferring the acceleration term in the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. By designing the network without explicit time as an input, the proposed approach enables physics enforcement using spatial evaluations alone, improving training efficiency while maintaining physical consistency with transient flow characteristics. In addition, we introduce an acceleration-mismatch loss that penalizes discrepancies between predicted and measured accelerations, which improves prediction accuracy through regularization. Numerical examples on pulsatile flow behind a stenosis using temporally and spatially downsampled synthetic data generated from time-resolved CFD demonstrate that the proposed framework reliably reconstructs velocity fields even under sparse temporal sampling, and appropriate regularization for acceleration improves predictions of pressure-gradient and acceleration fields."

    "abstract": "Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have revolutionized continuous signal modeling, yet they struggle to recover fine-grained details within finite training budgets. While empirical techniques, such as positional encoding (PE), sinusoidal activations (SIREN), and batch normalization (BN), effectively mitigate this, their theoretical justifications are predominantly post hoc, focusing on the global NTK spectrum only after modifications are applied. In this work, we reverse this paradigm by introducing a structural diagnostic framework. By performing a layer-wise decomposition of the NTK, we mathematically identify the ``Inlet Rank Collapse'': a phenomenon where the low-dimensional input coordinates fail to span the high-dimensional embedding space, creating a fundamental rank deficiency at the first layer that acts as an expressive bottleneck for the entire network. This framework provides a unified perspective to re-interpret PE, SIREN, and BN as different forms of rank restoration. Guided by this diagnosis, we derive a Rank-Expanding Initialization, a minimalist remedy that ensures the representation rank scales with the layer width without architectural modifications or computational overhead. Our results demonstrate that this principled remedy enables standard MLPs to achieve high-fidelity reconstructions, proving that the key to empowering INRs lies in the structural optimization of the initial rank propagation to effectively populate the latent space."

    "abstract": "Deploying learned control policies on humanoid robots is challenging: policies that appear robust in simulation can execute confidently in out-of-distribution (OOD) states after Sim-to-Real transfer, leading to silent failures that risk hardware damage. Although anomaly detection can mitigate these failures, prior methods are often incompatible with high-rate control, poorly calibrated at the extremely low false-positive rates required for practical deployment, or operate as black boxes that provide a binary stop signal without explaining why the robot drifted from nominal behavior. We present RAPT, a lightweight, self-supervised deployment-time monitor for 50Hz humanoid control. RAPT learns a probabilistic spatio-temporal manifold of nominal execution from simulation and evaluates execution-time predictive deviation as a calibrated, per-dimension signal. This yields (i) reliable online OOD detection under strict false-positive constraints and (ii) a continuous, interpretable measure of Sim-to-Real mismatch that can be tracked over time to quantify how far deployment has drifted from training. Beyond detection, we introduce an automated post-hoc root-cause analysis pipeline that combines gradient-based temporal saliency derived from RAPT's reconstruction objective with LLM-based reasoning conditioned on saliency and joint kinematics to produce semantic failure diagnoses in a zero-shot setting. We evaluate RAPT on a Unitree G1 humanoid across four complex tasks in simulation and on physical hardware. In large-scale simulation, RAPT improves True Positive Rate (TPR) by 37% over the strongest baseline at a fixed episode-level false positive rate of 0.5%. On real-world deployments, RAPT achieves a 12.5% TPR improvement and provides actionable interpretability, reaching 75% root-cause classification accuracy across 16 real-world failures using only proprioceptive data."

Unlike existing methods that rely on static rubrics or disjoint training pipelines, our approach treats rubric generation as a latent action learned to maximize judgment accuracy. We introduce an alternating optimization strategy to mitigate the non-stationarity of simultaneous updates, providing theoretical analysis that demonstrates how this schedule reduces gradient variance during training. Extensive experiments show that Rubric-ARM achieves state-of-the-art performance among baselines on multiple benchmarks and significantly improves downstream policy alignment in both offline and online reinforcement learning settings."

This is especially important for, e.g., hadronization models, where high precision is required to interpret the results of collider experiments. We introduce the High-Dimensional Sensitivity (HDSense) score, a computationally efficient metric for ranking observable sets using only one-dimensional histograms. Derived by profiling over unknown correlations in the Fisher information framework, the score balances total information content against redundancy between observables. We apply HDSense to rank a set observables in terms of their constraining power with respect to five parameters of the Lund string model of hadronization implemented in Pythia using simulated leptonic collider events at the $Z$ pole. Validation against machine-learning--based full-likelihood approximations demonstrates that HDSense successfully identifies near-optimal observable subsets. The framework naturally handles data from multiple experiments with different acceptances and incorporates detector effects. While demonstrated on hadronization models, the methodology applies broadly to generic parameter estimation problems where correlations are unknown or difficult to model."

Yet, most existing methods treat workload scheduling and regulation capacity bidding separately, overlooking how queueing dynamics and spatial-temporal dispatch decisions affect the ability to sustain real-time regulation. As a result, the committed regulation may become infeasible or short-lived. To address this issue, we propose a unified day-ahead co-optimization framework that jointly decides workload distribution across geographically distributed DCs and regulation capacity commitments. We construct a space-time network model to capture workload migration costs, latency requirements, and heterogeneous resource limits. To ensure that the committed regulation remains deliverable, we introduce chance constraints on instantaneous power flexibility based on interactive load forecasts, and apply Value-at-Risk queue-state constraints to maintain sustainable response under cumulative regulation signals. Case studies on a modified IEEE 68-bus system using real data center traces show that the proposed framework lowers system operating costs, enables more viable regulation capacity, and achieves better revenue-risk trade-offs compared to strategies that optimize scheduling and regulation independently."

    "abstract": "Traffic waves, the spatiotemporal propagation of congestion, are a key feature of traffic flow. As Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) systems gain widespread adoption and show promise for improving both efficiency and safety, understanding how these waves evolve under ACC becomes increasingly important. Yet most existing analyses rely on steady-state metrics (e.g., equilibrium spacing) and neglect the ACC control-law parameters, such as feedback gains, that fundamentally shape higher-order traffic dynamics. To overcome this limitation, we embed the ACC control law directly into the momentum equation while retaining mass conservation law. The result is a higher-order macroscopic model whose dynamics are governed by a second-order partial differential equation equivalent to the linear ACC feedback law. Analyzing the flux Jacobian confirms that the system is strictly hyperbolic, thereby preserving anisotropy and ensuring physical consistency. The derivation also shows that traffic wave evolution depends on both the initial state and the ACC control parameters. We analyze wave-propagation characteristics, linear degeneracy, admissible discontinuities, and their connection to ACC string stability, with the corresponding derivations. Numerical experiments confirm that the second-order model yields markedly lower vehicle-pair speed deviations along wave paths than a first-order model subject to the same non-steady disturbances, underscoring both the necessity of a second-order treatment and the soundness of the proposed framework."

To address these challenges, we propose TreeLoc, a LiDAR-based global localization framework for forests that handles place recognition and 6-DoF pose estimation. We represent scenes using tree stems and their Diameter at Breast Height (DBH), which are aligned to a common reference frame via their axes and summarized using the tree distribution histogram (TDH) for coarse matching, followed by fine matching with a 2D triangle descriptor. Finally, pose estimation is achieved through a two-step geometric verification. On diverse forest benchmarks, TreeLoc outperforms baselines, achieving precise localization. Ablation studies validate the contribution of each component. We also propose applications for long-term forest management using descriptors from a compact global tree database.

The main objectives of this study were to verify, test and analyze the procedures involved in transformations that lead to the popular NBSS plot, and to check for the correctness of currently used units, while testing the hypothesis that NBSS indeed represents biomass, not abundance or biomass flux (dB/dM), while developing i.) a new conceptual framework, ii.) new terminology, iii.) a novel back-transformation method, iv.) a simple, new calculation method, that yields the best (i.e., least biased) representation of the original biomass vs body mass distribution shape, numerical values, dimensions, and units. Extensive tests with in-situ and synthetic (simulated) data were used to verify the procedures involved in transformations that lead to the popular NBSS plots, and to compare the original biomass distribution data with the binned outputs. Original biomass units and dimensions are retained in the novel backtransformed normalized biomass spectrum (bNBS), proposed and described herein. The proposed bNBS constitutes a new, improved approach of robust size spectra science, that allows for quantitative inter-comparisons of biomass spectra across regions and time periods."

The pairing imbalance significantly enlarges the parameter region supporting a topological superconducting phase. Remarkably, we show that a topologically nontrivial phase hosting Majorana zero modes can be induced by varying the pairing imbalance, even in the regime of strong chemical potential. The gap-closing points and phase boundaries are determined analytically, and the resulting phase diagrams are characterized by a nonzero topological invariant. Furthermore, we identify the existence of Majorana zero modes and finite-energy Majorana edge modes in this system.

Sensitive, wide-field radio and X-ray surveys now allow identification of larger samples of active stars across the Galaxy. We aim to identify and characterise radio and X-ray-emitting stars in the Galactic plane by combining MeerKAT radio data with soft X-ray observations and assess their consistency with the canonical Güdel-Benz relation, which links thermal coronal X-rays to non-thermal gyrosynchrotron radio emission. We cross-matched compact sources from the SARAO MeerKAT Galactic Plane Survey with counterparts from the ROSAT All-Sky Survey and the first release of SRG/eROSITA (eRASS1). We computed radio-brightness temperatures and radio-X-ray luminosities to test the relation. We identify 137 stars with both radio and X-ray detections. Their $T_B$ ranges from $10^7$ to $10^{12}$ K, except two outliers: AXJ1600.9-5142 ($4.8 \\pm 1.5 \\times 10^{12}$ K) and HD~124831 ($8 \\pm 1 \\times 10^{6}$ K). The remainder are consistent with incoherent gyrosynchrotron emission. The sample lies below the canonical Güdel-Benz relation, driven by enhanced 1.3 GHz radio luminosities relative to the 5 GHz relation. This suggests the classical relation represents an upper envelope rather than a tight correlation. Additionally, eROSITA detections show early-type stars lie below the typical $\\log (L_{\\rm X}/L_{\\rm bol}) \\sim -3$ relation."

    "abstract": "Text-to-image diffusion models have revolutionized generative AI, enabling high-quality and photorealistic image synthesis. However, their practical deployment remains hindered by several limitations: sensitivity to prompt phrasing, ambiguity in semantic interpretation (e.g., ``mouse\" as animal vs. a computer peripheral), artifacts such as distorted anatomy, and the need for carefully engineered input prompts. Existing methods often require additional training and offer limited controllability, restricting their adaptability in real-world applications. We introduce Self-Improving Diffusion Agent (SIDiffAgent), a training-free agentic framework that leverages the Qwen family of models (Qwen-VL, Qwen-Image, Qwen-Edit, Qwen-Embedding) to address these challenges. SIDiffAgent autonomously manages prompt engineering, detects and corrects poor generations, and performs fine-grained artifact removal, yielding more reliable and consistent outputs. It further incorporates iterative self-improvement by storing a memory of previous experiences in a database. This database of past experiences is then used to inject prompt-based guidance at each stage of the agentic pipeline. \\modelour achieved an average VQA score of 0.884 on GenAIBench, significantly outperforming open-source, proprietary models and agentic methods. We will publicly release our code upon acceptance."

In this work, we conduct entropy-based pilot experiments and observe a strong positive correlation between entropy reduction and high-quality tool calls. Building on this finding, we propose using entropy reduction as a supervisory signal and design two reward strategies to address the differing needs of optimizing tool-use behavior. Sparse outcome rewards provide coarse, trajectory-level guidance to improve efficiency, while dense process rewards offer fine-grained supervision to enhance performance. Experiments across diverse domains show that both reward designs improve tool-use behavior: the former reduces tool calls by 72.07% compared to the average of baselines, while the latter improves performance by 22.27%. These results position entropy reduction as a key mechanism for enhancing tool-use behavior, enabling agents to be more adaptive in real-world applications."

    "abstract": "Automatically formulating optimization models from natural language descriptions is a growing focus in operations research, yet current LLM-based approaches struggle with the composite constraints and appropriate modeling paradigms required by complex operational rules. To address this, we introduce the Canonical Intermediate Representation (CIR): a schema that LLMs explicitly generate between problem descriptions and optimization models. CIR encodes the semantics of operational rules through constraint archetypes and candidate modeling paradigms, thereby decoupling rule logic from its mathematical instantiation. Upon a newly generated CIR knowledge base, we develop the rule-to-constraint (R2C) framework, a multi-agent pipeline that parses problem texts, synthesizes CIR implementations by retrieving domain knowledge, and instantiates optimization models. To systematically evaluate rule-to-constraint reasoning, we test R2C on our newly constructed benchmark featuring rich operational rules, and benchmarks from prior work. Extensive experiments show that R2C achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on the proposed benchmark (47.2% Accuracy Rate). On established benchmarks from the literature, R2C delivers highly competitive results, approaching the performance of proprietary models (e.g., GPT-5). Moreover, with a reflection mechanism, R2C achieves further gains and sets new best-reported results on some benchmarks."

    "abstract": "Enabling artificial intelligence systems, particularly large language models, to integrate new knowledge and flexibly apply it during reasoning remains a central challenge. Existing knowledge editing approaches emphasize atomic facts, improving factual recall but often failing to integrate new information into a coherent framework usable across contexts. In this work, we argue that knowledge internalization is fundamentally a reasoning problem rather than a memorization problem. Consequently, a model should be trained in situations where the new information is instrumental to solving a task, combined with pre-existing knowledge, and exercised through multi-step reasoning. Based on this insight, we propose a training strategy based on three principles. First, new knowledge is introduced as a coherent background story that contextualizes novel facts and explains their relation to existing knowledge. Second, models are trained using self-generated multi-hop questions that require multi-step reasoning involving the new information. Third, training is done using knowledge distillation, forcing a student model to internalize the teacher's reasoning behavior without access to the novel information. Experiments show that models trained with this strategy effectively leverage newly acquired knowledge during reasoning and achieve remarkable performance on challenging questions that require combining multiple new facts."

This diversity might induce properties of serendipidity and novelty which might increase user engagement or revenue. However, many real-life problems arise in that case: e.g., avoiding to recommend distinct but too similar items to reduce the churn risk, and computational cost for large item libraries, up to millions of items. First, we consider the case when the user feedback model is perfectly observed and known in advance, and introduce an efficient algorithm called B-DivRec combining determinantal point processes and a fuzzy denuding procedure to adjust the degree of item diversity. This helps enforcing a quality-diversity trade-off throughout the user history. Second, we propose an approach to adaptively tailor the quality-diversity trade-off to the user, so that diversity in recommendations can be enhanced if it leads to positive feedback, and vice-versa. Finally, we illustrate the performance and versatility of B-DivRec in the two settings on synthetic and real-life data sets on movie recommendation and drug repurposing."

    "abstract": "Protoplanetary disks in massive star-forming regions may be exposed to ultraviolet radiation fields orders of magnitude stronger than the interstellar background. This intense radiation drives photoevaporative winds that fundamentally shape disk evolution and chemistry. However, full radiation hydrodynamic simulations of these systems remain computationally expensive, preventing systematic exploration of the parameter space. We present a parametric framework for efficiently generating density structures of externally irradiated protoplanetary disks with photoevaporative winds. Our approach implements a spherically diverging wind configuration with smooth transitions between the disk interior, the FUV-heated surface layer, and the wind itself. We validate this framework extensively against the FRIED grid of hydrodynamical simulations, demonstrating accurate reproduction of density structures across stellar masses from 0.3 to 3.0 M_sun, disk radii from 20 to 150 au, and external FUV fields from 100 to 100,000 G0. The complete framework is available as 'PUFFIN', a Python package that generates full 1D or 2D density structures in seconds to minutes, compared to weeks or months for equivalent hydrodynamical calculations. We demonstrate the scientific utility of this approach by modelling CO chemistry across a comprehensive parameter grid, using our density structures as inputs to thermochemical calculations. Our results show that external FUV irradiation significantly enhances CO gas-phase abundances through indirect heating mechanisms, which raise midplane temperatures and enhance thermal desorption of CO ice. This effect is strongest in the outer disk and scales with both external field strength and disk mass, with important implications for volatile budgets available to forming planets in clustered environments."

As consequences, we show that every regular inclusion decomposes into finite direct sums and tensor products of basic building blocks, and that regular inclusions are necessarily of depth two. We further investigate the existence of unitary orthonormal bases in the sense of Pimsner-Popa and prove that, under a natural spectral condition, regularity is equivalent to the existence of a unitary orthonormal basis contained in the normalizer. These results provide a unified description of regularity, unitary bases, and depth through the normalizer matrix formalism."

    "abstract": "Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) achieve strong performance on single-image tasks, but their performance declines when multiple images are provided as input. One major reason is the cross-image information leakage, where the model struggles to distinguish information across different images. Existing LVLMs already employ delimiter tokens to mark the start and end of each image, yet our analysis reveals that these tokens fail to effectively block cross-image information leakage. To enhance their effectiveness, we propose a method that scales the hidden states of delimiter tokens. This enhances the model's ability to preserve image-specific information by reinforcing intra-image interaction and limiting undesired cross-image interactions. Consequently, the model is better able to distinguish between images and reason over them more accurately. Experiments show performance gains on multi-image benchmarks such as Mantis, MuirBench, MIRB, and QBench2. We further evaluate our method on text-only tasks that require clear distinction. The method improves performance on multi-document and multi-table understanding benchmarks, including TQABench, MultiNews, and WCEP-10. Notably, our method requires no additional training or inference cost."

    "abstract": "Open-vocabulary object detection in remote sensing commonly relies on text-only prompting to specify target categories, implicitly assuming that inference-time category queries can be reliably grounded through pretraining-induced text-visual alignment. In practice, this assumption often breaks down in remote sensing scenarios due to task- and application-specific category semantics, resulting in unstable category specification under open-vocabulary settings. To address this limitation, we propose RS-MPOD, a multimodal open-vocabulary detection framework that reformulates category specification beyond text-only prompting by incorporating instance-grounded visual prompts, textual prompts, and their multimodal integration. RS-MPOD introduces a visual prompt encoder to extract appearance-based category cues from exemplar instances, enabling text-free category specification, and a multimodal fusion module to integrate visual and textual information when both modalities are available. Extensive experiments on standard, cross-dataset, and fine-grained remote sensing benchmarks show that visual prompting yields more reliable category specification under semantic ambiguity and distribution shifts, while multimodal prompting provides a flexible alternative that remains competitive when textual semantics are well aligned."

Their key finding is that $\\partialγ_M(G)$ can be achieved by a partial dual with respect to the edge set of a spanning quasi-tree. Moreover, they proposed the following problem: Given a ribbon graph $G$, is there a sequence of edges $e_1,e_2,\\dots, e_k$ such that $γ(G^{\\{e_1, e_2,\\dots, e_k\\}})=\\partialγ_M(G)$ and such that the sequence $$γ(G), γ(G^{\\{e_1\\}}), \\dots, γ(G^ {\\{e_1, e_2,\\dots, e_k\\}})$$ rises monotonically (i.e., never decreasing) to $\\partialγ_M(G)$? Delta-matroids are set systems that satisfy the symmetric exchange axiom and serve as a matroidal abstraction of ribbon graphs. In this paper, we first show that the maximum twist width of a set system can be attained by twisting one of its feasible sets, which extends the result of Chen, Gross and Tucker to set systems. Then we solve the delta-matroid version of their problem, thereby providing an affirmative answer to the original problem for ribbon graphs."

Unlike data in vision and language domains, time series data is inherently tied to the evolution of underlying processes and can only accumulate as real-world time progresses, limiting the effectiveness of scale-driven pretraining alone. This time-bound constraint poses a challenge for enabling large language models (LLMs) to acquire forecasting capability, as existing approaches primarily rely on representation-level alignment or inference-time temporal modules rather than explicitly teaching forecasting behavior to the LLM. We propose T-LLM, a temporal distillation framework that equips general-purpose LLMs with time series forecasting capability by transferring predictive behavior from a lightweight temporal teacher during training. The teacher combines trend modeling and frequency-domain analysis to provide structured temporal supervision, and is removed entirely at inference, leaving the LLM as the sole forecasting model. Experiments on benchmark datasets and infectious disease forecasting tasks demonstrate that T-LLM consistently outperforms existing LLM-based forecasting methods under full-shot, few-shot, and zero-shot settings, while enabling a simple and efficient deployment pipeline."

Motivated by string-inspired effective field theories, we study the perturbative stability of the Cho-Maison monopole when the hypercharge kinetic term is regularised by a Born-Infeld extension, which renders the monopole energy finite. Focusing on the bosonic electroweak theory with an unmodified $SU(2)_L$ sector and a Born-Infeld U(1)_Y sector, we analyze linear fluctuations about the regularised monopole background. Using a complex tetrad and a spin-weighted harmonic decomposition, we reduce the fluctuation equations to coupled radial Schroedinger-type eigenvalue problems and examine the spectrum of the resulting operators. We extend the separation-of-variables framework developed by Gervalle and Volkov to this non-linear gauge-field setting. We show that, after appropriate gauge fixing and constraint elimination, the Born-Infeld deformation preserves the angular channel structure of the Maxwell theory and leads to a self-adjoint Sturm-Liouville type problem for the stability of the radial modes, with modified radial coefficients determined by the background Born-Infeld profile. The resulting operator represents a smooth deformation of the Maxwell case and retains positive kinetic weight. Our results provide plausible evidence for the stability of the Born-Infeld deformed monopole and, most importantly, a systematic framework for future numerical or variational studies aimed at a definitive spectral analysis."

Across scenarios, including game-playing and robotics, spanning both discrete and continuous domains, agents trained with our proposed prioritization method achieve 11-52% higher average success rates and improve sample efficiency by 19-45% compared to previous approaches. https://esharony.me/projects/vlm-rb/"

    "abstract": "Galaxy clusters are powerful probes of the growth of cosmic structure through measurements of their abundance as a function of mass and redshift. Extracting precise cosmological constraints from cluster surveys is challenging, as we must contend the complex relationship between richness and the underlying halo mass, selection function biases, super-sample covariance, and correlated measurement noise between mass proxies. As upcoming photometric surveys are expected to detect tens to hundreds of thousands of galaxy clusters, controlling these systematics becomes essential. In this paper, we present a forward-modelling approach using Simulation-Based Inference (SBI), which provides a natural framework for jointly modelling cluster abundance and lensing mass observables while capturing systematic uncertainties at higher fidelity than analytic likelihood methods - which rely on simplifying assumptions such as fixed covariances and Gaussianity - without requiring an explicit likelihood formulation. We introduce $\\texttt{Capish}$, a Python code for generating forward-modelled galaxy cluster catalogues using halo mass functions and incorporating observational effects. We perform SBI using neural density estimation with normalizing flows, trained on abundance and mean lensing mass measurements in observed redshift-richness bins. Our forward model accounts for realistic noise, redshift uncertainties, selection functions, and correlated scatter between lensing mass and observed richness. We find good agreement with likelihood-based analyses, with broader SBI posteriors reflecting the increased realism of the forward model. We also test $\\texttt{Capish}$ on cluster catalogues built from a large cosmological simulation, finding a good fit to cosmological parameters."

    "abstract": "Lip-to-speech synthesis aims to generate speech audio directly from silent facial video by reconstructing linguistic content from lip movements, providing valuable applications in situations where audio signals are unavailable or degraded. While recent diffusion-based models such as LipVoicer have demonstrated impressive performance in reconstructing linguistic content, they often lack prosodic consistency. In this work, we propose LipSody, a lip-to-speech framework enhanced for prosody consistency. LipSody introduces a prosody-guiding strategy that leverages three complementary cues: speaker identity extracted from facial images, linguistic content derived from lip movements, and emotional context inferred from face video. Experimental results demonstrate that LipSody substantially improves prosody-related metrics, including global and local pitch deviations, energy consistency, and speaker similarity, compared to prior approaches."

    "abstract": "Hyperspectral image classification (HSIC) is a challenging task due to high spectral dimensionality, complex spectral-spatial correlations, and limited labeled training samples. Although transformer-based models have shown strong potential for HSIC, existing approaches often struggle to achieve sufficient spectral discriminability while maintaining computational efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose a novel DSXFormer, a novel dual-pooling spectral squeeze-expansion transformer with Dynamic Context Attention for HSIC. The proposed DSXFormer introduces a Dual-Pooling Spectral Squeeze-Expansion (DSX) block, which exploits complementary global average and max pooling to adaptively recalibrate spectral feature channels, thereby enhancing spectral discriminability and inter-band dependency modeling. In addition, DSXFormer incorporates a Dynamic Context Attention (DCA) mechanism within a window-based transformer architecture to dynamically capture local spectral-spatial relationships while significantly reducing computational overhead. The joint integration of spectral dual-pooling squeeze-expansion and DCA enables DSXFormer to achieve an effective balance between spectral emphasis and spatial contextual representation. Furthermore, patch extraction, embedding, and patch merging strategies are employed to facilitate efficient multi-scale feature learning. Extensive experiments conducted on four widely used hyperspectral benchmark datasets, including Salinas (SA), Indian Pines (IP), Pavia University (PU), and Kennedy Space Center (KSC), demonstrate that DSXFormer consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving classification accuracies of 99.95%, 98.91%, 99.85%, and 98.52%, respectively."

    "abstract": "There have recently been many efforts to create machine learnt atmospheric emulators designed to replace physical models. So far these have mainly focused on medium-range weather forecasting, where these `Machine Learnt Weather Prediction' (MLWP) models can outperform leading operational forecasting centres. However, because of this focus on shorter timescales, many of these emulators ignore the effects of the ocean, and take no ocean variables as inputs. We hypothesise that such MLWP models have learnt a best-guess of the evolution of the atmosphere, by implicitly inferring ocean conditions from atmospheric states, with no access to ocean data. Turning this limitation into a strength, we use it as a means to study the role of the oceans on the evolution of the atmosphere. By exploring how model forecast errors relate to properties of the air-sea interface, we infer what ocean information these atmospheric emulators are able to derive from atmospheric data alone, and what they cannot. This highlights the regions and processes through which the ocean independently influences the atmosphere on fast timescales. We perform this analysis for GraphCast, finding clear relationships between air-sea properties and the forecast errors over the ocean, including clear seasonal effects. We then explore what this reveals about GraphCast's internal representation of the ocean. In addition to understanding real-world ocean-atmosphere interactions, this analysis provides guidance for improving forecast skill and physical realism in MLWP models, and for informing how future machine learning models should use ocean information on short timescales."

    "abstract": "Observationally, early H II regions are classified by size into ultracompact and hypercompact configurations. It remains unclear whether these phases are long-lived or transient. Understanding the physical processes that stall H II region growth may help to solve the so-called lifetime problem: the observation of more compact H II regions than expected from theory. Utilizing two-dimensional, axially symmetric radiation hydrodynamic simulations of young expanding H II regions, including the phase of early star and disk formation, we seek to better understand the trapping of H II regions. Trapping forces include gravity and ram pressure, which oppose forces such as thermal pressure expansion, radiation pressure, and centrifugal force. Without radiation pressure, the H II region remains gravitationally trapped in the ultracompact phase indefinitely. With radiation pressure, the H II region escapes gravitational trapping but experiences ram pressure trapping on larger scales. For initial mass reservoirs with high central density, no trapping occurs, while a less steep density gradient yields clear trapped phases. Hypercompact trapped phases exhibit a so-called flickering variation in H II region radius, in agreement with observations of stalling and even contraction over small time scales. With radiation pressure, low-density reservoirs experience both gravitational and ram pressure trapping, while high-mass reservoirs undergo only the latter."

While Gaussian process surrogates are the standard for such tasks, an underappreciated fact is that their posterior variance depends on the observed outputs only through the hyperparameters, rendering exploration largely insensitive to the actual measurements. We propose to inject observation-dependent feedback by warping the input space with a learned, monotone reparameterization. This mechanism allows the design policy to expand or compress regions of the input space in response to observed variability, thereby shaping the behavior of variance-based acquisition functions. We demonstrate that while such warps can be trained via marginal likelihood, a novel self-supervised objective yields substantially better performance. Our approach improves sample efficiency across a range of active learning benchmarks, particularly in regimes where non-stationarity challenges traditional methods."

We identify a root of this issue: the imbalanced data distribution in the pretraining corpus, which leads to a state of \"low-probability truth\" and \"high-probability falsehood\". Recent approaches, such as teaching models to say \"I don't know\" or post-hoc knowledge editing, either evade the problem or face catastrophic forgetting. To address this issue from its root, we propose \\textbf{PretrainRL}, a novel framework that integrates reinforcement learning into the pretraining phase to consolidate factual knowledge. The core principle of PretrainRL is \"\\textbf{debiasing then learning}.\" It actively reshapes the model's probability distribution by down-weighting high-probability falsehoods, thereby making \"room\" for low-probability truths to be learned effectively. To enable this, we design an efficient negative sampling strategy to discover these high-probability falsehoods and introduce novel metrics to evaluate the model's probabilistic state concerning factual knowledge. Extensive experiments on three public benchmarks demonstrate that PretrainRL significantly alleviates factual hallucinations and outperforms state-of-the-art methods."

A key challenge is that real-world degradations make correspondences between low-quality (LQ) inputs and reference (Ref) images unreliable, requiring adaptive control of reference usage. Existing methods either ignore LQ-Ref correlations or rely on brittle explicit matching, leading to over-reliance on misleading references or under-utilization of valuable cues. To address this, we propose Ada-RefSR, a single-step diffusion framework guided by a \"Trust but Verify\" principle: reference information is leveraged when reliable and suppressed otherwise. Its core component, Adaptive Implicit Correlation Gating (AICG), employs learnable summary tokens to distill dominant reference patterns and capture implicit correlations with LQ features. Integrated into the attention backbone, AICG provides lightweight, adaptive regulation of reference guidance, serving as a built-in safeguard against erroneous fusion. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that Ada-RefSR achieves a strong balance of fidelity, naturalness, and efficiency, while remaining robust under varying reference alignment."

Furthermore, a segmented multi-branch decoder is designed to separately handle early reflections and late reverberation, improving reconstruction across the entire RIR. Experiments on diverse simulated acoustic environments demonstrate that RIR-Former consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of normalized mean square error (NMSE) and cosine distance (CD), under varying missing rates and array configurations.

    "abstract": "Federated Unlearning (FU) aims to efficiently remove the influence of specific client data from a federated model while preserving utility for the remaining clients. However, three key challenges remain: (1) existing unlearning objectives often compromise model utility or increase vulnerability to Membership Inference Attacks (MIA); (2) there is a persistent conflict between forgetting and utility, where further unlearning inevitably harms retained performance; and (3) support for concurrent multi-client unlearning is poor, as gradient conflicts among clients degrade the quality of forgetting. To address these issues, we propose FUPareto, an efficient unlearning framework via Pareto-augmented optimization. We first introduce the Minimum Boundary Shift (MBS) Loss, which enforces unlearning by suppressing the target class logit below the highest non-target class logit; this can improve the unlearning efficiency and mitigate MIA risks. During the unlearning process, FUPareto performs Pareto improvement steps to preserve model utility and executes Pareto expansion to guarantee forgetting. Specifically, during Pareto expansion, the framework integrates a Null-Space Projected Multiple Gradient Descent Algorithm (MGDA) to decouple gradient conflicts. This enables effective, fair, and concurrent unlearning for multiple clients while minimizing utility degradation. Extensive experiments across diverse scenarios demonstrate that FUPareto consistently outperforms state-of-the-art FU methods in both unlearning efficacy and retained utility."

    "abstract": "Recently, data-centric AI methodology has been a dominant paradigm in single-cell transcriptomics analysis, which treats data representation rather than model complexity as the fundamental bottleneck. In the review of current studies, earlier sequence methods treat cells as independent entities and adapt prevalent ML models to analyze their directly inherited sequence data. Despite their simplicity and intuition, these methods overlook the latent intercellular relationships driven by the functional mechanisms of biological systems and the inherent quality issues of the raw sequence data. Therefore, a series of structured methods has emerged. Although they employ various heuristic rules to capture intricate intercellular relationships and enhance the raw sequencing data, these methods often neglect biological prior knowledge. This omission incurs substantial overhead and yields suboptimal graph representations, thereby hindering the utility of ML models. To address them, we propose DOGMA, a holistic data-centric framework designed for the structural reshaping and semantic enhancement of raw data through multi-level biological prior knowledge. Transcending reliance on stochastic heuristics, DOGMA redefines graph construction by integrating Statistical Anchors with Cell Ontology and Phylogenetic Trees to enable deterministic structure discovery and robust cross-species alignment. Furthermore, Gene Ontology is utilized to bridge the feature-level semantic gap by incorporating functional priors. In complex multi-species and multi-organ benchmarks, DOGMA achieves SOTA performance, exhibiting superior zero-shot robustness and sample efficiency while operating with significantly lower computational cost."

    "abstract": "Digital semantic communication systems, which often leverage the Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) framework, are pivotal for future wireless networks. In a VQ-VAE-based semantic communication system, the transmission rate is directly governed by the size of a discrete codebook known as knowledge base (KB). However, the KB size is a fixed hyperparameter, meaning that adapting the rate requires training and storing a separate model for each desired size -- a practice that is too computationally and storage-prohibitive to achieve truly granular rate control. To address this, we introduce a principled, zero-shot KB resizing method that enables on-the-fly rate adaptation without any retraining. Our approach establishes a global importance ranking for all vectors within a single, large parent KB by uncovering its inherent semantic hierarchy. This is achieved via a three-step framework: 1) embedding KB vectors into hyperbolic space to reveal their hierarchical relationships; 2) constructing a master semantic tree using a minimum spanning tree algorithm; 3) enabling instant resizing by iteratively pruning the least important leaf nodes. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our method achieves reconstruction quality nearly identical to that of dedicated KBs trained from scratch, while demanding only a fraction of the computational budget. Moreover, our approach exhibits superior robustness at very low rates, where conventional KBs suffer from catastrophic failure. Our work resolves a fundamental limitation of VQ-VAE-based semantic communication systems, offering a practical and efficient path toward flexible and rate-adaptive semantic communication."

In particular, for $1\\le k\\leω$ we prove first-order rigidity and atomicity of the standard model. For every $0\\le k\\leω$ we show that the corresponding theory does not have the finite cover property and weakly eliminates imaginaries. We also provide new proofs of stability-theoretic features previously obtained by Belegradek: the theories are stable but not superstable, normal (hence $1$-based), and have trivial forking; consequently, no infinite group is interpretable in any model. Finally, we analyze model completeness and show that $T_0$ is the model companion of the theory of locally free algebras, while the theories with $k\\ge 1$ are not model complete."

To address this gap, we introduce VIA-Bench, a challenging benchmark designed to probe model performance on visual illusions and anomalies. It includes six core categories: color illusions, motion illusions, gestalt illusions, geometric and spatial illusions, general visual illusions, and visual anomalies. Through careful human-in-the-loop review, we construct over 1K high-quality question-answer pairs that require nuanced visual reasoning. Extensive evaluation of over 20 state-of-the-art MLLMs, including proprietary, open-source, and reasoning-enhanced models, uncovers significant vulnerabilities. Notably, we find that Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning offers negligible robustness, often yielding ``brittle mirages'' where the model's logic collapses under illusory stimuli. Our findings reveal a fundamental divergence between machine and human perception, suggesting that resolving such perceptual bottlenecks is critical for the advancement of artificial general intelligence.

However, high-fidelity, single-shot imaging through a single TF remains underexplored due to intermodal coupling from the tapering geometry, which distorts output speckle patterns and poses challenges for image reconstruction using existing deep learning methods. Here, we propose a physics-inspired TF-UNet architecture that augments skip connections with hierarchical grouped-MLP fusion to effectively capture non-local, cross-scale dependencies caused by intermodal coupling in TFs. We experimentally validate our method on both FFs and TFs, demonstrating that TF-UNet outperforms standard U-Net variants in structural and perceptual fidelity while maintaining competitive PSNR at quadratic complexity.

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the quantization of the Schwarzschild--de Sitter (SdS) black hole (BH) using the Misner--Sharp--Hernandez (MSH) mass as the internal energy in a reduced phase space framework. After introducing the canonical variables of the reduced phase space, we derive a discrete spectrum for the surface areas of the BH event horizon (EH) as well as MSH masses. We utilized the MSH mass spectrum to obtain the entropy of the BH. The entropy of the BH and cosmic EHs reveals a logarithmic correction to the Bekenstein--Hawking term. Our results support the robustness of the logarithmic form of quantum corrections in SdS thermodynamics."

    "abstract": "Transmission line (TL) models implemented in the time domain can efficiently simulate basilar-membrane (BM) displacement in response to transient or non-stationary sounds. By design, a TL model is well-suited for an one-dimensional (1-D) characterization of the traveling wave, but the real configuration of the cochlea also introduces higher-dimensional effects. Such effects include the focusing of the pressure around the BM and transverse viscous damping, both of which are magnified in the short-wave region. The two effects depend on the wavelength and are more readily expressed in the frequency domain. In this paper, we introduce a numerical correction for the BM admittance to account for 2-D effects in the time domain using autoregressive filtering and regression techniques. The correction was required for the implementation of a TL model tailored to the gerbil cochlear physiology. The model, which includes instantaneous nonlinearities in the form of variable damping, initially presented insufficient compression with increasing sound levels. This limitation was explained by the strong coupling between gain and frequency selectivity assumed in the 1-D nonlinear TL model, whereas cochlear frequency selectivity shows only a moderate dependence on sound level in small mammals. The correction factor was implemented in the gerbil model and made level-dependent using a feedback loop. The updated model achieved some decoupling between frequency selectivity and gain, providing 5 dB of additional gain and extending the range of sound levels of the compressive regime by 10 dB. We discuss the relevance of this work through two key features: the integration of both analytical and regression methods for characterizing BM admittance, and the combination of instantaneous and non-instantaneous nonlinearities."

It is known that one can decide whether the bandwidth of $G$ is at most $k$ in $O(n^k)$ time and $O(n^k)$ space using dynamic programming techniques. For small $k$ close to $0$, this approach is effectively polynomial, but as $k$ scales with $n$, it becomes superexponential, requiring up to $O(n^{n - 1})$ time (where $n - 1$ is the maximum possible bandwidth). In this paper, we reformulate the problem in terms of bipartite matching for sufficiently large $k \\ge \\lfloor (n - 1)/2 \\rfloor$, allowing us to use Hall's marriage theorem to develop an algorithm that runs in $O(n^{n - k + 1})$ time and $O(n)$ auxiliary space (beyond storage of the input graph). This yields polynomial complexity for large $k$ close to $n - 1$, demonstrating that the bandwidth recognition problem is solvable in polynomial time whenever either $k$ or $n - k$ remains small."

However, in real-world settings, the extreme scarcity of labeled data severely limits the development and practical adoption of robust AES systems. This study proposes a novel approach to enhance AES performance in both limited-data and full-data settings by introducing three key techniques. First, we introduce a Two-Stage fine-tuning strategy that leverages low-rank adaptations to better adapt an AES model to target prompt essays. Second, we introduce a Score Alignment technique to improve consistency between predicted and true score distributions. Third, we employ uncertainty-aware self-training using unlabeled data, effectively expanding the training set with pseudo-labeled samples while mitigating label noise propagation. We implement above three key techniques on DualBERT. We conduct extensive experiments on the ASAP++ dataset. As a result, in the 32-data setting, all three key techniques improve performance, and their integration achieves 91.2% of the full-data performance trained on approximately 1,000 labeled samples. In addition, the proposed Score Alignment technique consistently improves performance in both limited-data and full-data settings: e.g., it achieves state-of-the-art results in the full-data setting when integrated into DualBERT."

    "abstract": "While linear attention reduces the quadratic complexity of standard Transformers to linear time, it often lags behind in expressivity due to the removal of softmax normalization. This omission eliminates \\emph{global competition}, a critical mechanism that enables models to sharply focus on relevant information amidst long-context noise. In this work, we propose \\textbf{Softmax Linear Attention (SLA)}, a framework designed to restore this competitive selection without sacrificing efficiency. By lifting the softmax operation from the token level to the head level, SLA leverages attention heads as coarse semantic slots, applying a competitive gating mechanism to dynamically select the most relevant subspaces. This reintroduces the ``winner-take-all'' dynamics essential for precise retrieval and robust long-context understanding. Distinct from prior methods that focus on refining local kernel functions, SLA adopts a broader perspective by exploiting the higher-level multi-head aggregation structure. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SLA consistently enhances state-of-the-art linear baselines (RetNet, GLA, GDN) across language modeling and long-context benchmarks, particularly in challenging retrieval scenarios where it significantly boosts robustness against noise, validating its capability to restore precise focus while maintaining linear complexity."

Here, a machine-learning-potential driven workflow combining non-equilibrium thermodynamic integration (NETI) and two-phase coexistence simulations is employed to enable large-scale, long-timescale molecular dynamics sampling. Within this workflow, the melting curve of forsterite is evaluated and a complete P-T phase diagram is constructed. Relative to conventional ab initio approaches, this strategy reduces computational expense while retaining thermodynamic consistency in phase-stability assessment. The workflow is applicable to efficient evaluation of phase stability and thermodynamic properties in deep-Earth silicate systems."

To address its practical limitations, we propose two key improvements: 1) a pre-voting alignment procedure to correct temporal and frequential biases among estimators, and 2) a greedy algorithm to select a compact yet effective subset of estimators based on error correlation. Experiments on a diverse dataset of speech, singing, and music show that our proposed method with alignment outperforms individual state-of-the-art estimators in clean conditions and maintains robust voiced/unvoiced detection in noisy environments."

    "abstract": "With the widespread deployment of Computer-using Agents (CUAs) in complex real-world environments, prevalent long-term risks often lead to severe and irreversible consequences. Most existing guardrails for CUAs adopt a reactive approach, constraining agent behavior only within the current observation space. While these guardrails can prevent immediate short-term risks (e.g., clicking on a phishing link), they cannot proactively avoid long-term risks: seemingly reasonable actions can lead to high-risk consequences that emerge with a delay (e.g., cleaning logs leads to future audits being untraceable), which reactive guardrails cannot identify within the current observation space. To address these limitations, we propose a predictive guardrail approach, with the core idea of aligning predicted future risks with current decisions. Based on this approach, we present SafePred, a predictive guardrail framework for CUAs that establishes a risk-to-decision loop to ensure safe agent behavior. SafePred supports two key abilities: (1) Short- and long-term risk prediction: by using safety policies as the basis for risk prediction, SafePred leverages the prediction capability of the world model to generate semantic representations of both short-term and long-term risks, thereby identifying and pruning actions that lead to high-risk states; (2) Decision optimization: translating predicted risks into actionable safe decision guidances through step-level interventions and task-level re-planning. Extensive experiments show that SafePred significantly reduces high-risk behaviors, achieving over 97.6% safety performance and improving task utility by up to 21.4% compared with reactive baselines."

We train small-to-medium models over 10,000 hyperparameter configurations and evaluate more than 40 measures computable from the trained model and the available training data alone. We significantly broaden the experimental scope along multiple axes: (i) extending the evaluation beyond the standard IID setting to include benchmarking for robustness across diverse distribution shifts, (ii) evaluating multiple architectures and training recipes, and (iii) newly incorporating calibration- and information-criteria-based measures to assess their alignment with both IID and OOD generalization. We find that distribution shifts can substantially alter the predictive performance of many generalization measures, while a smaller subset remains comparatively stable across settings."

Longer sequences increase computational load and memory use. We propose BBPE16, a UTF-16-based BBPE tokenizer that represents most modern scripts with a uniform 2-byte code unit. BBPE16 preserves BBPE's language-agnostic properties while substantially improving cross-lingual token sharing. Across monolingual, bilingual, and trilingual ASR, and in a multilingual continual-learning setup, BBPE16 attains comparable or better accuracy; for Chinese, it reduces token counts by up to 10.4% and lowers decoding iterations by up to 10.3%. These reductions speed up fine-tuning and inference and decrease memory usage, making BBPE16 a practical tokenization choice for multilingual ASR."

We constructed the dataset by manually digitizing a large repository of academic materials created by medical professionals in the Arabic-speaking region. We then conducted extensive preprocessing and split the dataset into training and test sets to support future research efforts in the area. To assess the quality of the data, we adopted two frameworks, namely expert human evaluation and LLM-as-a-judge. Our dataset is diverse and of high quality, spanning 19 specialties and five difficulty levels. For benchmarking purposes, we assessed the performance of eight state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary models, such as GPT-5, Gemini 2.0 Flash, and Claude 4-Sonnet. Our findings highlight the need for further domain-specific enhancements.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly embedded in enterprise workflows, yet their performance remains highly sensitive to prompt design. Automatic Prompt Optimization (APO) seeks to mitigate this instability, but existing approaches face two persistent challenges. First, commonly used prompt strategies rely on static instructions that perform well on average but fail to adapt to heterogeneous queries. Second, more dynamic approaches depend on offline reward models that are fundamentally correlational, confounding prompt effectiveness with query characteristics. We propose Causal Prompt Optimization (CPO), a framework that reframes prompt design as a problem of causal estimation. CPO operates in two stages. First, it learns an offline causal reward model by applying Double Machine Learning (DML) to semantic embeddings of prompts and queries, isolating the causal effect of prompt variations from confounding query attributes. Second, it utilizes this unbiased reward signal to guide a resource-efficient search for query-specific prompts without relying on costly online evaluation. We evaluate CPO across benchmarks in mathematical reasoning, visualization, and data analytics. CPO consistently outperforms human-engineered prompts and state-of-the-art automated optimizers. The gains are driven primarily by improved robustness on hard queries, where existing methods tend to deteriorate. Beyond performance, CPO fundamentally reshapes the economics of prompt optimization: by shifting evaluation from real-time model execution to an offline causal model, it enables high-precision, per-query customization at a fraction of the inference cost required by online methods. Together, these results establish causal inference as a scalable foundation for reliable and cost-efficient prompt optimization in enterprise LLM deployments."

By modeling exploration via guided diffusion, multi-step denoising distributes stochasticity and preserves multiple coexisting solution modes without mutual suppression. Furthermore, by decoupling latent-space exploration from text-space generation, we show that latent diffusion-based optimization is more effective than text-space policy optimization alone, while a complementary text policy provides additional gains when combined with latent exploration. Experiments on code generation and mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements in both pass@1 and pass@k over discrete RL baselines, with absolute pass@1 gains of +9.4% on code generation and +5.7% on mathematical reasoning, highlighting diffusion-based latent RL as a principled alternative to discrete token-level RL for reasoning."

Despite the absence of explicit topics, model outputs cover a broad semantic space, and surprisingly, each model family exhibits strong and systematic topical preferences. GPT-OSS predominantly generates programming (27.1%) and mathematical content (24.6%), whereas Llama most frequently generates literary content (9.1%). DeepSeek often generates religious content, while Qwen frequently generates multiple-choice questions. Beyond topical preferences, we also observe differences in content specialization and depth: GPT-OSS often generates more technically advanced content (e.g., dynamic programming) compared with other models (e.g., basic Python). Furthermore, we find that the near-unconstrained generation often degenerates into repetitive phrases, revealing interesting behaviors unique to each model family. For instance, degenerate outputs from Llama include multiple URLs pointing to personal Facebook and Instagram accounts.

We propose Wasserstein Policy Regularization (WPR), a semantic-aware regularization for the RLHF framework based on the entropy-regularized Wasserstein distance, which incorporates the geometry of the token space. The dual formulation of the distance expresses the regularization as penalty terms applied to the reward via optimal dual variables, which yield a tractable objective compatible with standard RL algorithms. Empirically, our method outperforms KL- and $f$-divergence-based baselines, demonstrating the benefits of semantic-aware policy distances for alignment.

    "abstract": "The Sterile Processing and Distribution (SPD) department is responsible for cleaning, disinfecting, inspecting, and assembling surgical instruments between surgeries. Manual inspection and preparation of instrument trays is a time-consuming, error-prone task, often prone to contamination and instrument breakage. In this work, we present a fully automated robotic system that sorts and structurally packs surgical instruments into sterile trays, focusing on automation of the SPD assembly stage. A custom dataset comprising 31 surgical instruments and 6,975 annotated images was collected to train a hybrid perception pipeline using YOLO12 for detection and a cascaded ResNet-based model for fine-grained classification. The system integrates a calibrated vision module, a 6-DOF Staubli TX2-60L robotic arm with a custom dual electromagnetic gripper, and a rule-based packing algorithm that reduces instrument collisions during transport. The packing framework uses 3D printed dividers and holders to physically isolate instruments, reducing collision and friction during transport. Experimental evaluations show high perception accuracy and statistically significant reduction in tool-to-tool collisions compared to human-assembled trays. This work serves as the scalable first step toward automating SPD workflows, improving safety, and consistency of surgical preparation while reducing SPD processing times."

    "abstract": "Achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) requires an understanding of the complex interlinkages that exist among their underlying indicators. While most existing research examines these interconnections at the goal level, policy interventions are typically designed and implemented at the indicator level, where synergies and trade-offs most directly emerge. This study addresses this gap by proposing a network-theoretic framework to assess indicator-level interactions in a systematic and data-driven manner. We introduce two complementary measures, the positive strength and negative strength of an indicator, which jointly capture the balance between synergistic and conflicting interactions within a national SDG indicator network. Based on these measures, indicators are classified as synergy- and trade-off-dominated according to their net systemic interaction structure. To move beyond classification, we further examine the structural drivers of synergy dominance using an explanatory regression framework, focusing on the roles of direct positive interactions and indirect network embeddedness. This analysis shows that indicators classified as synergy-dominated are typically characterized by a high concentration of direct synergies and additional support from indirect pathways through the network, allowing positive effects to extend beyond immediate neighbors. The framework is applied to two national case studies, India and Italy, to illustrate how the classification of indicators varies across development contexts. Overall, the proposed methodology provides a transparent and scalable tool for identifying the structural conditions under which indicator-level synergies emerge, thereby supporting a more nuanced understanding of how development actions can generate reinforcing effects across the SDG system."

We reexamine this mechanism with more modern technology, accounting for actual core collapse dynamics, and show that this mechanism is likely less powerful than originally envisioned."

These enigmatic objects have been mainly studied at radio frequencies, and their physical properties in the high-energy domain are poorly understood. Here we present the results of a multiwavelength study focused on NuSTAR J112829+5831.8 (J1128+5831), the only known GRS serendipitously detected with the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array. Being located in proximity to the famous interacting galaxy system, Arp 299, J1128+5831 has been serendipitously observed also by the Chandra X-ray Observatory, Hubble Space Telescope, and XMM-Newton satellites. From radio observations with the Low Frequency Array, the NRAO VLA Sky Survey and the Very Large Array Sky Survey, we have determined that J1128+5831 has an overall steep radio spectrum ($α=-0.86$; $F_ν\\proptoν^α$) and a low core dominance ($C_{\\rm D}=-2.4$, in log-scale), indicating the source to be viewed at large angles. From the X-ray spectral analysis, we found J1128+5831 to harbor an obscured active galactic nucleus (AGN) with neutral hydrogen column density exceeding $10^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$. Its optical spectrum, taken with the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument, exhibits prominent narrow emission lines but lacks broad components, thus confirming J1128+5831 to be a Type 2 AGN powered by a radiatively efficient accreting system. Overall, the broadband properties of J1128+5831 are consistent with those observed for the general GRS population."

    "abstract": "Spherical codes, with a rich history spanning nearly five centuries, remain an area of active mathematical exploration and are far from being fully understood. These codes, which arise naturally in problems of geometry, combinatorics, and information theory, continue to challenge researchers with their intricate structure and unresolved questions. Inspired by Polya's heuristic principle of \"vary the problem,\" we extend the classical framework by introducing the notion of noncommutative spherical codes, with particular emphasis on the noncommutative Newton-Gregory kissing number problem. This generalization moves beyond the traditional Euclidean setting into the realm of operator algebras and Hilbert C*-modules, thereby opening new avenues of investigation. A cornerstone in the study of spherical codes is the celebrated Delsarte-Goethals-Seidel-Kabatianskii-Levenshtein linear programming bound, developed over the past half-century. This bound employs Gegenbauer polynomials to establish sharp upper limits on the size of spherical codes, and it has served as a fundamental tool in coding theory and discrete geometry. Remarkably, a recent elegant one-line proof by Pfender [\\textit{J. Combin. Theory Ser. A, 2007}] provides a streamlined derivation of a variant of this bound. We demonstrate that Pfender's argument can be extended naturally to the setting of Hilbert C*-modules, thereby enriching the theory with noncommutative analogues."

However, the theoretical understanding of such strategy remains limited. In this work, we show that the empirical standard deviation is, with high probability, closely proportional to the norm of the (stochastic) gradient. Based on this insight, we analyze adaptive ZO methods under the generalized $(L_0,L_1)$-smoothness condition with respect to the matrix norm. We establish explicit convergence rates and query complexity bounds for both deterministic and stochastic settings, demonstrating that adaptive ZO methods achieve the faster convergence and the improved query efficiency compared to the vanilla ZO methods with fixed-step."

Reward-based post-training has emerged as a promising direction to improve the quality and semantic alignment of generated videos. However, recent methods either rely on large-scale human preference annotations or operate on misaligned embeddings from pre-trained vision-language models, leading to limited scalability or suboptimal supervision. We present $\\texttt{PISCES}$, an annotation-free post-training algorithm that addresses these limitations via a novel Dual Optimal Transport (OT)-aligned Rewards module. To align reward signals with human judgment, $\\texttt{PISCES}$ uses OT to bridge text and video embeddings at both distributional and discrete token levels, enabling reward supervision to fulfill two objectives: (i) a Distributional OT-aligned Quality Reward that captures overall visual quality and temporal coherence; and (ii) a Discrete Token-level OT-aligned Semantic Reward that enforces semantic, spatio-temporal correspondence between text and video tokens. To our knowledge, $\\texttt{PISCES}$ is the first to improve annotation-free reward supervision in generative post-training through the lens of OT. Experiments on both short- and long-video generation show that $\\texttt{PISCES}$ outperforms both annotation-based and annotation-free methods on VBench across Quality and Semantic scores, with human preference studies further validating its effectiveness. We show that the Dual OT-aligned Rewards module is compatible with multiple optimization paradigms, including direct backpropagation and reinforcement learning fine-tuning."

To bridge this gap, we introduce ToPi, a training-free token pruning framework tailored for in-context generation in DiTs. Specifically, ToPi utilizes offline calibration-driven sensitivity analysis to identify pivotal attention layers, serving as a robust proxy for redundancy estimation. Leveraging these layers, we derive a novel influence metric to quantify the contribution of each context token for selective pruning, coupled with a temporal update strategy that adapts to the evolving diffusion trajectory. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that ToPi can achieve over 30\\% speedup in inference while maintaining structural fidelity and visual consistency across complex image generation tasks."

We introduce a set of tools for mechanistic interpretability of TSFMs, including ablations of specific components and direct logit attribution on the residual stream. Our findings are consistent across several leading TSFMs with diverse architectures, and across a diverse set of real-world and synthetic time-series datasets. We discover that all models in our study are robust to ablations of entire layers. Furthermore, we develop a theoretical framework framing transformers as kernel regressors, motivating a purely intrinsic strategy for ablating heads based on the stable rank of the per-head projection matrices. Using this approach, we uncover the specific heads responsible for degenerate phenomena widely observed in TSFMs, such as parroting of motifs from the context and seasonality bias. Our study sheds light on the universal properties of this emerging class of architectures for continuous-time sequence modeling."

In this work, we propose inference-aware meta-alignment (IAMA), a novel approach that enables LLMs to be aligned to multiple criteria with limited computational budget at inference time. IAMA trains a base model such that it can be effectively aligned to multiple tasks via different inference-time alignment algorithms. To solve the non-linear optimization problems involved in IAMA, we propose non-linear GRPO, which provably converges to the optimal solution in the space of probability measures."

To address these challenges, we investigate structured pruning for FECCT and propose Spectral-Aligned Pruning (SAP), a structure-aware framework that enables cross-code reuse of structured pruning masks across codes by leveraging the spectrum of the corresponding bipartite graph. After pruning, SAP performs per-code recovery via parameter-efficient low-rank adaptation (LoRA), enabling a shared pruned backbone while storing only small code-specific adapter parameters. Experiments across diverse codes show that SAP achieves decoding performance comparable to dedicated per-code pruning, while enabling substantial reductions in computational cost and model memory footprint through kernel-level structured pruning."

We propose a gated multi-head Transformer architecture based on Swin U-Net, augmented with inter-slice context integration and a parallel detection head, which jointly performs slice-level structure detection via a multi-layer perceptron and pixel-level segmentation through a context-enhanced stream. Detection outputs gate the segmentation predictions to suppress false positives in anatomically invalid slices, and training uses slice-wise Tversky loss to address class imbalance. Experiments on the Prostate-Anatomical-Edge-Cases dataset from The Cancer Imaging Archive demonstrate that the gated model substantially outperforms a non-gated segmentation-only baseline, achieving a mean Dice loss of $0.013 \\pm 0.036$ versus $0.732 \\pm 0.314$, with detection probabilities strongly correlated with anatomical presence, effectively eliminating spurious segmentations. In contrast, the non-gated model exhibited higher variability and persistent false positives across all slices. These results indicate that detection-based gating enhances robustness and anatomical plausibility in automated segmentation applications, reducing hallucinated predictions without compromising segmentation quality in valid slices, and offers a promising approach for improving the reliability of clinical radiotherapy auto-contouring workflows."

In this work, we evaluate a key indicator from this list, called HOT-3, which tests for agency guided by a general belief-formation and action selection system that updates beliefs based on meta-cognitive monitoring. We view beliefs as representations in the model's latent space that emerge in response to a given input, and introduce a metric to quantify their dominance during generation. Analyzing the dynamics between competing beliefs across models and tasks reveals three key findings: (1) external manipulations systematically modulate internal belief formation, (2) belief formation causally drives the model's action selection, and (3) models can monitor and report their own belief states. Together, these results provide empirical support for the existence of belief-guided agency and meta-cognitive monitoring in LLMs. More broadly, our work lays methodological groundwork for investigating the emergence of agency, beliefs, and meta-cognition in LLMs."

TIC-VLA defines a delayed semantic-control interface that conditions action generation on delayed vision-language semantic states and explicit latency metadata, in addition to current observations, enabling policies to compensate for asynchronous reasoning.

We introduce MetaCLASS, a learning-science grounded framework that formulates metacognitive tutoring as move selection over 11 interpretable actions aligned to self-regulated learning processes. MetaCLASS uses a two-phase framework that first plans a pedagogical trajectory conditioned on learner profiles (calibration, help-seeking) and then generates natural dialogue consistent with that plan. This yields a dataset of 1,015 conversations (7,711 turns) annotated with turn-level metacognitive labels, and validated for pedagogical contingency and trajectory adherence. We benchmark nine LLMs on predicting the next coach move given the problem and dialogue context. The best model achieves only 43.2\\% accuracy, and models exhibit compulsive intervention bias: in turns where effective metacognitive tutoring requires silent (41.7\\% of cases), models predict `no intervention' only 4.2\\% of the time, while severely over-predicting high-intervention moves.

The two alternatives, supervised finetuning (SFT) from expert demonstrations and reinforcement learning (RL) in a software-based simulator, are limited by the amount of expert data available and the sim-to-real gap for manipulation. With the recent emergence of world models learned from real-world video-action data, we ask the question of whether training a policy in a world model can be more effective than supervised learning or software simulation in achieving better real-robot performance. We propose World-Gymnast, which performs RL finetuning of a vision-language-action (VLA) policy by rolling out the policy in an action-conditioned video world model and rewarding the rollouts with a vision-language model (VLM). On the Bridge robot setup, World-Gymnast outperforms SFT by as much as 18x and outperforms software simulator by as much as 2x. More importantly, World-Gymnast demonstrates intriguing capabilities of RL with a world model, including training on diverse language instructions and novel scenes from the world model, test-time training in a novel scene, and online iterative world model and policy improvement. Our results suggest learning a world model and training robot policies in the cloud could be the key to bridging the gap between robots that work in demonstrations and robots that can work in anyone's household."

    "abstract": "In statistical physics, the multivariate hard-core model describes a system of particles, each of which receives its own fugacity. In graph-theoretic language, the partition function of the model translates to the multivariate independence polynomial, i.e., the multiaffine generalisation of the independence polynomial, defined by $Z_G(λ_1,\\dots,λ_n) := \\sum_{I\\in\\mathcal{I}(G)} \\prod_{v\\in I}λ_v$, where $\\mathcal{I}(G)$ denotes the set of all independent sets in a graph $G$ on $[n]:=\\{1,2,\\dots,n\\}$. We prove that for every simple graph $G$ on $[n]$ and $λ_1,\\dots,λ_n\\geq 0$, \\[ Z_G(λ_1,\\dots,λ_n) \\geq \\prod_{i=1}^n (1+(d_i+1)λ_i)^{1/(d_i+1)}, \\] where $d_1,\\dots,d_n$ is the degree sequence of $G$. This generalises a result of Sah, Sawhney, Stoner, and Zhao, who proved the univariate case $λ_1=\\dots=λ_n=λ$. We further conjecture that our inequality should generalise to other antiferromagnetic models and give some evidence in support of it. In particular, for $λ_i,μ_i\\geq 0$, $1\\leq i\\leq n$, we obtain a stronger inequality \\[ \\sum_{\\substack{I,J\\in \\mathcal{I}(G) \\\\ I\\cap J=\\emptyset}} \\prod_{v\\in I}λ_v\\prod_{u\\in J}μ_u \\geq \\prod_{i=1}^n \\left(1+(d_i+1)(λ_i+μ_i)+d_i(d_i+1)λ_iμ_i\\right)^{1/(d_i+1)}, \\] which proves our conjecture for a multiaffine generalisation of the semiproper colouring partition function with two proper colours. Our key technical steps for both theorems are obtained by using a custom mathematical research agent built on top of Gemini Deep Think, which can be seen as a benchmark demonstrating that the current state-of-the-art language models can, in part, assist with mathematical research."

We compare LLM performance in zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuned settings against conventional NLP baselines that do not employ LLMs. In addition, we assess translation quality across language families and typologies to understand its influence on LLM performance. Proprietary LLMs and fine-tuned open-source LLMs achieve competitive F1 scores on several datasets, often surpassing state-of-the-art results. However, performance on MT data is generally lower, and the extent of this decline varies by language and typology. This variation highlights both the strengths of LLMs in handling mental health tasks in languages other than English and their limitations when translation quality introduces structural or lexical mismatches."

To address this, we propose UniReason, a unified framework that harmonizes these two tasks through a dual reasoning paradigm. We formulate generation as world knowledge-enhanced planning to inject implicit constraints, and leverage editing capabilities for fine-grained visual refinement to further correct visual errors via self-reflection. This approach unifies generation and editing within a shared representation, mirroring the human cognitive process of planning followed by refinement. We support this framework by systematically constructing a large-scale reasoning-centric dataset (~300k samples) covering five major knowledge domains (e.g., cultural commonsense, physics, etc.) for planning, alongside an agent-generated corpus for visual self-correction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniReason achieves advanced performance on reasoning-intensive benchmarks such as WISE, KrisBench and UniREditBench, while maintaining superior general synthesis capabilities."

Motivated by recent advancements in 3D foundation models, which can register images despite large viewpoint differences, we propose a robust loop closing approach that leverages these models to establish inter-robot measurements. In contrast to resource-intensive methods requiring full 3D reconstruction within a centralized map, our approach integrates foundation models into existing SLAM pipelines, yielding scalable and robust multi-robot mapping. Our contributions include: (1) integrating 3D foundation models to reliably estimate relative poses from monocular image pairs within decentralized C-SLAM; (2) introducing robust outlier mitigation techniques critical to the use of these relative poses; and (3) developing specialized pose graph optimization formulations that efficiently resolve scale ambiguities. We evaluate our method against state-of-the-art approaches, demonstrating improvements in localization and mapping accuracy, alongside significant gains in computational and memory efficiency. These results highlight the potential of our approach for deployment in large-scale multi-robot scenarios."

In this work, we explore whether language models can explicitly localize errors in incorrect reasoning, as a path toward building AI systems that can effectively correct themselves. We introduce a prompting method that structures reasoning as discrete, semantically coherent thought steps, and show that models are able to reliably localize errors within this structure, while failing to do so in conventional, unstructured chain-of-thought reasoning. Motivated by how the human brain monitors errors at discrete decision points and resamples alternatives, we introduce Iterative Correction Sampling of Thoughts (Thought-ICS), a self-correction framework. Thought-ICS iteratively prompts the model to generate reasoning one discrete and complete thought at a time--where each thought represents a deliberate decision by the model--creating natural boundaries for precise error localization. Upon verification, the model localizes the first erroneous step, and the system backtracks to generate alternative reasoning from the last correct point. When asked to correct reasoning verified as incorrect by an oracle, Thought-ICS achieves 20-40% self-correction lift. In a completely autonomous setting without external verification, it outperforms contemporary self-correction baselines."

However, this task is highly dependent on the effort and intuition of the teacher. In this work, we present a novel approach for detecting misconceptions from student-tutor dialogues using large language models (LLMs). First, we use a fine-tuned LLM to generate plausible misconceptions, and then retrieve the most promising candidates among these using embedding similarity with the input dialogue. These candidates are then assessed and re-ranked by another fine-tuned LLM to improve misconception relevance. Empirically, we evaluate our system on real dialogues from an educational tutoring platform. We consider multiple base LLM models including LLaMA, Qwen and Claude on zero-shot and fine-tuned settings. We find that our approach improves predictive performance over baseline models and that fine-tuning improves both generated misconception quality and can outperform larger closed-source models. Finally, we conduct ablation studies to both validate the importance of our generation and reranking steps on misconception generation quality."

One possible mitigation strategy is to incorporate information about the non-idealities at the map-making level, which helps to reduce the HWP-induced distortions of the reconstructed CMB. Nevertheless, the non-idealities can only be known with finite precision. In this paper we investigate the consequences of discrepancies between their true frequency profiles and those assumed by the map-maker. We present an end-to-end framework, including a blind component-separation step, and use it to translate these discrepancies into a bias on the tensor-to-scalar ratio, $r$, for the LiteBIRD satellite mission. We subsequently derive realistic and conservative measurement requirements for accurately characterizing the HWP non-idealities to ensure they do not compromise LiteBIRD's ambitious scientific goals. We find that the obtained results are robust against sky models with varying complexity."

    "abstract": "Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is critical for the safe deployment of deep neural networks. State-of-the-art post-hoc methods typically derive OOD scores from the output logits or penultimate feature vector obtained via global average pooling (GAP). We contend that this exclusive reliance on the logit or feature vector discards a rich, complementary signal: the raw channel-wise statistics of the pre-pooling feature map lost in GAP. In this paper, we introduce Catalyst, a post-hoc framework that exploits these under-explored signals. Catalyst computes an input-dependent scaling factor ($γ$) on-the-fly from these raw statistics (e.g., mean, standard deviation, and maximum activation). This $γ$ is then fused with the existing baseline score, multiplicatively modulating it -- an ``elastic scaling'' -- to push the ID and OOD distributions further apart. We demonstrate Catalyst is a generalizable framework: it seamlessly integrates with logit-based methods (e.g., Energy, ReAct, SCALE) and also provides a significant boost to distance-based detectors like KNN. As a result, Catalyst achieves substantial and consistent performance gains, reducing the average False Positive Rate by 32.87 on CIFAR-10 (ResNet-18), 27.94% on CIFAR-100 (ResNet-18), and 22.25% on ImageNet (ResNet-50).

    "abstract": "This paper develops a theory of scientific and technological peer effects to study how individuals' productivity responds to the behavior and network positions of their collaborators across both scientific and inventive activities. Building on a simultaneous equation network framework, the model predicts that productivity in each activity increases in a variation of the Katz-Bonacich centrality that captures within-activity and cross-activity strategic complementarities. To test these predictions, we assemble the universe of cancer-related publications and patents and construct coauthorship and coinventorship networks that jointly map the collaboration structure of researchers active in both spheres. Using an instrumental-variables approach based on predicted link formation from exogenous dyadic characteristics, and incorporating community fixed effects to address endogenous network formation, we show that both authors' and inventors' outputs rise with their network centrality, consistent with the theory. Moreover, scientific productivity significantly enhances technological productivity, while technological output does not exert a detectable reciprocal effect on scientific production, highlighting an asymmetric linkage aligned with a science-driven model of innovation. These findings provide the first empirical evidence on the joint dynamics of scientific and inventive peer effects, underscore the micro-foundations of the co-evolution of science and technology, and reveal how collaboration structures can be leveraged to design policies that enhance collective knowledge creation and downstream innovation."

Then we establish two asymptotic results that generalize known univariate cases to different regimes: a large deviation principle with speed $n$, implying almost sure convergence, and a multivariate Gaussian limit. Additionally, we introduce a novel moderate deviation result as a bridge between these regimes. Central to our proofs is a quasi-power property for the moment generating function of the statistics, allowing us to employ the Gärtner-Ellis Theorem for both large and moderate deviations."

Using 10 years of publicly available IceCube data, we performed a systematic population analysis of X-ray-bright and gamma-ray-bright AGN to evaluate the extent to which this diffuse flux could originate from these sources. We find that gamma-ray-bright blazars can account for no more than 16\\% of IceCube's total diffuse flux. Although we find no evidence of neutrino emission from gamma-ray-bright, non-blazar AGN, we cannot exclude the possibility that these sources contribute significantly to the diffuse flux. In contrast, we report (pre-trials) evidence of neutrino emission from several nearby, X-ray-bright, Seyfert-type AGN, including \\mbox{NGC 1068} ($4.9σ$), SWIFT J1041.4-1740 ($2.6σ$), SWIFT J0202.4+6824A/B ($2.6σ$), SWIFT J0744.0+2914 (2.6$σ$), NGC 4151 ($2.5σ$), and NGC 3079 ($2.5σ$). Although not fully conclusive, these results suggest that IceCube may be detecting neutrinos from a larger population of Seyfert galaxies. The fact that these sources are not gamma-ray bright indicates that their neutrino production must be taking place in optically thick environments, such as in the coronae surrounding these galaxies' supermassive black holes. We also identify a $4.2σ$ correlation between the neutrinos detected by IceCube and members of the Swift-BAT catalog of X-ray-bright AGN, although this correlation is dominated by NGC 1068. We estimate that this class of sources contributes between 11.2\\% and the entirety of IceCube's total diffuse neutrino flux. These results strengthen the emerging case for the prevalence of gamma-ray-obscured AGN as significant sources of high-energy neutrinos."

This work presents a fully integrated power management unit for ME WPT in millimetric implants. The PMU achieves load independent maximum power extraction and usage by continuously matching the impedance of the transducer, dynamically optimizing the power stage across varying input divided by load conditions, and reusing the storage energy to sustain the system when input power drops. Its parallel-input regulation and storing stages architecture prevent the cascading power loss. With the skewed-duty-cycle MPPT technique and regulation efficiency optimizer, the PMU achieves a peak MPPT efficiency of 98.5 percent and a peak system overall efficiency of 73.33 percent. Additionally, the PMU includes an adaptive high-voltage charging stage that charges the stimulation capacitor up to 12 V with an improved efficiency of 37.88 percent."

First, we show that RNCRNs can inherit some bifurcations defined by smooth ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Second, we demonstrate that the RNCRN can be trained to infer bifurcations that allow it to approximate different target behaviours within different regions of parameter space, without explicitly providing the bifurcation itself in the training. These behaviours can be specified using target ODEs that are discontinuous with respect to the parameters, or even simply by specifying certain desired dynamical features in certain regions of the parameter space. To achieve the latter, we introduce an ODE-free algorithm for training the RNCRN to display designer oscillations, such as a heart-shaped limit cycle or two coexisting limit cycles."

Although quantum noise is often viewed as a major challenge in quantum computing, it also offers a unique opportunity to enhance privacy. In particular, intrinsic quantum noise provides a natural stochastic resource that, when rigorously analyzed within the differential privacy (DP) framework and composed with classical mechanisms, can satisfy formal $(\\varepsilon, δ)$-DP guarantees. This enables a reduction in the required classical perturbation without compromising the privacy budget, potentially improving model utility. However, the integration of classical and quantum noise for privacy preservation remains unexplored. In this work, we propose a hybrid noise-added mechanism, HYPER-Q, that combines classical and quantum noise to protect the privacy of QML models. We provide a comprehensive analysis of its privacy guarantees and establish theoretical bounds on its utility. Empirically, we demonstrate that HYPER-Q outperforms existing classical noise-based mechanisms in terms of adversarial robustness across multiple real-world datasets."

In these environments, uplink bandwidth and latency impose strict communication limits, thereby making aggressive gradient compression essential. One-bit methods such as sign-based stochastic gradient descent (SignSGD) offer an attractive solution in flat federated settings, but existing theory and algorithms do not naturally extend to hierarchical settings. In particular, the interaction between majority-vote aggregation at the edge layer and model aggregation at the cloud layer, and its impact on end-to-end performance, remains unknown. To bridge this gap, we propose a highly communication-efficient sign-based HFL framework and develop its corresponding formulation for nonconvex learning, where devices send only signed stochastic gradients, edge servers combine them through majority-vote, and the cloud periodically averages the obtained edge models, while utilizing downlink quantization to broadcast the global model. We introduce the resulting scalable HFL algorithm, HierSignSGD, and provide the convergence analysis for SignSGD in a hierarchical setting. Our core technical contribution is a characterization of how biased sign compression, two-level aggregation intervals, and inter-cluster heterogeneity collectively affect convergence. Numerical experiments under homogeneous and heterogeneous data splits show that HierSignSGD, despite employing extreme compression, achieves accuracy comparable to or better than full-precision stochastic gradient descent while reducing communication cost in the process, and remains robust under aggressive downlink sparsification."

In parallel, modern artificial intelligence methods have demonstrated a remarkable ability to extract low-dimensional structure from high-dimensional data through representation learning. This review examines the interplay between these two perspectives, focusing on the extent to which symmetry-induced constraints can be identified, encoded, or diagnosed using machine learning techniques. Rather than emphasizing architectures that enforce known symmetries by construction, we concentrate on data-driven approaches and latent representation learning, with particular attention to variational autoencoders. We discuss how symmetries and conservation laws reduce the intrinsic dimensionality of physical datasets, and how this reduction may manifest itself through self-organization of latent spaces in generative models trained to balance reconstruction and compression. We review recent results, including case studies from simple geometric systems and particle physics processes, and analyze the theoretical and practical limitations of inferring symmetry structure without explicit inductive bias."

    "abstract": "The strange metal remains one of the great unsolved problems for 21st century science. Since the early development of the marginal Fermi liquid phenomenology, it has been clear that progress requires detailed knowledge of the momentum- and frequency-dependent charge susceptibility, $χ(\\mathbf{q},ω)$, particularly at large momenta. Electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS), performed in either reflection or transmission geometry, provides the most direct probe of $χ(\\mathbf{q},ω)$. However, measurements over the past four decades have yielded conflicting results, with some studies reporting a dispersing RPA-like plasmon and others observing a strongly overdamped, incoherent response. Here we report a transmission EELS study of Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$ (Bi-2212) that simultaneously achieves high energy resolution ($ΔE \\approx 30$ meV) and high momentum resolution ($Δq \\approx 0.01$ Å$^{-1}$). To address issues of reproducibility, measurements were repeated ten times on five different Bi-2212 flakes, benchmarked against aluminum, a well-characterized Fermi liquid, and quantitatively compared with prior studies spanning four decades. At momenta $q < 0.15$ Å$^{-1}$, we observe a highly damped plasmon whose linewidth is comparable to its energy. At larger momenta, $q > 0.15$ Å$^{-1}$, this excitation does not disperse but instead evolves into an incoherent continuum, with no evidence for the RPA-like dispersion reported in some earlier works. Comparison with recent RIXS measurements on Bi-based cuprates supports the view that Bi-2212 is an incoherent metal with strongly damped charge excitations."

Fairness-Sensitive PageRank aims to balance algorithmic influence across structurally and demographically diverse groups while preserving the link-based relevance of classical PageRank. However, existing formulations require solving constrained matrix inversions that scale poorly with network size. In this work, we develop an efficient mean-field approximation for Fairness-Sensitive PageRank (FSPR) that enforces group-level fairness through an estimated teleportation (jump) vector, thereby avoiding the costly matrix inversion and iterative optimization. We derive a closed-form approximation of FSPR using the in-degree and group label of nodes, along with the global group proportion. We further analyze intra-class fluctuations by deriving expressions for the variance of approximated FSPR scores. Empirical results on real-world networks demonstrate that the proposed approximation efficiently estimates the FSPR while reducing runtime by an order of magnitude, enabling fairness-constrained ranking at scale."

The continuum emission is well detected in both NIRSpec and MIRI spectra, yet no nebular recombination or metal emission lines are observed (EW(Hbeta+[OIII])<300A and EW(Halpha)<400A, at 3sigma). Combined with the exceptionally blue UV continuum slope, beta_UV ~ -2.9, and weak/flat Balmer break, these constraints indicate a stellar population dominated by very young and massive stars with a strongly suppressed nebular contribution. Comparisons with synthetic stellar population models indicate that U37126 requires both a very high ionizing photon production efficiency, log(Xi_ion / Hz erg^-1) ~ 25.75, and a nearly unit LyC escape fraction, of fesc>86% (3sigma) based on Halpha flux limit and fesc=0.94+/-0.06 derived independently from SED fitting. The best-fit SED yields a (de-lensed) stellar mass of Mstar ~ 10^7.8 Msun and a star-formation rate of SFR~10Msun/yr (sSFR~160 Gyr^-1), that along with its very compact size, reff~61pc, yields very high stellar mass and star-formation-rate surface densities, Sigma_M ~ 3x10^3 Msun/pc^2 and Sigma_SFR ~ 400 Msun/yr/kpc^2. Together with the lack of detectable nebular emission, these properties suggest that U37126 is undergoing an ``ISM-naked'' starburst phase, possibly driven by an extremely efficient gas-to-star conversion followed by strong feedback that has cleared the remaining gas from its stellar core, allowing most LyC photons to escape. Finally, we show that even a small fraction of galaxies like U37126 (~ 3%-6%), with extreme LyC production and escape, could contribute disproportionately (~ 50%-100%) to the ionizing photon budget during cosmic reionization."

Our approach is based on a sectional transfer operator acting on families of probability measures along the fibres. The operator allows to describe invariant measures of the skew-product in terms of sample measures over the base dynamics, regardless of invertibility or non-invertibility of the base map. Under general assumptions, we establish existence and uniqueness of invariant sample measures and prove their differentiability, with respect to system parameters, in suitable topologies. As an application we obtain linear response for Bernoulli convolutions, which are of prime importance in the study of number theoretic problems and fractals. Another application of our results yields linear response for physical measures of solenoidal attractors with intermittency, an example of a hyperbolic system which cannot be handled by traditional transfer operator techniques."

    "abstract": "GP-GOMEA is among the state-of-the-art for symbolic regression, especially when it comes to finding small and potentially interpretable solutions. A key mechanism employed in any GOMEA variant is the exploitation of linkage, the dependencies between variables, to ensure efficient evolution. In GP-GOMEA, mutual information between node positions in GP trees has so far been used to learn linkage. For this, a fixed expression template is used. This however leads to introns for expressions smaller than the full template. As introns have no impact on fitness, their occurrences are not directly linked to selection. Consequently, introns can adversely affect the extent to which mutual information captures dependencies between tree nodes. To overcome this, we propose two new measures for linkage learning, one that explicitly considers introns in mutual information estimates, and one that revisits linkage learning in GP-GOMEA from a grey-box perspective, yielding a measure that needs not to be learned from the population but is derived directly from the template. Across five standard symbolic regression problems, GP-GOMEA achieves substantial improvements using both measures. We also find that the newly learned linkage structure closely reflects the template linkage structure, and that explicitly using the template structure yields the best performance overall."

    "abstract": "Transition states (TSs) are central to understanding and quantitatively predicting chemical reactivity and reaction mechanisms. Although traditional TS generation methods are computationally expensive, recent generative modeling approaches have enabled chemically meaningful TS prediction for relatively small molecules. However, these methods fail to generalize to practically relevant reaction substrates because of distribution shifts induced by increasing molecular sizes. Furthermore, TS geometries for larger molecules are not available at scale, making it infeasible to train generative models from scratch on such molecules. To address these challenges, we introduce FragmentFlow: a divide-and-conquer approach that trains a generative model to predict TS geometries for the reactive core atoms, which define the reaction mechanism. The full TS structure is then reconstructed by re-attaching substituent fragments to the predicted core. By operating on reactive cores, whose size and composition remain relatively invariant across molecular contexts, FragmentFlow mitigates distribution shifts in generative modeling. Evaluated on a new curated dataset of reactions involving reactants with up to 33 heavy atoms, FragmentFlow correctly identifies 90% of TSs while requiring 30% fewer saddle-point optimization steps than classical initialization schemes. These results point toward scalable TS generation for high-throughput reactivity studies."

Builds may fail intermittently due to non-deterministic factors, leading to flaky builds that undermine developers' trust in CI, waste computational resources, and threaten the validity of CI-related empirical studies. In this paper, we present a large-scale empirical study of flaky builds in GitHub Actions based on rerun data from 1,960 open-source Java projects. Our results show that 3.2% of builds are rerun, and 67.73% of these rerun builds exhibit flaky behavior, affecting 1,055 (51.28%) of the projects. Through an in-depth failure analysis, we identify 15 distinct categories of flaky failures, among which flaky tests, network issues, and dependency resolution issues are the most prevalent. Building on these findings, we propose a machine learning-based approach for detecting flaky failures at the job level. Compared with a state-of-the-art baseline, our approach improves the F1-score by up to 20.3%."

These magnetic field data are available to the community through various observational instruments, prepared via different methodologies and/or flux-transport models. The solar wind solution driven by these maps provides the ambient plasma environment into which CMEs travel, coupling, and interacting with the surrounding plasma and governing the CME evolution and propagation in the solar corona and inner heliosphere. In this work, we use different input magnetic field maps for the same time period to drive the global Alfven Wave Solar atmosphere Model (AWSoM). We obtain the ambient solar wind conditions and compare the plasma properties and magnetic morphology in the coronal domain to study the influence of the input maps. To understand how the resulting coronal solutions impact CMEs, we launch eruptions described by analytical flux ropes into these data-driven solutions and compare their evolution in the coronal domain (up to 24 solar radii radially). The CMEs achieve varying speeds, deceleration rates, propagation directions, mass and energies while coupling with the background solar wind. We quantify these differences to show that the different input driving maps can significantly impact the simulated CME propagation in the solar wind plasma. This also highlights the importance of understanding the uncertainties associated with data-driven modeling that become increasingly important in operational models and space weather prediction."

Existing methods focus on final-answer correctness, providing limited insight into how reasoning unfolds across intermediate steps. We present EvalQReason, a framework that quantifies LLM reasoning quality through step-level probability distribution analysis without requiring human annotation. The framework introduces two complementary algorithms: Consecutive Step Divergence (CSD), which measures local coherence between adjacent reasoning steps, and Step-to-Final Convergence (SFC), which assesses global alignment with final answers. Each algorithm employs five statistical metrics to capture reasoning dynamics. Experiments across mathematical and medical datasets with open-source 7B-parameter models demonstrate that CSD-based features achieve strong predictive performance for correctness classification, with classical machine learning models reaching F1=0.78 and ROC-AUC=0.82, and sequential neural models substantially improving performance (F1=0.88, ROC-AUC=0.97). CSD consistently outperforms SFC, and sequential architectures outperform classical machine learning approaches. Critically, reasoning dynamics prove domain-specific: mathematical reasoning exhibits clear divergence-based discrimination patterns between correct and incorrect solutions, while medical reasoning shows minimal discriminative signals, revealing fundamental differences in how LLMs process different reasoning types. EvalQReason enables scalable, process-aware evaluation of reasoning reliability, establishing probability-based divergence analysis as a principled approach for trustworthy AI deployment."

Traditional NEM schemes provide temporally flat compensation at the retail price for net energy exports over a billing period. However, ongoing reforms in several U.S. states are introducing time-varying prices and asymmetric import/export compensation to better align incentives with grid costs. While prior studies treat PV capacity as exogenous and focus primarily on consumption behavior, this work endogenizes PV investment and derives the marginal value of solar capacity for a flexible prosumer under asymmetric NEM tariffs. We characterize optimal investment and show how optimal investment changes with prices and PV costs. Through this analysis, we identify a PV effect: changes in NEM pricing in one period can influence net demand and consumption in generating periods with unchanged prices through adjustments in optimal PV investment. The PV effect weakens the ability of higher import prices to increase prosumer payments, with direct implications for NEM reform. We validate our theoretical results in a case study using simulated household and tariff data derived from historical conditions in Massachusetts."

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in LLMs have led to significant breakthroughs in various AI applications. However, their sophisticated capabilities also introduce severe safety concerns, particularly the generation of harmful content through jailbreak attacks. Current safety testing for LLMs often relies on static datasets and lacks systematic criteria to evaluate the quality and adequacy of these tests. While coverage criteria have been effective for smaller neural networks, they are not directly applicable to LLMs due to scalability issues and differing objectives. To address these challenges, this paper introduces RACA, a novel set of coverage criteria specifically designed for LLM safety testing. RACA leverages representation engineering to focus on safety-critical concepts within LLMs, thereby reducing dimensionality and filtering out irrelevant information. The framework operates in three stages: first, it identifies safety-critical representations using a small, expert-curated calibration set of jailbreak prompts. Second, it calculates conceptual activation scores for a given test suite based on these representations. Finally, it computes coverage results using six sub-criteria that assess both individual and compositional safety concepts. We conduct comprehensive experiments to validate RACA's effectiveness, applicability, and generalization, where the results demonstrate that RACA successfully identifies high-quality jailbreak prompts and is superior to traditional neuron-level criteria. We also showcase its practical application in real-world scenarios, such as test set prioritization and attack prompt sampling. Furthermore, our findings confirm RACA's generalization to various scenarios and its robustness across various configurations. Overall, RACA provides a new framework for evaluating the safety of LLMs, contributing a valuable technique to the field of testing for AI."

    "abstract": "Deflections in the propagation of charged ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) caused by magnetic fields make the identification of their sources challenging. On the other hand, the arrival directions at Earth of neutrons point directly to their origin. The emission of UHECRs from a source is expected to be accompanied by the production of neutrons in its vicinity through interactions with ambient matter and radiation. Since free neutrons travel a mean distance $d/\\text{kpc}=9.2(E/\\text{EeV})$ before decaying, a neutron flux in the EeV range could be detected on Earth from sources of UHECRs in our Galaxy. Using cosmic-ray data from the Phase\\,I of the Surface Detector of the Pierre Auger Observatory, we search for neutron fluxes from Galactic candidate sources. We select more than 1000 objects of astrophysical interest, stacking them into target sets. The targets all have declinations within the exposure of the Observatory, ranging from $-90^\\circ$ up to $+45^\\circ$ for energies above 1 EeV (and up to $+20^\\circ$ for energies down to 0.1 EeV). Given that a neutron air shower is indistinguishable from a proton one, there is a significant background due to cosmic rays. A neutron flux from the direction of a candidate source would be identified by a celestial density of events that significantly exceeds the expected density of cosmic rays for that direction. No significant excess is found at any tested target direction, and an upper limit on the neutron flux is calculated for each candidate source."

Leveraging ros2 control, this framework provides native ROS2 interfaces for controlling any number of robots from a single process. Our core contributions address key challenges in real-time torque control, including interaction control and robot-environment modeling. A central focus of this work is sustaining a 1kHz control frequency, a necessity for real-time control and a minimum frequency required by safety standards. Moreover, we introduce a controllet-feature design pattern that enables controller-switching delays of $\\le 2$ ms, facilitating reproducible benchmarking and complex multi-robot interaction scenarios. To bridge the simulation-to-reality (sim2real) gap, we integrate a high-fidelity MuJoCo simulation with quantitative metrics for both kinematic accuracy and dynamic consistency (torques, forces, and control errors). Furthermore, we demonstrate that real-world inertial parameter identification can significantly improve force and torque accuracy, providing a methodology for iterative physics refinement. Our work extends approaches from soft robotics to rigid dual-arm, contact-rich tasks, showcasing a promising method to reduce the sim2real gap and providing a robust, reproducible platform for advanced robotics research."

    "abstract": "Graph Transformers typically rely on explicit positional or structural encodings and dense global attention to incorporate graph topology. In this work, we show that neither is essential. We introduce HopFormer, a graph Transformer that injects structure exclusively through head-specific n-hop masked sparse attention, without the use of positional encodings or architectural modifications. This design provides explicit and interpretable control over receptive fields while enabling genuinely sparse attention whose computational cost scales linearly with mask sparsity. Through extensive experiments on both node-level and graph-level benchmarks, we demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive or superior performance across diverse graph structures. Our results further reveal that dense global attention is often unnecessary: on graphs with strong small-world properties, localized attention yields more stable and consistently high performance, while on graphs with weaker small-world effects, global attention offers diminishing returns. Together, these findings challenge prevailing assumptions in graph Transformer design and highlight sparsity-controlled attention as a principled and efficient alternative."

This task has recently attracted significant attention, as the secure instantiation of many isogeny-based cryptographic protocols relies on the ability to sample such ``hard'' curves. Existing approaches, however, achieve this only in a trusted-setup setting. We present the first provable quantum polynomial-time algorithm that samples a random hard supersingular elliptic curve with high probability.Our algorithm runs heuristically in $\\tilde{O}\\!\\left(\\log^{4}p\\right)$ quantum gate complexity and in $\\tilde{O}\\!\\left(\\log^{13} p\\right)$ under the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis. As a consequence, our algorithm gives a secure instantiation of the CGL hash function and other cryptographic primitives. Our analysis relies on a new spectral delocalization result for supersingular $\\ell$-isogeny graphs: we prove the Quantum Unique Ergodicity conjecture, and we further provide numerical evidence for complete eigenvector delocalization; this theoretical result may be of independent interest. Along the way, we prove a stronger $\\varepsilon$-separation property for eigenvalues of isogeny graphs than that predicted in the quantum money protocol of Kane, Sharif, and Silverberg, thereby removing a key heuristic assumption in their construction."

    "abstract": "Spin defects in two-dimensional materials hold significant potential for quantum information technologies and sensing applications. The negatively charged boron vacancy (VB-) in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has attracted considerable attention as a quantum sensor due to its demonstrated sensitivity to temperature, magnetic fields, and pressure.1 However, its applications have thus far been limited by inherently dim photoluminescence (PL). By fabricating a van der Waals heterostructure with a sensitizing donor layer, lead iodide (PbI2), we effectively enhance the PL intensity from the VB- by 5-45x, while maintaining compatibility with other heterostructures and vdW optoelectronic platforms. The type-I band alignment at the heterojunction enables efficient exciton migration while suppressing back-electron transfer, and the strong spectral overlap between the PbI2 emission and defect absorption supports efficient fluorescence resonance energy transfer. Ab initio density functional theory (DFT) predicts a photon-ratcheting mechanism that boosts absorption and emission while maintaining magnetic resonance (ODMR) contrast through minimal hybridization. Experimentally, the heterostructure exhibits enhanced continuous-wave ODMR sensitivity and functions as a precise probe of external magnetic fields. This work establishes a proof-of-concept for amplifying weak defect signals in nanomaterials, highlighting a new strategy for engineering their optical and magnetic responses."

We first propose a square-root-Nyquist-filtered FMCW (SRN-FMCW) waveform to address limitations of conventional linear FMCW waveforms in ISAC systems. To better integrate with ODDM, we generate SRN-FMCW by embedding symbols in the DD domain, referred to as a DD-SRN-FMCW frame. A DD chirp compression receiver is designed to obtain the channel response efficiently. Next, we construct the proposed ODDM-FMCW waveform for ISAC by superimposing a DD-SRN-FMCW frame onto an ODDM data frame. A comprehensive performance analysis of the ODDM-FMCW waveform is presented, covering peak-to-average power ratio, spectrum, ambiguity function, and Cramer-Rao bound for delay and Doppler estimation. Numerical results show that the proposed ODDM-FMCW waveform delivers excellent ISAC performance in terms of root mean square error for sensing and bit error rate for communications."

    "abstract": "Firmware serves as the critical interface between hardware and software in computing systems, making any bugs or vulnerabilities particularly dangerous as they can cause catastrophic system failures. While fuzzing is a promising approach for identifying design flaws and security vulnerabilities, traditional fuzzers are ineffective at detecting firmware vulnerabilities. For example, existing fuzzers focus on user-level fuzzing, which is not suitable for detecting kernel-level vulnerabilities. Existing fuzzers also face a coverage plateau problem when dealing with complex interactions between firmware and hardware. In this paper, we present an efficient firmware verification framework, SysFuSS, that integrates system-level fuzzing with selective symbolic execution. Our approach leverages system-level emulation for initial fuzzing, and automatically transitions to symbolic execution when coverage reaches a plateau. This strategy enables us to generate targeted test cases that can trigger previously unexplored regions in firmware designs. We have evaluated SysFuSS on real-world embedded firmware, including OpenSSL, WolfBoot, WolfMQTT, HTSlib, MXML, and libIEC. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that SysFuSS significantly outperforms state-of-the-art fuzzers in terms of both branch coverage and detection of firmware vulnerabilities. Specifically, SysFuSS can detect 118 known vulnerabilities while state-of-the-art can cover only 13 of them. Moreover, SysFuSS takes significantly less time (up to 3.3X, 1.7X on average) to activate these vulnerabilities."

In response, existing interpretability approaches in the field keep focusing on explaining the internal model computations, without addressing whether they align or not with how a human would reason about the studied phenomenon. Instead, we state interpretability in deep time series models should pursue semantic alignment: predictions should be expressed in terms of variables that are meaningful to the end user, mediated by spatial and temporal mechanisms that admit user-dependent constraints. In this paper, we formalize this requirement and require that, once established, semantic alignment must be preserved under temporal evolution: a constraint with no analog in static settings. Provided with this definition, we outline a blueprint for semantically aligned deep time series models, identify properties that support trust, and discuss implications for model design."

However, this success has introduced a growing scalability challenge, as artifact evaluation relies heavily on reviewers' manual execution and debugging, leading to escalating human effort amid rapidly increasing paper submissions. To address this problem, we investigate automated artifact evaluation. We first conduct a preliminary study on artifacts from top-tier SE conferences and identify three key challenges: perceiving execution states, maintaining stable execution environments, and recovering from execution errors. Inspired by these findings, we propose ArtifactCopilot, the first end-to-end agent-based framework for automated artifact evaluation. ArtifactCopilot automates environment construction, instruction execution, and error recovery by combining an execution normalization strategy to ensure environment stability with an artifact evaluation graph that transforms README documents into dependency-aware command graphs, enabling structured execution planning, execution-state tracking, and error recovery. Evaluation on 48 real-world artifacts shows that ArtifactCopilot matches human artifact evaluation outcomes for 85.42% of the artifacts, outperforming Claude Code by 52.09 percentage points, while costing only \\$0.091 per artifact on average and requiring zero human intervention for 45 out of 48 artifacts."

    "abstract": "Central to interatomic potential efficiency is the radial envelope function that enables linear scaling with computational cost by defining a local neighborhood of atoms. This has enabled MLIPs to revolutionize materials science over the past decade by providing DFT accuracy with linear scaling computational cost in molecular dynamics workflows. However, MLIPs still have a relatively high computational cost compared to empirical interatomic potentials, preventing them from transforming molecular dynamics workflows. A central issue is that MLIPs use relatively large cutoff radii, converging to 6A over the last few years. The large cutoffs prioritize accuracy of any material over efficiency in any particular region of phase space, capturing dispersion effects and low density materials at the expense of increased computational cost in higher density materials. Past work has aimed to address this with KNN graph sparsification, which, while significantly reducing cost, has the drawback of breaking energy conservation. In this work, we propose higher-order envelope functions that prune local atomic neighborhoods through physically inspired geometric functions to provide the memory and efficiency benefits of KNN graph sparsification while eliminating non-conservative energy dynamics. Through numerical experiments on solids and liquids with 5-8A cutoffs, we show that triplet envelope functions complement radial envelope functions by doubling training and inference speed, tripling memory efficiency, and increasing simulation stability while not impacting accuracy or data efficiency for the most common 6A cutoff. Moreover, experiments with 8A radial cutoffs show triplet envelope functions create a pathway to larger cutoff radii for efficiently and accurately modeling open structures with large interatomic distances, showing a promising new direction for engineering MLIP efficiency."

With a graph attention autoencoder, we reconstruct a dynamics-informed, denoised chemical space and identify coherent stellar substructures by applying ensemble clustering. Our method successfully recovers the three largest globular clusters hidden in the dataset, estimates the in-situ fraction to be approximately 41\\%, and chemically characterizes several dynamical halo substructures. Strikingly, stars dynamically associated with Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE) separate into two chemically distinct clusters. By examining their abundances, energy ($E$) and angular momentum ($L_z$) distributions, together with the metallicity trend with $E$, we connect these clusters to their birthplace within the progenitor by proposing a simple infall scenario: one cluster traces the metal-poor, less evolved outskirts, while the other traces the metal-rich, chemically evolved core."

Specifically, our Intention Abstraction (IA) extracts verbose linguistic instructions and their associated reasoning into compact, explicit semantic primitives, while the Environment Semantics Abstraction (ESA) projects overwhelming visual streams into a structured, topological affordance representation. Furthermore, aligning these two abstract modalities induces an emergent attention-concentration effect, enabling a parameter-free token-pruning strategy that filters out perceptual redundancy without degrading performance. Extensive experiments in open-world Minecraft and large-scale PvP environments (Game for Peace and Valorant) demonstrate that MAIN-VLA sets a new state-of-the-art, which achieves superior decision quality, stronger generalization, and cutting-edge inference efficiency."

    "abstract": "Pulmonary trees extracted from CT images frequently exhibit topological incompleteness, such as missing or disconnected branches, which substantially degrades downstream anatomical analysis and limits the applicability of existing pulmonary tree modeling pipelines. Current approaches typically rely on dense volumetric processing or explicit graph reasoning, leading to limited efficiency and reduced robustness under realistic structural corruption. We propose TopoField, a topology-aware implicit modeling framework that treats topology repair as a first-class modeling problem and enables unified multi-task inference for pulmonary tree analysis. TopoField represents pulmonary anatomy using sparse surface and skeleton point clouds and learns a continuous implicit field that supports topology repair without relying on complete or explicit disconnection annotations, by training on synthetically introduced structural disruptions over \\textit{already} incomplete trees. Building upon the repaired implicit representation, anatomical labeling and lung segment reconstruction are jointly inferred through task-specific implicit functions within a single forward pass.Extensive experiments on the Lung3D+ dataset demonstrate that TopoField consistently improves topological completeness and achieves accurate anatomical labeling and lung segment reconstruction under challenging incomplete scenarios. Owing to its implicit formulation, TopoField attains high computational efficiency, completing all tasks in just over one second per case, highlighting its practicality for large-scale and time-sensitive clinical applications.

Using polarization-resolved electronic Raman scattering, we map the momentum selectivity of the spin-density-wave (SDW) gap in trilayer La4Ni3O10. We observe a SDW-induced redistribution of spectral weight on both the $α$ pocket at the Brillouin-zone centre and a portion of the $β$ pocket near the zone boundary, characterized by gap energies of approximately 55~meV. In contrast, no comparable spectral weight suppression is observed along the diagonal region of $β$ pockets, implying little or no gap opening. This gap topology contrasts sharply with that in La3Ni2O7, where anisotropic SDW gaps open solely on the $β$ pocket. Our results establish a distinct momentum-space gap topology between bilayer and trilayer nickelates, placing new constraints on the ordering wave vector and the mechanism of the density-wave instability relevant to superconductivity."

We present a camera-free 2D LiDAR object detection pipeline that encodes short-term temporal context by stacking three consecutive scans as RGB channels, yielding a compact YOLOv8n input without occupancy-grid construction while preserving angular structure and motion cues. Evaluated in Webots across 160 randomized indoor scenarios with strict scenario-level holdout, the method achieves 98.4% mAP@0.5 (0.778 mAP@0.5:0.95) with 94.9% precision and 94.7% recall on four object classes. On a Raspberry Pi 5, it runs in real time with a mean post-warm-up end-to-end latency of 47.8ms per frame, including scan encoding and postprocessing. Relative to a closely related occupancy-grid LiDAR-YOLO pipeline reported on the same platform, the proposed representation is associated with substantially lower reported end-to-end latency. Although results are simulation-based, they suggest that lightweight temporal encoding can enable accurate and real-time LiDAR-only detection for embedded indoor robotics without capturing RGB appearance."

Building on the insight that in-context learning is akin to kernel regression, we make this mechanism explicit by replacing the final prediction layer with kernel functions (Gaussian, dot-product, kNN) so that every prediction is a transparent weighted average of training labels. We introduce a two-dimensional taxonomy that formally unifies standard kernel methods, modern neighbor-based approaches, and attention mechanisms under a single framework, and quantify inspectability via the perplexity of the weight distribution over training samples. On 55 TALENT benchmark datasets, KernelICL achieves performance on par with existing tabular foundation models, demonstrating that explicit kernel constraints on the final layer enable inspectable predictions without sacrificing performance."

    "abstract": "Test-time reinforcement learning generates multiple candidate answers via repeated rollouts and performs online updates using pseudo-labels constructed by majority voting. To reduce overhead and improve exploration, prior work introduces tree structured rollouts, which share reasoning prefixes and branch at key nodes to improve sampling efficiency. However, this paradigm still faces two challenges: (1) high entropy branching can trigger rollout collapse, where the branching budget concentrates on a few trajectories with consecutive high-entropy segments, rapidly reducing the number of effective branches; (2) early pseudo-labels are noisy and biased, which can induce self-reinforcing overfitting, causing the policy to sharpen prematurely and suppress exploration. To address these issues, we propose Entropy Confidence Hybrid Group Relative Policy Optimization (ECHO). During rollout, ECHO jointly leverages local entropy and group level confidence to adaptively control branch width, and further introduces online confidence-based pruning to terminate persistently low confidence branches, avoiding high entropy traps and mitigating collapse. During policy updates, ECHO employs confidence adaptive clipping and an entropy confidence hybrid advantage shaping approach to enhance training robustness and mitigate early stage bias. Experiments demonstrate that ECHO achieves consistent gains on multiple mathematical and visual reasoning benchmarks, and generalizes more effectively under a limited rollout budget."

A linearized, addition-by-subtraction CC method called linearized ladder CCD (linLCCD) removes these terms to avoid divergences, but linLCCD under-estimates dynamical correlation. Herein we resolve this deficiency of linLCCD by introducing a linearized external coupled cluster perturbation theory that adds a second-order ring/crossed-ring correction back into a linLCCD reference wave function.

Direct multi-step forecasting (DMS) methods enable fast, parallel prediction of all future horizons but often lose temporal consistency across steps, while iterative multi-step forecasting (IMS) preserves temporal dependencies at the cost of error accumulation and slow inference. To bridge this gap, we propose Back to the Future (BTTF), a simple yet effective framework that enhances forecasting stability through look-ahead augmentation and self-corrective refinement. Rather than relying on complex model architectures, BTTF revisits the fundamental forecasting process and refines a base model by ensembling the second-stage models augmented with their initial predictions. Despite its simplicity, our approach consistently improves long-horizon accuracy and mitigates the instability of linear forecasting models, achieving accuracy gains of up to 58% and demonstrating stable improvements even when the first-stage model is trained under suboptimal conditions. These results suggest that leveraging model-generated forecasts as augmentation can be a simple yet powerful way to enhance long-term prediction, even without complex architectures."

We present Force-Distilled VLA (FD-VLA), a novel framework that integrates force awareness into contact-rich manipulation without relying on physical force sensors. The core of our approach is a Force Distillation Module (FDM), which distills force by mapping a learnable query token, conditioned on visual observations and robot states, into a predicted force token aligned with the latent representation of actual force signals. During inference, this distilled force token is injected into the pretrained VLM, enabling force-aware reasoning while preserving the integrity of its vision-language semantics. This design provides two key benefits: first, it allows practical deployment across a wide range of robots that lack expensive or fragile force-torque sensors, thereby reducing hardware cost and complexity; second, the FDM introduces an additional force-vision-state fusion prior to the VLM, which improves cross-modal alignment and enhances perception-action robustness in contact-rich scenarios. Surprisingly, our physical experiments show that the distilled force token outperforms direct sensor force measurements as well as other baselines, which highlights the effectiveness of this force-distilled VLA approach."

    "abstract": "Safety alignment incurs safety tax that perturbs a large reasoning model's (LRM) general reasoning ability. Existing datasets used for safety alignment for an LRM are usually constructed by distilling safety reasoning traces and answers from an external LRM or human labeler. However, such reasoning traces and answers exhibit a distributional gap with the target LRM that needs alignment, and we conjecture such distributional gap is the culprit leading to significant degradation of reasoning ability of the target LRM. Driven by this hypothesis, we propose a safety alignment dataset construction method, dubbed DGR. DGR transforms and refines an existing out-of-distributional safety reasoning dataset to be aligned with the target's LLM inner distribution. Experimental results demonstrate that i) DGR effectively mitigates the safety tax while maintaining safety performance across all baselines, i.e., achieving \\textbf{+30.2\\%} on DirectRefusal and \\textbf{+21.2\\%} on R1-ACT improvement in average reasoning accuracy compared to Vanilla SFT; ii) the degree of reasoning degradation correlates with the extent of distribution shift, suggesting that bridging this gap is central to preserving capabilities. Furthermore, we find that safety alignment in LRMs may primarily function as a mechanism to activate latent knowledge, as a mere \\textbf{10} samples are sufficient for activating effective refusal behaviors. These findings not only emphasize the importance of distributional consistency but also provide insights into the activation mechanism of safety in reasoning models."

By confining intrinsically hard, small trace distance distinctions to small node-specific datasets and combining weak shallow learners via AdaBoost, TTA distributes capacity across many small submodels rather than one deep circuit, mitigating barren-plateau and optimization failures without sacrificing generalization. Empirically TTA achieves top test accuracy ($\\approx $100\\%) among quantum and classical baselines, is robust to common quantum errors, and realizes aggregate systems with 10000 cumulative layers and 0.2M parameters, implemented as many shallow circuits.

Specifically, iCCDM introduces a novel matrix-form EDM formulation together with an adaptive vicinal training strategy. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets, spanning image resolutions from $64\\times64$ to $256\\times256$, demonstrate that iCCDM consistently outperforms existing methods, including state-of-the-art large-scale text-to-image diffusion models (e.g., Stable Diffusion 3, FLUX.1, and Qwen-Image), achieving higher generation quality while significantly reducing sampling cost."

Our approach employs a chunk-recurrent training framework with on-the-fly activation recomputation, which maintains a constant activation memory footprint (O(1)) and shifts the primary bottleneck to the growing KV cache. To manage the KV cache, OOMB integrates a suite of synergistic optimizations: a paged memory manager for both the KV cache and its gradients to eliminate fragmentation, asynchronous CPU offloading to hide data transfer latency, and page-level sparse attention to reduce both computational complexity and communication overhead. The synergy of these techniques yields exceptional efficiency. Our empirical results show that for every additional 10K tokens of context, the end-to-end training memory overhead increases by a mere 10MB for Qwen2.5-7B. This allows training Qwen2.5-7B with a 4M-token context on a single H200 GPU, a feat that would otherwise require a large cluster using context parallelism.

We study the more realistic setting of covariate mismatch, where each client observes a different subset of features, which typically arises in multicenter collaborations with no prior agreement on data collection. We formalize learning a linear prediction under client-wise MCAR patterns and develop two modular approaches tailored to the dimensional regime and communication budget. In the low-dimensional setting, we propose a plug-in estimator that approximates the oracle linear predictor by aggregating sufficient statistics to estimate the covariance and cross-moment terms. In higher dimensions, we study an impute-then-regress strategy: (i) impute missing covariates using any exchangeability-preserving imputation procedure, and (ii) fit a ridge-regularized linear model on the completed data.

While Mansouri et al. assume an idealized setting, where the contrastive example is at minimum distance of the originally queried/sampled point, we introduce and analyze a mechanism, parameterized by a non-decreasing noise function $f$, under which this ideal contrastive example is perturbed. The amount of perturbation is controlled by $f(d)$, where $d$ is the distance of the queried/sampled point to the decision boundary. Intuitively, this results in higher-quality contrastive examples for points closer to the decision boundary. We study this model in two settings: (i) when the maximum perturbation magnitude is fixed, and (ii) when it is stochastic. For one-dimensional thresholds and for half-spaces under the uniform distribution on a bounded domain, we characterize active and passive contrastive sample complexity in dependence on the function $f$. We show that, under certain conditions on $f$, the presence of contrastive examples speeds up learning in terms of asymptotic query complexity and asymptotic expected query complexity."

We show that the leading term in the evolution equation for the density matrix associated with any quantum clock model gives the von Neumann equation.

    "abstract": "The passage through the $5/3$ mean-motion resonance between Ariel and Umbriel, two of Uranus's largest moons, still raises several open questions. Previous studies suggest that, in order to reproduce the current orbital configuration, Ariel must have had an eccentricity of approximately $\\sim 0.01$ before the resonance encounter, which would prevent resonant capture. However, the rapid tidal circularization of Ariel's orbit implies that some prior mechanism must have excited its eccentricity before the resonance encounter. In this work, we performed a large number of simulations using an N-body integrator to assess whether the earlier $7/4$ mean-motion resonance between Miranda and Ariel could serve as a mechanism to increase Ariel's eccentricity. Our results show that, due to divergent migration, resonance capture does not occur. As the satellites cross the nominal resonance, Ariel's eccentricity is only excited to $3.4 \\times 10^{-4}$, substantially smaller than the required value. Therefore, the $7/4$ mean-motion resonance is not a viable mechanism for increasing Ariel's eccentricity."

    "abstract": "Despite the unitary evolution of closed quantum systems, long-time expectation of local observables are well described by thermal ensembles, providing the foundation of quantum statistical mechanics. A promising route to understanding this quantum thermalization is the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), which posits that individual energy eigenstates already appear locally thermal. Subsequent studies have extended this concept to the full ETH, which captures higher-order correlations among matrix elements through nontrivial relations. In this work, we perform a detailed exact-diagonalization study of finite-size corrections to these relations in the canonical ensemble. We distinguish two distinct sources of corrections: those arising from energy fluctuations, which decay polynomially with system size, and those originating from fluctuations within each energy window, which decay exponentially with system size. In particular, our analysis resolves the puzzle that, for certain observables, finite-size corrections exhibit anomalous growth with increasing system size even in chaotic systems. Our results provide a systematic and practical methodology for validating the full ETH in quantum many-body systems."

While Knowledge Distillation is effective for LALM compression, existing methods remain underexplored in distilling the cross-modal projection module (Projector), and often struggle with alignment due to differences in feature dimensions. We propose PL-Distill, a KD framework that combines Projector-Level Distillation (PDist) to align audio embeddings and Logits-Level Distillation (LDist) to align output logits. PDist introduces Attention-weighted Centered Kernel Alignment, a novel approach we propose to highlight important time steps and address dimension mismatches. Meanwhile, LDist minimizes the Kullback-Leibler divergence between teacher and student logits from audio and text modalities. On IEMOCAP, RAVDESS, and SAVEE, PL-Distill compresses an 8.4B-parameter teacher to a compact 1.1B-parameter student, consistently outperforming the teacher, state-of-the-art pretrained models, and other KD baselines across all metrics."

    "abstract": "The NBA Draft lottery is designed to promote competitive balance by awarding better draft positions to weaker teams, but it creates incentives to deliberately lose, a practice known as tanking. We propose a draft mechanism that is simultaneously practical, incentive-compatible, and advantages weaker teams. The \\textbf{Carry-Over Lottery Allocation (COLA) Draft Mechanism} represents a paradigm shift in evaluating team quality, replacing a single season's standings with playoff outcomes over multiple years. COLA uses a draft lottery where every non-playoff team receives the same number of lottery tickets, removing incentives to lose additional games after elimination. Lottery tickets that do not win a top draft pick carry over to future lotteries, while playoff success or winning a top pick diminishes a team's accumulated tickets. Over time, COLA rewards teams with poor long-term performance and less prior draft assistance. By retaining the lottery format, COLA preserves transparency and fan engagement. Real-world implementation challenges are addressed to demonstrate feasibility, including transitioning from the current system, handling traded draft picks, and accommodating draft classes of varying strength. The most significant challenge occurs in years with exceptionally strong draft classes, where teams may prefer missing the playoffs in order to gain lottery access, violating a foundational assumption: that teams prefer playoff success to lottery participation. We provide a solution to this problem, employing a truth-elicitation mechanism to identify such years and expand lottery eligibility to include as many playoff teams as necessary to preserve anti-tanking incentives."

    "abstract": "While multilingual large language models have gained widespread adoption, their performance on non-English languages remains substantially inferior to English. This disparity is particularly evident in in-context learning scenarios, where providing demonstrations in English but testing on non-English inputs leads to significant performance degradation. In this paper, we hypothesize that LLMs develop a universal semantic space for understanding languages, where different languages are encoded as distinct directions within this space. Based on this hypothesis, we propose language vectors -- a training-free language steering approach that leverages activation differences between source and target languages to guide model behavior. We steer the model generations by adding the vector to the intermediate model activations during inference. This is done to make the model's internal representations shift towards the target language space without any parameter updates. We evaluate our method across three datasets and test on a total of 19 languages on three different models. Our results show consistent improvements on multilingual in-context learning over baselines across all tasks and languages tested. Beyond performance gains, hierarchical clustering of steering vectors reveals meaningful linguistic structure aligned with language families. These vectors also successfully transfer across tasks, demonstrating that these representations are task-agnostic."

This leads to suboptimal performance for specific groups, limiting targeted marketing effectiveness. To bridge this gap, we present \\textit{One Size, Many Fits} (OSMF), a unified framework that aligns diverse group-wise click preferences in large-scale advertising image generation. OSMF begins with product-aware adaptive grouping, which dynamically organizes users based on their attributes and product characteristics, representing each group with rich collective preference features. Building on these groups, preference-conditioned image generation employs a Group-aware Multimodal Large Language Model (G-MLLM) to generate tailored images for each group. The G-MLLM is pre-trained to simultaneously comprehend group features and generate advertising images. Subsequently, we fine-tune the G-MLLM using our proposed Group-DPO for group-wise preference alignment, which effectively enhances each group's CTR on the generated images. To further advance this field, we introduce the Grouped Advertising Image Preference Dataset (GAIP), the first large-scale public dataset of group-wise image preferences, including around 600K groups built from 40M users. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves the state-of-the-art performance in both offline and online settings.

Standard benchmarks report aggregate metrics that obscure which specific capabilities a task requires and whether a cheaper model could suffice. BELLA addresses this gap through three stages: (1) decomposing LLM outputs and extract the granular skills required by using critic-based profiling, (2) clustering skills into structured capability matrices, and (3) multi-objective optimization to select the right models to maximize performance while respecting budget constraints. BELLA provides natural-language rationale for recommendations, providing transparency that current black-box routing systems lack. We describe the framework architecture, situate it within the landscape of LLM routing and evaluation, and discuss its application to financial reasoning as a representative domain exhibiting diverse skill requirements and cost-variation across models. Our framework enables practitioners to make principled and cost-performance trade-offs for deploying LLMs."

In this work, we develop and implement the Quantum Jacobi-Davidson (QJD) method and its quantum diagonalization variant, the Sample-Based Quantum Jacobi-Davidson (SBQJD) method, and demonstrate their fast convergence for ground state energy estimation. We assess the intrinsic algorithmic performance of our methods through exact numerical simulations on a variety of quantum systems, including 8-qubit diagonally dominant matrices, 12-qubit one-dimensional Ising models, and a 10-qubit water molecule (H$_2$O) Hamiltonian. Our results show that both QJD and SBQJD achieve significantly faster convergence and require fewer Pauli measurements compared to the recently reported Quantum Davidson method, with SBQJD further benefiting from optimized reference state preparation. These findings establish the QJD framework as an efficient general-purpose subspace-based technique for solving quantum eigenvalue problems, providing a promising foundation for sparse Hamiltonian calculations on future fault-tolerant quantum hardware."

    "abstract": "Autoregressive large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in many complex tasks, yet they can still fail in very simple logical reasoning such as the \"reversal curse\" -- when trained on forward knowledge data of the form \"$A \\rightarrow B$\" (e.g., Alice's husband is Bob), the model is unable to deduce the reversal knowledge \"$B \\leftarrow A$\" (e.g., Bob's wife is Alice) during test. Extensive prior research suggests that this failure is an inherent, fundamental limit of autoregressive causal LLMs, indicating that these models tend to memorize factual-level knowledge rather than capture higher-level rules. In this paper, we challenge this view by showing that this seemingly fundamental limit can be mitigated by slightly tweaking the training data with a simple regularization data recipe called the Identity Bridge of the form \"$A \\to A$\" (e.g., The name of Alice is Alice). Theoretically, we prove that under this recipe, even a one-layer transformer can break the reversal curse by analyzing the implicit bias of gradient descent. Empirically, we show that a 1B pretrained language model finetuned with the proposed data recipe achieves a 40% success rate on reversal tasks, in stark contrast to a near-zero success rate when trained solely on forward-knowledge data. Our work provides a novel theoretical foundation for the reversal curse and offers a principled, low-cost path to encouraging LLMs to learn higher-level rules from data."

Considering the expressivity of two-layer neural networks, we first construct the data model as a generative two-layer NN where the activation function is expanded by using Hermite polynomials. This allows us to achieve interpretable control over high-order cumulants such as skewness and kurtosis through the Hermite coefficients while keeping the data model realistic. Using samples generated from the data model, we perform controlled online learning experiments with a two-layer NN. Our results reveal a moment-wise progression in training: networks first capture low-order statistics such as mean and covariance, and progressively learn high-order cumulants. Finally, we pretrain the generative model on the Fashion-MNIST dataset and leverage the generated samples for further experiments. The results of these additional experiments confirm our conclusions and show the utility of the data model in a real-world scenario. Overall, our proposed approach bridges simplified data assumptions and practical data complexity, which offers a principled framework for investigating distributional effects in machine learning and signal processing."

The resulting generating functional exposes an emergent phase-space description in which the Lanczos coefficients define an effective Hamiltonian governing operator motion along the Krylov chain. In the semiclassical limit, exponential complexity growth arises from hyperbolic trajectories, and asymptotically linear Lanczos growth appears as a universal chaotic fixed point, with sub-leading deformations classified as irrelevant, marginal or relevant. Going beyond the saddle, the Schwinger-Keldysh framework provides controlled access to fluctuations and large deviations of Krylov complexity, revealing sharp signatures of integrability-chaos crossovers that are invisible at the level of the mean. This formulation reorganises Krylov complexity into a dynamical field-theoretic framework and identifies new fluctuation diagnostics of operator growth in closed quantum systems."

    "abstract": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) achieve strong performance through instruction tuning, but real-world deployment requires them to continually expand their capabilities, making Multimodal Continual Instruction Tuning (MCIT) essential. Recent methods leverage sparse expert routing to promote task specialization, but we find that the expert routing process suffers from drift as the data distribution evolves. For example, a grounding query that previously activated localization experts may instead be routed to irrelevant experts after learning OCR tasks. Meanwhile, the grounding-related experts can be overwritten by new tasks and lose their original functionality. Such failure reflects two problems: router drift, where expert selection becomes inconsistent over time, and expert drift, where shared experts are overwritten across tasks. Therefore, we propose StAbilized Mixture-of-Experts (SAME) for MCIT. To address router drift, SAME stabilizes expert selection by decomposing routing dynamics into orthogonal subspaces and updating only task-relevant directions. To mitigate expert drift, we regulate expert updates via curvature-aware scaling using historical input covariance in a rehearsal-free manner. SAME also introduces adaptive expert activation to freeze selected experts during training, reducing redundant computation and cross-task interference. Extensive experiments demonstrate its SOTA performance."

Remarkably, the same functions also arise in spin models, including the Ising and Heisenberg models, where distinct interaction structures correspond to different matrix functions. This correspondence has been used to establish the classical hardness of simulating interacting spin systems by relating their output distributions to #P-hard quantities. Previous works, however, have largely been restricted to bipartite spin interactions, where transition amplitudes, which provide the leading-order contribution to the output probabilities, are proportional to the permanent. In this work, we extend the Ising model construction to arbitrary interaction networks and show that transition amplitudes of the Ising Hamiltonian are proportional to the hafnian and the loop-hafnian. The loop-hafnian generalizes both the permanent and hafnian, but unlike these cases, loop-hafnian-based states require Dicke-like superpositions, making the design of corresponding quantum circuits non-trivial. Our results establish a unified framework linking bosonic networks of single photons and Gaussian states with quantum spin dynamics and matrix functions. This unification not only broadens the theoretical foundation of quantum circuit models but also highlights new, diverse, and classically intractable applications."

Our purpose is to develop and delve into a temporal discretization scheme for approximating a solution to this problem. To this end, we propose a symmetric three-layer semi-discrete time-stepping scheme in which the nonlinear term is evaluated at the temporal midpoint. As a result, at each time step, this approach reduces the original nonlinear problem to a linear one and enables parallel computation of its solution. Convergence is proved, and second-order accuracy with respect to the time-step size is established on a local temporal interval. The proposed scheme is then applied to a spatially one-dimensional nonlinear dynamic Timoshenko beam system, and the results obtained for the abstract nonlinear system are extended to this setting. A Legendre-Galerkin spectral approximation is employed for the spatial discretization. By taking differences of Legendre polynomials within the Galerkin framework, the resulting linear system is sparse and can be efficiently decoupled. The convergence of the method is also investigated. Finally, several numerical experiments on carefully chosen benchmark problems are conducted to validate the proposed approach and to confirm the theoretical findings."

Moreover, this article, combined with previous articles by the second author, gives a unified and geometric perspective on large classes of seemingly disparate results in the first two categories. Concerning the third category, Oude Groeniger et al recently formulated a general condition on initial data ensuring big bang formation, including curvature blow up. This result, among other things, generalises previous results on stable big bang formation. However, it does not include a statement saying that the solutions induce initial data on the singularity.

We employ a physics-based forward model of large-scale structure using Lagrangian perturbation theory, incorporating light-cone effects, redshift-space distortions, quasar bias, and survey selection effects. This approach enables a detailed and physically motivated inference of the three-dimensional density field and initial conditions over the entire cosmic volume considered. We analyse both the G < 20.0 (Quaia Clean) and G < 20.5 (Quaia Deep) samples, where G denotes the Gaia broad optical-band magnitude, imposing conservative sky cuts to ensure robustness against foreground contamination. The resulting reconstructions span a comoving volume of (10h^{-1} Gpc)^3 with a maximum spatial resolution of 39.1 h^{-1}Mpc, making this the largest field-level reconstruction of the observable Universe in terms of comoving volume to date. We validate our reconstructions through a range of internal and external consistency checks, including the cross-correlation of the inferred density fields with Planck CMB lensing, where we detect a signal at ~4σsignificance.

The bias and correlations limit the estimator in the case of regular datasets with amplified TTL coefficients to a relative error of $10\\%$, but the subtraction of the TTL signal still works well. For lower readout noises, the estimation error diverges, which can be mitigated using a regularization term. Alternatively, using sinusoidal maneuvers improves the inference to a high accuracy of $0.1\\%$ for TTL coefficients around the expected level, removing all correlations in the inferred parameters. This validates the maneuver design by Wegener et al. (2025) in this closed-loop setting."

    "abstract": "Direct alignment methods are increasingly used to align large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. However, many real-world alignment problems involve multiple conflicting objectives, where naive aggregation of preferences can lead to unstable training and poor trade-offs. In particular, weighted loss methods may fail to identify update directions that simultaneously improve all objectives, and existing multi-objective approaches often rely on explicit reward models, introducing additional complexity and distorting user-specified preferences. The contributions of this paper are two-fold. First, we propose a Reward-free Alignment framework for Conflicted Objectives (RACO) that directly leverages pairwise preference data and resolves gradient conflicts via a novel clipped variant of conflict-averse gradient descent. We provide convergence guarantees to Pareto-critical points that respect user-specified objective weights, and further show that clipping can strictly improve convergence rate in the two-objective setting. Second, we improve our method using some heuristics and conduct experiments to demonstrate the compatibility of the proposed framework for LLM alignment. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations on multi-objective summarization and safety alignment tasks across multiple LLM families (Qwen 3, Llama 3, Gemma 3) show that our method consistently achieves better Pareto trade-offs compared to existing multi-objective alignment baselines."

Pre-training improves data-efficient generalisation by learning statistical priors across subjects, but these priors critically depend on context. While natural speech might unfold gradually over minutes, most methods pre-train with only a few seconds of context. Thus, we propose MEG-XL, a model pre-trained with 2.5 minutes of MEG context per sample, 5-300x longer than prior work, and equivalent to 191k tokens, capturing extended neural context. Fine-tuning on the task of word decoding from brain data, MEG-XL matches supervised performance with a fraction of the data (e.g. 1hr vs 50hrs) and outperforms brain foundation models. We find that models pre-trained with longer contexts learn representations that transfer better to word decoding. Our results indicate that long-context pre-training helps exploit extended neural context that other methods unnecessarily discard.

However, it is challenging to optimize high-dimensional pixel manifolds that contain many perceptually irrelevant signals, leaving existing pixel diffusion methods lagging behind latent diffusion models. We propose PixelGen, a simple pixel diffusion framework with perceptual supervision. Instead of modeling the full image manifold, PixelGen introduces two complementary perceptual losses to guide diffusion model towards learning a more meaningful perceptual manifold. An LPIPS loss facilitates learning better local patterns, while a DINO-based perceptual loss strengthens global semantics. With perceptual supervision, PixelGen surpasses strong latent diffusion baselines. It achieves an FID of 5.11 on ImageNet-256 without classifier-free guidance using only 80 training epochs, and demonstrates favorable scaling performance on large-scale text-to-image generation with a GenEval score of 0.79. PixelGen requires no VAEs, no latent representations, and no auxiliary stages, providing a simpler yet more powerful generative paradigm.

This enables iterative reflection and globally informed planning, reframing research as a progressive process. Empirical results show that Re-TRAC consistently outperforms ReAct by 15-20% on BrowseComp with frontier LLMs. For smaller models, we introduce Re-TRAC-aware supervised fine-tuning, achieving state-of-the-art performance at comparable scales.

    "abstract": "High-frequency stability is crucial for the performance of graphene resonators in sensing and timekeeping applications. However, the extreme miniaturization and high mechanical compliance that make graphene attractive also render it highly susceptible to nonlinearities, degrading frequency stability. Here, we demonstrate that graphene parametric oscillators provide an alternative nonlinear operating regime, where short-term frequency stability can be enhanced despite strong nonlinearity. By operating graphene resonators in a phase-locked loop (PLL), we experimentally demonstrate that parametric oscillations in the post-bifurcation regime achieve lower Allan deviation at fast integration times than Duffing oscillations at identical amplitudes. This improvement originates from strong nonlinear damping inherent to parametric oscillators, which suppresses amplitude-to-frequency noise conversion at large amplitudes. A minimal theoretical model captures observed phase diffusion and identifies nonlinear damping as the dominant mechanism governing phase noise reduction. These results highlight the role of nonlinear dissipation in enabling precision sensing beyond conventional limits of graphene oscillators."

To this end, we present \\textbf{MemSkill}, which reframes these operations as learnable and evolvable memory skills, structured and reusable routines for extracting, consolidating, and pruning information from interaction traces. Inspired by the design philosophy of agent skills, MemSkill employs a \\emph{controller} that learns to select a small set of relevant skills, paired with an LLM-based \\emph{executor} that produces skill-guided memories. Beyond learning skill selection, MemSkill introduces a \\emph{designer} that periodically reviews hard cases where selected skills yield incorrect or incomplete memories, and evolves the skill set by proposing refinements and new skills. Together, MemSkill forms a closed-loop procedure that improves both the skill-selection policy and the skill set itself. Experiments on LoCoMo, LongMemEval, HotpotQA, and ALFWorld demonstrate that MemSkill improves task performance over strong baselines and generalizes well across settings. Further analyses shed light on how skills evolve, offering insights toward more adaptive, self-evolving memory management for LLM agents."

We propose an efficient \\emph{age-aware edge-blind over-the-air FL} approach that does not require channel state information (CSI) at the devices. Instead, the parameter server (PS) uses multiple antennas and applies maximum-ratio combining (MRC) based on its estimated sum of the channel gains to detect the parameter updates. A key challenge is that the number of orthogonal subcarriers is limited; thus, transmitting many parameters requires multiple Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) symbols, which increases latency. To address this, the PS selects only a small subset of model coordinates each round using \\emph{AgeTop-\\(k\\)}, which first picks the largest-magnitude entries and then chooses the \\(k\\) coordinates with the longest waiting times since they were last selected. This ensures that all selected parameters fit into a single OFDM symbol, reducing latency. We provide a convergence bound that highlights the advantages of using a higher number of antenna array elements and demonstrates a key trade-off: increasing \\(k\\) decreases compression error at the cost of increasing the effect of channel noise. Experimental results show that (i) more PS antennas greatly improve accuracy and convergence speed; (ii) AgeTop-\\(k\\) outperforms random selection under relatively good channel conditions; and (iii) the optimum \\(k\\) depends on the channel, with smaller \\(k\\) being better in noisy settings."

Existing approaches search for individual global directions, implicitly assuming linear separability, which overlooks concepts with nonlinear or multi-dimensional structure. In this work, we leverage Mixture of Factor Analyzers (MFA) as a scalable, unsupervised alternative that models the activation space as a collection of Gaussian regions with their local covariance structure. MFA decomposes activations into two compositional geometric objects: the region's centroid in activation space, and the local variation from the centroid. We train large-scale MFAs for Llama-3.1-8B and Gemma-2-2B, and show they capture complex, nonlinear structures in activation space. Moreover, evaluations on localization and steering benchmarks show that MFA outperforms unsupervised baselines, is competitive with supervised localization methods, and often achieves stronger steering performance than sparse autoencoders. Together, our findings position local geometry, expressed through subspaces, as a promising unit of analysis for scalable concept discovery and model control, accounting for complex structures that isolated directions fail to capture."

This bias persists even when models generate step-wise explanations, indicating that intermediate rationales may inherit the same semantic shortcuts that affect answers. Recent approaches propose mitigating this issue by increasing inference-time structural constraints, either by encouraging abstract intermediate representations or by intervening directly in the model's internal computations; however, reliably suppressing semantic interference remains an open challenge. To make formal deduction less sensitive to semantic content, we introduce a framework for abstraction-guided reasoning that explicitly separates structural inference from lexical semantics. We construct paired content-laden and abstract syllogisms and use the model's activations on abstract inputs to define an abstract reasoning space. We then learn lightweight Abstractors that, from content-conditioned residual-stream states, predict representations aligned with this space and integrate these predictions via multi-layer interventions during the forward pass. Using cross-lingual transfer as a test bed, we show that abstraction-aligned steering reduces content-driven errors and improves validity-sensitive performance. Our results position activation-level abstraction as a scalable mechanism for enhancing the robustness of formal reasoning in LLMs against semantic interference."

In our networked SIR model, each node must keep its infection level below a critical threshold, despite dynamic interactions with neighboring nodes and inherent uncertainties in the epidemic parameters and measurement errors, to ensure public health safety. We first derive a CBF-based controller that guarantees infection thresholds are not exceeded in the nominal case. We enhance the framework to handle realistic epidemic scenarios under uncertainties by incorporating compensation terms that reinforce safety against uncertainties: an independent method with constant bounds for uniform uncertainty, and a novel approach that scales with the state to capture increased relative noise in early or suppressed outbreak stages. Simulation results on a networked SIR system illustrate that the nominal CBF controller maintains safety under low uncertainty, while the robust approaches provide formal safety guarantees under higher uncertainties; in particular, the novel method employs more conservative control efforts to provide larger safety margins, whereas the independent approach optimizes resource allocation by allowing infection levels to approach the boundaries in steady epidemic regimes."

    "abstract": "Discovering causal relationships requires controlled experiments, but experimentalists face a sequential decision problem: each intervention reveals information that should inform what to try next. Traditional approaches such as random sampling, greedy information maximization, and round-robin coverage treat each decision in isolation, unable to learn adaptive strategies from experience. We propose Active Causal Experimentalist (ACE), which learns experimental design as a sequential policy. Our key insight is that while absolute information gains diminish as knowledge accumulates (making value-based RL unstable), relative comparisons between candidate interventions remain meaningful throughout. ACE exploits this via Direct Preference Optimization, learning from pairwise intervention comparisons rather than non-stationary reward magnitudes. Across synthetic benchmarks, physics simulations, and economic data, ACE achieves 70-71% improvement over baselines at equal intervention budgets (p < 0.001, Cohen's d ~ 2). Notably, the learned policy autonomously discovers that collider mechanisms require concentrated interventions on parent variables, a theoretically-grounded strategy that emerges purely from experience. This suggests preference-based learning can recover principled experimental strategies, complementing theory with learned domain adaptation."

Related is the covering problem (or sub-marking reachbility), which decides whether there is a reachable marking covering at least the tokens in the given marking. For live and bounded free-choice nets as well as for sound free-choice workflow nets, both problems are polynomial in their computational complexity. This paper refines this complexity for the class of sound acyclic free-choice workflow nets to a quadratic polynomial, more specifically to $O(P^2 + T^2)$. Furthermore, this paper shows the feasibility of accurately explaining why a given marking is or is not reachable. This can be achieved by three new concepts: admissibility, maximum admissibility, and diverging transitions. Admissibility requires that all places in a given marking are pairwise concurrent. Maximum admissibility states that adding a marked place to an admissible marking would make it inadmissible. A diverging transition is a transition which originally \"produces\" the concurrent tokens that lead to a given marking. In this paper, we provide algorithms for all these concepts and explain their computation in detail by basing them on the concepts of concurrency and post-dominance frontiers - a well known concept from compiler construction. In doing this, we present straight-forward implementations for solving (sub-marking) reachability."

    "abstract": "We consider a run-and-tumble particle (RTP) with stochastic resetting confined to the half line $[0,\\infty)$ with a sticky boundary at $x=0$. In the bulk the RTP tumbles at a constant rate $α>0$ between velocity states $\\pm v$ with $v>0$ and randomly resets to its initial position and orientation $(x_0,k_0)\\in(\\mathbb{R}^+,\\pm)$. When the RTP reaches the target at $x=0$ it attaches to the boundary for a random waiting time before either detaching and continuing to navigate the bulk domain or (permanently) entering the target. These events are the analogs of adsorption, desorption, and absorption of a particle by a partially reactive surface in physical chemistry. We use renewal theory to characterize the particle trajectory in terms of successive binding events under two distinct desorption protocols: via resetting to $(x_0,k_0)$ and via continuous movement from $x=0$ with velocity $+v$. First we derive the nonequilibrum stationary state (NESS) in the case of no absorption and characterize the accumulation at the boundary. Second, we compute the mean first passage time (MFPT) statistics. In addition to observing the usual unimodal dependence of the MFPT on bulk resetting, both the NESS and MFPT strongly depend on the initial orientation $k_0$ and the desorption protocol. For instance, if the initial orientation is toward the boundary, we find that the desorption-induced resetting protocol can reduce the MFPT more effectively than the non-resetting desorption protocol. We also show how matching the desorption kinetics with the bulk resetting or tumbling rate introduces a trade-off between minimizing the adsorption and absorption times. In this setting we find that the desorption protocol which minimizes the absorption MFPT for a given set of parameters is almost always the opposite of that favored when desorption and bulk kinetics are not the same."

RANKVIDEO is trained using a two-stage curriculum consisting of perception-grounded supervised fine-tuning followed by reranking training that combines pointwise, pairwise, and teacher confidence distillation objectives, and is supported by a data synthesis pipeline for constructing reasoning-intensive query-video pairs.

Each network specializes in executing a distinct type of task. Users stochastically generate jobs of various types and forward them to the central server, which routes each job to the appropriate network of machines. Due to resource constraints, the server cannot serve all users' jobs simultaneously, which motivates the design of scheduling policies with possible preemption. To evaluate scheduling performance, we introduce a novel timeliness metric, the age of job, inspired by the well-known metric, the age of information. We study the problem of minimizing the long-term weighted average age of job. We first propose a max-weight policy by minimizing the one-step Lyapunov drift and then derive the Whittle index (WI) policy when the job completion times of the networks of machines follow geometric distributions. For general job completion time distributions, we introduce a Whittle index with max-weight fallback (WIMWF) policy. We also investigate the Net-gain maximization (NGM) policy. Numerically, we show that the proposed WIMWF policy achieves the best performance in the general job completion time setting. We also observe a scaling trend: two different max-weight policies can outperform the NGM policy in small systems, whereas the NGM policy improves as we scale the system size and becomes asymptotically better than max-weight policies. For geometric service times, the WI policy yields the lowest age across all considered system sizes."

However, numerous recent works have shown that it is unable to perform basic tasks involving detecting triples of correlated tokens, or compositional tasks where multiple input tokens need to be referenced to generate a result. Some higher-dimensional alternatives to self-attention have been proposed to address this, including higher-order attention and Strassen attention, which can perform some of these polyadic tasks in exchange for slower, superquadratic running times. In this work, we define a vast class of generalizations of self-attention, which we call poly-attention mechanisms. Our mechanisms can incorporate arbitrary higher-order (tensor) computations as well as arbitrary relationship structures between the input tokens, and they include the aforementioned alternatives as special cases. We then systematically study their computational complexity and representational strength, including giving new algorithms and matching complexity-theoretic lower bounds on the time complexity of computing the attention matrix exactly as well as approximately, and tightly determining which polyadic tasks they can each perform. Our results give interesting trade-offs between different desiderata for these mechanisms, including a tight relationship between how expressive a mechanism is, and how large the coefficients in the model may be so that the mechanism can be approximated in almost-linear time. Notably, we give a new attention mechanism which can be computed exactly in quadratic time, and which can perform function composition for any fixed number of functions. Prior mechanisms, even for just composing two functions, could only be computed in superquadratic time, and our new lower bounds show that faster algorithms for them are not possible."

    "abstract": "Continual learning aims to acquire tasks sequentially without catastrophic forgetting, yet standard strategies face a core tradeoff: regularization-based methods (e.g., EWC) can overconstrain updates when task optima are weakly overlapping, while replay-based methods can retain performance but drift due to imperfect replay. We study a hybrid perspective: \\emph{trust region continual learning} that combines generative replay with a Fisher-metric trust region constraint. We show that, under local approximations, the resulting update admits a MAML-style interpretation with a single implicit inner step: replay supplies an old-task gradient signal (query-like), while the Fisher-weighted penalty provides an efficient offline curvature shaping (support-like). This yields an emergent meta-learning property in continual learning: the model becomes an initialization that rapidly \\emph{re-converges} to prior task optima after each task transition, without explicitly optimizing a bilevel objective. Empirically, on task-incremental diffusion image generation and continual diffusion-policy control, trust region continual learning achieves the best final performance and retention, and consistently recovers early-task performance faster than EWC, replay, and continual meta-learning baselines."

However, in practical scenarios, there is a lack of clean speech, and self-supervised learning-based (SSL) speech enhancement methods that offer comparable enhancement performance and can be applied to other speech-related downstream applications are desired. In this work, we develop a masked autoencoder based universal speech enhancer that is agnostic to the type of distortion affecting speech, can handle multiple distortions simultaneously, and is trained in a self-supervised manner. An augmentation stack adds further distortions to the noisy input data. The masked autoencoder model learns to remove the added distortions along with reconstructing the masked regions of the spectrogram during pre-training. The pre-trained embeddings are then used by fine-tuning models trained on a small amount of paired data for specific downstream tasks. We evaluate the pre-trained features for denoising and dereverberation downstream tasks. We explore different augmentations (like single or multi-speaker) in the pre-training augmentation stack and the effect of different noisy input feature representations (like $log1p$ compression) on pre-trained embeddings and downstream fine-tuning enhancement performance. We show that the proposed method not only outperforms the baseline but also achieves state-of-the-art performance for both in-domain and out-of-domain evaluation datasets."

    "abstract": "The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence has made the generation of synthetic images widely accessible, increasing concerns related to misinformation, digital forgery, and content authenticity on large-scale online platforms. This paper proposes a blockchain-backed framework for verifying AI-generated images through a registry-based provenance mechanism. Each AI-generated image is assigned a digital fingerprint that preserves similarity using perceptual hashing and is registered at creation time by participating generation platforms. The hashes are stored on a hybrid on-chain/off-chain public blockchain using a Merkle Patricia Trie for tamper-resistant storage (on-chain) and a Burkhard-Keller tree (off-chain) to enable efficient similarity search over large image registries. Verification is performed when images are re-uploaded to digital platforms such as social media services, enabling identification of previously registered AI-generated images even after benign transformations or partial modifications. The proposed system does not aim to universally detect all synthetic images, but instead focuses on verifying the provenance of AI-generated content that has been registered at creation time. By design, this approach complements existing watermarking and learning-based detection methods, providing a platform-agnostic, tamper-proof mechanism for scalable content provenance and authenticity verification at the point of large-scale online distribution."

    "abstract": "Improving the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) typically relies either on the model's ability to sample a correct solution to be reinforced or on the existence of a stronger model able to solve the problem. However, many difficult problems remain intractable for even current frontier models, preventing the extraction of valid training signals. A promising alternative is to leverage high-quality expert human solutions, yet naive imitation of this data fails because it is fundamentally out of distribution: expert solutions are typically didactic, containing implicit reasoning gaps intended for human readers rather than computational models. Furthermore, high-quality expert solutions are expensive, necessitating generalizable sample-efficient training methods. We propose Distribution Aligned Imitation Learning (DAIL), a two-step method that bridges the distributional gap by first transforming expert solutions into detailed, in-distribution reasoning traces and then applying a contrastive objective to focus learning on expert insights and methodologies. We find that DAIL can leverage fewer than 1000 high-quality expert solutions to achieve 10-25% pass@k gains on Qwen2.5-Instruct and Qwen3 models, improve reasoning efficiency by 2x to 4x, and enable out-of-domain generalization."

    "abstract": "We propose Infinite-World, a robust interactive world model capable of maintaining coherent visual memory over 1000+ frames in complex real-world environments. While existing world models can be efficiently optimized on synthetic data with perfect ground-truth, they lack an effective training paradigm for real-world videos due to noisy pose estimations and the scarcity of viewpoint revisits. To bridge this gap, we first introduce a Hierarchical Pose-free Memory Compressor (HPMC) that recursively distills historical latents into a fixed-budget representation. By jointly optimizing the compressor with the generative backbone, HPMC enables the model to autonomously anchor generations in the distant past with bounded computational cost, eliminating the need for explicit geometric priors. Second, we propose an Uncertainty-aware Action Labeling module that discretizes continuous motion into a tri-state logic. This strategy maximizes the utilization of raw video data while shielding the deterministic action space from being corrupted by noisy trajectories, ensuring robust action-response learning. Furthermore, guided by insights from a pilot toy study, we employ a Revisit-Dense Finetuning Strategy using a compact, 30-minute dataset to efficiently activate the model's long-range loop-closure capabilities. Extensive experiments, including objective metrics and user studies, demonstrate that Infinite-World achieves superior performance in visual quality, action controllability, and spatial consistency."

It has been previously suggested that this may represent a certain degree of fine-tuning, and thus perhaps observers are a-priori more likely to develop on those rare worlds with nearly equal land-ocean ratios, such as our own. In this work, we take the single datum of the Earth and then use Bayesian inference to compare four models for the probability distribution of a planet becoming inhabited by observers as a function of land-fraction, $f$, which we classify as i) land-centric ii) ocean-centric iii) equi-centric and iv) indifference. We find that no model is strongly favoured over the others, but that 1) the land-centric model is disfavoured over all others, and, 2) the equi-centric model is favoured over all competitors. Further, we show that more extreme models with heavy tail-weighting are strongly disfavoured even when conditioned upon the Earth alone. For example, a land-centric model where the median planet has $f=0.82$ (or greater) is in strong tension with our existence. Finally, we consider the potential addition of more data via Mars or exoplanets. Should paleo-Mars have once harboured life and had $f<0.20$, then this would strongly favour the ocean-centric model for life, over a land-centric hypothesis. We show that strong evidence for/against the equi-centric model versus its competitors would likely require at least a dozen inhabited exoplanets, offering a well-motivated sample size for future experiments."

    "abstract": "Can Large language models (LLMs) learn to reason without any weight update and only through in-context learning (ICL)? ICL is strikingly sample-efficient, often learning from only a handful of demonstrations, but complex reasoning tasks typically demand many training examples to learn from. However, naively scaling ICL by adding more demonstrations breaks down at this scale: attention costs grow quadratically, performance saturates or degrades with longer contexts, and the approach remains a shallow form of learning. Due to these limitations, practitioners predominantly rely on in-weight learning (IWL) to induce reasoning. In this work, we show that by using Prefix Tuning, LLMs can learn to reason without overloading the context window and without any weight updates. We introduce $\\textbf{ReasonCACHE}$, an instantiation of this mechanism that distills demonstrations into a fixed key-value cache. Empirically, across challenging reasoning benchmarks, including GPQA-Diamond, ReasonCACHE outperforms standard ICL and matches or surpasses IWL approaches. Further, it achieves this all while being more efficient across three key axes: data, inference cost, and trainable parameters. We also theoretically prove that ReasonCACHE can be strictly more expressive than low-rank weight update since the latter ties expressivity to input rank, whereas ReasonCACHE bypasses this constraint by directly injecting key-values into the attention mechanism. Together, our findings identify ReasonCACHE as a middle path between in-context and in-weight learning, providing a scalable algorithm for learning reasoning skills beyond the context window without modifying parameters.

This paper also presents a Gaussian implementation of the T-IEMB filter, which performs the update by approximating the conditional moments of the measurement model, and admits a computationally light filtering solution.

    "abstract": "We present a predictive framework for neutrino mass generation based on the spontaneous breaking of a leptonic $U(1)_{L_μ-L_τ}$ symmetry within a supersymmetric setting. The breaking of the global symmetry gives rise to a Majoron-like axion-like particle and a pseudo-Goldstone right-handed neutrino whose mass is naturally suppressed by supersymmetry-breaking effects. The interplay between the pseudo-Goldstone neutrino and the low-scale seesaw mechanism leads to a structured neutrino mass matrix capable of reproducing the observed neutrino masses, mixing angles, and CP-violating phase without invoking extreme parameter hierarchies. We perform a numerical fit to current neutrino oscillation data and identify representative benchmark solutions consistent with laboratory constraints as well as cosmological and astrophysical bounds. A characteristic outcome of the framework is the emergence of correlated relations linking the symmetry breaking scale, heavy neutrino masses, Majoron couplings, and neutrino lifetimes. Majoron-induced invisible neutrino decay arises generically and can significantly modify cosmological neutrino mass constraints for sufficiently low symmetry breaking scales. We discuss the phenomenological implications across neutrino oscillation experiments, cosmology, and collider searches for long-lived heavy neutrinos. While a detailed experimental simulation is beyond the scope of this work, existing sensitivity projections indicate that portions of the parameter space may become accessible in future facilities. The combined interplay of laboratory probes and cosmological observations provides a consistent and testable picture of neutrino mass generation tied to spontaneous leptonic symmetry breaking and axion-like physics."

We also approximate the reference model's scoring over long contexts by evaluating only the anchor clip, reducing computational overhead. In Stage 2, we employ a recursive captioning pipeline on long videos to generate scene-level metadata, then use a large language model to craft multi-segment reasoning queries and dispreferred responses, aligning the model's preferences through multi-segment reasoning tasks. With only 16K synthetic examples and no costly human labels, LongVPO outperforms the state-of-the-art open-source models on multiple long-video benchmarks, while maintaining strong short-video performance (e.g., on MVBench), offering a scalable paradigm for efficient long-form video understanding."

To model this hierarchy, we employ Residual Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (RVQ-VAEs) to learn a coarse-to-fine representation of motion. We further enhance the disentanglement by integrating contrastive learning and a novel information leakage loss with codebook learning to organize the content and the style across different codebooks. We harness this disentangled representation using our simple and effective inference-time technique Quantized Code Swapping, which enables motion style transfer without requiring any fine-tuning for unseen styles. Our framework demonstrates strong versatility across multiple inference applications, including style transfer, style removal, and motion blending."

The limit system preserves the essential physical mechanisms of the original model, while exhibiting a reduced, effectively two-and-a-half-dimensional structure. This simplified framework allows for a rigorous analytical study of the data assimilation process while maintaining a direct physical connection to the full compressible model. We establish well posedness of global-in-time solutions and a compact trajectory attractor, followed by the stability and convergence results for the nudging scheme applied to the limiting system.

We combine this theory with Kullback-Leibler divergence, a fundamental concept in information theory and statistics, to propose a test for equality of extremal dependence structures in practically relevant directions. Under suitable assumptions, we derive the limiting distributions of the proposed statistic under null and alternative hypotheses. Importantly, our test is fast to compute and easy to interpret by practitioners, making it attractive in applications. Simulations provide evidence of the power of our test.

For scalar masses $\\lesssim 200 $ GeV and appropriate values of the triplet vacuum expectation value, this state can be long-lived and decay predominantly into like-sign muon pairs (e.g. $μ^+μ^+ $ or $μ^-μ^-$), producing distinctive displaced-vertex signals. We investigate the pair production of these scalars at the International Linear Collider (ILC) and a prospective muon collider, considering their planned center-of-mass energies. Incorporating theoretical and experimental constraints, we study the resulting signature of four leptons accompanied by missing transverse energy. Displaced vertices offer direct evidence of the scalar's long lifetime, while we further show that the invariant mass distribution of same-sign dilepton pairs serves as a powerful complementary probe for discovering doubly charged Higgs bosons at both the ILC and muon collider."

We take the position that behavioral shifts should be explained comparatively: the core target should be the intervention-induced shift between a reference model and an intervened model, rather than any single model in isolation. To this aim we formulate a Comparative XAI ($Δ$-XAI) framework with a set of desiderata to be taken into account when designing proper explaining methods. To highlight how $Δ$-XAI methods work, we introduce a set of possible pipelines, relate them to the desiderata, and provide a concrete $Δ$-XAI experiment."

    "abstract": "A deep learning model usually has to sacrifice some utilities when it acquires some other abilities or characteristics. Privacy preservation has such trade-off relationships with utilities. The loss disparity between various defense approaches implies the potential to decouple generalizability and privacy risks to maximize privacy gain. In this paper, we identify that the model's generalization and privacy risks exist in different regions in deep neural network architectures. Based on the observations that we investigate, we propose Privacy-Preserving Training Principle (PPTP) to protect model components from privacy risks while minimizing the loss in generalizability. Through extensive evaluations, our approach shows significantly better maintenance in model generalizability while enhancing privacy preservation."

Our end-to-end formal infrastructure implement the missing contents in latest Lean 4 Mathlib library, including a complete development of Gaussian Lipschitz concentration, the first formalization of Dudley's entropy integral theorem for sub-Gaussian processes, and an application to least-squares (sparse) regression with a sharp rate. The project was carried out using a human-AI collaborative workflow, in which humans design proof strategies and AI agents execute tactical proof construction, leading to the human-verified Lean 4 toolbox for SLT. Beyond implementation, the formalization process exposes and resolves implicit assumptions and missing details in standard SLT textbooks, enforcing a granular, line-by-line understanding of the theory.

    "abstract": "Inferring spatial transcriptomics (ST) from histology enables scalable histogenomic profiling, yet current methods are largely restricted to single-tissue models. This fragmentation fails to leverage biological principles shared across cancer types and hinders application to data-scarce scenarios. While pan-cancer training offers a solution, the resulting heterogeneity challenges monolithic architectures. To bridge this gap, we introduce MoLF (Mixture-of-Latent-Flow), a generative model for pan-cancer histogenomic prediction. MoLF leverages a conditional Flow Matching objective to map noise to the gene latent manifold, parameterized by a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) velocity field. By dynamically routing inputs to specialized sub-networks, this architecture effectively decouples the optimization of diverse tissue patterns. Our experiments demonstrate that MoLF establishes a new state-of-the-art, consistently outperforming both specialized and foundation model baselines on pan-cancer benchmarks. Furthermore, MoLF exhibits zero-shot generalization to cross-species data, suggesting it captures fundamental, conserved histo-molecular mechanisms."

The approach taken goes beyond a regional knowledge production function and draws possible explanations from a more extensive pool of R&D related and regional structural variables. Having employed game theory techniques in order to describe the licensing of the patents through royalties and derived the subgame perfect Nash equilibrium under a Stackelberg duopoly, the results obtained accord with findings of previous studies when it comes R&D expenditure related variables and further suggest that the role of highly-qualified employment is instrumental in promoting regional innovation. The results also suggest the benefits of synergies between R&D personnel in manufacturing and other measures of highly-qualified employment as well as R&D expenditure of the public sector and employment in manufacturing business R&D for regional innovation."

    "abstract": "LLM-powered coding agents are redefining how real-world software is developed. To drive the research towards better coding agents, we require challenging benchmarks that can rigorously evaluate the ability of such agents to perform various software engineering tasks. However, popular coding benchmarks such as HumanEval and SWE-Bench focus on narrowly scoped tasks such as competition programming and patch generation. In reality, software engineers have to handle a broader set of tasks for real-world software development. To address this gap, we propose OmniCode, a novel software engineering benchmark that contains a broader and more diverse set of task categories beyond code or patch generation. Overall, OmniCode contains 1794 tasks spanning three programming languages (Python, Java, and C++) and four key categories: bug fixing, test generation, code review fixing, and style fixing. In contrast to prior software engineering benchmarks, the tasks in OmniCode are (1) manually validated to eliminate ill-defined problems, and (2) synthetically crafted or recently curated to avoid data leakage issues, presenting a new framework for synthetically generating diverse software tasks from limited real-world data. We evaluate OmniCode with popular agent frameworks such as SWE-Agent and show that while they may perform well on bug fixing for Python, they fall short on tasks such as Test Generation and in languages such as C++ and Java. For instance, SWE-Agent achieves a maximum of 20.9% with DeepSeek-V3.1 on Java Test Generation tasks. OmniCode aims to serve as a robust benchmark and spur the development of agents that can perform well across different aspects of software development.

    "abstract": "Fine-tuning is the primary mechanism for adapting foundation models to downstream tasks; however, standard approaches largely optimize task objectives in isolation and do not account for secondary yet critical alignment objectives (e.g., safety and hallucination avoidance). As a result, downstream fine-tuning can degrade alignment and fail to correct pre-existing misaligned behavior. We propose an alignment-aware fine-tuning framework that integrates feedback from an external alignment signal through policy-gradient-based regularization. Our method introduces an adaptive gating mechanism that dynamically balances supervised and alignment-driven gradients on a per-sample basis, prioritizing uncertain or misaligned cases while allowing well-aligned examples to follow standard supervised updates. The framework further learns abstention behavior for fully misaligned inputs, incorporating conservative responses directly into the fine-tuned model. Experiments on general and domain-specific instruction-tuning benchmarks demonstrate consistent reductions in harmful and hallucinated outputs without sacrificing downstream task performance. Additional analyses show robustness to adversarial fine-tuning, prompt-based attacks, and unsafe initializations, establishing adaptively gated alignment optimization as an effective approach for alignment-preserving and alignment-recovering model adaptation."

In the classic variant, it is assumed that both sides of the market submit a ranked list of all agents on the other side. However, in large matching markets such as the National Resident Matching Program (NRMP), it is infeasible for hospitals to interview or mutually rank each resident. In this paper, we study the stable matching problem with truncated preference lists. In particular, we assume that, based on historical datasets, each hospital has a predicted rank of its likely match and only ranks residents within a bounded interval around that prediction. We use the algorithms-with-predictions framework and show that the classic deferred-acceptance (DA) algorithm used to compute stable matchings is robust to such truncation. We present two algorithms and theoretically and empirically evaluate their performance. Our results show that even with reasonably accurate predictions, it is possible to significantly cut down on both instance size (the length of preference lists) as well as the number of proposals made. These results explain the practical success of the DA algorithm and connect market design to the emerging theory of algorithms with predictions."

However, most research in this field relies on simulations or limited on-device testing, which makes the real-world reliability of proposed schemes difficult to assess. We systematically reviewed 31 acoustic communication studies for commodity devices and found that none provided accessible source code. After contacting authors and re-implementing three promising schemes, we assembled a testbed of eight representative acoustic communication systems. Using over 11000 smartphone transmissions in both realistic indoor environments and an anechoic chamber, we provide a systematic and repeatable methodology for evaluating the reliability and generalizability of these schemes under real-world conditions. Our results show that many existing schemes face challenges in practical usage, largely due to severe multipath propagation indoors and varying audio characteristics across device models. To support future research and foster more robust evaluations, we release our re-implementations alongside the first comprehensive dataset of real-world acoustic transmissions. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of rigorous on-device testing and underscore the need for robust design strategies to bridge the gap between simulation results and reliable IoT deployments."

Since PNSs are also superdense objects with strong gravitational fields, we can use them to probe general relativity (GR) in the high-curvature regime, similar to NSs. In this study, we analyze the macroscopic properties like mass, radius, compactness, tidal deformability, $f$-mode oscillations and gravitational binding energy of PNSs using four different relativistic mean-field (RMF) equations of state (EOSs) with fixed entropy per baryon ($S$ =1, 2) and varying the lepton fractions ($Y_l$). The variation of $S$ and $Y_l$ has a noticeable effect on these properties. Extending our study beyond GR, we explore these effects within the framework of Energy-Momentum Squared Gravity (EMSG). This modified gravity theory adds the squared energy-momentum terms to the field equations with a free parameter $α$. In the weak-field regimes, EMSG remains indistinguishable from GR, but in the strong-field regimes, such as PNSs or NSs, it shows measurable deviations. Varying the free parameter $α$, we observe significant changes in the macroscopic properties of the PNSs. After that, we focus on the universal relations of the macroscopic properties and the correlations of the universal relations. We find that, despite significant changes in the macroscopic properties induced by the variations of $S$, $Y_l$ and $α$, the correlations remain strong and nearly unaffected."

    "abstract": "Radio frequency fingerprint (RFF) identification technology, which exploits relatively stable hardware imperfections, is highly susceptible to constantly changing channel effects. Although various channel-robust RFF feature extraction methods have been proposed, they predominantly rely on experimental comparisons rather than theoretical analyses. This limitation hinders the progress of channel-robust RFF feature extraction and impedes the establishment of theoretical guidance for its design. In this paper, we establish a unified theoretical performance analysis framework for different RFF feature extraction methods using the silhouette score as an evaluation metric, and propose a precoding-based channel-robust RFF feature extraction method that enhances the silhouette score without requiring channel estimation. First, we employ the silhouette score as an evaluation metric and obtain the theoretical performance of various RFF feature extraction methods using the Taylor series expansion. Next, we mitigate channel effects by computing the reciprocal of the received signal in the frequency domain at the device under authentication. We then compare these methods across three different scenarios: the deterministic channel scenario, the independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) stochastic channel scenario, and the non-i.i.d. stochastic channel scenario. Finally, simulation and experimental results demonstrate that the silhouette score is an efficient metric to evaluate classification accuracy. Furthermore, the results indicate that the proposed precoding-based channel-robust RFF feature extraction method achieves the highest silhouette score and classification accuracy under channel variations."

On the example of an InAsP quantum dot embedded in an InP matrix, we compute single-particle states using an ab initio-parametrized tight-binding model, then obtain correlated many-body wave functions of neutral excitons, biexcitons, and charged trions via the configuration-interaction method. Using these correlated states, we compute the exciton-phonon coupling matrix elements. The resulting phonon spectral densities for different excitonic complexes are compared with the widely used analytical super-Ohmic form and reveal deviations at higher energies originating from the realistic dot geometry and atomistic wave functions, whereas configuration mixing is found to play only a minor role. Furthermore, we extract radiative lifetimes comparable to values experimentally measured. As a direct application, we simulate the emission brightness of a pulsed-driven quantum dot and demonstrate that the atomistically derived spectral density substantially broadens the region of efficient off-resonant excitation compared to the analytical model. The presented framework provides a nearly parameter-free route to simulate the non-Markovian open quantum dynamics in semiconductor quantum dots."

We further define relative Rota-Baxter operators on Lie group crossed modules. The well-known one-to-one correspondence between Lie 2-groups and crossed modules is extended to an equivalence between the respective relative Rota-Baxter operators on these two structures.

    "abstract": "Agent memory systems often adopt the standard Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline, yet its underlying assumptions differ in this setting. RAG targets large, heterogeneous corpora where retrieved passages are diverse, whereas agent memory is a bounded, coherent dialogue stream with highly correlated spans that are often duplicates. Under this shift, fixed top-$k$ similarity retrieval tends to return redundant context, and post-hoc pruning can delete temporally linked prerequisites needed for correct reasoning. We argue retrieval should move beyond similarity matching and instead operate over latent components, following decoupling to aggregation: disentangle memories into semantic components, organise them into a hierarchy, and use this structure to drive retrieval. We propose xMemory, which builds a hierarchy of intact units and maintains a searchable yet faithful high-level node organisation via a sparsity--semantics objective that guides memory split and merge. At inference, xMemory retrieves top-down, selecting a compact, diverse set of themes and semantics for multi-fact queries, and expanding to episodes and raw messages only when it reduces the reader's uncertainty. Experiments on LoCoMo and PerLTQA across the three latest LLMs show consistent gains in answer quality and token efficiency."

    "abstract": "Analogy is a central faculty of human intelligence, enabling abstract patterns discovered in one domain to be applied to another. Despite its central role in cognition, the mechanisms by which Transformers acquire and implement analogical reasoning remain poorly understood. In this work, inspired by the notion of functors in category theory, we formalize analogical reasoning as the inference of correspondences between entities across categories. Based on this formulation, we introduce synthetic tasks that evaluate the emergence of analogical reasoning under controlled settings. We find that the emergence of analogical reasoning is highly sensitive to data characteristics, optimization choices, and model scale. Through mechanistic analysis, we show that analogical reasoning in Transformers decomposes into two key components: (1) geometric alignment of relational structure in the embedding space, and (2) the application of a functor within the Transformer. These mechanisms enable models to transfer relational structure from one category to another, realizing analogy. Finally, we quantify these effects and find that the same trends are observed in pretrained LLMs. In doing so, we move analogy from an abstract cognitive notion to a concrete, mechanistically grounded phenomenon in modern neural networks."

Thermal-acoustic oscillations were eliminated by replacing the original G10 cooldown-valve stem with a stainless-steel stem fitted with wipers. A newly developed Python script automated acquisition of ACNET data, performed real-time heat-load calculations, and generated plots and tables that were posted to the electronic logbook within minutes, vastly reducing manual effort and accelerating feedback between SRF and cryogenics teams. Analysis showed that JT heat-exchanger effectiveness and temperature stratification in the two-phase and relief piping strongly influence the observed loads and helped isolate sources of excess heat. The campaign demonstrates that rigorous pre-test planning, real-time diagnostics, and automated reporting can improve both accuracy and efficiency, providing a template for future PIP-II cryomodule tests and for implementing targeted heat-load mitigations."

    "abstract": "Recent advances in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) have shifted from simple vector similarity to structure-aware approaches like HippoRAG, which leverage Knowledge Graphs (KGs) and Personalized PageRank (PPR) to capture multi-hop dependencies. However, these methods suffer from a \"Static Graph Fallacy\": they rely on fixed transition probabilities determined during indexing. This rigidity ignores the query-dependent nature of edge relevance, causing semantic drift where random walks are diverted into high-degree \"hub\" nodes before reaching critical downstream evidence. Consequently, models often achieve high partial recall but fail to retrieve the complete evidence chain required for multi-hop queries. To address this, we propose CatRAG, Context-Aware Traversal for robust RAG, a framework that builds on the HippoRAG 2 architecture and transforms the static KG into a query-adaptive navigation structure. We introduce a multi-faceted framework to steer the random walk: (1) Symbolic Anchoring, which injects weak entity constraints to regularize the random walk; (2) Query-Aware Dynamic Edge Weighting, which dynamically modulates graph structure, to prune irrelevant paths while amplifying those aligned with the query's intent; and (3) Key-Fact Passage Weight Enhancement, a cost-efficient bias that structurally anchors the random walk to likely evidence. Experiments across four multi-hop benchmarks demonstrate that CatRAG consistently outperforms state of the art baselines. Our analysis reveals that while standard Recall metrics show modest gains, CatRAG achieves substantial improvements in reasoning completeness, the capacity to recover the entire evidence path without gaps. These results reveal that our approach effectively bridges the gap between retrieving partial context and enabling fully grounded reasoning.

Existing studies mostly focus on CI adoption in general-purpose software, providing limited insight into mobile-specific dynamics, such as app store visibility and user engagement. In this paper, we analyze open-source Android apps to (1) compare CI adopters and non-adopters, (2) characterize adoption patterns using activity and bug metrics, and (3) assess pre/post adoption changes and user-facing outcomes. We observe that CI adopters are larger and more active, with faster and more regular releases. CI adoption is concentrated in integration- and reliability-intensive categories (e.g., finance and productivity) and is associated with higher Google Play Store engagement (more downloads and reviews) without lower ratings. Overall, CI adoption aligns with practices that support sustained delivery, higher project visibility, and stronger user engagement in mobile ecosystems."

    "abstract": "We consider deep multivariate models for heterogeneous collections of random variables. In the context of computer vision, such collections may e.g. consist of images, segmentations, image attributes, and latent variables. When developing such models, most existing works start from an application task and design the model components and their dependencies to meet the needs of the chosen task. This has the disadvantage of limiting the applicability of the resulting model for other downstream tasks. Here, instead, we propose to represent the joint probability distribution by means of conditional probability distributions for each group of variables conditioned on the rest. Such models can then be used for practically any possible downstream task. Their learning can be approached as training a parametrised Markov chain kernel by maximising the data likelihood of its limiting distribution. This has the additional advantage of allowing a wide range of semi-supervised learning scenarios."

Previous studies using multi-scale features in clinical applications rely on multiple inputs across magnifications with late feature fusion, which does not retain the link between features across scales while the inputs are dependent on arbitrary, manufacturer-defined magnifications, being inflexible and computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose the Multi-scale Pyramidal Network (MSPN), which is plug-and-play over attention-based MIL that introduces progressive multi-scale analysis on WSI. Our MSPN consists of (1) grid-based remapping that uses high magnification features to derive coarse features and (2) the coarse guidance network (CGN) that learns coarse contexts. We benchmark MSPN as an add-on module to 4 attention-based frameworks using 4 clinically relevant tasks across 3 types of foundation model, as well as the pre-trained MIL framework. We show that MSPN consistently improves MIL across the compared configurations and tasks, while being lightweight and easy-to-use."

    "abstract": "Extremely Large-scale MIMO (XL-MIMO) systems operating in Near-Field (NF) introduce new degrees of freedom for accurate source localisation, but make dense arrays impractical. Sparse or distributed arrays can reduce hardware complexity while maintaining high resolution, yet sub-Nyquist spatial sampling introduces aliasing artefacts in the localisation ambiguity function. This paper presents a unified framework to jointly characterise resolution and aliasing in NF localisation and study the trade-off between the two. Leveraging the concept of local chirp spatial frequency, we derive analytical expressions linking array geometry and sampling density to the spatial bandwidth of the received field. We introduce two geometric tools--Critical Antenna Elements (CAEs) and the Non-Contributive Zone (NCZ)--to intuitively identify how individual antennas contribute to resolution and/or aliasing. Our analysis reveals that resolution and aliasing are not always strictly coupled, e.g., increasing the array aperture can improve resolution without necessarily aggravating aliasing. These results provide practical guidelines for designing NF arrays that optimally balance resolution and aliasing, supporting efficient XL-MIMO deployment."

    "abstract": "Autoregressive learning of time-stepping operators offers an effective approach to data-driven PDE simulation on grids. For conservation laws, however, long-horizon rollouts are often destabilized when learned updates violate global conservation and, in many applications, additional state bounds such as nonnegative mass and densities or concentrations constrained to [0,1]. Enforcing these coupled constraints via direct next-state regression remains difficult. We introduce a framework for learning conservative transport operators on regular grids, inspired by lattice Boltzmann-style discrete-velocity transport representations. Instead of predicting the next state, the model outputs local transport operators that update cells through neighborhood exchanges, guaranteeing discrete conservation by construction. For bounded quantities, we parameterize transport within a capacity-constrained feasible set, enforcing bounds structurally rather than by post-hoc clipping. We validate FluxNet on 1D convection-diffusion, 2D shallow water equations, 1D traffic flow, and 2D spinodal decomposition. Experiments on shallow-water equations and traffic flow show improved rollout stability and physical consistency over strong baselines. On phase-field spinodal decomposition, the method enables large time-steps with long-range transport, accelerating simulation while preserving microstructure evolution in both pointwise and statistical measures."

    "abstract": "Matter is the most recent application-layer standard for the Internet of Things (IoT). As one of its major selling points, Matter's design imposes particular attention to security and privacy: it provides validated secure session establishment protocols, and it uses robust security algorithms to secure communications between IoT devices and Matter controllers. However, to our knowledge, there is no systematic analysis investigating the extent to which a passive attacker, in possession of lower layer keys or exploiting security misconfiguration at those layers, could infer information by passively analyzing encrypted Matter traffic. In this paper, we fill this gap by analyzing the robustness of the Matter IoT standard to encrypted traffic analysis performed by a passive eavesdropper. By using various datasets collected from real-world testbeds and simulated setups, we identify patterns in metadata of the encrypted Matter traffic that allow inferring the specific interactions occurring between end devices and controllers. Moreover, we associate patterns in sequences of interactions to specific types of IoT devices. These patterns can be used to create fingerprints that allow a passive attacker to infer the type of devices used in the network, constituting a serious breach of users privacy. Our results reveal that we can identify specific Matter interactions that occur in encrypted traffic with over $95\\%$ accuracy also in the presence of packet losses and delays. Moreover, we can identify Matter device types with a minimum accuracy of $88\\%$. The CSA acknowledged our findings, and expressed the willingness to address such vulnerabilities in the next releases of the standard."

We study resampling strategies tailored to ISO 5725 data and extend a bias-correction idea to obtain simple adjusted point estimators and confidence intervals for the variance components. Using extensive simulations that mirror realistic study sizes and variance ratios, we evaluate accuracy, stability, and coverage, and we contrast the resampling-based procedures with ANOVA-based estimators and common approximate intervals. The results yield a clear division of labor: adjusted within-laboratory resampling provides accurate and stable point estimation in small-to-moderate designs, whereas a two-stage strategy-resampling laboratories and then resampling within each-paired with bias-corrected and accelerated intervals offers the most reliable (near-nominal or conservative) confidence intervals. Performance degrades under extreme designs, such as very small samples or dominant between-laboratory variation, clarifying when additional caution is warranted. A case study from an ISO 5725-4 dataset illustrates how the recommended procedures behave in practice and how they compare with ANOVA and approximate methods. We conclude with concrete guidance for implementing resampling-based precision analysis in interlaboratory studies: use adjusted within-laboratory resampling for point estimation, and adopt the two-stage strategy with bias-corrected and accelerated intervals for interval estimation."

We propose \\textbf{PIMPC-GNN}, a physics-informed multi-phase consensus framework for imbalanced node classification. Our method integrates three complementary dynamics: (i) thermodynamic diffusion, which spreads minority labels to capture long-range dependencies, (ii) Kuramoto synchronisation, which aligns minority nodes through oscillatory consensus, and (iii) spectral embedding, which separates classes via structural regularisation. These perspectives are combined through class-adaptive ensemble weighting and trained with an imbalance-aware loss that couples balanced cross-entropy with physics-based constraints. Across five benchmark datasets and imbalance ratios from 5-100, PIMPC-GNN outperforms 16 state-of-the-art baselines, achieving notable gains in minority-class recall (up to +12.7\\%) and balanced accuracy (up to +8.3\\%). Beyond empirical improvements, the framework also provides interpretable insights into consensus dynamics in graph learning. The code is available at \\texttt{https://github.com/afofanah/PIMPC-GNN}."

    "abstract": "As the foundation of closed-loop training and evaluation in autonomous driving, traffic simulation still faces two fundamental challenges: covariate shift introduced by open-loop imitation learning and limited capacity to reflect the multimodal behaviors observed in real-world traffic. Although recent frameworks such as RIFT have partially addressed these issues through group-relative optimization, their forward simulation procedures remain largely non-reactive, leading to unrealistic agent interactions within the virtual domain and ultimately limiting simulation fidelity. To address these issues, we propose ForSim, a stepwise closed-loop forward simulation paradigm. At each virtual timestep, the traffic agent propagates the virtual candidate trajectory that best spatiotemporally matches the reference trajectory through physically grounded motion dynamics, thereby preserving multimodal behavioral diversity while ensuring intra-modality consistency. Other agents are updated with stepwise predictions, yielding coherent and interaction-aware evolution. When incorporated into the RIFT traffic simulation framework, ForSim operates in conjunction with group-relative optimization to fine-tune traffic policy. Extensive experiments confirm that this integration consistently improves safety while maintaining efficiency, realism, and comfort. These results underscore the importance of modeling closed-loop multimodal interactions within forward simulation and enhance the fidelity and reliability of traffic simulation for autonomous driving.

    "abstract": "Smart-home sensor data holds significant potential for several applications, including healthcare monitoring and assistive technologies. Existing approaches, however, face critical limitations. Supervised models require impractical amounts of labeled data. Foundation models for activity recognition focus only on inertial sensors, failing to address the unique characteristics of smart-home binary sensor events: their sparse, discrete nature combined with rich semantic associations. LLM-based approaches, while tested in this domain, still raise several issues regarding the need for natural language descriptions or prompting, and reliance on either external services or expensive hardware, making them infeasible in real-life scenarios due to privacy and cost concerns. We introduce DomusFM, the first foundation model specifically designed and pretrained for smart-home sensor data. DomusFM employs a self-supervised dual contrastive learning paradigm to capture both token-level semantic attributes and sequence-level temporal dependencies. By integrating semantic embeddings from a lightweight language model and specialized encoders for temporal patterns and binary states, DomusFM learns generalizable representations that transfer across environments and tasks related to activity and event analysis. Through leave-one-dataset-out evaluation across seven public smart-home datasets, we demonstrate that DomusFM outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on different downstream tasks, achieving superior performance even with only 5% of labeled training data available for fine-tuning. Our approach addresses data scarcity while maintaining practical deployability for real-world smart-home systems."

    "abstract": "Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are plagued by exorbitant inference costs attributable to the profusion of visual tokens within the vision encoder. The redundant visual tokens engenders a substantial computational load and key-value (KV) cache footprint bottleneck. Existing approaches focus on token-wise optimization, leveraging diverse intricate token pruning techniques to eliminate non-crucial visual tokens. Nevertheless, these methods often unavoidably undermine the integrity of the KV cache, resulting in failures in long-text generation tasks. To this end, we conduct an in-depth investigation towards the attention mechanism of the model from a new perspective, and discern that attention within more than half of all decode layers are semantic similar. Upon this finding, we contend that the attention in certain layers can be streamlined by inheriting the attention from their preceding layers. Consequently, we propose Lazy Attention, an efficient attention mechanism that enables cross-layer sharing of similar attention patterns. It ingeniously reduces layer-wise redundant computation in attention. In Lazy Attention, we develop a novel layer-shared cache, Q Cache, tailored for MLLMs, which facilitates the reuse of queries across adjacent layers. In particular, Q Cache is lightweight and fully compatible with existing inference frameworks, including Flash Attention and KV cache. Additionally, our method is highly flexible as it is orthogonal to existing token-wise techniques and can be deployed independently or combined with token pruning approaches. Empirical evaluations on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method can reduce KV cache usage by over 35% and achieve 1.5x throughput improvement, while sacrificing only approximately 1% of performance on various MLLMs. Compared with SOTA token-wise methods, our technique achieves superior accuracy preservation."

We propose a method that can learn tasks even in the absence of the ground truth labels for some of the tasks. We also provide a detailed analysis of the proposed method. An interesting finding is related to the interaction of the tasks. We show a methodology to find out which tasks can improve the performance of other tasks.

Our methodology employed an initial selection based on photometric colours, followed by spectral energy distribution fitting to both stellar atmospheric models and high-redshift galaxy templates. This approach yielded two robust T dwarf candidates and one possible L subdwarf candidate. The T dwarfs have estimated Galactic heights of 0.43 and 0.86 kpc, likely residing near the outer edges of the Galactic thin and thick discs, respectively. We measure a T dwarf surface number density of 0.094 per squared arcmin in the UNCOVER field, lower than previous predictions but consistent at the order-of-magnitude level. We also provide space number density estimates for T5-T8.9 dwarfs across different effective temperature and spectral type bins, finding that T5-T7 dwarfs out to 2 kpc have significantly lower densities than their solar neighbourhood counterparts, whilst T8 dwarfs within the thick disc exhibit densities comparable to local values. Our analysis demonstrates that broad-band near- to mid-infrared photometry provides high sensitivity to late-T dwarfs but is relatively less sensitive to L and early-T dwarfs. Spectroscopy is typically required to distinguish photometric candidates of L dwarfs, early-T subdwarfs, and high-redshift galaxies in JWST deep fields. This study demonstrates the potential for expanding our understanding of brown dwarf distributions and characteristics at unprecedented distances, offering new insights into substellar populations beyond the solar neighbourhood."

Yet, their effectiveness remains limited by deficiencies in robust long-term memory, particularly in complex, long-term web-based services such as online emotional support. However, existing long-term dialogue benchmarks primarily focus on static and explicit fact retrieval, failing to evaluate agents in critical scenarios where user information is dispersed, implicit, and continuously evolving. To address this gap, we introduce ES-MemEval, a comprehensive benchmark that systematically evaluates five core memory capabilities: information extraction, temporal reasoning, conflict detection, abstention, and user modeling, in long-term emotional support settings, covering question answering, summarization, and dialogue generation tasks. To support the benchmark, we also propose EvoEmo, a multi-session dataset for personalized long-term emotional support that captures fragmented, implicit user disclosures and evolving user states. Extensive experiments on open-source long-context, commercial, and retrieval-augmented (RAG) LLMs show that explicit long-term memory is essential for reducing hallucinations and enabling effective personalization. At the same time, RAG improves factual consistency but struggles with temporal dynamics and evolving user states. These findings highlight both the potential and limitations of current paradigms and motivate more robust integration of memory and retrieval for long-term personalized dialogue systems."

To address this gap, we explicitly represent charging infrastructure and its costs in a cost minimizing European energy system model, allowing uncontrolled charging, V1G, and V2G to compete. We find that V1G captures the majority of system cost savings, amounting to 19 to 42 billion euros per year, or 2.2 to 4.5 percent, and substantially reduces infrastructure requirements. V2G provides more limited system cost savings of up to 2.5 billion euros per year, but generates substantial balancing market revenues of around 6.4 billion euros per year. V2G deployment is most cost effective in photovoltaic dominated systems and in scenarios with limited grid expansion, where combined solar and wind generation is relatively scarce. Charging infrastructure requirements vary across countries, reflecting either utilization maximization or flexibility maximization. This indicates that uniform EU targets risk overestimating infrastructure needs in some regions while constraining the benefits of smart charging in others."

Using onboard measurement data, we estimate and compensate for VIO drift through a novel mathematical drift model. State-of-the-art approaches often rely on more complex hardware (e.g., stereo cameras or rangefinders) and use uncorrected drifting VIO velocities, orientation, and angular rates, leading to errors during fast maneuvers. In contrast, our method corrects all VIO states (position, orientation, linear and angular velocity), resulting in accurate state estimation even during rapid and dynamic motion. Our approach was thoroughly validated through 1600 simulations and numerous real-world experiments. Furthermore, we applied the proposed method in the A2RL Drone Racing Challenge 2025, where our team advanced to the final four out of 210 teams and earned a medal."

We show that correct treatment of dark shunt resistance and emphasizing shifted current (J + Jsc) during fitting enhances prediction accuracy at low to intermediate illumination level. Additionally, we analyze the information content of various input JV curve combinations, demonstrating that including at least one illuminated JV, preferably not under high illumination due to series resistance effects, is critical for reliable parameter estimation and device performance prediction."

Furthermore, we employ a normalized additive fusion strategy that aligns the latent distributions of spatial and temporal features, preventing the destructive interference common in standard implementations.

    "abstract": "In multimodal misinformation, deception usually arises not just from pixel-level manipulations in an image, but from the semantic and contextual claim jointly expressed by the image-text pair. Yet most deepfake detectors, engineered to detect pixel-level forgeries, do not account for claim-level meaning, despite their growing integration in automated fact-checking (AFC) pipelines. This raises a central scientific and practical question: Do pixel-level detectors contribute useful signal for verifying image-text claims, or do they instead introduce misleading authenticity priors that undermine evidence-based reasoning? We provide the first systematic analysis of deepfake detectors in the context of multimodal misinformation detection. Using two complementary benchmarks, MMFakeBench and DGM4, we evaluate: (1) state-of-the-art image-only deepfake detectors, (2) an evidence-driven fact-checking system that performs tool-guided retrieval via Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and engages in deliberative inference through Multi-Agent Debate (MAD), and (3) a hybrid fact-checking system that injects detector outputs as auxiliary evidence. Results across both benchmark datasets show that deepfake detectors offer limited standalone value, achieving F1 scores in the range of 0.26-0.53 on MMFakeBench and 0.33-0.49 on DGM4, and that incorporating their predictions into fact-checking pipelines consistently reduces performance by 0.04-0.08 F1 due to non-causal authenticity assumptions. In contrast, the evidence-centric fact-checking system achieves the highest performance, reaching F1 scores of approximately 0.81 on MMFakeBench and 0.55 on DGM4. Overall, our findings demonstrate that multimodal claim verification is driven primarily by semantic understanding and external evidence, and that pixel-level artifact signals do not reliably enhance reasoning over real-world image-text misinformation."

    "abstract": "Current agentic frameworks underperform on long-horizon tasks. As reasoning depth increases, sequential orchestration becomes brittle, context windows impose hard limits that degrade performance, and opaque execution traces make failures difficult to localize or debug. We introduce ROMA (Recursive Open Meta-Agents), a domain-agnostic framework that addresses these limitations through recursive task decomposition and structured aggregation. ROMA decomposes goals into dependency-aware subtask trees that can be executed in parallel, while aggregation compresses and validates intermediate results to control context growth. Our framework standardizes agent construction around four modular roles --Atomizer (which decides whether a task should be decomposed), Planner, Executor, and Aggregator -- which cleanly separate orchestration from model selection and enable transparent, hierarchical execution traces. This design supports heterogeneous multi-agent systems that mix models and tools according to cost, latency, and capability. To adapt ROMA to specific tasks without fine-tuning, we further introduce GEPA$+$, an improved Genetic-Pareto prompt proposer that searches over prompts within ROMA's component hierarchy while preserving interface contracts. We show that ROMA, combined with GEPA+, delivers leading system-level performance on reasoning and long-form generation benchmarks. On SEAL-0, which evaluates reasoning over conflicting web evidence, ROMA instantiated with GLM-4.6 improves accuracy by 9.9\\% over Kimi-Researcher. On EQ-Bench, a long-form writing benchmark, ROMA enables DeepSeek-V3 to match the performance of leading closed-source models such as Claude Sonnet 4.5. Our results demonstrate that recursive, modular agent architectures can scale reasoning depth while remaining interpretable, flexible, and model-agnostic."

Since such monitoring requires sensitive user data (e.g., ethnicity), the AI Act permits its processing only with strict privacy measures, such as multi-party computation (MPC), in compliance with the GDPR. However, the effectiveness of such secure monitoring protocols ultimately depends on people's willingness to share their data. Little is known about how different MPC protocol designs shape user acceptance. To address this, we conducted an online survey with 833 participants in Europe, examining user acceptance of various MPC protocol designs for fairness monitoring. Findings suggest that users prioritized risk-related attributes (e.g., privacy protection mechanism) in direct evaluation but benefit-related attributes (e.g., fairness objective) in simulated choices, with acceptance shaped by their fairness and privacy orientations. We derive implications for deploying and communicating privacy-preserving protocols in ways that foster informed consent and align with user expectations."

To explore this challenge, we introduce Cloth Dynamics Grounding (CDG), a novel scenario for unsupervised learning of cloth dynamics from multi-view visual observations. We further propose Cloth Dynamics Splatting (CloDS), an unsupervised dynamic learning framework designed for CDG. CloDS adopts a three-stage pipeline that first performs video-to-geometry grounding and then trains a dynamics model on the grounded meshes. To cope with large non-linear deformations and severe self-occlusions during grounding, we introduce a dual-position opacity modulation that supports bidirectional mapping between 2D observations and 3D geometry via mesh-based Gaussian splatting in video-to-geometry grounding stage. It jointly considers the absolute and relative position of Gaussian components. Comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that CloDS effectively learns cloth dynamics from visual data while maintaining strong generalization capabilities for unseen configurations.

Most test-time scaling (TTS) algorithms rely on autoregressive decoding, which is ill-suited to discrete diffusion language models (dLLMs) due to their parallel decoding over the entire sequence. As a result, developing effective and efficient TTS methods to unlock dLLMs' full generative potential remains an underexplored challenge. To address this, we propose Prism (Pruning, Remasking, and Integrated Self-verification Method), an efficient TTS framework for dLLMs that (i) performs Hierarchical Trajectory Search (HTS) which dynamically prunes and reallocates compute in an early-to-mid denoising window, (ii) introduces Local branching with partial remasking to explore diverse implementations while preserving high-confidence tokens, and (iii) replaces external verifiers with Self-Verified Feedback (SVF) obtained via self-evaluation prompts on intermediate completions. Across four mathematical reasoning and code generation benchmarks on three dLLMs, including LLaDA 8B Instruct, Dream 7B Instruct, and LLaDA 2.0-mini, our Prism achieves a favorable performance-efficiency trade-off, matching best-of-N performance with substantially fewer function evaluations (NFE).

However, their deployment in long-context scenarios is hindered by two challenges: computational inefficiency and redundant information. We propose RAM (Read As HuMan), a context compression framework that adopts an adaptive hybrid reading strategy, to address these challenges. Inspired by human reading behavior (i.e., close reading important content while skimming less relevant content), RAM partitions the context into segments and encodes them with the input query in parallel. High-relevance segments are fully retained (close reading), while low-relevance ones are query-guided compressed into compact summary vectors (skimming). Both explicit textual segments and implicit summary vectors are concatenated and fed into decoder to achieve both superior performance and natural language format interpretability. To refine the decision boundary between close reading and skimming, we further introduce a contrastive learning objective based on positive and negative query-segment pairs. Experiments demonstrate that RAM outperforms existing baselines on multiple question answering and summarization benchmarks across two backbones, while delivering up to a 12x end-to-end speedup on long inputs (average length 16K; maximum length 32K)."

Using $^{238}$U and $^{239}$Pu as target nuclei, we determine the optimal model parameters based on the convergence behavior of the average cross sections. The statistical uncertainty of the probability tables is examined as a function of the number of ladders.

Based on this observation, Hyperbolic Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) have been widely adopted as a principled choice for representation learning on tree-like graphs. In this work, we question this paradigm by proposing an additional condition of geometry-task alignment, i.e., whether the metric structure of the target follows that of the input graph. We theoretically and empirically demonstrate the capability of HGNNs to recover low-distortion representations on two synthetic regression problems, and show that their geometric inductive bias becomes helpful when the problem requires preserving metric structure. Additionally, we evaluate HGNNs on the tasks of link prediction and node classification by jointly analyzing predictive performance and embedding distortion, revealing that only link prediction is geometry-aligned. Overall, our findings shift the focus from only asking \"Is the graph hyperbolic?\" to also questioning \"Is the task aligned with hyperbolic geometry?\", showing that HGNNs consistently outperform Euclidean models under such alignment, while their advantage vanishes otherwise."

This has motivated the use of LLMs offline to improve retrieval, ranking, and recommendation models. Existing solutions typically fine-tune separate LLMs for individual tasks such as query-ad relevance labeling, keyword-based query generation, and user profiling. This results in redundant models, high maintenance cost, and limited performance gains despite substantial overlap in domain knowledge and reasoning patterns. We introduce AdNanny, a unified reasoning-centric LLM that serves as a shared backbone for offline advertising tasks. AdNanny is obtained by fine-tuning a public 671B-parameter DeepSeek-R1 checkpoint using a scalable training system that supports hybrid dense-MoE parallelism. We construct reasoning-augmented corpora that pair structured supervision with step-by-step natural language explanations. A multi-task supervised fine-tuning stage with adaptive reweighting enables AdNanny to handle diverse labeling and generation tasks in a consistent reasoning format. This is followed by reinforcement learning using downstream advertising metrics to align model behavior with online retrieval and ranking objectives. AdNanny is deployed in production within Bing Ads, where it significantly reduces manual labeling effort and improves accuracy across multiple offline tasks. By consolidating many task-specific models into a single reasoning-centric foundation model, AdNanny provides a scalable and cost-effective solution for large-scale advertising systems."

Based on these constraints, we propose a protograph template tailored for two-block BFCs.

The resulting codes effectively bridge the gap between diversityoriented and capacity-oriented designs, exhibiting robust performance across both channel environments."

    "abstract": "The spatial topography of brain functional organization is increasingly recognized to play an important role in cognition and disease. Accounting for individual differences in functional topography is also crucial for accurately distinguishing spatial and temporal aspects of brain organization. Yet, accurate estimation of individual functional brain networks from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) without extensive scanning remains challenging, due to low signal-to-noise ratio. Here, we describe Bayesian brain mapping (BBM), a technique for individual functional topography and connectivity leveraging population information. Population-derived priors for both spatial topography and functional connectivity based on existing spatial templates, such as parcellations or continuous network maps, are used to guide subject-level estimation and combat noise. BBM is highly flexible, avoiding strong spatial or temporal constraints and allowing for overlap between networks and heterogeneous patterns of engagement. Unlike multi-subject hierarchical models, BBM is designed for single-subject analysis, making it highly computationally efficient and translatable to clinical settings. Here, we describe the BBM model and illustrate the use of the BayesBrainMap R package to construct population-derived priors, fit the model, and perform inference to identify engagements. A demo is provided in an accompanying Github repo. We also share priors derived from the Human Connectome Project database and provide code to support the construction of priors from different data sources, lowering the barrier to adoption of BBM for studies of individual brain organization."

In this Works-in-Progress paper, we argue that the static nature of security cues represents a design mismatch with transitional human lives. We draw on prior empirical insights from work on educational migration as a motivating case, and extend the discussion to other life transitions. Building on these insights, we introduce the Transition-Aware Security Cues (TASeC) framework and present speculative design concepts illustrating how security cues might evolve across transition stages.

Current approaches primarily scale Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in the text space, even when language alone is insufficient for clear and structured reasoning, and largely neglect visual reasoning mechanisms analogous to the human visuospatial sketchpad and visual imagery. To mitigate this deficiency, we introduce Cognitive Supersensing, a novel training paradigm that endows MLLMs with human-like visual imagery capabilities by integrating a Latent Visual Imagery Prediction (LVIP) head that jointly learns sequences of visual cognitive latent embeddings and aligns them with the answer, thereby forming vision-based internal reasoning chains. We further introduce a reinforcement learning stage that optimizes text reasoning paths based on this grounded visual latent. To evaluate the cognitive capabilities of MLLMs, we present CogSense-Bench, a comprehensive visual question answering (VQA) benchmark assessing five cognitive dimensions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MLLMs trained with Cognitive Supersensing significantly outperform state-of-the-art baselines on CogSense-Bench and exhibit superior generalization on out-of-domain mathematics and science VQA benchmarks, suggesting that internal visual imagery is potentially key to bridging the gap between perceptual recognition and cognitive understanding.

At inference time, the agent intervenes only when a calibrated probability of user acceptance exceeds a threshold derived from asymmetric costs of missed help and false alarms. Inspired by festina lente (Latin: \"make haste slowly\"), we gate by an acceptance-calibrated, cost-derived threshold and invoke a resource-intensive Slow mode with counterfactual checks only near the decision boundary, concentrating computation on ambiguous and high-stakes cases. Training uses gate-aligned, schema-locked distillation: a teacher running the full PRISM pipeline provides dense, executable supervision on unlabeled interaction traces, while the student learns a response policy that is explicitly decoupled from the intervention gate to enable tunable and auditable control. On ProactiveBench, PRISM reduces false alarms by 22.78% and improves F1 by 20.14% over strong baselines. These results show that principled decision-theoretic gating, paired with selective slow reasoning and aligned distillation, yields proactive agents that are precise, computationally efficient, and controllable.

    "abstract": "Drawing supports learning by externalizing mental models, but providing timely feedback at scale remains challenging. We present Draw2Learn, a system that explores how AI can act as a supportive teammate during drawing-based learning. The design translates learning principles into concrete interaction patterns: AI generates structured drawing quests, provides optional visual scaffolds, monitors progress, and delivers multidimensional feedback. We collected formative user feedback during system development and open-ended comments. Feedback showed positive ratings for usability, usefulness, and user experience, with themes highlighting AI scaffolding value and learner autonomy. This work contributes a design framework for teammate-oriented AI in generative learning and identifies key considerations for future research."

    "abstract": "Sampling a quantum systems underlying probability distributions is an important computational task, e.g., for quantum advantage experiments and quantum Monte Carlo algorithms. Tensor networks are an invaluable tool for efficiently representing states of large quantum systems with limited entanglement. Algorithms for sampling one-dimensional (1D) tensor networks are well-established and utilized in several 1D tensor network methods. In this paper we introduce two novel sampling algorithms for two-dimensional (2D) isometric tensor network states (isoTNS) that can be viewed as extensions of algorithms for 1D tensor networks. The first algorithm we propose performs independent sampling and yields a single configuration together with its associated probability. The second algorithm employs a greedy search strategy to identify K high-probability configurations and their corresponding probabilities. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of these algorithms across quantum states with varying entanglement and system size."

    "abstract": "Entropic optimal transport (EOT) in continuous spaces with quadratic cost is a classical tool for solving the domain translation problem. In practice, recent approaches optimize a weak dual EOT objective depending on a single potential, but doing so is computationally not efficient due to the intractable log-partition term. Existing methods typically resolve this obstacle in one of two ways: by significantly restricting the transport family to obtain closed-form normalization (via Gaussian-mixture parameterizations), or by using general neural parameterizations that require simulation-based training procedures. We propose Variational Entropic Optimal Transport (VarEOT), based on an exact variational reformulation of the log-partition $\\log \\mathbb{E}[\\exp(\\cdot)]$ as a tractable minimization over an auxiliary positive normalizer. This yields a differentiable learning objective optimized with stochastic gradients and avoids the necessity of MCMC simulations during the training. We provide theoretical guarantees, including finite-sample generalization bounds and approximation results under universal function approximation. Experiments on synthetic data and unpaired image-to-image translation demonstrate competitive or improved translation quality, while comparisons within the solvers that use the same weak dual EOT objective support the benefit of the proposed optimization principle."

We further show that RTRRL synergizes with a recent biologically inspired recurrent network model, the Liquid-Resistance Liquid-Capacitance RNN.

These methods rely on an adjustment based on the propensity score and explain how to handle the uncertainty concerning it when studying the posterior distribution of a treatment effect. We examine theoretically the asymptotic properties of the posterior distribution obtained and show that our proposed method, a generalized version of the 'Linked Bayesian Bootstrap', enjoys desirable frequentist properties. In addition, we show that the credible intervals have asymptotically the correct coverage properties. We discuss the applications of our method to mis-specified and singly-robust models in causal inference."

This frequency-based calibration avoids the geometric and electrostatic response functions that affect inductive sensors, such as fluxgates, search coils, and SQUID magnetometers. We demonstrate calibration of magnetic measurement using oscillating magnetic fields in the 300 Hz - 20 kHz range and a sensor noise floor of 15 fT.Hz-1/2.

Existing agent frameworks rely on rigid, syntax-heavy state representations such as nested JSON, which require models to devote a substantial portion of their limited attention to syntactic processing rather than semantic reasoning. In this paper, we propose Fat-Cat, a document-driven agent architecture that improves the signal-to-noise ratio of state management. By integrating three key components: (1) a Semantic File System that represents agent state as Markdown documents aligned with common pre-training corpora, (2) a Textual Strategy Evolution module that accumulates task-solving knowledge without parameter updates, and (3) a Closed-Loop Watcher that monitors reasoning trajectories to reduce hallucinations. Extensive reasoning, retrieval, and coding benchmarks, Fat-Cat consistently improves agent performance. It enables the Kimi-k2 model to outperform the proprietary GPT-4o baseline on HotPotQA. Replacing the document-based state with JSON leads to performance drop, while empirically validating the critical necessity of document-driven state modeling over rigid syntax.

We introduce **CardinalGraphFormer**, a graph transformer that incorporates Graphormer-inspired structural biases, including shortest-path distance and centrality, as well as direct-bond edge bias, within a structured sparse attention regime limited to shortest-path distance <= 3. The model further augments this design with a cardinality-preserving unnormalized aggregation channel over the same support set. Pretraining combines contrastive graph-level alignment with masked attribute reconstruction.

We deviate from the standard fixed summary size approach by implementing a block-wise accumulation strategy governed by a protection divisor (n).

Our experiments on the Babilong benchmark reveal performance degradation in previous compression methods by 15-30% on various long context tasks.

In this work, we investigate the possibility of IP theft via acoustic side channels and propose a novel method to protect 3D printers against such attacks.

This simple approach produces inverted noise with natural Gaussian properties while maintaining reconstruction fidelity. As a plug-and-play technique compatible with general diffusion models, our method achieves superior performance on public image datasets for reconstruction and interpolation tasks, providing a principled and efficient solution to diffusion model inversion."

In this paper, we study PCA in a double asymptotic regime where $n$ probability measures are observed, each through $m$ samples. We derive convergence rates of the form $n^{-1/2} + m^{-α}$ for the empirical covariance operator and the PCA excess risk, where $α>0$ depends on the chosen embedding. This characterizes the relationship between the number $n$ of measures and the number $m$ of samples per measure, revealing a sparse (small $m$) to dense (large $m$) transition in the convergence behavior. Moreover, we prove that the dense-regime rate is minimax optimal for the empirical covariance error. Our numerical experiments validate these theoretical rates and demonstrate that appropriate subsampling preserves PCA accuracy while reducing computational cost."

    "abstract": "Contemporary multi-agent systems increasingly rely on internal coordination mechanisms to combine, arbitrate, or constrain the outputs of heterogeneous components. In safety-critical and regulated domains such as finance, these mechanisms must satisfy strict formal requirements, remain auditable, and operate within explicitly bounded limits. Coordination logic therefore functions as a governance layer rather than an optimization heuristic. This paper presents an exploratory systems feasibility study of Self-Evolving Coordination Protocols (SECP): coordination protocols that permit limited, externally validated self-modification while preserving fixed formal invariants. We study a controlled proof-of-concept setting in which six fixed Byzantine consensus protocol proposals are evaluated by six specialized decision modules. All coordination regimes operate under identical hard constraints, including Byzantine fault tolerance (f < n/3), O(n2) message complexity, complete non-statistical safety and liveness arguments, and bounded explainability. Four coordination regimes are compared in a single-shot design: unanimous hard veto, weighted scalar aggregation, SECP v1.0 (an agent-designed non-scalar protocol), and SECP v2.0 (the result of one governed modification). Outcomes are evaluated using a single metric, proposal coverage, defined as the number of proposals accepted. A single recursive modification increased coverage from two to three accepted proposals while preserving all declared invariants. The study makes no claims regarding statistical significance, optimality, convergence, or learning. Its contribution is architectural: it demonstrates that bounded self-modification of coordination protocols is technically implementable, auditable, and analyzable under explicit formal constraints, establishing a foundation for governed multi-agent systems."

We propose a novel approach to Neural CDE path construction that replaces exact interpolation with Kernel and Gaussian Process (GP) smoothing, enabling explicit control over trajectory regularity. To recover details lost during smoothing, we propose an attention-based Multi-View CDE (MV-CDE) and its convolutional extension (MVC-CDE), which employ learnable queries to inform path reconstruction. This framework allows the model to distribute representational capacity across multiple trajectories, each capturing distinct temporal patterns.

Among various amodal sensing paradigms, wireless amodal sensing is a potential solution due to its advantages of environmental robustness, privacy preservation, and low cost. However, the sensing data obtained by wireless system is sparse for shape reconstruction because of the low spatial resolution, and this issue is further intensified in complex environments with occlusion. To address this issue, we propose a Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS)-aided wireless amodal sensing scheme that leverages a large-scale RIS to enhance the spatial resolution and create reflection paths that can bypass the obstacles. A generative learning model is also employed to reconstruct the complete shape based on the sensing data captured from the viewpoint of the RIS. In such a system, it is challenging to optimize the RIS phase shifts because the relationship between RIS phase shifts and amodal sensing accuracy is complex and the closed-form expression is unknown. To tackle this challenge, we develop an error prediction model that learns the mapping from RIS phase shifts to amodal sensing accuracy, and optimizes RIS phase shifts based on this mapping. Experimental results on the benchmark dataset show that our method achieves at least a 56.73% reduction in reconstruction error compared to conventional schemes under the same number of RIS configurations."

While it serves as a crucial paradigm for privacy-preserving learning, its security remains vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where malicious clients manipulate local training to inject targeted backdoors. Existing FSSL attack methods, however, often suffer from low utilization of poisoned samples, limited transferability, and weak persistence. To address these limitations, we propose a new backdoor attack method for FSSL, namely Hallucinated Positive Entanglement (HPE). HPE first employs hallucination-based augmentation using synthetic positive samples to enhance the encoder's embedding of backdoor features. It then introduces feature entanglement to enforce tight binding between triggers and backdoor samples in the representation space. Finally, selective parameter poisoning and proximity-aware updates constrain the poisoned model within the vicinity of the global model, enhancing its stability and persistence. Experimental results on several FSSL scenarios and datasets show that HPE significantly outperforms existing backdoor attack methods in performance and exhibits strong robustness under various defense mechanisms."

Across math (AIME24, AIME25, HMMT25) and code (LiveCodeBench) reasoning benchmarks, our models consistently outperform prompting and majority-voting baselines, often approaching or exceeding much larger models.

These objects remain relevant as they can serve as the progenitors of intermediate-mass black holes and they are also formidable chemical polluter candidates, as evidenced by the peculiar abundances seen across cosmic history. This work investigates merger-induced mass loss in extremely massive stars within a hydrodynamic framework and provides a prescription derived from the simulations to estimate both the mass loss and the outcome of the interaction. We adapted the 1D hydrodynamic, stellar structure, and evolution code MESA to simulate stellar inspirals. In our simulations, we considered stars of $>1000\\,\\rm M_{\\odot}$ with inspiraling companions of $<100$ M$_\\odot$; hence, with mass ratios of $<0.1$. As the inspiral progresses, the orbital energy of the system is lost through the hydrodynamic and gravitational drag forces. This energy gets deposited as thermal energy in the extremely massive star's envelope. We find that the total ejected mass is $\\sim$10-30$\\%$ of the system's mass. Our results point out that most of the energy deposited by the inspiral is used to eject mass. These findings demonstrate that merger-induced mass loss is non-negligible for the considered configurations. Thus, it is an important process to account for when investigating the formation of extremely massive stars and predicting their possible role throughout cosmic history."

Among existing methods, GPTQ has been widely adopted due to its efficiency; however, it neglects input statistics and inter-group correlations when determining group scales, leading to a mismatch with its goal of minimizing layer-wise reconstruction loss. In this work, we propose a two-stage optimization framework for group scales that explicitly minimizes the layer-wise reconstruction loss. In the first stage, performed prior to GPTQ, we initialize each group scale to minimize the group-wise reconstruction loss, thereby incorporating input statistics. In the second stage, we freeze the integer weights obtained via GPTQ and refine the group scales to minimize the layer-wise reconstruction loss. To this end, we employ the coordinate descent algorithm and derive a closed-form update rule, which enables efficient refinement without costly numerical optimization. Notably, our derivation incorporates the quantization errors from preceding layers to prevent error accumulation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method consistently enhances group-wise quantization, achieving higher accuracy with negligible overhead."

    "abstract": "Drug-induced toxicity remains a leading cause of failure in preclinical development and early clinical trials. Detecting adverse effects at an early stage is critical to reduce attrition and accelerate the development of safe medicines. Histopathological evaluation remains the gold standard for toxicity assessment, but it relies heavily on expert pathologists, creating a bottleneck for large-scale screening. To address this challenge, we introduce an AI-based anomaly detection framework for histopathological whole-slide images (WSIs) in rodent livers from toxicology studies. The system identifies healthy tissue and known pathologies (anomalies) for which training data is available. In addition, it can detect rare pathologies without training data as out-of-distribution (OOD) findings. We generate a novel dataset of pixelwise annotations of healthy tissue and known pathologies and use this data to fine-tune a pre-trained Vision Transformer (DINOv2) via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) in order to do tissue segmentation. Finally, we extract features for OOD detection using the Mahalanobis distance. To better account for class-dependent variability in histological data, we propose the use of class-specific thresholds. We optimize the thresholds using the mean of the false negative and false positive rates, resulting in only 0.16\\% of pathological tissue classified as healthy and 0.35\\% of healthy tissue classified as pathological. Applied to mouse liver WSIs with known toxicological findings, the framework accurately detects anomalies, including rare OOD morphologies. This work demonstrates the potential of AI-driven histopathology to support preclinical workflows, reduce late-stage failures, and improve efficiency in drug development."

At the far edge, ultra-low-cost microcontrollers can handle lightweight AI tasks, while intermediate edge devices provide local intelligence, and the cloud tier offers large-scale analytics, federated learning, model adaptation, and global identity management. The proposed architecture enables multi-protocols and technologies (WebSocket, MQTT, HTTP) compared to a versatile protocol (Zenoh) to transfer diverse bidirectional data across the tiers, offering a balance between computational challenges and latency requirements. Comparative implementations between these two architectures demonstrate the trade-offs between resource utilization and communication efficiency. The results show that TriCloudEdge can distribute computational challenges to address latency and privacy concerns. The work also presents tests of AI model adaptation on the far edge and the computational effort challenges under the prism of parallelism. This work offers a perspective on the practical continuum challenges of implementation aligned with recent research advances addressing challenges across the different cloud levels."

    "abstract": "Von Neumann entropy (VNE) is a fundamental quantity in quantum information theory and has recently been adopted in machine learning as a spectral measure of diversity for kernel matrices and kernel covariance operators. While maximizing VNE under constraints is well known in quantum settings, a principled analogue of the classical maximum entropy framework, particularly its decision theoretic and game theoretic interpretation, has not been explicitly developed for VNE in data driven contexts. In this paper, we extend the minimax formulation of the maximum entropy principle due to Grünwald and Dawid to the setting of von Neumann entropy, providing a game-theoretic justification for VNE maximization over density matrices and trace-normalized positive semidefinite operators. This perspective yields a robust interpretation of maximum VNE solutions under partial information and clarifies their role as least committed inferences in spectral domains. We then illustrate how the resulting Maximum VNE principle applies to modern machine learning problems by considering two representative applications, selecting a kernel representation from multiple normalized embeddings via kernel-based VNE maximization, and completing kernel matrices from partially observed entries. These examples demonstrate how the proposed framework offers a unifying information-theoretic foundation for VNE-based methods in kernel learning."

Our symmetry analysis demonstrates that, in contrast to monolayers, the reduced symmetry of heterobilayers enables coupling between conduction band spin subbands by an electric field. We establish the optical selection rules for all six high-symmetry stacking configurations. The microscopic mechanism of the effect is identified as the spin-orbit coupling induced mixing of Bloch states from different conduction bands, which generates a non-zero momentum matrix element between the spin-split states. It also leads to the linear-in-wavevector spin-dependent terms in the effective Hamiltonian, i.e., the Rashba effect. Our estimates show that the rate of electric-dipole spin-flip transitions exceeds by far that of the magnetic-dipole transitions in transition metal dichalcogenide heterobilayers."

However, running world models rely on hevay computational cost and memory footprint, making model quantization essential for efficient deployment. To date, the effects of post-training quantization (PTQ) on world models remain largely unexamined. In this work, we present a systematic empirical study of world model quantization using DINO-WM as a representative case, evaluating diverse PTQ methods under both weight-only and joint weight-activation settings. We conduct extensive experiments on different visual planning tasks across a wide range of bit-widths, quantization granularities, and planning horizons up to 50 iterations. Our results show that quantization effects in world models extend beyond standard accuracy and bit-width trade-offs: group-wise weight quantization can stabilize low-bit rollouts, activation quantization granularity yields inconsistent benefits, and quantization sensitivity is highly asymmetric between encoder and predictor modules. Moreover, aggressive low-bit quantization significantly degrades the alignment between the planning objective and task success, leading to failures that cannot be remedied by additional optimization. These findings reveal distinct quantization-induced failure modes in world model-based planning and provide practical guidance for deploying quantized world models under strict computational constraints.

In particular, we uncover how non-Hermiticity parameters can induce fractional topological phases--even in the presence of quantized topological invariants as predicted by conventional linear approaches. Crucially, these fractional phases are naturally explained within the framework of the equation of auxiliary eigenvalues, directly linking nonlinear spectral characteristics to the bulk-boundary correspondence. Our findings reveal novel emergent phenomena arising from the interplay between nonlinearity and non-Hermiticity, providing key insights for the design of topological insulators and the controlled manipulation of quantum edge states in the real world."

    "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) can elicit strong multi-step reasoning, yet it often encourages overly verbose traces. Moreover, naive length penalties in group-relative optimization can severely hurt accuracy. We attribute this failure to two structural issues: (i) Dilution of Length Baseline, where incorrect responses (with zero length reward) depress the group baseline and over-penalize correct solutions; and (ii) Difficulty-Penalty Mismatch, where a static penalty cannot adapt to problem difficulty, suppressing necessary reasoning on hard instances while leaving redundancy on easy ones. We propose Dynamic Decoupled Conditional Advantage (DDCA) to decouple efficiency optimization from correctness. DDCA computes length advantages conditionally within the correct-response cluster to eliminate baseline dilution, and dynamically scales the penalty strength using the group pass rate as a proxy for difficulty. Experiments on GSM8K, MATH500, AMC23, and AIME25 show that DDCA consistently improves the efficiency--accuracy trade-off relative to adaptive baselines, reducing generated tokens by approximately 60% on simpler tasks (e.g., GSM8K) versus over 20% on harder benchmarks (e.g., AIME25), thereby maintaining or improving accuracy.

This problem was formulated by Huet in the 1970s and shown undecidable by Loader in 2003 by reduction from lambda-definability. The present work provides a novel undecidability proof for higher-order beta-matching, in an effort to verify this result by means of a proof assistant. Rather than starting from lambda-definability, the presented proof encodes a restricted form of string rewriting as higher-order beta-matching. The particular approach is similar to Urzyczyn's undecidability result for intersection type inhabitation. The presented approach has several advantages. First, the proof is simpler to verify in full detail due to the simple form of rewriting systems, which serve as a starting point. Second, undecidability of the considered problem in string rewriting is already certified using the Coq proof assistant. As a consequence, we obtain a certified many-one reduction from the Halting Problem to higher-order beta-matching. Third, the presented approach identifies a uniform construction which shows undecidability of higher-order beta-matching, lambda-definability, and intersection type inhabitation. The presented undecidability proof is mechanized in the Coq proof assistant and contributed to the existing Coq Library of Undecidability Proofs."

This research presents an in-situ EEG study on how digital interpretive content modulate engagement during art viewing. Participants experienced three modalities: direct viewing of a Bruegel painting, a 180° immersive interpretive projection, and a regular, display-based interpretive video. Frontal EEG markers of motivational orientation, internal involvement, perceptual drive, and arousal were extracted using eyes-open baselines and Z-normalized contrasts. Results show modality-specific engagement profiles: display-based interpretive video induced high arousal and fast-band activity, immersive projections promoted calm, presence-oriented absorption, and original artworks reflected internally regulated engagement. These findings, relying on lightweight EEG sensing in an operational cultural environment, suggest that digital interpretive content affects engagement style rather than quantity. This paves the way for new multimodal sensing approaches and enables museums to optimize the modalities and content of their interpretive media."

We investigate the minimal flows and Ellis groups of definable groups over $ M_0 $ from the perspective of definable topological dynamics. This paper builds on the research initiated in \\cite{BY-APAL} and generalizes the main results thereof in two key ways: First, we extend the scope of these results from reductive algebraic groups to arbitrary definable groups. Second, we generalize the approach from $ p $-adically closed fields to $o$-minimal expansions of real closed fields. Let $G$ be a definable group over $M_0$, and let $B$ be a definably amenable component (see Definition \\ref{def-DAC}) of $G$. In a certain sense, $B$ can be regarded as a ``maximal definably amenable subgroup'' of $G$ (see Fact \\ref{fact-max-DA-subgroup}). The main conclusion of this paper is as follows: For any $M \\succ M_0$, the Ellis group of the universal definable flow of $G$ over $M$ is isomorphic to that of $B$ over $M$. In particular, the Ellis groups of the universal definable flow of $G$ are model-independent, as is the case for $B$ (see \\cite{CS-Definably-Amenable-NIP-Groups}).

To address these challenges, we propose FlowBypass, a novel and analytical framework grounded in Rectified Flow that constructs a bypass directly connecting inversion and reconstruction trajectories, thereby mitigating error accumulation without relying on feature manipulations. We provide a formal derivation of two trajectories, from which we obtain an approximate bypass formulation and its numerical solution, enabling seamless trajectory transitions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FlowBypass consistently outperforms state-of-the-art image editing methods, achieving stronger prompt alignment while preserving high-fidelity details in irrelevant regions."

Specifically, data owners may be concerned that the shared data may leak sensitive information about their customers' mobility patterns or business secrets, resulting in the failure of collaboration. This paper investigates how privacy-preserving mechanisms can foster data collaboration in such settings. We propose a game-theoretic framework to investigate data-sharing among transportation stakeholders, especially considering perturbation-based privacy-preserving mechanisms. Numerical studies demonstrate that lower data quality expectations can incentivize voluntary data sharing, improving transport-related welfare for both MAs and MPs.

In this work, we focus on performance guarantees for {the downlink of} cellular networks where we impose a hardcore (spatial) regulation on base station (BS) locations and evaluate {how BS scheduling (which controls which BSs can transmit at a given time) impacts performance}. Hardcore regulation is the simplest form of spatial regulation that enforces a minimal distance between any pair of transmitters in the network. Within this framework of spatial network calculus, we first provide an upper bound on the power of total interference for a spatially regulated cellular network, and then, identify the regimes where scheduling BSs yields {better} link-level rate guarantees compared to scenarios where base stations are always active. The hexagonal cellular network is analyzed as a special case. The results offer insights into what spatial regulations are needed, when to choose scheduling, and how to potentially reduce the network power consumption {to provide a certain target performance guarantee}."

Their performance is, however, limited by radiation induced degradation of the gain layer, primarily driven by acceptor removal. This study presents a systematic comparison of how the degradation evolves with different incident proton energies, using LGADs from Hamamatsu Photonics (HPK) and The Institute of Microelectronics of Barcelona (IMB-CNM) irradiated with 18 MeV, 24 MeV, 400 MeV and 23 GeV protons and fluences up to 2.5x10^15 p/cm2. Electrical characterization is used to extract the acceptor removal coefficients for different proton energies, whereas IR TCT measurements offer complementary insight into the gain evolution in LGADs after irradiation. Across all devices, lower energy protons induce stronger gain layer degradation, confirming expectations. However, 400 MeV protons consistently appear less damaging than both lower and higher energy protons, an unexpected deviation from a monotonic energy trend. Conversion of proton fluences to 1 MeV neutron-equivalent fluences reduces but does not eliminate these differences, indicating that the standard Non-Ionizing Energy Loss (NIEL) scaling does not fully account for the underlying defect formation mechanisms at different energies and requires revision when considering irradiation fields that contain a broader spectrum of particle types and energies."

This paper presents the Spatio-Temporal Transformer for Long Term Forecasting (STT-LTF ), an extended framework that advances beyond purely temporal analysis to integrate spatial context modeling with temporal sequence prediction. STT-LTF processes multi-scale spatial patches alongside temporal sequences (up to 20 years) through a unified transformer architecture, capturing both local neighborhood relationships and regional climate influences. The framework employs comprehensive self-supervised learning with spatial masking, temporal masking, and horizon sampling strategies, enabling robust model training from 40 years of unlabeled Landsat imagery. Unlike autoregressive approaches, STT-LTF directly predicts arbitrary future time points without error accumulation, incorporating spatial patch embeddings, cyclical temporal encoding, and geographic coordinates to learn complex dependencies across heterogeneous Mediterranean ecosystems. Experimental evaluation on Landsat data (1984-2024) demonstrates that STT-LTF achieves a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.0328 and R^2 of 0.8412 for next-year predictions, outperforming traditional statistical methods, CNN-based approaches, LSTM networks, and standard transformers. The framework's ability to handle irregular temporal sampling and variable prediction horizons makes it particularly suitable for analysis of heterogeneous landscapes experiencing rapid ecological transitions."

    "abstract": "Recent advances in large-scale language models (LLMs) have made multi-agent architectures attractive for challenging reasoning tasks. However, many existing systems rely on stochastic routing or ad-hoc heuristics, making their behavior difficult to reproduce and their decision process hard to interpret. We propose ORCH, a deterministic coordination framework for discrete-choice reasoning that orchestrates heterogeneous LLMs. ORCH follows a ``many analyses, one decision'' paradigm: multiple base models independently produce structured analyses, and a dedicated merge agent outputs the final choice. The framework uses fixed rules for task decomposition and answer aggregation, keeping the pipeline predictable, reproducible, and training-free. Determinism here refers to fixed routing and aggregation rules under a fixed evaluation protocol, rather than strict bit-level reproducibility across deployments. To exploit model complementarity, we optionally introduce an EMA-guided router that updates agent selection using historical accuracy, latency, or cost; since it relies on answer-based feedback, it is mainly intended for benchmarking, controlled evaluation, or delayed-feedback settings. Experiments on MMLU, MMLU-Pro, and GSM8K show that ORCH consistently outperforms single-model baselines and a majority-vote ensemble. On MMLU-Pro, ORCH improves accuracy by over 10 points compared to the strongest baseline, and on GSM8K it yields gains exceeding 50 points; McNemar tests confirm statistical significance. The EMA router provides an additional 0.7--2.0 point accuracy boost, and ablations show that both multi-agent collaboration and routing contribute substantially. Overall, ORCH offers a practical path toward controllable, interpretable, and deployment-ready LLM-based agent systems for discrete-choice reasoning."

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in source code understanding, yet as software systems grow in scale, computational efficiency has become a critical bottleneck. Currently, these models rely on a text-based paradigm that treats source code as a linear sequence of tokens, which leads to a linear increase in context length and associated computational costs. The rapid advancement of Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) introduces an opportunity to optimize efficiency by representing source code as rendered images. Unlike text, which is difficult to compress without losing semantic meaning, the image modality is inherently suitable for compression. By adjusting resolution, images can be scaled to a fraction of their original token cost while remaining recognizable to vision-capable models. To explore the feasibility of this approach, we conduct the first systematic study on the effectiveness of MLLMs for code understanding. Our experiments reveal that: (1) MLLMs can effectively understand code with substantial token reduction, achieving up to 8x compression; (2) MLLMs can effectively leverage visual cues such as syntax highlighting, improving code completion performance under 4x compression; and (3) Code-understanding tasks like clone detection exhibit exceptional resilience to visual compression, with some compression ratios even slightly outperforming raw text inputs. Our findings highlight both the potential and current limitations of MLLMs in code understanding, which points out a shift toward image-modality code representation as a pathway to more efficient inference."

To bridge this gap, we are the first to adopt a data-centric perspective to systematically investigate how data distribution impacts compression quality, including two dimensions: input data and intrinsic data (i.e., the model's internal pretrained knowledge). We evaluate the semantic integrity of compressed representations using an autoencoder-based framework to systematically investigate it. Our experimental results reveal that: (1) encoder-measured input entropy negatively correlates with compression quality, while decoder-measured entropy shows no significant relationship under a frozen-decoder setting; and (2) the gap between intrinsic data of the encoder and decoder significantly diminishes compression gains, which is hard to mitigate. Based on these findings, we further present practical guidelines to optimize compression gains."

    "abstract": "Stochastic gradient methods are central to large-scale learning, yet their analysis typically treats mini-batch gradients as unbiased estimators of the population gradient. In high-dimensional settings, however, classical results from statistical decision theory show that unbiased estimators are generally inadmissible under quadratic loss, suggesting that standard stochastic gradients may be suboptimal from a risk perspective. In this work, we formulate stochastic gradient computation as a high-dimensional estimation problem and introduce a decision-theoretic framework based on Stein-rule shrinkage. We construct a shrinkage gradient estimator that adaptively contracts noisy mini-batch gradients toward a stable restricted estimator derived from historical momentum. The shrinkage intensity is determined in a data-driven manner using an online estimate of gradient noise variance, leveraging second-moment statistics commonly maintained by adaptive optimization methods. Under a Gaussian noise model and for dimension p>=3, we show that the proposed estimator uniformly dominates the standard stochastic gradient under squared error loss and is minimax-optimal in the classical decision-theoretic sense. We further demonstrate how this estimator can be incorporated into the Adam optimizer, yielding a practical algorithm with negligible additional computational cost. Empirical evaluations on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100, across multiple levels of label noise, show consistent improvements over Adam in the large-batch regime. Ablation studies indicate that the gains arise primarily from selectively applying shrinkage to high-dimensional convolutional layers, while indiscriminate shrinkage across all parameters degrades performance. These results illustrate that classical shrinkage principles provide a principled and effective approach to improving stochastic gradient estimation in modern deep learning."

This approach is prone to overfitting and lacks generalizability across diverse species and experimental conditions. Here, we present DIA-CLIP, a pre-trained model shifting the DIA analysis paradigm from semi-supervised training to universal cross-modal representation learning. By integrating dual-encoder contrastive learning framework with encoder-decoder architecture, DIA-CLIP establishes a unified cross-modal representation for peptides and corresponding spectral features, achieving high-precision, zero-shot PSM inference. Extensive evaluations across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that DIA-CLIP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art tools, yielding up to a 45% increase in protein identification while achieving a 12% reduction in entrapment identifications. Moreover, DIA-CLIP holds immense potential for diverse practical applications, such as single-cell and spatial proteomics, where its enhanced identification depth facilitates the discovery of novel biomarkers and the elucidates of intricate cellular mechanisms."

Low-lying $S$-wave configurations of the $ss\\bar s\\bar s$ and $ssss\\bar s$ systems are investigated using the Gaussian Expansion Method (GEM) combined with the Complex Scaling Method (CSM), which allows for a unified treatment of bound, resonant, and scattering states. For tetraquarks, all possible configurations: meson-meson, diquark-antidiquark, and K-type structures, with complete color bases, are incorporated, while baryon-meson and diquark-diquark-antiquark configurations are considered for pentaquarks. Several weakly bound states and narrow resonances are identified in both sectors. In particular, a compact fully strange tetraquark with $J^P=1^+$ is found near $2.3\\,\\text{GeV}$, providing a natural interpretation of the $X(2300)$ resonance. Additional exotic states with dominant hidden-color and K-type components are predicted in the mass ranges $1.6-3.1$ GeV for tetraquarks and $2.6-3.2$ GeV for pentaquarks. The internal structure of these states is analyzed through their sizes, magnetic moments, and wave-function compositions, highlighting the essential role of channel coupling and exotic color configurations.

In this paper, we propose WorldCup, a multi-bit watermarking framework for LLMs that treats sampling as a natural communication channel and embeds message bits directly into token selection via a hierarchical competition mechanism guided by complementary signals. Moreover, WorldCup further adopts entropy-aware modulation to preserve generation quality and supports robust message recovery through confidence-aware decoding. Comprehensive experiments show that WorldCup achieves a strong balance across capacity, detectability, robustness, text quality, and decoding efficiency, consistently outperforming prior baselines and laying a solid foundation for future LLM watermarking studies."

Existing mitigations rely on static defenses that cannot adapt to novel exploitation strategies. We propose Adversarial Reward Auditing (ARA), a framework that reconceptualizes reward hacking as a dynamic, competitive game. ARA operates in two stages: first, a Hacker policy discovers reward model vulnerabilities while an Auditor learns to detect exploitation from latent representations; second, Auditor-Guided RLHF (AG-RLHF) gates reward signals to penalize detected hacking, transforming reward hacking from an unobservable failure into a measurable, controllable signal. Experiments across three hacking scenarios demonstrate that ARA achieves the best alignment-utility tradeoff among all baselines: reducing sycophancy to near-SFT levels while improving helpfulness, decreasing verbosity while achieving the highest ROUGE-L, and suppressing code gaming while improving Pass@1. Beyond single-domain evaluation, we show that reward hacking, detection, and mitigation all generalize across domains -- a Hacker trained on code gaming exhibits increased sycophancy despite no reward for this behavior, and an Auditor trained on one domain effectively suppresses exploitation in others, enabling efficient multi-domain defense with a single model."

A long-standing challenge is to connect microscopic cross-bridge dynamics to macroscopic observables while retaining an explicit, thermodynamically consistent energetic budget for chemical-to-mechanical transduction. Here we use the Energetic Variational Approach (EnVarA) to unify Hill's cycle-affinity viewpoint with Huxley's sliding-filament mechanics within a single thermodynamically closed framework. We formulate a three-state Fokker--Planck-jump description for cross-bridge populations evolving on state-dependent free-energy landscapes, in which ATP hydrolysis enters through local detailed balance and biases the transition rates. Filament sliding velocity is incorporated as a convective transport mechanism in the Fokker--Planck dynamics, so that mechanical power exchange with the external motion emerges transparently from the resulting energy-dissipation law together with chemical input and irreversible dissipation. Under chemostatted conditions and a fast-equilibration closure for the attached substates, the model reduces to a closed two-state molecular motor description; in a further singular limit, this reduction recovers a Huxley-type transport-reaction equation. Proof-of-concept simulations of the reduced model reproduce a Hill-like force-velocity relation and show how ATP availability modulates the force-velocity curve while preserving its characteristic Hill-type shape."

To address these challenges, we propose TAPTQ, a Tail-Aware Post-Training Quantization pipeline specifically engineered for 3D geometric learning. Our contribution is threefold: (1) To overcome the data-scale bottleneck in 3D datasets, we develop a progressive coarse-to-fine calibration construction strategy that constructs a highly compact subset to achieve both statistical purity and geometric representativeness. (2) We reformulate the quantization interval search as an optimization problem and introduce a ternary-search-based solver, reducing the computational complexity from $\\mathcal{O}(N)$ to $\\mathcal{O}(\\log N)$ for accelerated deployment. (3) To mitigate quantization error accumulation, we propose TRE-Guided Module-wise Compensation, which utilizes a Tail Relative Error (TRE) metric to adaptively identify and rectify distortions in modules sensitive to long-tailed activation outliers. Extensive experiments on the VGGT and Pi3 benchmarks demonstrate that TAPTQ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art PTQ methods in accuracy while significantly reducing calibration time.

To overcome the architectural limitations, we introduce the Physics-Informed Chebyshev Polynomial Neural Operator (CPNO), a novel mesh-free framework that leverages a basis transformation to replace unstable monomial expansions with the numerically stable Chebyshev spectral basis. By integrating parameter dependent modulation mechanism to main net, CPNO constructs PDE solutions in a near-optimal functional space, decoupling the model from MLP-specific constraints and enhancing multi-scale representation. Theoretical analysis demonstrates the Chebyshev basis's near-minimax uniform approximation properties and superior conditioning, with Lebesgue constants growing logarithmically with degree, thereby mitigating spectral bias and ensuring stable gradient flow during optimization. Numerical experiments on benchmark parameterized PDEs show that CPNO achieves superior accuracy, faster convergence, and enhanced robustness to hyperparameters.

Shared expert-guided learning captures reducible domain-invariant functions. Routed expert-guided learning employs a mixture-of-experts architecture to model irreducible domain-specific functions.

Context compression methods address these challenges by significantly reducing input length and eliminating redundancy.

We introduce Marginal Information Gain (MIG), a metric defined as the relevance of a unit to the input query minus its semantic redundancy with other units, guiding the compression process to prioritize information that is both relevant and low redundant. The framework operates in two stages: (1) Coarse-Grained Group Reallocation, where the context is partitioned into groups and dynamically assigned compression rates based on inter-group MIG, ensuring compression budgets align with information value distribution; and (2) Fine-Grained Token Merging, where tokens within each group are fused via an intra-group MIG-based weighting mechanism, thereby preserving key semantics while avoiding the accumulation of redundancy. Extensive experiments across question-answering (e.g., NaturalQuestions, 2WikiMQA, HotpotQA and NarrativeQA), summarization (e.g., MultiNews) with various backbones (e.g., LLaMA-2-7B, Qwen2-7B) show that COMI outperforms existing baselines by a large margin, e.g., approximately 25-point Exact Match (EM) improvement under 32x compression constraint with Qwen2-7B on NaturalQuestions."

Using the Feynman--Vernon influence functional formalism, we derive a quantum master equation describing the two-level atom interacting with a scalar field in a Newtonian gravitational field, and compute the energy dissipation rate of the atom. We find that the spontaneous emission rate (the dissipation rate in vacuum) is modified by the gravitational field. Specifically, this modification depends on the atom's dipole, the position of the atom relative to the source of the gravitational field, and the frequency of the scalar radiation emitted by the atom. Furthermore, we identify the parameter regimes in which the spontaneous emission rate is enhanced or suppressed by gravity. We also discuss how the modification arises from time dilation and dipole radiation in a weak gravitational field. These findings provide a theoretical basis for exploring gravitational effects in open quantum systems."

We define a curvature-aware iterated function system (IFS) with parameters optimized via a penalty-based approach to minimize deviation from the curvature of the classical spline. Theoretical conditions for interpolation and curvature approximation are derived. We compare the curvature of the proposed FIF with that of the classical cubic spline and discrete data curvature across multiple examples. Our method achieves both data interpolation and shape fidelity, preserving curvature more accurately than standard splines. The approach has potential applications in geometric modeling, computer graphics, and scientific data interpolation."

Existing mitigations remain largely technical and system-centric: tracking capability in advanced systems, shaping behaviour through methods such as reinforcement learning from human feedback, and designing systems to be corrigible and interruptible. Here we develop instrumental goal trajectories to expand these options beyond the model. Gaining capability typically depends on access to additional technical resources, such as compute, storage, data and adjacent services, which in turn requires access to monetary resources. In organisations, these resources can be obtained through three organisational pathways. We label these pathways the procurement, governance and finance instrumental goal trajectories (IGTs). Each IGT produces a trail of organisational artefacts that can be monitored and used as intervention points when a systems capabilities or behaviour exceed acceptable thresholds. In this way, IGTs offer concrete avenues for defining capability levels and for broadening how corrigibility and interruptibility are implemented, shifting attention from model properties alone to the organisational systems that enable them."

Meanwhile, sparse representation models uncover human-interpretable semantic features but remain largely confined to post-hoc analysis. We reconcile this tension by proposing LSTR (Latent Sparse Transcoder Reasoning), a latent reasoning framework that elevates functional sparse transcoders into active reasoning operators to perform multi-step computation through sparse semantic transitions. At its core, LSTR employs a Latent Transition Transcoder (LTT) with a residual skip architecture that decouples linear manifold transport from sparse semantic updates, enabling controllable semantic resolution via explicit sparsity constraints. Extensive experiments show that LSTR preserves reasoning accuracy and compression efficiency while substantially improving interpretability over dense latent baselines. Causal interventions and trajectory analyses further demonstrate that these sparse features act as both interpretable and causally effective operators in the reasoning process."

Language models offer an alternative: a natural-language interface where researchers write text with informal citation fragments, which are automatically resolved to proper references. However, language models are not reliable for scholarly work as they generate fabricated (hallucinated) citations at substantial rates. We present an architectural approach that combines the natural-language interface of LLM chatbots with the accuracy of direct database access, implemented through the Model Context Protocol. Our system enables language models to search bibliographic databases, perform fuzzy matching, and export verified entries, all through conversational interaction. A key architectural principle bypasses the language model during final data export: entries are fetched directly from authoritative sources, with timeout protection, to guarantee accuracy. We demonstrate this approach with MCP-DBLP, a server providing access to the DBLP computer science bibliography. The system transforms form-based bibliographic services into conversational assistants that maintain scholarly integrity. This architecture is adaptable to other bibliographic databases and academic data sources."

Existing approaches rely on outcome-based reinforcement learning (RL), which provides limited guidance for regulating information acquisition.

Building on this utility, we introduce retrieval continuation and granularity control mechanisms that selectively regulate when to continue and stop retrieval, and how much information to expand. An annealed control strategy enables the agent to internalize effective information acquisition behaviors during training. Extensive experiments across seven benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms strong baselines. In particular, our approach achieves average performance improvements of 9.4% and 8.6% on Qwen2.5-7B and Qwen2.5-3B, respectively, over strong outcome-based RL baselines, and consistently outperforms both retrieval-free and retrieval-based reasoning methods without explicit information control. These results highlight the importance of adaptive information control for scaling search-augmented reasoning agents to complex, real-world information environments."

In this process, the policy model analyzes execution states and selects editing actions, while the canvas executes operators and returns feedback for iterative refinement. Moreover, FlowSteer provides a plug-and-play framework that supports diverse operator libraries and interchangeable LLM backends. To effectively train this interaction paradigm, we propose Canvas Workflow Relative Policy Optimization (CWRPO), which introduces diversity-constrained rewards with conditional release to stabilize learning and suppress shortcut behaviors. Experimental results on twelve datasets show that FlowSteer significantly outperforms baselines across various tasks."

The results show that the sphere rolls down with constant deceleration while sinking into the granular bed. $δ/R$ (the sinking depth $δ$ normalized to the sphere radius $R$) is scaled by the sphere density normalized by the bulk density of the granular layer. To evaluate the translational energy dissipation, we introduce an effective friction coefficient $μ_\\mathrm{d}$. We demonstrate that $μ_\\mathrm{d}$ decreases with increasing the slope angle and the slip ratio. Furthermore, systematic measurements over a wide range of sphere densities reveal that $μ_\\mathrm{d}$ increases linearly with $δ/R$ : $μ_\\mathrm{d}=β(δ/R)+μ_0$. The value of $μ_0$ is linearly decreasing with slip ratio and its coefficient $β(\\simeq0.41)$ does not vary significantly. The results suggest that the normalized depth and slip ratio determine the effective friction of a rolling sphere."

We argue that this failure is not an engineering problem but a violation of physical postulates. Drawing inspiration from physics, we identify three constraints that any generalizing system must satisfy: (1) Locality -- information propagates at finite speed; (2) Symmetry -- the laws of computation are invariant across space and time; (3) Stability -- the system converges to discrete attractors that resist noise accumulation. From these postulates, we derive -- rather than design -- the Spatiotemporal Evolution with Attractor Dynamics (SEAD) architecture: a neural cellular automaton where local convolutional rules are iterated until convergence. Experiments on three tasks validate our theory: (1) Parity -- demonstrating perfect length generalization via light-cone propagation; (2) Addition -- achieving scale-invariant inference from L=16 to L=1 million with 100% accuracy, exhibiting input-adaptive computation; (3) Rule 110 -- learning a Turing-complete cellular automaton without trajectory divergence. Our results suggest that the gap between statistical learning and logical reasoning can be bridged -- not by scaling parameters, but by respecting the physics of computation."

    "abstract": "Molecular structure generation from mass spectrometry is fundamental for understanding cellular metabolism and discovering novel compounds. Although tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) enables the high-throughput acquisition of fragment fingerprints, these spectra often reflect higher-order interactions involving the concerted cleavage of multiple atoms and bonds-crucial for resolving complex isomers and non-local fragmentation mechanisms. However, most existing methods adopt atom-centric and pairwise interaction modeling, overlooking higher-order edge interactions and lacking the capacity to systematically capture essential many-body characteristics for structure generation. To overcome these limitations, we present MBGen, a Many-Body enhanced diffusion framework for de novo molecular structure Generation from mass spectra. By integrating a many-body attention mechanism and higher-order edge modeling, MBGen comprehensively leverages the rich structural information encoded in MS/MS spectra, enabling accurate de novo generation and isomer differentiation for novel molecules. Experimental results on the NPLIB1 and MassSpecGym benchmarks demonstrate that MBGen achieves superior performance, with improvements of up to 230% over state-of-the-art methods, highlighting the scientific value and practical utility of many-body modeling for mass spectrometry-based molecular generation. Further analysis and ablation studies show that our approach effectively captures higher-order interactions and exhibits enhanced sensitivity to complex isomeric and non-local fragmentation information."

For a given approximate discrete state, we verify existence and local uniqueness of a weak solution in a computable neighbourhood via a Newton--Kantorovich argument based on three certified ingredients: a guaranteed dual-norm residual bound, a computable lower bound for the stability constant of the linearised operator, and a Lipschitz bound for the derivative on the verification ball. The residual bound is obtained by an equilibrated-flux reconstruction exploiting an explicit relation between nonconforming and mixed formulations, yielding $H(\\mathrm{div})$-conforming fluxes without local mixed solves. The stability ingredient follows from a computable coercivity lower bound for the linearisation. An admissible verification radius is selected by a simple bracketing--bisection search, justified for an affine Lipschitz model. Once the verification ball is certified, we derive guaranteed enclosures for quantities of interest using computable variation bounds; an adjoint-based correction, in the spirit of goal-oriented error estimation, tightens these intervals while retaining full rigour. Numerical experiments for semilinear diffusion--reaction models show that the certificates are informative and that the adjoint enhancement substantially reduces enclosure widths."

Furthermore, focusing on normal data representations makes models vulnerable to distribution shifts at inference time. To address these limitations, we propose Codebook-based Online-adaptive Multi-scale Embedding for Time-series anomaly detection (COMET), which consists of three key components: (1) Multi-scale Patch Encoding captures temporal dependencies and inter-variable correlations across multiple patch scales. (2) Vector-Quantized Coreset learns representative normal patterns via codebook and detects anomalies with a dual-score combining quantization error and memory distance. (3) Online Codebook Adaptation generates pseudo-labels based on codebook entries and dynamically adapts the model at inference through contrastive learning. Experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that COMET achieves the best performance in 36 out of 45 evaluation metrics, validating its effectiveness across diverse environments."

Human evaluation is reliable but costly and difficult to scale, while traditional automatic metrics, such as FVD, CLAP, and ViCLIP, focus on isolated modality pairs, struggle with complex prompts, and provide limited interpretability. Omni-modal large language models (omni-LLMs) present a promising alternative: they naturally process audio, video, and text, support rich reasoning, and offer interpretable chain-of-thought feedback. Driven by this, we introduce Omni-Judge, a study assessing whether omni-LLMs can serve as human-aligned judges for text-conditioned audio-video generation. Across nine perceptual and alignment metrics, Omni-Judge achieves correlation comparable to traditional metrics and excels on semantically demanding tasks such as audio-text alignment, video-text alignment, and audio-video-text coherence. It underperforms on high-FPS perceptual metrics, including video quality and audio-video synchronization, due to limited temporal resolution. Omni-Judge provides interpretable explanations that expose semantic or physical inconsistencies, enabling practical downstream uses such as feedback-based refinement. Our findings highlight both the potential and current limitations of omni-LLMs as unified evaluators for multi-modal generation."

    "abstract": "Camera-based visible light positioning (VLP) is a promising technique for accurate and low-cost indoor camera pose estimation (CPE). To reduce the number of required light-emitting diodes (LEDs), advanced methods commonly exploit LED shape features for positioning. Although interesting, they are typically restricted to a single LED geometry, leading to failure in heterogeneous LED-shape scenarios. To address this challenge, this paper investigates Lamé curves as a unified representation of common LED shapes and proposes a generic VLP algorithm using Lamé curve-shaped LEDs, termed LC-VLP. In the considered system, multiple ceiling-mounted Lamé curve-shaped LEDs periodically broadcast their curve parameters via visible light communication, which are captured by a camera-equipped receiver. Based on the received LED images and curve parameters, the receiver can estimate the camera pose using LC-VLP. Specifically, an LED database is constructed offline to store the curve parameters, while online positioning is formulated as a nonlinear least-squares problem and solved iteratively. To provide a reliable initialization, a correspondence-free perspective-\\textit{n}-points (FreeP\\textit{n}P) algorithm is further developed, enabling approximate CPE without any pre-calibrated reference points. The performance of LC-VLP is verified by both simulations and experiments. Simulations show that LC-VLP outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both circular- and rectangular-LED scenarios, achieving reductions of over 40% in position error and 25% in rotation error. Experiments further show that LC-VLP can achieve an average position accuracy of less than 4 cm."

    "abstract": "Loss-based updating, including generalized Bayes, Gibbs, and quasi-posteriors, replaces likelihoods by a user-chosen loss and produces a posterior-like distribution via exponential tilt. We give a decision-theoretic characterization that separates \\emph{belief posteriors} -- conditional beliefs justified by the foundations of Savage and Anscombe-Aumann under a joint probability mode l-- from \\emph{decision posteriors} -- randomized decision rules justified by preferences over decision rules. We make explicit that a loss-based posterior coincides with ordinary Bayes if and only if the loss is, up to scale and a data-only term, negative log-likelihood. We then show that generalized marginal likelihood is not evidence for decision posteriors, and Bayes factors are not well-defined without additional structure. In the decision posterior regime, non-degenerate posteriors require nonlinear preferences over decision rules. Under sequential coherence and separability, these lead to an entropy-penalized variational representation yielding generalized Bayes as the optimal rule."

    "abstract": "Frontier models are transitioning from multimodal large language models (MLLMs) that merely ingest visual information to unified multimodal models (UMMs) capable of native interleaved generation. This shift has sparked interest in using intermediate visualizations as a reasoning aid, akin to human mental imagery. Central to this idea is the ability to form, maintain, and manipulate visual representations in a goal-oriented manner. To evaluate and probe this capability, we develop MentisOculi, a procedural, stratified suite of multi-step reasoning problems amenable to visual solution, tuned to challenge frontier models. Evaluating visual strategies ranging from latent tokens to explicit generated imagery, we find they generally fail to improve performance. Analysis of UMMs specifically exposes a critical limitation: While they possess the textual reasoning capacity to solve a task and can sometimes generate correct visuals, they suffer from compounding generation errors and fail to leverage even ground-truth visualizations. Our findings suggest that despite their inherent appeal, visual thoughts do not yet benefit model reasoning. MentisOculi establishes the necessary foundation to analyze and close this gap across diverse model families."

    "abstract": "Magnetic fields have been constrained at the surface of several massive and intermediate-mass stars, but their origin and properties in deep stellar radiative interiors are still debated, despite recent detections in the core of some red giant stars. Therefore, the modelling of AM transport in stellar radiative layers only relies on theoretical and numerical estimates of magnetic fields. Recent 3D numerical simulations show that a dynamo could occur in deep radiative regions. A realistic setup for understanding AM transport in such layers thus requires to take into account the mutual interactions of IGW and dynamo-generated magnetic field. We model the dynamics induced by IGW and dynamo in rotating radiative stellar layers using a simple description applicable to various evolutionary stages. As dynamo action and the propagation of IGW are 3D processes that have characteristic timescales short compared to periods associated with structural evolution of stars, we propose a mean-field 1D model by taking advantage of the dynamo coefficients computed from 3D spherical simulations. In this model, the necessary mean shear flow to trigger the dynamo results from the dissipation of monochromatic IGW generated in existing adjacent convective layers, which are expected to drive the formation of an oscillating rotational shear layer, the so-called Shear Layer Oscillation (SLO). In turn, magnetic effects can act on the mean flow through the Lorentz force. We show that the inclusion of magnetic fields adds up to the already very complex nonlinear problem and gives rise to the emergence of new dynamical regimes. Particularly, the fast SLO generated very close to the place where IGW are generated is perturbed by magnetic fields. This dynamical change can filter the wave energy spectrum transmitted towards further layers, with potential influence on the long-term evolution of the inner rotation."

In one stack, the bottom half of the stack is given a positive DMI and the top half a negative DMI, and as a result, the in-plane component of the dipolar field is aligned parallel to the effective field of the DMI in every layer, enhancing the effective DMI. We show that this enhanced DMI facilitates the nucleation and stability of skyrmions using both current-driven and laser-induced skyrmion nucleation. In the devices with an enhanced effective DMI, the density of nucleated skyrmions is greater by up to a factor 20 and skyrmions can be observed in stronger magnetic fields - suggesting that their stability is also improved. These results show that skyrmion nucleation depends strongly on the magnitude of the effective DMI in a magnetic multilayer and that the dipolar field within such a multilayer presents an effective route towards controlling the effective DMI, and thereby, the nucleation of chiral magnetic textures."

MOFs featuring ferromagnetically coupled metal atoms are theoretically predicted to induce an exchange gap in the TI surface band structure, potentially leading to a quantum anomalous Hall effect. However, achieving ordered MOFs on TI surfaces remains challenging due to the limited knowledge of self-assembly on these substrates. In this paper, we demonstrate self-assembly of Fe atoms and dicyanoanthracene (DCA) molecules into 2D MOFs on the Bi2Se3(0001) surface at room temperature, investigated via a combination of low-energy electron microscopy and diffraction (LEEM/LEED), scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), and ab initio calculations based on density functional theory (DFT). Two competing Fe-DCA phases form. The first phase corresponds to a close-packed Fe1DCA3 structure. In contrast, the second phase exhibits a larger unit cell with no match to either known or DFT-calculated systems, indicating a more complex bonding environment. These findings advance the understanding of the growth of MOFs on a strong topological insulator surface and provide insights for designing MOFs/TI interfaces with tailored electronic and magnetic properties."

Our previous work revealed a spectacular ionised outflow, but the effect of the outflow on the cold phase remained unclear. Our analysis shows that potentially outflowing molecular gas is detected only within the inner 1 kpc above the disc, where CO clouds exhibit disturbed kinematics and spatial correspondence with the ionisation cone. At larger heights, the CO surface brightness rapidly drops, indicating that the molecular phase contributes little to the mass of outflowing gas. In contrast, the HI distribution shows plumes a few kiloparsecs above the disc that are aligned with the ionised cone, and complex kinematics suggestive of parts of the atomic phase being entrained in the outflow. However, the extended and warped HI disc associated with NGC 4383 complicates the unambiguous identification of outflowing atomic gas and, most importantly, the quantification of outflowing mass and loading factor. Independent support for a cold component in the outflow comes from dust extinction features associated with the outflow and coincident with HI plumes. Despite significant uncertainties in the estimate of the mass of cold gas associated with the outflow, these results suggest that the atomic phase likely dominates the cold outflow above 1 kpc. The observed cold gas velocities remain below the velocities of the ionised phase, suggesting that NGC 4383 does not host a large-scale escaping wind but more likely a galactic fountain, in which feedback redistributes material within the halo and regulates ongoing and future star formation."

    "abstract": "The success of RL for LLM post-training stems from an unreasonably uninformative source: a single bit of information per rollout as binary reward or preference label. At the other extreme, distillation offers dense supervision but requires demonstrations, which are costly and difficult to scale. We study text feedback as an intermediate signal: richer than scalar rewards, yet cheaper than complete demonstrations. Textual feedback is a natural mode of human interaction and is already abundant in many real-world settings, where users, annotators, and automated judges routinely critique LLM outputs. Towards leveraging text feedback at scale, we formalize a multi-turn RL setup, RL from Text Feedback (RLTF), where text feedback is available during training but not at inference. Therefore, models must learn to internalize the feedback in order to improve their test-time single-turn performance. To do this, we propose two methods: Self Distillation (RLTF-SD), which trains the single-turn policy to match its own feedback-conditioned second-turn generations; and Feedback Modeling (RLTF-FM), which predicts the feedback as an auxiliary objective. We provide theoretical analysis on both methods, and empirically evaluate on reasoning puzzles, competition math, and creative writing tasks. Our results show that both methods consistently outperform strong baselines across benchmarks, highlighting the potential of RL with an additional source of rich supervision at scale."

To this end, we use a fluctuation-regularized quantum master equation that predicts dipolar relaxation and drive-induced dissipation, in addition to the standard environmental dissipation channels. Importantly, this unified approach predicts the existence of optimal microwave drive amplitudes that maximize the OE and SE enhancements. We also report optimal enhancement regime for electron-nuclear coupling for maximal enhancement."

    "abstract": "Establishing quantitative adiabaticity criteria at finite temperature remains substantially less developed than in the pure-state setting, despite the fact that realistic quantum systems are never at absolute zero. Here we derive rigorous bounds on the Hilbert-Schmidt fidelity between mixed states by combining a mixed-state quantum speed limit with mixed-state fidelity susceptibility within the Liouville space formulation of quantum mechanics. Applied to protocols that drive an initial Gibbs state toward a quasi-Gibbs target, these bounds yield an explicit threshold driving rate for the onset of nonadiabaticity. For a broad class of local Hamiltonians in gapped phases, we show that, in the thermodynamic limit, the threshold factorizes into two factors: a system-size contribution that recovers the zero-temperature scaling and a universal temperature-dependent factor. The latter is exponentially close to unity at low temperature, whereas at high temperature it increases linearly with temperature. We verify the predicted scaling in several spin-1/2 chains by obtaining closed-form expressions for the threshold driving rate. Our results provide practical and largely model-independent criteria for finite-temperature adiabaticity in closed many-body systems."

Standard models that optimize pixel-wise losses are prone to regression-to-the-mean bias, which blurs extreme values. Existing Fourier-based methods also lack the spatial localization needed to resolve transient convective cells. To overcome these intrinsic limitations, we propose WADEPre, a wavelet-based decomposition model for extreme precipitation that transitions the modeling into the wavelet domain. By leveraging the Discrete Wavelet Transform for explicit decomposition, WADEPre employs a dual-branch architecture: an Approximation Network to model stable, low-frequency advection, isolating deterministic trends from statistical bias, and a spatially localized Detail Network to capture high-frequency stochastic convection, resolving transient singularities and preserving sharp boundaries. A subsequent Refiner module then dynamically reconstructs these decoupled multi-scale components into the final high-fidelity forecast. To address optimization instability, we introduce a multi-scale curriculum learning strategy that progressively shifts supervision from coarse scales to fine-grained details. Extensive experiments on the SEVIR and Shanghai Radar datasets demonstrate that WADEPre achieves state-of-the-art performance, yielding significant improvements in capturing extreme thresholds and maintaining structural fidelity.

In this paper, utilizing Morse-Bott functions, we present a rigorous analysis of HiSD for computing degenerate saddle points on a critical manifold. We prove the local convergence of the continuous HiSD and establish the linear convergence rate of the discrete HiSD algorithm. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical explanation for the gradient alignment tendency, revealing that the gradient direction asymptotically aligns with a specific Hessian eigenvector. Our analysis also elucidates the flexibility in selecting the index for HiSD in the context of degenerate saddle points. We validate our analytical results through numerical experiments on neural-network loss landscapes and demonstrate that momentum-accelerated variants of HiSD achieve rapid convergence to degenerate saddle points."

The scheme introduces no spatial diffusion or mollification; all regularization originates solely from the marker selection mechanism. As the sharpness parameter $β\\to\\infty$, we prove uniform convergence of the transported marker functions on finite time intervals. Moreover, under a geometric nondegeneracy condition on the underlying Euler interface network, we establish Hausdorff convergence of the evolving interfacial structures and exponential-in-$β$ pointwise convergence of the regularized vorticity away from the tie sets to the corresponding sharp multi-phase vortex patch solution. Finally, we show that the loss of pointwise convergence coincides precisely with the onset of geometric degeneracy in the Euler interface dynamics."

To support systematic analysis, we introduce the Decision-based Implicit Bias (DIB) Benchmark, a large-scale dataset comprising 3,776 decision-making scenarios across nine social domains, designed to quantify implicit bias in long-term decision processes. Using a realistic long-horizon simulation framework, we evaluate six state-of-the-art LLMs integrated with three representative memory architectures on DIB and demonstrate that LLMs' implicit bias does not remain static but intensifies over time and propagates across unrelated domains. We further analyze mitigation strategies and show that a static system-level prompting baseline provides limited and short-lived debiasing effects. To address this limitation, we propose Dynamic Memory Tagging (DMT), an agentic intervention that enforces fairness constraints at memory write time. Extensive experimental results show that DMT substantially reduces bias accumulation and effectively curtails cross-domain bias propagation."

The proposed method treats question formation as a first-class decision process preceding task selection and execution, and integrates internal-driven, environment-aware, and inter-agent-aware prompting scopes to progressively expand cognitive coverage. In addition, the framework supports learning the question-formation process from experience, allowing the system to improve its adaptability and decision quality over time. xperimental results in a multi-agent simulation environment show that environment-aware prompting significantly reduces no-eat events compared with the internal-driven baseline, and inter-agent-aware prompting further reduces cumulative no-eat events by more than 60% over a 20-day simulation, with statistically significant improvements (p < 0.05)."

Therefore, we introduce a capacity-constrained perspective, highlighting that in shared-token unified MLLMs the visual tokenizer behaves as a compute-bounded learner, so the token budget should prioritize reusable structure over hard-to-exploit high-entropy variations and redundancy. Motivated by this perspective, we propose InfoTok, an information-regularized visual tokenization mechanism grounded in the Information Bottleneck (IB) principle. InfoTok formulates tokenization as controlling information flow from images to shared tokens to multimodal outputs, yielding a principled trade-off between compression and task relevance via mutual-information regularization. We integrate InfoTok into three representative unified MLLMs without introducing any additional training data. Experiments show consistent improvements on both understanding and generation, supporting information-regularized tokenization as a principled foundation for learning a shared token space in unified MLLMs."

While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are the standard solution, state-of-the-art pipelines often rely on explicit structural heuristics or memory-intensive node embeddings -- approaches that struggle to generalize or scale to massive graphs. Emerging Graph Transformers (GTs) offer a potential alternative but often incur significant overhead due to complex structural encodings, hindering their applications to large-scale link prediction. We challenge these sophisticated paradigms with PENCIL, an encoder-only plain Transformer that replaces hand-crafted priors with attention over sampled local subgraphs, retaining the scalability and hardware efficiency of standard Transformers. Through experimental and theoretical analysis, we show that PENCIL extracts richer structural signals than GNNs, implicitly generalizing a broad class of heuristics and subgraph-based expressivity. Empirically, PENCIL outperforms heuristic-informed GNNs and is far more parameter-efficient than ID-embedding--based alternatives, while remaining competitive across diverse benchmarks -- even without node features. Our results challenge the prevailing reliance on complex engineering techniques, demonstrating that simple design choices are potentially sufficient to achieve the same capabilities."

Building on previous studies of entanglement entropy and the holographic c-function, we focus on multipartite entanglement measures, including the conditional mutual information, multi-entropy, and the Markov gap which is based on the entanglement wedge cross section. Our results demonstrate that while these multipartite measures vanish in the long-distance limit $l \\to \\infty$, which confirms that the holographic nodal line semimetal remains a short-range entangled state, their large $l$ scaling behavior remains highly sensitive to the underlying topology. The large $l$ power-law decay and scaling exponents serve as robust, non-local order parameters that exhibit sharp changes at the quantum critical point.

    "abstract": "This paper presents an LMI-based design framework for multirate steady-state Kalman filters in systems with sensors operating at different sampling rates. The multirate system is formulated as a periodic time-varying system, where the Kalman gains converge to periodic steady-state values that repeat every frame period. Cyclic reformulation transforms this into a time-invariant problem; however, the resulting measurement noise covariance becomes semidefinite rather than positive definite, preventing direct application of standard Riccati equation methods. We address this through a dual LQR formulation with LMI optimization that naturally handles semidefinite covariances. The framework enables multi-objective design, supporting pole placement for guaranteed convergence rates and mixed H_2/l_2-induced norm design for balancing average and worst-case performance. Numerical validation using an automotive navigation system with GPS and wheel speed sensors demonstrates that the proposed filter achieves estimation errors well below raw measurement noise levels."

This paper evaluates how community attention and sentiment relate to valuation in major Ethereum NFT collections after accounting for time effects, market-wide conditions, and persistent visual heterogeneity. Transaction data for large generative collections are merged with Reddit-based discourse measures available for 25 collections, covering 87{,}696 secondary-market sales from January 2021 through March 2025. Visual differences are absorbed by a transparent, within-collection standardized index built from explicit image traits and aggregated via PCA. Discourse is summarized at the collection-by-bin level using discussion intensity and lexicon-based tone measures, with smoothing to reduce noise when text volume is sparse. A mixed-effects specification with a Mundlak within--between decomposition separates persistent cross-collection differences from within-collection fluctuations. Valuations align most strongly with sustained collection-level attention and sentiment environments; within collections, short-horizon negativity is consistently associated with higher prices, and attention is most informative when measured as cumulative engagement over multiple prior windows."

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel hybrid control framework for switched linear parameter-varying (LPV) systems under hysteresis switching logic. By introducing a controller state-reset mechanism, the hybrid LPV synthesis problem is reformulated as a convex optimization problem expressed in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), enabling efficient computation of both switching LPV controller gains and reset matrices. The proposed approach is then applied to active magnetic bearing (AMB) systems, whose rotor dynamics exhibit strong dependence on rotational speed. Conventional LPV designs are often conservative due to large speed variations. The proposed hybrid gain-scheduled controller explicitly accounts for bounds on parameter variation rates, employs multiple LPV controllers over distinct operating regions, and uses hysteresis switching to reduce chattering and ensure stability. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated through a detailed AMB control design example."

To address this issue, we propose native PIC by reintroducing the encoder to prevalent decoder-only LLMs and explicitly training it to support PIC. We further develop COMB, a PIC-aware caching system that integrates seamlessly with existing inference frameworks. Experimental results show that COMB reduces Time-to-First-Token (TTFT) by 51-94% and increases throughput by 3$\\times$ with comparable accuracy.

Existing approaches often rely on sorting, which incur significant computation and memory overhead on GPUs, or stochastic approaches, which alter the algorithm output. In this work, we propose Qrita, an efficient Top-k and Top-p algorithm based on a pivot-based selection strategy. Based on RTop-k, which uses a pivot-based search for node selection in graph neural networks, Qrita extends the concept of pivot-based search to both Top-k and Top-p with two key techniques: 1. Gaussian-based sigma-truncation, which greatly reduces the search space of the target elements, and 2. Quaternary pivot search with duplication handling, which halves the pivot search iteration and guarantees deterministic output. We provide the full implementation of Qrita using Triton, a popular GPU programming language. Our evaluation of Qrita against the Top-k and Top-p kernels of high performance LLM execution engines such as vLLM, SGLang, and Flashinfer show that Qrita achieves up to 2 times throughput and half memory use while providing the same output to the the sorting-based algorithms."

Specifically, MarkCleaner is trained with micro-geometry-perturbed supervision, which encourages the model to separate semantic content from strict spatial alignment and enables robust reconstruction under subtle geometric displacements. The framework adopts a mask-guided encoder that learns explicit spatial representations and a 2D Gaussian Splatting-based decoder that explicitly parameterizes geometric perturbations while preserving semantic content. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MarkCleaner achieves superior performance in both watermark removal effectiveness and visual fidelity, while enabling efficient real-time inference. Our code will be made available upon acceptance."

    "abstract": "Genetic programming-based feature construction has achieved significant success in recent years as an automated machine learning technique to enhance learning performance. However, overfitting remains a challenge that limits its broader applicability. To improve generalization, we prove that vicinal risk, estimated through noise perturbation or mixup-based data augmentation, is bounded by the sum of empirical risk and a regularization term-either finite difference or the vicinal Jensen gap. Leveraging this decomposition, we propose an evolutionary feature construction framework that jointly optimizes empirical risk and the vicinal Jensen gap to control overfitting. Since datasets may vary in noise levels, we develop a noise estimation strategy to dynamically adjust regularization strength. Furthermore, to mitigate manifold intrusion-where data augmentation may generate unrealistic samples that fall outside the data manifold-we propose a manifold intrusion detection mechanism. Experimental results on 58 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of Jensen gap minimization compared to other complexity measures. Comparisons with 15 machine learning algorithms further indicate that genetic programming with the proposed overfitting control strategy achieves superior performance."

Our approach applies STORM (STOchastic Recursive Momentum) to reduce variance in the critic updates. However, because samples are drawn from a nonstationary occupancy measure induced by the evolving policy, variance reduction via STORM alone is insufficient. To address this challenge, we maintain a buffer of small fraction of recent samples and uniformly sample from it for each critic update. Importantly, these mechanisms are compatible with existing deep learning architectures and require only minor modifications, without compromising practical applicability."

Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in code generation, symbolic reasoning, and tool use, but reliably solving PDEs across heterogeneous settings remains challenging. Prior work on LLM-based code generation and transformer-based foundation models for PDE learning has shown promising advances. However, a persistent trade-off between execution success rate and numerical accuracy arises, particularly when generalization to unseen parameters and boundary conditions is required. In this work, we propose OpInf-LLM, an LLM parametric PDE solving framework based on operator inference. The proposed framework leverages a small amount of solution data to enable accurate prediction of diverse PDE instances, including unseen parameters and configurations, and provides seamless integration with LLMs for natural language specification of PDE solving tasks. Its low computational demands and unified tool interface further enable a high execution success rate across heterogeneous settings. By combining operator inference with LLM capabilities, OpInf-LLM opens new possibilities for generalizable reduced-order modeling in LLM-based PDE solving."

    "abstract": "Autoregressive video diffusion models enable streaming generation, opening the door to long-form synthesis, video world models, and interactive neural game engines. However, their core attention layers become a major bottleneck at inference time: as generation progresses, the KV cache grows, causing both increasing latency and escalating GPU memory, which in turn restricts usable temporal context and harms long-range consistency. In this work, we study redundancy in autoregressive video diffusion and identify three persistent sources: near-duplicate cached keys across frames, slowly evolving (largely semantic) queries/keys that make many attention computations redundant, and cross-attention over long prompts where only a small subset of tokens matters per frame. Building on these observations, we propose a unified, training-free attention framework for autoregressive diffusion: TempCache compresses the KV cache via temporal correspondence to bound cache growth; AnnCA accelerates cross-attention by selecting frame-relevant prompt tokens using fast approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) matching; and AnnSA sparsifies self-attention by restricting each query to semantically matched keys, also using a lightweight ANN. Together, these modules reduce attention, compute, and memory and are compatible with existing autoregressive diffusion backbones and world models. Experiments demonstrate up to x5--x10 end-to-end speedups while preserving near-identical visual quality and, crucially, maintaining stable throughput and nearly constant peak GPU memory usage over long rollouts, where prior methods progressively slow down and suffer from increasing memory usage."

To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a novel parallel generative speech enhancement (ParaGSE) framework that leverages a group vector quantization (GVQ)-based neural speech codec. The GVQ-based codec adopts separate VQs to produce mutually independent tokens, enabling efficient parallel token prediction in ParaGSE. Specifically, ParaGSE leverages the GVQ-based codec to encode degraded speech into distinct tokens, predicts the corresponding clean tokens through parallel branches conditioned on degraded spectral features, and ultimately reconstructs clean speech via the codec decoder. Experimental results demonstrate that ParaGSE consistently produces superior enhanced speech compared to both discriminative and generative baselines, under a wide range of distortions including noise, reverberation, band-limiting, and their mixtures. Furthermore, empowered by parallel computation in token prediction, ParaGSE attains about a 1.5-fold improvement in generation efficiency on CPU compared with serial generative speech enhancement approaches."

While this paradigm has driven substantial progress, it proves insufficient in adaptive and multi-turn settings where forecasting requires informative feature extraction, reasoning-driven inference, iterative refinement, and continual adaptation over time. In this paper, we argue for agentic time series forecasting (ATSF), which reframes forecasting as an agentic process composed of perception, planning, action, reflection, and memory. Rather than focusing solely on predictive models, ATSF emphasizes organizing forecasting as an agentic workflow that can interact with tools, incorporate feedback from outcomes, and evolve through experience accumulation. We outline three representative implementation paradigms -- workflow-based design, agentic reinforcement learning, and a hybrid agentic workflow paradigm -- and discuss the opportunities and challenges that arise when shifting from model-centric prediction to agentic forecasting. Together, this position aims to establish agentic forecasting as a foundation for future research at the intersection of time series forecasting."

The offline stage enables rapid embedding transfer via dimension-adaptive projections without iterative training, combined with progressive network distillation and strategic sampling to reduce computational cost. The online stage introduces asymmetric co-distillation, where students update frequently while teachers update infrequently, together with a distribution-aware adaptation mechanism that dynamically balances historical knowledge preservation and fast adaptation to evolving data. Experiments on three public datasets show that CrossAdapt achieves 0.27-0.43% AUC improvements while reducing training time by 43-71%. Large-scale deployment on Tencent WeChat Channels (~10M daily samples) further demonstrates its effectiveness, significantly mitigating AUC degradation, LogLoss increase, and prediction bias compared to standard distillation baselines."

We find that $K^*$-Reggeon exchange provides the dominant contribution, while $K$-Reggeon exchange remains nonnegligible, particularly in describing the SDMEs. In contrast, the $s$-channel $Λ$ and $u$-channel nucleon exchanges are negligible. To obtain reliable predictions for the open-charm reaction $K^- p \\to D_s^{*-} Λ_c^+$, we employ a Quark-Gluon String Model (QGSM)-motivated Regge framework that incorporates both pseudoscalar- and vector-Reggeon exchanges. Within this framework, the Regge trajectories $α(t)$ and energy-scale parameters $s_0$ are determined consistently, thereby constaining the model and reducing theoretical ambiguities.

The total cross sections for $K^- p \\to D_s^{*-} Λ_c^+$ and $K^- p \\to J/ψΛ$ are suppressed by approximately 5-6 and 8-9 orders of magnitude, respectively, compared with that for $K^- p \\to φΛ$.

    "abstract": "Diffusion models have been widely deployed in AIGC services; however, their reliance on opaque training data and procedures exposes a broad attack surface for backdoor injection. In practical auditing scenarios, due to the protection of intellectual property and commercial confidentiality, auditors are typically unable to access model parameters, rendering existing white-box or query-intensive detection methods impractical. More importantly, even after the backdoor is detected, existing detoxification approaches are often trapped in a dilemma between detoxification effectiveness and generation quality. In this work, we identify a previously unreported phenomenon called temporal noise unconsistency, where the noise predictions between adjacent diffusion timesteps is disrupted in specific temporal segments when the input is triggered, while remaining stable under clean inputs. Leveraging this finding, we propose Temporal Noise Consistency Defense (TNC-Defense), a unified framework for backdoor detection and detoxification. The framework first uses the adjacent timestep noise consistency to design a gray-box detection module, for identifying and locating anomalous diffusion timesteps. Furthermore, the framework uses the identified anomalous timesteps to construct a trigger-agnostic, timestep-aware detoxification module, which directly corrects the backdoor generation path. This effectively suppresses backdoor behavior while significantly reducing detoxification costs. We evaluate the proposed method under five representative backdoor attack scenarios and compare it with state-of-the-art defenses. The results show that TNC-Defense improves the average detection accuracy by $11\\%$ with negligible additional overhead, and invalidates an average of $98.5\\%$ of triggered samples with only a mild degradation in generation quality."

To mitigate the quadratic complexity of standard full attention, various efficient attention mechanisms, such as linear and hybrid attention, have been developed. A fundamental gap remains: their expressive power relative to full attention lacks a rigorous theoretical characterization. In this work, we theoretically characterize the performance differences among these attention mechanisms. Our theory applies to all linear attention variants that can be formulated as a recurrence, including Mamba, DeltaNet, etc. Specifically, we establish an expressiveness hierarchy: for the sequential function composition-a multi-step reasoning task that must occur within a model's forward pass, an ($L+1$)-layer full attention network is sufficient, whereas any hybrid network interleaving $L-1$ layers of full attention with a substantially larger number ($2^{3L^2}$) of linear attention layers cannot solve it. This result demonstrates a clear separation in expressive power between the two types of attention. Our work provides the first provable separation between hybrid attention and standard full attention, offering a theoretical perspective for understanding the fundamental capabilities and limitations of different attention mechanisms."

While existing work attempts to balance the trade-off between prediction accuracy and compute latency, we address this fundamental dilemma through architectural innovation. We propose PRISM, which disaggregates the computation of each predictive step across different parameter sets, refactoring the computational pathways of draft models to successfully decouple model capacity from inference cost. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that PRISM outperforms all existing draft architectures, achieving exceptional acceptance lengths while maintaining minimal draft latency for superior end-to-end speedup. We also re-examine scaling laws with PRISM, revealing that PRISM scales more effectively with expanding data volumes than other draft architectures. Through rigorous and fair comparison, we show that PRISM boosts the decoding throughput of an already highly optimized inference engine by more than 2.6x."

To achieve this goal, we propose a novel concept of single-image fusion, which extends conventional data-level fusion to the knowledge level. Specifically, we develop MagicFuse, a novel single image fusion framework capable of deriving a comprehensive cross-spectral scene representation from a single low-quality visible image. MagicFuse first introduces an intra-spectral knowledge reinforcement branch and a cross-spectral knowledge generation branch based on the diffusion models. They mine scene information obscured in the visible spectrum and learn thermal radiation distribution patterns transferred to the infrared spectrum, respectively. Building on them, we design a multi-domain knowledge fusion branch that integrates the probabilistic noise from the diffusion streams of these two branches, from which a cross-spectral scene representation can be obtained through successive sampling. Then, we impose both visual and semantic constraints to ensure that this scene representation can satisfy human observation while supporting downstream semantic decision-making. Extensive experiments show that our MagicFuse achieves visual and semantic representation performance comparable to or even better than state-of-the-art fusion methods with multi-modal inputs, despite relying solely on a single degraded visible image."

To overcome this limitation, we extend the system with a spot-wise monitoring strategy based on a distance-aware matching method with spatial tolerance, enhanced through an Adaptive Bounding Box Partitioning method for challenging spaces. The proposed approach achieves a balanced accuracy of 98.80% while maintaining an inference time of 8 seconds on a resource-constrained edge device, enhancing the capabilities of YOLOv11m, a model that has a size of 40.5 MB. In addition, two new components were introduced: (i) a Digital Shadow that visually represents parking lot entities as a base to evolve to a full Digital Twin, and (ii) an application support server based on a repurposed TV box.

RankTuner introduces a probability--entropy calibration signal, the Relative Rank Indicator, which compares the rank of the ground-truth token with its expected rank under the prediction distribution. The inverse indicator is used as a token-wise Relative Scale to reweight the fine-tuning objective, focusing updates on truly under-learned tokens without over-penalizing intrinsically uncertain positions. Experiments on multiple backbones show consistent improvements on mathematical reasoning benchmarks, transfer gains on out-of-distribution reasoning, and pre code generation performance over probability-only or entropy-only reweighting baselines."

    "abstract": "Coronal jets are collimated plasma eruptions which are ubiquitous in the solar atmosphere. Believed to be triggered by magnetic reconnection, these jets can contribute to various phenomena, including coronal heating and particle acceleration. Coronal jets are a contemporary area of research with their onset mechanism meriting further attention. Importantly, a subclass of jets, the blowout jets, are particularly interesting because of their broad spire, suggesting substantial three-dimensional (3D) reconnection between open and closed field lines involving 3D null points. Consequently, here we explore the onset of a blowout jet associated with Active Region (AR) SPoCA 29093 detected by Spatial Possibilistic Clustering Algorithm (SPoCA). This AR produced a C1.1-class flare on 10 November 2022 and we investigate it using a data-constrained magnetohydrodynamic simulation initiated with a non force-free-field (NFFF) extrapolation of the photospheric magnetic field. Key elements of the extrapolated field lines are the presence of a 3D null and a magnetic flux rope (MFR) co-located with the jet activity region, the evolution of which is further traced in the simulation. The simulation suggests that magnetic reconnection is responsible for the evolution of the MFR, leading to a near-simultaneous onset of the flare and jet as observed by the AIA/SDO. In particular, the simulation shows spontaneous creation and annihilation of 3D null pairs via magnetic reconnection near the jet region. Such spontaneous null pair generation, in principle, can trigger or contribute to coronal jets; opening up a new avenue for further research."

    "abstract": "Video language models (Video-LLMs) are prone to hallucinations, often generating plausible but ungrounded content when visual evidence is weak, ambiguous, or biased. Existing decoding methods, such as contrastive decoding (CD), rely on random perturbations to construct contrastive data for mitigating hallucination patterns. However, such a way is hard to control the visual cues that drive hallucination or well align with model weaknesses. We propose Model-aware Counterfactual Data based Contrastive Decoding (MACD), a new inference strategy that combines model-guided counterfactual construction with decoding. Our approach uses the Video-LLM's own feedback to identify object regions most responsible for hallucination, generating targeted counterfactual inputs at the object level rather than arbitrary frame or temporal modifications. These model-aware counterfactual data is then integrated into CD to enforce evidence-grounded token selection during decoding. Experiments on EventHallusion, MVBench, Perception-test and Video-MME show that MACD consistently reduces hallucination while maintaining or improving task accuracy across diverse Video-LLMs, including Qwen and InternVL families. The method is especially effective in challenging scenarios involving small, occluded, or co-occurring objects. Our code and data will be publicly released."

Empirically, the final-layer posterior of post-trained LRMs exhibit sharply reduced entropy, while the entropy of intermediate layers remains relatively high. Motivated by this entropy asymmetry, we propose Latent Exploration Decoding (LED), a depth-conditioned decoding strategy. LED aggregates intermediate posteriors via cumulative sum and selects depth configurations with maximal entropy as exploration candidates. Without additional training or parameters, LED consistently improves pass@1 and pass@16 accuracy by 0.61 and 1.03 percentage points across multiple reasoning benchmarks and models.

    "abstract": "Despite rapid progress, embodied agents still struggle with long-horizon manipulation that requires maintaining spatial consistency, causal dependencies, and goal constraints. A key limitation of existing approaches is that task reasoning is implicitly embedded in high-dimensional latent representations, making it challenging to separate task structure from perceptual variability. We introduce Grounded Scene-graph Reasoning (GSR), a structured reasoning paradigm that explicitly models world-state evolution as transitions over semantically grounded scene graphs. By reasoning step-wise over object states and spatial relations, rather than directly mapping perception to actions, GSR enables explicit reasoning about action preconditions, consequences, and goal satisfaction in a physically grounded space. To support learning such reasoning, we construct Manip-Cognition-1.6M, a large-scale dataset that jointly supervises world understanding, action planning, and goal interpretation. Extensive evaluations across RLBench, LIBERO, GSR-benchmark, and real-world robotic tasks show that GSR significantly improves zero-shot generalization and long-horizon task completion over prompting-based baselines. These results highlight explicit world-state representations as a key inductive bias for scalable embodied reasoning."

Second, it enables LLMs to perform a wide range of tasks/functions with a few examples demonstrating a desirable task. ICL opens up new ways to utilize LLMs in more domains, but its underlying mechanisms still remain poorly understood, making error correction and diagnosis extremely challenging. Thus, it is imperative that we better understand the limitations of ICL and how exactly LLMs support ICL. Inspired by ICL properties and LLMs' functional modules, we propose 1the counting hypothesis' of ICL, which suggests that LLMs' encoding strategy may underlie ICL, and provide supporting evidence."

    "abstract": "We study online inverse linear optimization, also known as contextual recommendation, where a learner sequentially infers an agent's hidden objective vector from observed optimal actions over feasible sets that change over time. The learner aims to recommend actions that perform well under the agent's true objective, and the performance is measured by the regret, defined as the cumulative gap between the agent's optimal values and those achieved by the learner's recommended actions. Prior work has established a regret bound of $O(d\\log T)$, as well as a finite but exponentially large bound of $\\exp(O(d\\log d))$, where $d$ is the dimension of the optimization problem and $T$ is the time horizon, while a regret lower bound of $Ω(d)$ is known (Gollapudi et al. 2021; Sakaue et al. 2025). Whether a finite regret bound polynomial in $d$ is achievable or not has remained an open question. We partially resolve this by showing that when the feasible sets are M-convex -- a broad class that includes matroids -- a finite regret bound of $O(d\\log d)$ is possible. We achieve this by combining a structural characterization of optimal solutions on M-convex sets with a geometric volume argument. Moreover, we extend our approach to adversarially corrupted feedback in up to $C$ rounds. We obtain a regret bound of $O((C+1)d\\log d)$ without prior knowledge of $C$, by monitoring directed graphs induced by the observed feedback to detect corruptions adaptively."

We address this gap with a scalable synthetic data pipeline that generates photorealistic human frames and motion-aligned sequences with pixel-accurate depth, normals, and masks. Unlike prior static data synthetic pipelines, our pipeline provides both frame-level labels for spatial learning and sequence-level supervision for temporal learning. Building on this, we train a unified ViT-based dense predictor that (i) injects an explicit human geometric prior via CSE embeddings and (ii) improves geometry-feature reliability with a lightweight channel reweighting module after feature fusion. Our two-stage training strategy, combining static pretraining with dynamic sequence supervision, enables the model first to acquire robust spatial representations and then refine temporal consistency across motion-aligned sequences. Extensive experiments show that we achieve state-of-the-art performance on THuman2.1 and Hi4D and generalize effectively to in-the-wild videos."

In this paper, we propose CoDiQ (Controllable Difficult Question Generation), a novel framework enabling fine-grained difficulty control via test-time scaling while ensuring question solvability. Specifically, first, we identify a test-time scaling tendency (extended reasoning token budget boosts difficulty but reduces solvability) and the intrinsic properties defining the upper bound of a model's ability to generate valid, high-difficulty questions. Then, we develop CoDiQ-Generator from Qwen3-8B, which improves the upper bound of difficult question generation, making it particularly well-suited for challenging question construction. Building on the CoDiQ framework, we build CoDiQ-Corpus (44K competition-grade question sequences). Human evaluations show these questions are significantly more challenging than LiveCodeBench/AIME with over 82% solvability. Training LRMs on CoDiQ-Corpus substantially improves reasoning performance, verifying that scaling controlled-difficulty training questions enhances reasoning capabilities. We open-source CoDiQ-Corpus, CoDiQ-Generator, and implementations to support related research."

    "abstract": "Steering vectors (SVs) offer a lightweight way to control large language models (LLMs) at inference time by shifting hidden activations, providing a practical middle ground between prompting and fine-tuning. Yet SVs can be unreliable in practice. Some concepts are unsteerable, and even when steering helps on average it can backfire for a non-trivial fraction of inputs. Reliability also degrades in long-form generation and multi-attribute steering. We take a geometric view of these failures. A static SV applies the same update vector everywhere in representation space, implicitly assuming that the concept-improving direction is constant across contexts. When the locally effective direction varies with the current activation, a single global vector can become misaligned, which yields weak or reversed effects. Guided by this perspective, we propose Steering Vector Fields (SVF), which learns a differentiable concept scoring function whose local gradient defines the steering direction at each activation, making interventions explicitly context-dependent. This formulation supports coordinated multi-layer interventions in a shared, aligned concept space, and enables efficient long-form and multi-attribute control within a unified framework. Across multiple LLMs and steering tasks, SVF delivers stronger and more reliable control, improving the practicality of inference-time steering."

Existing online CP methods maintain target coverage by adaptively scaling the conformal threshold, but typically employ a static nonconformity score function. We show that this fixed geometry leads to highly conservative, volume-inefficient prediction regions when environments undergo structural shifts. To address this, we propose \\textbf{AdaptNC}, a framework for the joint online adaptation of both the nonconformity score parameters and the conformal threshold. AdaptNC leverages an adaptive reweighting scheme to optimize score functions, and introduces a replay buffer mechanism to mitigate the coverage instability that occurs during score transitions. We evaluate AdaptNC on diverse robotic benchmarks involving multi-agent policy changes, environmental changes and sensor degradation. Our results demonstrate that AdaptNC significantly reduces prediction region volume compared to state-of-the-art threshold-only baselines while maintaining target coverage levels."

However, realizations have mostly been limited to classical applications or artificial setups. In this study, we focus on the quantum nature inherent in bosonic Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) systems, which from the perspective of spectral theory corresponds to non-Hermiticity. Based on this insight, we propose a steady-state skin effect in quantum condensed matter utilizing such BdG non-Hermiticity. Specifically, we introduce BdG quantum terms arising from parametric pumping to the edge states of an underlying bosonic Hermitian Chern insulator, thereby realizing non-Hermiticity without dissipation. This system design has the advantage of being largely independent of microscopic model details. Through analysis using non-equilibrium Green's functions, we find that under open boundary conditions, a steady state exhibiting the non-Hermitian skin effect is realized. The pronounced corner particle accumulation observed in this steady state shows quadrature anisotropy, which manifests the bosonic quantum nature. Our results bridge the gap between the fascinating mathematics of non-Hermitian matrices and practical quantum physical systems."

    "abstract": "Many modern ultrasound beamformers report improved image quality when evaluated using classical criteria like the contrast ratio and contrast-to-noise ratio, which are based on summary statistics of regions of interest (ROIs). However, nonlinear beamformers and post-processing methods can substantially alter these statistics, raising concerns that the reported improvements may reflect changes in dynamic range or remapping rather than a reflection of true information gain, such as clutter suppression. New criteria like the generalized contrast-to-noise ratio (gCNR) address these concerns, but rely on noisy estimates of the underlying distribution. To address this, we introduce a new image quality criterion, called the contrast order (CO), defined as the expected value of the sign of the difference in brightness between two ROIs. The CO is invariant under all strictly monotonic transformations of the image values, as it depends only on their relative ordering, and is interpretable as the probability that one ROI is brighter than the other minus the probability that it is darker. Unlike the gCNR, the CO has a simple unbiased estimator whose variance decreases with the number of samples in each ROI. We further propose the effective contrast ratio (ECR), which calibrates the contrast order to the familiar contrast ratio such that the two coincide under ideal Rayleigh-speckle statistics. Together, the CO and ECR provide order- and sign-preserving, dynamic-range-invariant criteria for evaluating lesion contrast, offering a principled alternative to classical and newer image quality criteria when assessing modern beamformers."

One way to directly measure turbulent motion in disks is through molecular line broadening. DM Tau is one of only a few disks with claimed detection of nonthermal line broadening of 0.25cs-0.33cs, where cs is the sound speed. Using the radiative transfer code mcfost within a Bayesian inference framework that evaluates over five million disk models to efficiently sample the parameter space, we fit high-resolution (0.15\", 28 m s-1) 12CO J = 3-2 observations of DM Tau from the exoALMA Large Program. This approach enables us to simultaneously constrain the disk structure and kinematics, revealing a significant nonthermal contribution to the line width of ~0.4cs, inconsistent with purely thermal motions. Using the CO-based disk structure as a starting point, we reproduce the CS J = 7-6 emission well, demonstrating that the CS (which is more sensitive to nonthermal motions than CO) agrees with the turbulence inferred from the CO fit. Establishing a well-constrained background disk model further allows us to identify residual structures in the moment maps that deviate from the expected emission, revealing localized perturbations that may trace forming planets. This framework provides a powerful general approach for extracting disk structure and nonthermal broadening directly from molecular line data and can be applied to other disks with high-quality observations."

However, MI-based methods tend to favor simple, static skills due to their invariance properties, limiting the discovery of dynamic, task-relevant behaviors. Distance-Maximizing Skill Discovery (DSD) promotes more dynamic skills by leveraging state-space distances, yet still fall short in encouraging comprehensive skill sets that engage all controllable factors or entities in the environment. In this work, we introduce SUSD, a novel framework that harnesses the compositional structure of environments by factorizing the state space into independent components (e.g., objects or controllable entities). SUSD allocates distinct skill variables to different factors, enabling more fine-grained control on the skill discovery process. A dynamic model also tracks learning across factors, adaptively steering the agent's focus toward underexplored factors. This structured approach not only promotes the discovery of richer and more diverse skills, but also yields a factorized skill representation that enables fine-grained and disentangled control over individual entities which facilitates efficient training of compositional downstream tasks via Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL). Our experimental results across three environments, with factors ranging from 1 to 10, demonstrate that our method can discover diverse and complex skills without supervision, significantly outperforming existing unsupervised skill discovery methods in factorized and complex environments.

In this work, motivated by its phenomenological similarity to GW190521, we test whether GW231123 is compatible with a wormhole-echo scenario by modeling a leading echo pulse with a well-motivated phenomenological sine-Gaussian wavepacket. We perform Bayesian model comparison against a BBH baseline described by the IMRPhenomXPHM-SpinTaylor waveform, and obtain the Bayes factor ratio $\\ln B^{\\rm Echo}_{\\rm BBH} = 1.87$, corresponding to weak-to-moderate support for the echo hypothesis. In our previous analysis for GW190521 within the same overall framework, we found $\\ln B^{\\rm Echo}_{\\rm BBH} \\approx -2.9$, implying a shift of $Δ\\ln B \\approx 4.8$ between the two events. This sign change indicates that GW231123 is more compatible with a single-pulse echo description than GW190521."

We propose PIPE, a protocol-level evaluation augmentation for diagnosing interface reliance by minimally rewriting environment interfaces while preserving task semantics and execution behavior. Across 16 environments from AgentBench and AgentGym and a range of open-source and API-based agents, PIPE reveals that trajectory-SFT substantially amplifies interface shortcutting: trained agents degrade sharply under minimal interface rewrites, while non-trajectory-trained models remain largely stable. We further introduce Interface Reliance (IR), a counterbalanced alias-based metric that quantifies preference for training-time interfaces, and show that interface shortcutting exhibits environment-dependent, non-monotonic training dynamics that remain invisible under standard evaluation.

Diffusion models, in contrast, capture rich spatial structure through high-dimensional generation, but lack the stepwise logical control needed to satisfy complex, multi-stage constraints or to reliably identify and correct errors. We introduce Collaborative Thoughts, a unified collaborative framework that enables autoregressive and diffusion models to reason and generate jointly through a closed-loop interaction. In Collaborative Thoughts, autoregressive models perform structured planning and constraint management, diffusion models instantiate these constraints as intermediate visual thoughts, and a vision-based critic module evaluates whether the visual thoughts satisfy the intended structural and physical requirements. This feedback is then used to iteratively refine subsequent planning and generation steps, mitigating error propagation across modalities. Importantly, Collaborative Thoughts uses the same collaborative loop regardless of whether the task is autoregressive question answering or diffusion-based visual generation. Through representative examples, we illustrate how Collaborative Thoughts can improve the reliability of spatial reasoning and the controllability of generation."

    "abstract": "Cellular metabolism is globally regulated by various currency metabolites such as ATP, GTP, and NAD(P)H. These metabolites cycle between charged (high-energy) and uncharged (low-energy) states to mediate energy transfer. While distinct currency metabolites are associated with different metabolic functions, their charged and uncharged forms are generally interchangeable via biochemical reactions such as ${\\rm ATP{\\,+\\,}GDP{\\,\\rightleftharpoons\\,}ADP{\\,+\\,}GTP}$ and $\\rm NADP^+{\\,+\\,}NADH{\\,\\rightleftharpoons\\,}NADPH{\\,+\\,}NAD^+ $. Thus, their energetic states are generally coupled and influence each other, which would hinder the independent regulation of different currency metabolites. Despite the extensive knowledge of the molecular biology of individual currency metabolites, it remains poorly understood how the coordination of various coupled currency metabolites shapes metabolic regulation, efficiency, and ultimately the evolution of organisms. Here, we present a minimal theoretical model of metabolic currency coupling and reveal a fundamental tradeoff relationship between metabolic controllability and thermodynamic cost: increasing the capacity to independently regulate multiple currency metabolites generally requires comparable abundances of those metabolites, which in turn incurs a higher entropy production rate. The tradeoff suggests that in complex environments, organisms evolutionarily favor an equal abundance of currency metabolites to enhance metabolic controllability at the expense of a higher thermodynamic cost; conversely, in simple environments, organisms evolve to have imbalanced amounts of them to reduce heat dissipation. These considerations also offer a hypothesis regarding evolutionary trends in nucleotide-pool balance and genomic GC content."

In this work, we introduce Expected Harm, a metric that weights the severity of a jailbreak by its execution likelihood, modeled as a function of execution cost. Through empirical analysis of state-of-the-art models, we reveal a systematic Inverse Risk Calibration: models disproportionately exhibit stronger refusal behaviors for low-likelihood (high-cost) threats while remaining vulnerable to high-likelihood (low-cost) queries. We demonstrate that this miscalibration creates a structural vulnerability: by exploiting this property, we increase the attack success rate of existing jailbreaks by up to $2\\times$. Finally, we trace the root cause of this failure using linear probing, which reveals that while models encode severity in their latent space to drive refusal decisions, they possess no distinguishable internal representation of execution cost, making them \"blind\" to this critical dimension of risk."

They are key $γ$-ray sources providing a unique laboratory for studying extreme particle acceleration and plasma physics. Variability in $γ$-ray emission is an important signature that may constrain the size of the emission region and the physical processes driving flares. However, current large-scale $γ$-ray catalogs, such as the Fermi-LAT 4LAC-DR3, typically characterize variability only on long timescales (yearly or 60-day), lacking necessary constraints on short-term behavior from days to weeks. To address this, we systematically characterize $γ$-ray variability in AGNs across short timescales: 3-day, 7-day (weekly), and 30-day (monthly). We present a preliminary catalogue of variable AGN based on light curves from the Fermi-LAT Light Curve Repository. We show that the variability amplitude ($σ_{\\rm NXS}^{2}$) presents similar values across different timescales, potentially increasing for a subsample of sources as the observation timescale increases. This high-cadence analysis reinforces the known dichotomy between flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) and BL Lacertae objects (BL Lacs), with FSRQs consistently exhibiting stronger variability. By identifying the most luminous and variable sources at each timescale, we highlight key targets for follow-up with next-generation observatories such as the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO), ASTRI Mini-Array, and the Southern Wide-field Gamma-ray Observatory (SWGO), where strong short-term variability suggests highly compact emission zones and extreme particle acceleration efficiency. This catalogue contributes to the understanding of high-energy outflows in AGN jets and provides a foundation for optimizing observational strategies through a unified variability metric across timescales."

However, this task poses significant challenges due to self-occlusion of the hands and occlusions caused by interactions with objects. In this paper, we propose HandMCM to address these challenges. Our HandMCM is a novel method based on the powerful state space model (Mamba). By incorporating modules for local information injection/filtering and correspondence modeling, the proposed correspondence Mamba effectively learns the highly dynamic kinematic topology of keypoints across various occlusion scenarios. Moreover, by integrating multi-modal image features, we enhance the robustness and representational capacity of the input, leading to more accurate hand pose estimation. Empirical evaluations on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods, particularly in challenging scenarios involving severe occlusions. These results highlight the potential of our approach to advance the accuracy and reliability of 3D hand pose estimation in practical applications."

While such gains are promising, a fundamental question remains: where do these improvements come from, and what cost is paid to achieve them? In this work, we study this question through the lens of robustness to distributional shifts at the channel output. We evaluate both input-dependent adversarial perturbations (FGM and projected gradient methods under $\\ell_2$ constraints) and universal adversarial perturbations that apply a single norm-bounded shift to all received vectors. Our results show that recent AI decoders, including ECCT and CrossMPT, could suffer significant performance degradation under such perturbations, despite superior nominal performance under i.i.d. AWGN. Moreover, adversarial perturbations transfer relatively strongly between AI decoders but weakly to BP-based decoders, and universal perturbations are substantially more harmful than random perturbations of equal norm. These numerical findings suggest a potential robustness cost and higher sensitivity to channel distribution underlying recent AI decoding gains."

Prior targeted transfer attacks often overfit surrogate-specific embedding space by relying on a single reference and emphasizing final-layer alignment, which underutilizes intermediate semantics and degrades transfer across heterogeneous VLMs. To address this, we propose SGHA-Attack, a Semantic-Guided Hierarchical Alignment framework that adopts multiple target references and enforces intermediate-layer consistency. Concretely, we generate a visually grounded reference pool by sampling a frozen text-to-image model conditioned on the target prompt, and then carefully select the Top-K most semantically relevant anchors under the surrogate to form a weighted mixture for stable optimization guidance. Building on these anchors, SGHA-Attack injects target semantics throughout the feature hierarchy by aligning intermediate visual representations at both global and spatial granularities across multiple depths, and by synchronizing intermediate visual and textual features in a shared latent subspace to provide early cross-modal supervision before the final projection. Extensive experiments on open-source and commercial black-box VLMs show that SGHA-Attack achieves stronger targeted transferability than prior methods and remains robust under preprocessing and purification defenses."

To bridge this gap, we introduce WildGraphBench, a benchmark designed to assess GraphRAG performance in the wild. We leverage Wikipedia's unique structure, where cohesive narratives are grounded in long and heterogeneous external reference documents, to construct a benchmark reflecting real-word scenarios. Specifically, we sample articles across 12 top-level topics, using their external references as the retrieval corpus and citation-linked statements as ground truth, resulting in 1,100 questions spanning three levels of complexity: single-fact QA, multi-fact QA, and section-level summarization. Experiments across multiple baselines reveal that current GraphRAG pipelines help on multi-fact aggregation when evidence comes from a moderate number of sources, but this aggregation paradigm may overemphasize high-level statements at the expense of fine-grained details, leading to weaker performance on summarization tasks.

While NVFP4 mitigates quantization error via hierarchical microscaling, a persistent loss gap remains compared to BF16. This study conducts a longitudinal analysis of outlier dynamics across architecture during NVFP4 pretraining, focusing on where they localize, why they occur, and how they evolve temporally. We find that, compared with Softmax Attention (SA), Linear Attention (LA) reduces per-tensor heavy tails but still exhibits persistent block-level spikes under block quantization. Our analysis attributes outliers to specific architectural components: Softmax in SA, gating in LA, and SwiGLU in FFN, with \"post-QK\" operations exhibiting higher sensitivity to quantization. Notably, outliers evolve from transient spikes early in training to a small set of persistent hot channels (i.e., channels with persistently large magnitudes) in later stages. Based on these findings, we introduce Hot-Channel Patch (HCP), an online compensation mechanism that identifies hot channels and reinjects residuals using hardware-efficient kernels. We then develop CHON, an NVFP4 training recipe integrating HCP with post-QK operation protection. On GLA-1.3B model trained for 60B tokens, CHON reduces the loss gap to BF16 from 0.94% to 0.58% while maintaining downstream accuracy."

To enable fine-grained, controllable analysis, we introduce Auto-Comp, a fully automated and synthetic pipeline for generating scalable benchmarks. Its controllable nature is key to dissecting and isolating different reasoning skills. Auto-Comp generates paired images from Minimal (e.g., \"a monitor to the left of a bicycle on a white background\") and LLM-generated Contextual captions (e.g., \"In a brightly lit photography studio, a monitor is positioned to the left of a bicycle\"), allowing a controlled A/B test to disentangle core binding ability from visio-linguistic complexity. Our evaluation of 20 VLMs on novel benchmarks for color binding and spatial relations reveals universal compositional failures in both CLIP and SigLIP model families. Crucially, our novel \"Confusion Benchmark\" reveals a deeper flaw beyond simple attribute swaps: models are highly susceptible to low-entropy distractors (e.g., repeated objects or colors), demonstrating their compositional failures extend beyond known bag-of-words limitations. we uncover a surprising trade-off: visio-linguistic context, which provides global scene cues, aids spatial reasoning but simultaneously hinders local attribute binding by introducing visual clutter.

During the collision detection phase, contact points are localized with particle-centric geometric primitives; during the contact resolution phase, we cast frictional contact as a Nonlinear Complementarity Problem (NCP) over contact impulses and solve it with an Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) scheme. Crucially, the formulation reuses the same implicit MPM linearization, yielding efficiency and numerical stability. The method integrates seamlessly into the implicit MPM loop and is agnostic to modeling choices, including material laws, interpolation functions, and transfer schemes. We evaluate it across seven representative scenes that span elastic and elasto-plastic responses, simple and complex deformable geometries, and a wide range of contact conditions. Overall, the proposed method enables accurate contact localization, reliable frictional handling, and broad generality, making it a practical solution for MPM-based simulations in robotics and related domains."

However, practical adoption is hindered by the reliance on gradient-based optimization to estimate model parameters on a per-image basis - a process that is computationally intensive and difficult to scale. Initialization strategies for SMoE are an essential component that directly affects convergence and reconstruction quality. In this paper, we propose a novel, edge-based initialization scheme that achieves good reconstruction qualities while reducing the need for stochastic optimization significantly. Through a method that leverages Canny edge detection to extract a sparse set of image contours, kernel positions and orientations are deterministically inferred. A separate approach enables the direct estimation of initial expert coefficients. This initialization reduces both memory consumption and computational cost."

In this paper, we propose to follow this line of work by characterizing inexact proximal operators, thus providing an answer to what constitutes a good approximation of these operators. We propose several definitions of approximations and discuss their regularity, approximation power, and their fixed points. Equipped with these characterizations, we investigate the convergence of proximal algorithms in the presence of errors that may be non-summable and/or non-vanishing. In particular, we look at the proximal point algorithm, and at the forward-backward, Peaceman-Rachford and Douglas-Rachford algorithms when we minimize the sum of a weakly convex function (whose proximal operator is approximated) and a strongly convex function."

    "abstract": "World models have demonstrated significant promise for data synthesis in autonomous driving. However, existing methods predominantly concentrate on single-modality generation, typically focusing on either multi-camera video or LiDAR sequence synthesis. In this paper, we propose UniDriveDreamer, a single-stage unified multimodal world model for autonomous driving, which directly generates multimodal future observations without relying on intermediate representations or cascaded modules. Our framework introduces a LiDAR-specific variational autoencoder (VAE) designed to encode input LiDAR sequences, alongside a video VAE for multi-camera images. To ensure cross-modal compatibility and training stability, we propose Unified Latent Anchoring (ULA), which explicitly aligns the latent distributions of the two modalities. The aligned features are fused and processed by a diffusion transformer that jointly models their geometric correspondence and temporal evolution. Additionally, structured scene layout information is projected per modality as a conditioning signal to guide the synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniDriveDreamer outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in both video and LiDAR generation, while also yielding measurable improvements in downstream"

    "abstract": "R1-style LLMs have attracted growing attention for their capacity for self-reflection, yet the internal mechanisms underlying such behavior remain unclear. To bridge this gap, we anchor on the onset of reflection behavior and trace its layer-wise activation trajectory. Using the logit lens to read out token-level semantics, we uncover a structured progression: (i) Latent-control layers, where an approximate linear direction encodes the semantics of thinking budget; (ii) Semantic-pivot layers, where discourse-level cues, including turning-point and summarization cues, surface and dominate the probability mass; and (iii) Behavior-overt layers, where the likelihood of reflection-behavior tokens begins to rise until they become highly likely to be sampled. Moreover, our targeted interventions uncover a causal chain across these stages: prompt-level semantics modulate the projection of activations along latent-control directions, thereby inducing competition between turning-point and summarization cues in semantic-pivot layers, which in turn regulates the sampling likelihood of reflection-behavior tokens in behavior-overt layers. Collectively, our findings suggest a human-like meta-cognitive process-progressing from latent monitoring, to discourse-level regulation, and to finally overt self-reflection.

By varying the number of embedded electrons from 2 to 8, aromatic systems saturate near 63-64 percent, while linear molecules such as carbon dioxide reach 68 percent. All systems converge within two embedding iterations under relaxed self-consistency thresholds, highlighting the robustness of the approach.

    "abstract": "Quantum many-body systems pose a formidable computational challenge due to the exponential growth of their Hilbert space. While machine learning (ML) has shown promise as an alternative paradigm, most applications remain at the proof-of-concept stage, focusing narrowly on energy estimation at the lower end of the spectrum. Here, we push ML beyond this frontier by extensively testing HubbardNet, a deep neural network architecture for the Bose-Hubbard model. Pushing improvements in the optimizer and learning rates, and introducing physics-informed output activations that can resolve extremely small wave-function amplitudes, we achieve ground-state energy errors reduced by orders of magnitude and wave-function fidelities exceeding 99%. We further assess physical relevance by analysing generalized inverse participation ratios and multifractal dimensions for ground and excited states in one and two dimensions, demonstrating that optimized ML models reproduce localization, delocalization, and multifractality trends across the spectrum. Crucially, these qualitative predictions remain robust across four decades of the interaction strength, e.g. spanning across superfluid, Mott-insulating, as well as quantum chaotic regimes. Together, these results suggest ML as a viable qualitative predictor of many-body structure, complementing the quantitative strengths of exact diagonalization and tensor-network methods."

While effective, such evaluations remain confined to finite, dataset-bounded samples, leaving the broader impact of editing on the model's knowledge system insufficiently understood. To address this gap, we introduce Embedding-Virtualized Knowledge (EVK) that characterizes model knowledge through controlled perturbations in embedding space, enabling the exploration of a substantially broader and virtualized knowledge region beyond explicit data annotations. Based on EVK, we construct an embedding-level evaluation benchmark EVK-Bench that quantifies potential knowledge drift induced by editing, revealing effects that are not captured by conventional sample-based metrics. Furthermore, we propose a plug-and-play EVK-Align module that constrains embedding-level knowledge drift during editing and can be seamlessly integrated into existing editing methods. Experiments demonstrate that our approach enables more comprehensive evaluation while significantly improving knowledge preservation without sacrificing editing accuracy."

We hypothesize that this behavior stems from distributional shift in fake samples and implicit priors learned during training. Specifically, models tend to overfit to superficial artifacts that do not generalize well across different generation methods, leading to a misaligned decision threshold when faced with test-time distribution shift. To address this, we propose a theoretically grounded post-hoc calibration framework based on Bayesian decision theory. In particular, we introduce a learnable scalar correction to the model's logits, optimized on a small validation set from the target distribution while keeping the backbone frozen. This parametric adjustment compensates for distributional shift in model output, realigning the decision boundary even without requiring ground-truth labels. Experiments on challenging benchmarks show that our approach significantly improves robustness without retraining, offering a lightweight and principled solution for reliable and adaptive AI-generated image detection in the open world.

Under suitable assumptions in the model, an explicit solution is given to the value function and a precise description of the optimal strategy is obtained."

Accent-agnostic approaches improve robustness yet struggle with heavily accented or unseen varieties, while accent-specific methods rely on limited and often noisy labels. We introduce Moe-Ctc, a Mixture-of-Experts architecture with intermediate CTC supervision that jointly promotes expert specialization and generalization. During training, accent-aware routing encourages experts to capture accent-specific patterns, which gradually transitions to label-free routing for inference. Each expert is equipped with its own CTC head to align routing with transcription quality, and a routing-augmented loss further stabilizes optimization. Experiments on the Mcv-Accent benchmark demonstrate consistent gains across both seen and unseen accents in low- and high-resource conditions, achieving up to 29.3% relative WER reduction over strong FastConformer baselines."

While electrostatic gating is widely applied to gain charge control in TMDC monolayers, charge transfer can also be engineered via coupling of TMDC monolayers at semiconductor III/V, organic, or van der Waals interfaces. This confers great advantages, such as ease in implementation and compatibility in device integration. Here, we shed light on the optical properties of many-particle complexes emerging at the GaInP/MoSe2 interface as a highly relevant material combination to manipulate the optical properties of TMDCs in integrated photonic devices. Our study verifies its nature as a type II hetero-interface, which bears the feasibility to display disorder-free photoluminescence. Through optical absorption measurements, we verify that the charged complexes acquire substantial oscillator strength. Furthermore, temperature-dependent photoluminescence, supported by a microscopic theory framework, evidences the suppression of the characteristic carrier recoil effect that was previously observed in the photoluminescence of trions in TMDCs. These phenomena allow us to identify the optical signatures at the TMDC-GaInP interface as Fermi polaron quasiparticle resonances, which are of high importance in researching Bose-Fermi mixtures in condensed matter systems."

However, estimating Epistemic Uncertainty(EU) via Deep Ensembles is computationally prohibitive at the scale of modern models. We propose a framework that leverages the small draft models to efficiently estimate token-level EU, bypassing the need for full-scale ensembling. Theoretically grounded in a Bias-Variance Decomposition, our approach approximates EU via Jensen-Shannon divergence among drafts (variance proxy) and KL divergence between the draft mixture and the target (bias proxy). To further ensure accuracy without significant overhead, we introduce Online Stochastic Distillation (OSD) to efficiently approximate target aggregation and the Data-Diverse Drafts (DDD) strategy to enhance draft diversity for better target approximation. Extensive experiments on GSM8K demonstrate that our method reduces the estimation error (RMSE) by up to 37% compared to baselines. Crucially, our approach achieves Hallucination Detection performance competitive with heavy perturbation-based methods like TokUR while incurring negligible inference costs, offering a practical solution for uncertainty-aware LLM deployment."

We show that the behaviour can be understood in terms of weakly-interacting repulsively-bound few-body clusters. Signatures of cluster behaviour are observed in the expectation values of observables which oscillate at frequencies characterised by the energies of few-body boundstates. Using a semiclassical theory for interacting clusters, we predict the long-time growth of the cloud width to be a power law in the logarithm of time. This slow thermalisation of bound clusters represents a form of quantum many-body scars."

We reflect on the visual occlusion issue and identify its essence as the absence of information useful for task completion. Inspired by this, we come up with the more fundamental problem of Exploratory and Focused Manipulation (EFM). The proposed problem is about actively collecting information to complete challenging manipulation tasks that require exploration or focus. As an initial attempt to address this problem, we establish the EFM-10 benchmark that consists of 4 categories of tasks that align with our definition (10 tasks in total). We further come up with a Bimanual Active Perception (BAP) strategy, which leverages one arm to provide active vision and another arm to provide force sensing while manipulating. Based on this idea, we collect a dataset named BAPData for the tasks in EFM-10. With the dataset, we successfully verify the effectiveness of the BAP strategy in an imitation learning manner. We hope that the EFM-10 benchmark along with the BAP strategy can become a cornerstone that facilitates future research towards this direction. Project website: EFManipulation.github.io."

We show that the proposed flux-correction form preserves third-order accuracy, provided that the general numerical flux is evaluated with the left and right states that are computed exactly for a quadratic function, which can be achieved effectively by the U-MUSCL scheme with κ = 1/2.

In this work, we compare LLM and FCA to better understand their strengths and weakneses in the topic modeling field. FCA is evaluated through the CREA pipeline used in past experiments on topic modeling and visualization, whereas GPT-5 is used for the LLM. A strategy based on three prompts is applied with GPT-5 in a zero-shot setup: topic generation from document batches, merging of batch results into final topics, and topic labeling.

In this study, we construct realistic mock ELG samples with IllustrisTNG hydrodynamical simulations and stellar population synthesis framework. In order to validate the modelling of clustering, we measure the anisotropic correlation functions of mock ELGs and infer the linear growth rate, which is one of key cosmological parameters in galaxy clustering. As a control sample, we construct the mass-limited subhalo samples with the same number density as ELGs. The isotropic correlation functions in real space for both samples do not differ significantly. However, the quadrupole moment of the anisotropic correlation function, which is sensitive to the velocity of galaxies, is suppressed for ELGs, potentially due to the infalling motion of ELGs towards the centre of the hosting halos. The smaller amplitude leads to the underestimation of the linear growth rate and implies the velocity bias between ELGs and dark matter. When the analysis is limited to large scales $(\\gtrsim 15 \\, h^{-1} \\, \\mathrm{Mpc})$, the parameter bias vanishes. Next, we investigate the ELG-halo connection through the phase-space distribution of satellite ELGs within hosting halos and galactic conformity of star formation activity. The infalling motion is further confirmed by the phase-space distribution relative to the host halo, and this dynamics of ELGs challenges the assumption that the radial distribution of satellites follows that of dark matter."

Analysis of end-of-course feedback from 19 students reveals high satisfaction (mean scores 4.4-4.6/5.0) across engagement, conceptual learning, and assessment fairness. Students particularly valued the reduced cognitive load from debugging, enabling deeper focus on NLP concepts. However, challenges emerged around time constraints, LLM output verification, and the need for clearer task specifications.

However, its relatively low thermal conductivity is not optimal from the viewpoints of fuel integrity and safety margins, particularly during loss-of-coolant accidents. Although the development of accident-tolerant fuels with higher thermal conductivity is strongly desired, many potential uranium compounds remain unexplored due to constraints associated with handling radioactive materials. To efficiently screen promising uranium compounds with high thermal conductivity, past studies have leveraged machine-learning models to accelerate the discovery process. In this study, we experimentally examine the model's predictions by fabricating UCo and measuring its high-temperature thermophysical properties. Our results show that the thermal conductivity of UCo predicted by machine learning is in good agreement with the experimental measurements. Despite slight discrepancies, additional SHAP analysis suggests that the model's decision logic is consistent with known physical trends. Overall, this study fills a gap in reported thermophysical properties of UCo and provides experimental support for machine-learning-assisted screening of uranium compounds relevant to advanced fuel development."

This introduces a novel barrier mechanism: quantum pressure creates an effective barrier inside the vortex channel, set by the constriction width, which controls the superflow. Tuning the interspecies interaction strength drives a crossover from the hydrodynamic transport to Josephson tunneling regime. Long-range dipolar interactions further tune the weak-link properties, enabling both short links and two coupled junctions in series. Circuit models quantitatively capture the dc current-phase relations for both configurations.

    "abstract": "Meteor spectroscopy presents new opportunities for investigating the diversity of small Solar System bodies and capturing the real distribution of present material types. We analyze 180 higher-resolution meteor spectra from the All-sky Meteor Orbit System (AMOS) network to identify meteoroids with atypical compositions. In addition to several iron bodies, we identify the first two achondritic meteoroids in our database, both likely meteorite-dropping impactors, and compare them with a reference ordinary chondrite meteoroid observed under similar conditions. Their spectra show strong compositional departures: one case has strong Mg and Si with low Fe, while the other has strong Ca, Al and Ti with low Mg. Derived relative elemental abundances imply an aubrite-like and a eucrite-like composition. The aubrite-like meteoroid exhibits unexpected enhancements in Ca, Mn and Ti in short-lived intensity spikes, which we interpret as rapid release of localized inclusions rather than bulk enrichment. This indicates that transient spectral features can reveal internal heterogeneity in achondritic meteoroids beyond their average composition. Dynamical and physical properties are consistent with these classifications: the eucrite-like meteoroid originated from an inner-main-belt orbit influenced by the $ν_6$ resonance and shows compact ablation with low erosion and an estimated bulk density of 3.16 $\\pm$ 0.10 g cm -3; the aubrite-like meteoroid came from a short-period, low-eccentricity orbit similar to some E-type near-Earth asteroids. Both events show atypical light curves, but our results indicate that robust identification of achondritic meteoroids in surveys generally requires emission spectra. This work presents one of the first detailed studies of achondrites from meteor observations and provides reference properties of atypical meteors for future surveys."

    "abstract": "Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have become a popular and powerful framework for solving partial differential equations (PDEs), leveraging neural networks to approximate solutions while embedding PDE constraints, boundary conditions, and interface jump conditions directly into the loss function. However, most existing PINN approaches are based on multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), which may require large network sizes and extensive training to achieve high accuracy, especially for complex interface problems. In this work, we propose a novel PINN architecture based on Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), which offer greater flexibility in choosing activation functions and can represent functions with fewer parameters. Specifically, we introduce a dual KANs structure that couples two KANs across subdomains and explicitly enforces interface conditions. To further boost training efficiency and convergence, we integrate the RAR-D adaptive sampling strategy to dynamically refine training points. Numerical experiments on the elliptic interface problems yield more uniform error distributions across the computational domain, which demonstrates that our PINN-based KANs achieve superior accuracy with significantly smaller network sizes and faster convergence compared to standard PINNs."

    "abstract": "Recent advances in robot learning increasingly rely on LLM-based task planning, leveraging their ability to bridge natural language with executable actions. While prior works showcased great performances, the widespread adoption of these models in robotics has been challenging as 1) existing methods are often closed-source or computationally intensive, neglecting the actual deployment on real-world physical systems, and 2) there is no universally accepted, plug-and-play representation for robotic task generation. Addressing these challenges, we propose BTGenBot-2, a 1B-parameter open-source small language model that directly converts natural language task descriptions and a list of robot action primitives into executable behavior trees in XML. Unlike prior approaches, BTGenBot-2 enables zero-shot BT generation, error recovery at inference and runtime, while remaining lightweight enough for resource-constrained robots. We further introduce the first standardized benchmark for LLM-based BT generation, covering 52 navigation and manipulation tasks in NVIDIA Isaac Sim. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that BTGenBot-2 consistently outperforms GPT-5, Claude Opus 4.1, and larger open-source models across both functional and non-functional metrics, achieving average success rates of 90.38% in zero-shot and 98.07% in one-shot, while delivering up to 16x faster inference compared to the previous BTGenBot."

    "abstract": "This paper describes a setup aimed at measuring the so-called Tilt-To-Length (TTL) coupling in the optical benches of the LISA mission. The TTL is the coupling of the angular jitter of any optical setup into the optical path length between its input and output pupils. This might be deleterious in laser ranging experiments and must be evaluated for further compensation. The setup is made of two laser beams, one features an angular jitter that mimics the input beam as seen from the jittering bench under test (BUT), the other is aligned to the optical axis of the BUT and provides a phase reference for the jittering beam. The induced phase variations between both beams detected at the BUT's output pupil gives access to the TTL coupling. The ''TTL probe'' must feature a negligible residual TTL coupling which implies a micrometric accuracy in the centering of the setup pupil, the beams and the angular jitter associated pivot point. The setup integrates optical masks as a link between the setup optical reference frame to its mechanical reference frame, together with position memories and servo-loops for the beam's alignment. We show that the stability, the accuracy, and the noise floor of the setup is compliant with the LISA specifications for the TTL mitigation, although it makes use of off-the-shelf components and is operated in a standard environment laboratory."

Concretely, for mixture contexts $ν= I^{-1} \\sum_{i=1}^I μ^{(i^*)}$ and a query $x_{\\mathrm{q}}(i^*)$, the task decomposes into (i) recall of the relevant component $μ^{(i^*)}$ and (ii) prediction from $(μ_{i^*},x_\\mathrm{q})$. We study learned softmax attention (not a frozen kernel) trained by empirical risk minimization and show that a shallow measure-theoretic Transformer composed with an MLP learns the recall-and-predict map under a spectral assumption on the input densities. We further establish a matching minimax lower bound with the same rate exponent (up to multiplicative constants), proving sharpness of the convergence order. The framework offers a principled recipe for designing and analyzing Transformers that recall from arbitrarily long, distributional contexts with provable generalization guarantees."

Yet, its application to time series experiments, where policies are sequentially assigned over time, remains challenging. Existing designs suffer from two limitations: (i) they do not fully leverage the entire history for treatment allocation; (ii) they rely on strong assumptions to approximate the objective function (e.g., the mean squared error of the estimated treatment effect) for optimizing the design. We first establish an impossibility theorem showing that failure to condition on the full history leads to suboptimal designs, due to the dynamic dependencies in time series experiments. To address both limitations simultaneously, we next propose a transformer reinforcement learning (RL) approach which leverages transformers to condition allocation on the entire history and employs RL to directly optimize the MSE without relying on restrictive assumptions. Empirical evaluations on synthetic data, a publicly available dispatch simulator, and a real-world ridesharing dataset demonstrate that our proposal consistently outperforms existing designs."

Trained on 33B tokens in 40 B200 GPU-hours, Proust achieves Spearman $ρ= 0.390$ on ProteinGym substitutions, competitive with MLMs requiring 50--200$\\times$ the compute. On indels, Proust sets a new state-of-the-art, outperforming models up to 20$\\times$ larger. On EVEREST viral fitness benchmarks, it approaches structure-aware methods using sequence alone. These powerful representations position Proust in a sweet spot as it also retains native generative capabilities that MLMs lack by design. Interpretability analysis reveals that per-position entropy variance predicts, to an extent, when retrieval augmentation helps and hurts. Such insights can grow in both quantity and quality at scale and inform capabilities such as test-time scaling. Code and weights are available at https://github.com/Furkan9015/proust-inference"

Here, based on group theory analysis, we present a scheme for rapidly identifying the Weyl-Dirac nodal lines (a complex of Weyl and Dirac nodal lines) in bosonic systems. We find only 5 of the 230 space groups host Weyl-Dirac nodal line phonons. Notably, the Dirac nodal line resides along the high-symmetry line, whereas the Weyl nodal line is distributed on the high-symmetry plane and is interconnected with the Dirac nodal line, jointly forming a composite nodal network structure. Unlike traditional nodal nets, this nodal network exhibits markedly distinct surface states on different surfaces, which can be attributed to the fundamental differences in the topological properties between the Weyl and Dirac nodal lines. This unique property thus allows the material to present distinct surface states in a termination-selective manner. Furthermore, by first-principles calculations, we identify the materials NdRhO$_{3}$ and ZnSe$_{2}$O$_{5}$ as candidate examples to elaborate the Weyl-Dirac nodal line and their related topological features. Our work provides an insight for exploring and leveraging topological properties in systems with coexisting multiple topological states."

AXE uses a specialized \"pruning\" mechanism to strip away boilerplate and irrelevant nodes, leaving behind a distilled, high-density context that allows a tiny 0.6B LLM to generate precise, structured outputs. To keep the model honest, we implement Grounded XPath Resolution (GXR), ensuring every extraction is physically traceable to a source node. Despite its low footprint, AXE achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance, outperforming several much larger, fully-trained alternatives with an F1 score of 88.1% on the SWDE dataset.

This paper introduces a novel architecture that extends the Vector RISC-V Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) to integrate a tightly coupled DIMC unit directly into the execution stage of the pipeline, to accelerate Deep Learning inference at the edge. Specifically, the proposed approach adds four custom instructions dedicated to data loading, computation, and write-back, enabling flexible and optimal control of the inference execution on the target architecture. Experimental results demonstrate high utilization of the DIMC tile in Vector RISC-V and sustained throughput across the ResNet-50 model, achieving a peak performance of 137 GOP/s. The proposed architecture achieves a speedup of 217x over the baseline core and 50x area-normalized speedup even when operating near the hardware resource limits.

Adding entropy regularization during SFT is not a cure-all; it tends to flatten token distributions toward uniformity, increasing entropy without improving meaningful exploration capability. In this paper, we propose CurioSFT, an entropy-preserving SFT method designed to enhance exploration capabilities through intrinsic curiosity. It consists of (a) Self-Exploratory Distillation, which distills the model toward a self-generated, temperature-scaled teacher to encourage exploration within its capability; and (b) Entropy-Guided Temperature Selection, which adaptively adjusts distillation strength to mitigate knowledge forgetting by amplifying exploration at reasoning tokens while stabilizing factual tokens. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks demonstrate that, in SFT stage, CurioSFT outperforms the vanilla SFT by 2.5 points on in-distribution tasks and 2.9 points on out-of-distribution tasks. We also verify that exploration capabilities preserved during SFT successfully translate into concrete gains in RL stage, yielding an average improvement of 5.0 points."

In this article, we propose a semiparametric framework for causal inference with derived outcomes obtained after intra-subject processing. This framework applies to settings with a modular structure, where intra-subject analyses are conducted independently across subjects and are followed by inter-subject analyses based on parameters from the intra-subject stage. We develop multiply robust estimators of causal parameters under rate conditions on both intra-subject and inter-subject models, which allows the use of flexible machine learning. We specialize the framework to a mediation setting and focus on the natural direct effect. For high dimensional inference, we employ a step-down procedure that controls the exceedance rate of the false discovery proportion. Simulation studies demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed approach. We apply our method to estimate the impact of stimulant medication on brain connectivity in children with autism spectrum disorder."

While there are many benchmarks of these models using validation errors and materials discovery tasks, their fidelity in reproducing the detailed features of potential energy surfaces (PES) is not understood to the same degree. We evaluate the accuracy of these potentials by systematically probing their predicted energy landscapes. Two-dimensional slices of the potential energy surface are constructed where the atomic positions are varied along selected Wyckoff degrees of freedom within a fixed crystal symmetry. This approach enables a direct, visual comparison of the interatomic potentials and DFT-calculated surfaces which reveals potential artifacts e.g., arising from unique local environments. Our analysis highlights the strengths and limitations of different potentials in capturing local minima, saddle points, and overall PES topology, offering insights into the physical accuracy of current pre-trained IAPs and providing benchmarks for future model development."

Continuous CSP monitoring could provide an objective proxy for functional asymmetries. Prior wearable approaches, however, mostly use specialized form factors and demonstrate limited performance. We therefore present CHOMP, the first system for chewing side detection using earphones. Employing OpenEarable 2.0, we collected data from 20 participants with microphones, a bone-conduction microphone, IMU, PPG, and a pressure sensor across eleven foods, five non-chewing activities, and three noise conditions. We apply the Continuous Wavelet Transform to each sensing modality and use the resulting multi-channel scalograms as inputs to CNN-based classifiers. Microphones achieve the strongest single-sensor unit performance, with median F1 scores of 94.5% in leave-one-food-out (LOFO) and 92.6% in leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) cross-validations. Fusing sensing modalities further improves performance to 97.7% for LOFO and 95.4% for LOSO, with additional evaluations under noise interference indicating robust performance.

    "abstract": "This report is divided into three main parts: 1. The first two chapters discuss the emission of Short GRB (SGRB) from binary mergers surrounded by a strong magnetic field. By introducing our model, we investigated the physics of the emission of SGRBs from rotating and charged rotating BHs. A rapidly spinning, strongly magnetized neutron star (millisecond magnetar) is the primary source of strong magnetic fields ranging from $10^{13}~\\rm to ~ 10^{16} G$. The decay of the magnetic field could power electromagnetic radiation, especially X-rays and gamma rays from NSs or NS-BH mergers as their primary sources. Considering the merger of compact bodies (NS-NS or NS-BH or BH-BH), we can obtain interesting results. 2. In the next two chapters, we reviewed the BH interiors to understand the nature of black hole interior information and evaporation from its initial to final phases via entropy variation. The evolution relation obtained from two types of entropy gives diverse understandings of the evaporation of BHs under Hawking radiation. 3. The fifth Chapter is related to BH configuration (information) entropy and the thermodynamic phase transition of $f(R)$ BH. Here, we consider a d$-$dimensional black hole (BH) in $f(R)$ gravity and analyze the effect of modified gravity on critical point parameters, the difference in number densities, and configuration entropy during the BH phase transition phenomenon. These results were also compared with charged AdS BH, the holographic dual of van der Waal's fluid, and hence the BH in modified gravity."

    "abstract": "Neural networks represent more features than they have dimensions via superposition, forcing features to share representational space. Current methods decompose activations into sparse linear features but discard geometric structure. We develop a theory for studying the geometric structre of features by analyzing the spectra (eigenvalues, eigenspaces, etc.) of weight derived matrices. In particular, we introduce the frame operator $F = WW^\\top$, which gives us a spectral measure that describes how each feature allocates norm across eigenspaces. While previous tools could describe the pairwise interactions between features, spectral methods capture the global geometry (``how do all features interact?''). In toy models of superposition, we use this theory to prove that capacity saturation forces spectral localization: features collapse onto single eigenspaces, organize into tight frames, and admit discrete classification via association schemes, classifying all geometries from prior work (simplices, polygons, antiprisms). The spectral measure formalism applies to arbitrary weight matrices, enabling diagnosis of feature localization beyond toy settings. These results point toward a broader program: applying operator theory to interpretability."

    "abstract": "Explainable AI (XAI) offers a growing number of algorithms that aim to answer specific questions about black-box models. What is missing is a principled way to consolidate explanatory information about a fixed black-box model into a persistent, auditable artefact, that accompanies the black-box throughout its life cycle. We address this gap by introducing the notion of a scientific theory of a black (SToBB). Grounded in Constructive Empiricism, a SToBB fulfils three obligations: (i) empirical adequacy with respect to all available observations of black-box behaviour, (ii) adaptability via explicit update commitments that restore adequacy when new observations arrive, and (iii) auditability through transparent documentation of assumptions, construction choices, and update behaviour. We operationalise these obligations as a general framework that specifies an extensible observation base, a traceable hypothesis class, algorithmic components for construction and revision, and documentation sufficient for third-party assessment. Explanations for concrete stakeholder needs are then obtained by querying the maintained record through interfaces, rather than by producing isolated method outputs. As a proof of concept, we instantiate a complete SToBB for a neural-network classifier on a tabular task and introduce the Constructive Box Theoriser (CoBoT) algorithm, an online procedure that constructs and maintains an empirically adequate rule-based surrogate as observations accumulate. Together, these contributions position SToBBs as a life cycle-scale, inspectable point of reference that supports consistent, reusable analyses and systematic external scrutiny."

    "abstract": "To achieve real-time interactive video generation, current methods distill pretrained bidirectional video diffusion models into few-step autoregressive (AR) models, facing an architectural gap when full attention is replaced by causal attention. However, existing approaches do not bridge this gap theoretically. They initialize the AR student via ODE distillation, which requires frame-level injectivity, where each noisy frame must map to a unique clean frame under the PF-ODE of an AR teacher. Distilling an AR student from a bidirectional teacher violates this condition, preventing recovery of the teacher's flow map and instead inducing a conditional-expectation solution, which degrades performance. To address this issue, we propose Causal Forcing that uses an AR teacher for ODE initialization, thereby bridging the architectural gap. Empirical results show that our method outperforms all baselines across all metrics, surpassing the SOTA Self Forcing by 19.3\\% in Dynamic Degree, 8.7\\% in VisionReward, and 16.7\\% in Instruction Following.

However, evaluating these visual and textual search abilities is still difficult, and existing benchmarks have two major limitations. First, existing benchmarks are not visual search-centric: answers that should require visual search are often leaked through cross-textual cues in the text questions or can be inferred from the prior world knowledge in current MLLMs. Second, overly idealized evaluation scenario: On the image-search side, the required information can often be obtained via near-exact matching against the full image, while the text-search side is overly direct and insufficiently challenging. To address these issues, we construct the Vision-DeepResearch benchmark (VDR-Bench) comprising 2,000 VQA instances. All questions are created via a careful, multi-stage curation pipeline and rigorous expert review, designed to assess the behavior of Vision-DeepResearch systems under realistic real-world conditions. Moreover, to address the insufficient visual retrieval capabilities of current MLLMs, we propose a simple multi-round cropped-search workflow. This strategy is shown to effectively improve model performance in realistic visual retrieval scenarios. Overall, our results provide practical guidance for the design of future multimodal deep-research systems. The code will be released in https://github.com/Osilly/Vision-DeepResearch."

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are routinely evaluated on language use tasks, yet their knowledge of linguistic structure remains poorly understood. Existing linguistic benchmarks typically focus on narrow phenomena, emphasize high-resource languages, and rarely evaluate metalinguistic knowledge-explicit reasoning about language structure rather than language use. Using accuracy and macro F1, together with majority-class and chance baselines, we analyse overall performance and examine variation by linguistic domains and language-related factors. Our results show that metalinguistic knowledge in current LLMs is limited: GPT-4o performs best but achieves only moderate accuracy (0.367), while open-source models lag behind. All models perform above chance but fail to outperform the majority-class baseline, suggesting they capture cross-linguistic patterns but lack fine-grained grammatical distinctions. Performance varies across linguistic domains, with lexical features showing the highest accuracy and phonological features among the lowest, partially reflecting differences in online visibility. At the language level, accuracy shows a strong association with digital language status: languages with higher digital presence and resource availability are evaluated more accurately, while low-resource languages show substantially lower performance. Analyses of predictive factors confirm that resource-related indicators (Wikipedia size, corpus availability) are more informative predictors of accuracy than geographical, genealogical, or sociolinguistic factors. Together, these results suggest that LLMs' metalinguistic knowledge is fragmented and shaped by data availability rather than generalizable grammatical competence across the world's languages. We release our benchmark as an open-source dataset to support systematic evaluation and encourage greater global linguistic diversity in future LLMs."

    "abstract": "Powered prostheses are capable of providing net positive work to amputees and have advanced in the past two decades. However, reducing amputee metabolic cost of walking remains an open problem. The Law of Intersegmental Coordination (ISC) has been observed across gaits and has been previously implicated in energy expenditure of walking, yet it has rarely been analyzed or applied within the context of lower-limb amputee gait. This law states that the elevation angles of the thigh, shank and foot over the gait cycle are not independent. In this work, we developed a method to analyze intersegmental coordination for lower-limb 3D kinematic data, to simplify ISC analysis. Moreover, inspired by motor control, biomechanics and robotics literature, we used our method to broaden ISC toward a new law of coordination of moments. We find these Elevation Space Moments (ESM), and present results showing a moment-based coordination for able bodied gait. We also analyzed ISC for amputee gait walking with powered and passive prosthesis, and found that while elevation angles remained planar, the ESM showed less coordination. We use ISC as a constraint to predict the shank angles/moments that would compensate for alterations due to a passive foot so as to mimic a healthy thigh angle/moment profile. This may have implications for improving powered prosthetic control. We developed the ISC3d toolbox that is freely available online, which may be used to compute kinematic and kinetic ISC in 3D. This provides a means to further study the role of coordination in gait and may help address fundamental questions of the neural control of human movement."

    "abstract": "We study localization driven solely by interparticle interactions in moiré lattice systems without intrinsic disorder or externally imposed quasiperiodic potentials. We consider a one-dimensional bilayer with incommensurate lattice constants, described by a spin-dependent Fermi-Hubbard-type model with short-range interlayer interactions, where quasiperiodicity emerges only through interactions. Exact diagonalization shows that quenching hopping in one layer generates an interaction-induced mosaic potential with multiple mobility edges. When both layers are dynamical, increasing interlayer interactions drives transitions among ergodic, critical, and many-body localized regimes, with energy-dependent coexistence in certain parameter ranges. An exact mapping to a noninteracting single-particle model on a higher-dimensional structured graph provides a unified interpretation of these results and suggests an experimentally accessible route to interaction-induced moiré physics and localization."

Consider that current methods rely on costly and time-consuming fine-grained annotations, such as patch/token-level annotations. This paper proposes a novel framework named Coupling Implicit and Explicit Cues (CIEC), which aims to achieve multimodal weakly-supervised manipulation localization for image-text pairs utilizing only coarse-grained image/sentence-level annotations. It comprises two branches, image-based and text-based weakly-supervised localization. For the former, we devise the Textual-guidance Refine Patch Selection (TRPS) module. It integrates forgery cues from both visual and textual perspectives to lock onto suspicious regions aided by spatial priors. Followed by the background silencing and spatial contrast constraints to suppress interference from irrelevant areas. For the latter, we devise the Visual-deviation Calibrated Token Grounding (VCTG) module. It focuses on meaningful content words and leverages relative visual bias to assist token localization. Followed by the asymmetric sparse and semantic consistency constraints to mitigate label noise and ensure reliability. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our CIEC, yielding results comparable to fully supervised methods on several evaluation metrics."

    "abstract": "Digital quantum computing promises to offer computational capabilities beyond the reach of classical systems, yet its capabilities are often challenged by scarce quantum resources. A critical bottleneck in this context is how to load classical or quantum data into quantum circuits efficiently. Approximate quantum loaders (AQLs) provide a viable solution to this problem by balancing fidelity and circuit complexity. However, most existing AQL methods are either heuristic or provide guarantees only for specific input types, and a general theoretical framework is still lacking. To address this gap, here we reformulate most AQL methods into a unified framework and establish information-theoretic bounds on their approximation error. Our analysis reveals that the achievable infidelity between the prepared state and target state scales linearly with the total entanglement entropy across subsystems when the loading circuit is applied to the target state. In light of this, we develop AQER, a scalable AQL method that constructs the loading circuit by systematically reducing entanglement in target states. We conduct systematic experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of AQER, using synthetic datasets, classical image and language datasets, and a quantum many-body state datasets with up to 50 qubits. The results show that AQER consistently outperforms existing methods in both accuracy and gate efficiency. Our work paves the way for scalable quantum data processing and real-world quantum computing applications."

We propose a fully automated, deep learning-based framework for fine-grained urban change analysis from large collections of historical maps, built on a modular design that integrates dense map alignment, multi-temporal object detection, and change profiling. This framework shifts the analysis of historical maps from ad hoc visual comparison toward systematic, quantitative characterization of urban change. Experiments demonstrate the robust performance of the proposed alignment and object detection methods. Applied to Paris between 1868 and 1937, the framework reveals the spatial and temporal heterogeneity in urban transformation, highlighting its relevance for research in the social sciences and humanities. The modular design of our framework further supports adaptation to diverse cartographic contexts and downstream applications."

The primary effect of different directions is not whether the model refuses, but how it refuses."

We present STAR-MD (Spatio-Temporal Autoregressive Rollout for Molecular Dynamics), a scalable SE(3)-equivariant diffusion model that generates physically plausible protein trajectories over microsecond timescales. Our key innovation is a causal diffusion transformer with joint spatio-temporal attention that efficiently captures complex space-time dependencies while avoiding the memory bottlenecks of existing methods. On the standard ATLAS benchmark, STAR-MD achieves state-of-the-art performance across all metrics--substantially improving conformational coverage, structural validity, and dynamic fidelity compared to previous methods. STAR-MD successfully extrapolates to generate stable microsecond-scale trajectories where baseline methods fail catastrophically, maintaining high structural quality throughout the extended rollout. Our comprehensive evaluation reveals severe limitations in current models for long-horizon generation, while demonstrating that STAR-MD's joint spatio-temporal modeling enables robust dynamics simulation at biologically relevant timescales, paving the way for accelerated exploration of protein function."

We provide decisive spectroscopic evidence that the low-energy reconstruction is governed by inter-orbital nesting between the $α$ and $β$ bands. Specifically, we resolve a orbital-dependent gap of $\\sim44$ meV on the $α$ pocket, a value quantitatively consistent with prior measurements, unifying previously conflicting experimental reports regarding the locus and magnitude of the DW gap. Furthermore, we reveal strong orbital-selective mass renormalization in the $d_{z^2}$ states and successfully resolve the long-sought intrinsic trilayer $β$-band splitting, establishing a critical lower bound for the outer-layer hopping.

Motivated by this, we propose order-expressive masked diffusion model (OeMDM) for a broad class of diffusion generative processes with various generation orders, enabling the interpretation of MDM, ARM, and block diffusion in a single framework. Furthermore, building on OeMDM, we introduce learnable-order masked diffusion model (LoMDM), which jointly learns the generation ordering and diffusion backbone through a single objective from scratch, enabling the diffusion model to generate text in context-dependent ordering. Empirically, we confirm that LoMDM outperforms various discrete diffusion models across multiple language modeling benchmarks."

    "abstract": "Existing Knowledge Distillation (KD) methods often align feature information between teacher and student by exploring meaningful feature processing and loss functions. However, due to the difference in feature distributions between the teacher and student, the student model may learn incompatible information from the teacher. To address this problem, we propose teacher-guided student Diffusion Self-KD, dubbed as DSKD. Instead of the direct teacher-student alignment, we leverage the teacher classifier to guide the sampling process of denoising student features through a light-weight diffusion model. We then propose a novel locality-sensitive hashing (LSH)-guided feature distillation method between the original and denoised student features. The denoised student features encapsulate teacher knowledge and could be regarded as a teacher role. In this way, our DSKD method could eliminate discrepancies in mapping manners and feature distributions between the teacher and student, while learning meaningful knowledge from the teacher. Experiments on visual recognition tasks demonstrate that DSKD significantly outperforms existing KD methods across various models and datasets. Our code is attached in supplementary material."

To deepen the understanding between LLM's internal states and its verbalized reasoning trajectories, we investigate the latent planning strength of LLMs, through our probing method, Tele-Lens, applying to hidden states across diverse task domains. Our empirical results indicate that LLMs exhibit a myopic horizon, primarily conducting incremental transitions without precise global planning. Leveraging this characteristic, we propose a hypothesis on enhancing uncertainty estimation of CoT, which we validate that a small subset of CoT positions can effectively represent the uncertainty of the entire path. We further underscore the significance of exploiting CoT dynamics, and demonstrate that automatic recognition of CoT bypass can be achieved without performance degradation.

The main focus is on multidimensional convex limiting techniques designed to constrain antidiffusive element contributions rather than fluxes. We show that the resulting schemes can be interpreted as residual distribution methods. Two kinds of convex limiting can be used to enforce the validity of generalized discrete maximum principles in this context. The first approach has the structure of a localized flux-corrected transport (FCT) algorithm, in which the computation of a low-order predictor is followed by an antidiffusive correction stage. The second option is the use of a monolithic convex limiting (MCL) procedure at the level of spatial semi-discretization. In both cases, inequality constraints are imposed on scalar functions of intermediate states that are required to stay in convex invariant sets."

The key insight is that cell identity is redundantly encoded across genes. We show predicting cell-level embeddings from partial observations forces the model to learn dropout-robust features. On cell-type clustering, Cell-JEPA achieves 0.72 AvgBIO in zero-shot transfer versus 0.53 for scGPT, a 36% relative improvement.

To address these issues, we present UrbanGS, a scalable reconstruction framework that effectively tackles these challenges for city-scale applications. First, we propose a Depth-Consistent D-Normal Regularization module. Unlike existing approaches that rely solely on monocular normal estimators, which can effectively update rotation parameters yet struggle to update position parameters, our method integrates D-Normal constraints with external depth supervision. This allows for comprehensive updates of all geometric parameters. By further incorporating an adaptive confidence weighting mechanism based on gradient consistency and inverse depth deviation, our approach significantly enhances multi-view depth alignment and geometric coherence, which effectively resolves the issue of geometric accuracy in complex large-scale scenes. To improve scalability, we introduce a Spatially Adaptive Gaussian Pruning (SAGP) strategy, which dynamically adjusts Gaussian density based on local geometric complexity and visibility to reduce redundancy. Additionally, a unified partitioning and view assignment scheme is designed to eliminate boundary artifacts and optimize computational load. Extensive experiments on multiple urban datasets demonstrate that UrbanGS achieves superior performance in rendering quality, geometric accuracy, and memory efficiency, providing a systematic solution for high-fidelity large-scale scene reconstruction."

This paper aims to learn robust sequential decision-making policies from such offline, multi-site datasets. To model cross-site uncertainty, we study distributionally robust MDPs with a group-linear structure: all sites share a common feature map, and both the transition kernels and expected reward functions are linear in these shared features. We introduce feature-wise (d-rectangular) uncertainty sets, which preserve tractable robust Bellman recursions while maintaining key cross-site structure. Building on this, we then develop an offline algorithm based on pessimistic value iteration that includes: (i) per-site ridge regression for Bellman targets, (ii) feature-wise worst-case (row-wise minimization) aggregation, and (iii) a data-dependent pessimism penalty computed from the diagonals of the inverse design matrices. We further propose a cluster-level extension that pools similar sites to improve sample efficiency, guided by prior knowledge of site similarity. Under a robust partial coverage assumption, we prove a suboptimality bound for the resulting policy. Overall, our framework addresses multi-site learning with heterogeneous data sources and provides a principled approach to robust planning without relying on strong state-action rectangularity assumptions."

    "abstract": "The introduction of the new multi-user linearly-separable distributed computing framework, has recently revealed how a parallel treatment of users can yield large parallelization gains with relatively low computation and communication costs. These gains stem from a new approach that converts the computing problem into a sparse matrix factorization problem; a matrix $F$ that describes the users' requests, is decomposed as \\(F = DE\\), where a \\(γ\\)-sparse \\(E\\) defines the task allocation across $N$ servers, and a \\(δ\\)-sparse \\(D\\) defines the connectivity between \\(N\\) servers and \\(K\\) users as well as the decoding process. While this approach provides near-optimal performance, its linear nature has raised data secrecy concerns. We here adopt an information-theoretic secrecy framework, seeking guarantees that each user can learn nothing more than its own requested function. In this context, our main result provides two necessary and sufficient secrecy criteria; (i) for each user \\(k\\) who observes $α_k$ server responses, the common randomness visible to that user must span a subspace of dimension exactly $α_k-1$, and (ii) for each user, removing from \\(\\mathbf{D}\\) the columns corresponding to the servers it observes must leave a matrix of rank at least \\(K-1\\). With these conditions in place, we design a general scheme -- that applies to finite and non-finite fields alike -- which is based on appending to \\(\\mathbf{E}\\) a basis of \\(\\mathrm{Null}(\\mathbf{D})\\) and by carefully injecting shared randomness. In many cases, this entails no additional costs. The scheme, while maintaining performance, guarantees perfect information-theoretic secrecy in the case of finite fields, while in the real case, the conditions yield an explicit mutual-information bound that can be made arbitrarily small by increasing the variance of Gaussian common randomness."

Nevertheless, at the limits of model capability, CoT often proves insufficient, and its strictly sequential nature constrains test-time scalability. A potential alternative is divide-and-conquer (DAC) reasoning, which decomposes a complex problem into subproblems to facilitate more effective exploration of the solution. Although promising, our analysis reveals a fundamental misalignment between general-purpose post-training and DAC-style inference, which limits the model's capacity to fully leverage this potential. To bridge this gap and fully unlock LLMs' reasoning capabilities on the most challenging tasks, we propose an end-to-end reinforcement learning (RL) framework to enhance their DAC-style reasoning capacity. At each step, the policy decomposes a problem into a group of subproblems, solves them sequentially, and addresses the original one conditioned on the subproblem solutions, with both decomposition and solution integrated into RL training. Under comparable training, our DAC-style framework endows the model with a higher performance ceiling and stronger test-time scalability, surpassing CoT by 8.6% in Pass@1 and 6.3% in Pass@32 on competition-level benchmarks."

While prior work has extensively explored depth expansion, width expansion remains significantly understudied, with the few existing methods limited to the early stages of training. However, expanding width during the mid-stage is essential for maximizing computational savings, yet it remains a formidable challenge due to severe training instabilities. Empirically, we show that naive initialization at this stage disrupts activation statistics, triggering loss spikes, while copy-based initialization introduces gradient symmetry that hinders feature diversity. To address these issues, we propose SPARKLING (balancing {S}ignal {P}reservation {A}nd symmet{R}y brea{K}ing for width-progressive {L}earn{ING}), a novel framework for mid-stage width expansion. Our method achieves signal preservation via RMS-scale consistency, stabilizing activation statistics during expansion. Symmetry breaking is ensured through asymmetric optimizer state resetting and learning rate re-warmup. Extensive experiments on Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models demonstrate that, across multiple width axes and optimizer families, SPARKLING consistently outperforms training from scratch and reduces training cost by up to 35% under $2\\times$ width expansion."

Thick, fully-depleted p-channel Skipper-CCDs provide low readout noise and high quantum efficiency for 1-10 keV X-rays, but their X-ray performance has not yet been demonstrated in the space environment. DarkNESS will operate in low-Earth orbit, where trapped protons induce displacement damage in the sensor that increases charge-transfer inefficiency and degrades the X-ray energy resolution. This work measures the X-ray line response of Skipper-CCDs before and after proton irradiation and quantifies the associated degradation. A sensor was exposed to 217 MeV protons at a fluence of 8.4 x 10^10 protons cm^-2, corresponding to a displacement-damage dose more than an order of magnitude above the three-year expectation for representative mid-inclination and Sun-synchronous low-Earth orbits. A 55Fe source was used to compare the energy resolution of the beam-exposed quadrant to adjacent unexposed quadrants and a non-irradiated reference sensor. These measurements provide a quantitative assessment of radiation-induced spectral degradation in Skipper-CCDs and enable an estimate of the end-of-life X-ray energy resolution expected for DarkNESS operation in low-Earth orbit."

Despite these benefits, traditional single-server FL suffers from high communication latency due to the aggregation of models from a large number of clients. While multi-server FL distributes workloads across edge servers, overlapping client coverage and uncoordinated selection often lead to resource contention, causing bandwidth conflicts and training failures. To address these limitations, we propose a decentralized reinforcement learning with conflict risk prediction, named RL CRP, to optimize client selection in multi-server FL systems. Specifically, each server estimates the likelihood of client selection conflicts using a categorical hidden Markov model based on its sparse historical client selection sequence. Then, a fairness-aware reward mechanism is incorporated to promote long-term client participation for minimizing training latency and resource contention. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed RL-CRP framework effectively reduces inter-server conflicts and significantly improves training efficiency in terms of convergence speed and communication cost."

We empirically characterize fine-grained MoE routing and uncover an informative pattern: router scores exhibit a certain head of high-confidence experts followed by an uncertain tail of low-confidence candidates. While single-run greedy accuracy remains stable when fewer experts are activated, multi-sample pass@n degrades significantly-suggesting that the certain head governs core reasoning capability while the uncertain tail correlates with reasoning diversity.

The hierarchy preserves locality and is organized into configurable layers within regions. Coordination across thousands of regions is achieved via virtual upper-layer roles dynamically mapped onto nodes up to the top layer. Each region maintains multiple active coordinators that monitor local health and perform dynamic re-selection if failures occur. Temporary drops below the minimum threshold do not compromise coordination, ensuring near-zero recovery latency, bounded communication overhead, and exponentially reduced failure probability while maintaining safety, liveness, and robustness under mobile, interference-prone, or adversarial conditions. Communication is decoupled from the hierarchy and may use multi-frequency wireless links. Two message hop strategies are supported: (i) with long-distance infrastructure-assisted channels, coordinators exploit the virtual tree to minimize hops; (ii) without such channels, messages propagate via adjacent regions. sVIRGO also supports Layer-Scoped Command Execution. Commands and coordination actions are executed within the scope of each hierarchical layer, enabling efficient local and regional decision-making while limiting unnecessary global propagation."

Canopy trees in particular play a disproportionate role in carbon storage and functioning of these ecosystems. Studying canopy trees at scale requires accurate delineation of individual tree crowns, typically performed using high-resolution aerial imagery. Despite advances in transformer-based models for individual tree crown segmentation, performance remains low in most forests, especially tropical ones. To this end, we introduce SelvaMask, a new tropical dataset containing over 8,800 manually delineated tree crowns across three Neotropical forest sites in Panama, Brazil, and Ecuador. SelvaMask features comprehensive annotations, including an inter-annotator agreement evaluation, capturing the dense structure of tropical forests and highlighting the difficulty of the task.

Our approach reaches state-of-the-art performance, outperforming both zero-shot generalist models and fully supervised end-to-end methods in dense tropical forests. We validate these gains on external tropical and temperate datasets, demonstrating that SelvaMask serves as both a challenging benchmark and a key enabler for generalized forest monitoring.

By the Batchelor-Gawedzki-type theorem (Kotov--Salnikov), every $\\mathbb{Z}$-graded manifold over base $M$ is noncanonically isomorphic to one associated with its canonical $\\mathbb{Z}$-graded bundle (Batchelor-Gawedzki bundle). In finite dimensions, this is the formal neighborhood of the zero section with the induced homogeneity structure. Kotov-Salnikov's graded Borel lemma extends weight-$k$ functions from the formal neighborhood to smooth ones of the same weight. Here, this generalizes to a Borel--Whitney theorem: homogeneity morphisms of formal neighborhoods lift to smooth homogeneity maps between Batchelor-Gawedzki bundles. Categorically, let $\\mathsf{B}_{\\mathbb{Z}}$ be the category of finite-dimensional $\\mathbb{Z}$-graded vector bundles with homogeneity morphisms, and $\\mathsf{Man}_{\\mathbb{Z}}$ the category of finite-dimensional $\\mathbb{Z}$-graded manifolds. The functor $\\mathsf{F}\\colon \\mathsf{B}_{\\mathbb{Z}} \\to \\mathsf{Man}_{\\mathbb{Z}}$ sends bundles to formal neighborhoods of their zero sections. The graded Batchelor-Gawedzki and Borel-Whitney theorems imply $\\mathsf{F}$ is full and surjective on objects."

    "abstract": "Electrical conductivity is the most fundamental charge transport parameter, and measurements of conductivity are a basic part of materials characterization for nearly all conducting materials. In thin films, conductivity is often measured in four bar architectures in which the current source and voltage measurement are spatially separated to eliminate systematic error due to contact resistance. Despite the apparent simplicity of these measurements, we demonstrate here that the four bar architecture is subject to significant systematic error arising from the finite conductivity of the metal electrodes. Remarkably, these systematic errors can in some cases become unbounded, producing arbitrarily high measured conductivity at modest true film conductivities, within the range relevant to emerging thin film thermoelectric materials such as conducting polymers. These unbounded errors, which can occur even in properly conducted four-point measurements of patterned films, likely explain literature reports of extremely high conductivities in conducting polymers, and can lead to anomalous scaling in temperature dependent studies, potentially leading to incorrect interpretation of the relevant charge transport mechanism. We characterize the device geometric factors that control these errors, which stand partially at odds with those required for accurate Seebeck coefficient measurements. Our analyses allow us to identify device architectures that provide small systematic errors for conductivity and Seebeck coefficient while still providing a low measurement resistance, critical to reducing noise in thermal voltage measurements. These findings provide important guidelines for accurate measurements in the growing field of thin-film thermoelectric materials."

    "abstract": "Modern machine learning has achieved remarkable success on many problems, but this success often depends on the existence of large, labeled datasets. While active learning can dramatically reduce labeling cost when annotations are expensive, early performance is frequently dominated by the initial seed set, typically chosen at random. In many applications, however, related or approximate datasets are readily available and can be leveraged to construct a better seed set. We introduce a new method for selecting the seed data set for active learning, Active-Transfer Bagging (ATBagging). ATBagging estimates the informativeness of candidate data point from a Bayesian interpretation of bagged ensemble models by comparing in-bag and out-of-bag predictive distributions from the labeled dataset, yielding an information-gain proxy. To avoid redundant selections, we impose feature-space diversity by sampling a determinantal point process (DPP) whose kernel uses Random Fourier Features and a quality-diversity factorization that incorporates the informativeness scores. This same blended method is used for selection of new data points to collect during the active learning phase. We evaluate ATBagging on four real-world datasets covering both target-transfer and feature-shift scenarios (QM9, ERA5, Forbes 2000, and Beijing PM2.5). Across seed sizes nseed = 10-100, ATBagging improves or ties early active learning and increases area under the learning-curve relative to alternative seed subset selection methodologies in almost all cases, with strongest benefits in low-data regimes. Thus, ATBagging provides a low-cost, high reward means to initiating active learning-based data collection."

ReasonEdit continuously stores human reasoning in a codebook, and retrieves only relevant facts during inference using a novel topology-balanced multimodal embedding method inspired by network science. Across four VLMs on multiple rationale-based visual question answering datasets, ReasonEdit achieves state-of-the-art editing performance, ultimately showing that using human reasoning during editing greatly improves edit generalization."

A special phase-modulation interferometry technique is implemented to increase the sensitivity for the comprehensive mapping of the strong-field induced high-order nonlinear response. We find that the dynamics arising from the interference of the two electric fields can be adequately described by the non-perturbative model developed by Lewenstein and co-workers."

We address this open question by establishing the first general framework for establishing generalization guarantees for tuning multi-dimensional hyperparameters in data-driven settings. Our approach strengthens the generalization guarantee framework for semi-algebraic function classes by exploiting tools from real algebraic geometry, yielding sharper, more broadly applicable guarantees. We then extend the analysis to hyperparameter tuning using the validation loss under minimal assumptions, and derive improved bounds when additional structure is available. Finally, we demonstrate the scope of the framework with new learnability results, including data-driven weighted group lasso and weighted fused lasso."

    "abstract": "Human motion analysis tasks, such as temporal 3D pose estimation, motion prediction, and motion in-betweening, play an essential role in computer vision. However, current paradigms suffer from severe fragmentation. First, the field is split between ``perception'' models that understand motion from video but only output text, and ``generation'' models that cannot perceive from raw visual input. Second, generative MLLMs are often limited to single-frame, static poses using dense, parametric SMPL models, failing to handle temporal motion. Third, existing motion vocabularies are built from skeleton data alone, severing the link to the visual domain. To address these challenges, we introduce Superman, a unified framework that bridges visual perception with temporal, skeleton-based motion generation. Our solution is twofold. First, to overcome the modality disconnect, we propose a Vision-Guided Motion Tokenizer. Leveraging the natural geometric alignment between 3D skeletons and visual data, this module pioneers robust joint learning from both modalities, creating a unified, cross-modal motion vocabulary. Second, grounded in this motion language, a single, unified MLLM architecture is trained to handle all tasks. This module flexibly processes diverse, temporal inputs, unifying 3D skeleton pose estimation from video (perception) with skeleton-based motion prediction and in-betweening (generation). Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks, including Human3.6M, demonstrate that our unified method achieves state-of-the-art or competitive performance across all motion tasks. This showcases a more efficient and scalable path for generative motion analysis using skeletons."

To address such issue of excessive zeros, zero-inflated and hurdle models introduce additional parameters that explicitly account for excess zeros, thereby improving the joint representation of zero and positive claim outcomes. These models have further been extended with random effects to accommodate longitudinal dependence and unobserved heterogeneity. However, their consistency with fundamental probabilistic principles in insurance, particularly stochastic monotonicity, has not been formally examined. This paper provides a rigorous analysis showing that standard counting random-effect models for excessive zeros may violate this property, leading to inconsistencies in posterior credibility. We then propose new classes of counting random-effect models that both accommodate excessive zeros and ensure stochastic monotonicity, thereby providing fair and theoretically coherent credibility adjustments as claim histories evolve."

To validate this threat, we present Slingshot, a 'cold-start' reinforcement learning framework that autonomously discovers emergent attack vectors, revealing a critical insight: in our setting, learned attacks tend to converge to short, instruction-like syntactic patterns rather than multi-turn persuasion. On held-out extreme-difficulty tasks, Slingshot achieves a 67.0% success rate against a Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct-AWQ Operator (vs. 1.7% baseline), reducing the expected attempts to first success (on solved tasks) from 52.3 to 1.3. Crucially, Slingshot transfers zero-shot to several model families, including closed-source models like Gemini 2.5 Flash (56.0% attack success rate) and defensive-fine-tuned open-source models like Meta-SecAlign-8B (39.2% attack success rate).

    "abstract": "Grain boundary (GB) migration governs microstructure evolution and can mediate plastic deformation through sliding or shear coupling. Numerous experimental and numerical studies have reported a wide range of behaviors associated with boundary migration, such as defect emission or mode switching. Notably, recent studies have reported directionally asymmetric migration rates under symmetric loading, attributing this behavior to intrinsically asymmetric mobility; however, a mechanistic mesoscale explanation for this behavior remains lacking. In this work, we introduce a constitutive flow rule for grain-boundary eigendeformation within a multiphase-field framework, in which interfacial shear evolves in response to its mechanically conjugate driving force through the phase field Allen-Cahn equations. The formulation systematically employs regularized grain boundary shear kinematics informed by crystallography, and enables elastic compatibility to modulate boundary motion. Migration thresholds, residual back-stress, and apparent directional asymmetry appear naturally as emergent mechanical behavior. Simulations of symmetric and asymmetric tilt grain boundaries under mechanical, synthetic, and curvature-driven loading reveal persistent defect-like residuals following incompatible migration, transitions from planar motion to lamination at large inclinations, and even \"ratcheting\" behavior. These results provide a mechanically transparent explanation for behaviors such as effective mobility asymmetry and establish elastic compatibility as a constitutive mechanism in mesoscale models of boundary-mediated plasticity."

    "abstract": "Direct preference optimization methods have emerged as a computationally efficient alternative to Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs). Latest approaches have streamlined the alignment process by deriving implicit reward functions, yet they often suffer from a critical objective mismatch: optimizing the relative margin between chosen and rejected responses does not guarantee the preservation of the chosen response's absolute likelihood. This can lead to ``unlearning'', where the model degrades the probability of high-quality outputs to satisfy margin constraints, and ``formatting collapse'' caused by the over-penalization of rejected sequences. In this work, we introduce SLIME (Stabilized Likelihood Implicit Margin Enforcement), a reference-free alignment objective designed to decouple preference learning from generation quality. SLIME incorporates a three-pronged objective: (1) an anchoring term to maximize the likelihood of preferred responses; (2) a stabilizing penalty that prevents the probabilities of rejected tokens from collapsing to zero; and (3) a dual-margin mechanism that combines hard and soft constraints for precise boundary shaping. Our results demonstrate that SLIME achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines while maintaining higher generation stability."

Low-friction assistants can become sycophantic, baking in implicit assumptions and pushing verification costs onto experts, while outcomes arrive too late to serve as reward signals. In deep-uncertainty decisions (where objectives are contested and reversals are costly), scaling fluent agreement amplifies poor commitments faster than it builds expertise. We argue reliable human-AI partnership requires a shift from answer generation to collaborative premise governance over a knowledge substrate, negotiating only what is decision-critical. A discrepancy-driven control loop operates over this substrate: detecting conflicts, localizing misalignment via typed discrepancies (teleological, epistemic, procedural), and triggering bounded negotiation through decision slices. Commitment gating blocks action on uncommitted load-bearing premises unless overridden under logged risk; value-gated challenge allocates probing under interaction cost. Trust then attaches to auditable premises and evidence standards, not conversational fluency. We illustrate with tutoring and propose falsifiable evaluation criteria."

We explicitly analyze the relationship between the LCS Calabi invariant and its symplectic counterpart, showing they are controlled by a multiplicative factor depending on the conformal weight.

The resulting framework provides a principled and flexible approach to high-quality data augmentation for downstream learning tasks in the target domain. From a theoretical perspective, we show that an empirical risk minimizer (ERM) trained on the augmented dataset achieves a tighter excess risk bound than the target-only ERM under mild conditions. In particular, we establish new convergence rates for the quantile matching estimator that governs the transfer bias-variance tradeoff.

The total entropy includes contributions from this atmosphere, and the Bekenstein entropy, which arises from the Gibbons--Hawking--York boundary term, which encodes topological information. We show that the contribution of the quantum atmosphere to the black hole specific heat is positive, indicating that the system may become thermodynamically stable. By analyzing homology groups, we show that the black hole evaporation is a tunneling between topologically distinct spacetimes: Schwarzschild ($χ= 2)$ transitions to the flat spacetime ($χ= 1$) via Hawking radiation, where $χ$ is the Euler characteristic, a topological invariant. This process resembles instanton-driven tunneling in Yang-Mills theories, where topologically non-trivial solutions dominate the vacuum amplitude. In our case, the Gibbons--Hawking--York term dominates the transition amplitude, which induces the evaporation process. These results corroborate the Parikh-Wilczek picture of Hawking radiation and the interpretation of Euclidean black holes as gravitational instantons."

A 2005 fusion-fission theory predicts mathematically that for armed groups operating in dynamically evolving clusters within a given conflict, the number of fatalities per conflict event will follow an approximate power-law distribution with exponent near 2.5, with the specific exponent value offering insight into the relative robustness of larger versus smaller clusters of fighters in that armed group. Since Yemen and Syria are current hotspots for future conflict, yet their most recent conflicts (2023-2025) have not been studied at the event level, we use ACLED data to determine their best-fit exponent value as each conflict evolved. We find that the exponent lies between 2.5 and 3.5 predominantly throughout each conflict, which suggests that the fighters in each of these conflicts continued to operate in smaller clusters as the conflict evolved. Moreover, temporary reductions in the exponent value -- which suggests a temporary increase in the robustness and involvement of larger clusters of fighters -- appear to arise during major crises ahead of the largest battles. Though the lack higher-quality data for these conflicts prevents us from establishing this more firmly, such a temporary reduction in the exponent value hints at its potential use as an early-warning signature."

Poorly located charging stations create coverage gaps and slow down EV adoption, especially in underserved communities. This paper proposes a two-stage stochastic mixed-integer programming model for the optimal deployment of Fixed and Mobile Charging Stations (FCSs and MCSs) across multiple zones and periods. Initially, a finite dominating set of candidate locations is identified using the Edge Scanning Algorithm for a Single Refueling Station (ESS), an exact continuous-location method. We modify the ESS algorithm to incorporate existing public charging stations, thereby avoiding redundant coverage. In the first stage of our model, FCSs are allocated based on long-term traffic patterns, budgetary constraints, and socioeconomic factors to ensure stable baseline coverage. The second stage dynamically assigns MCSs in response to short-term demand fluctuations and uncertainties, aiming to minimize relocation costs while maximizing coverage. We use a scenario-based framework to capture demand variability. Numerical experiments on realistic networks demonstrate the model's capacity to enhance system resilience and reduce unmet demand. These findings offer practical insights for planners and policymakers seeking to develop accessible and demand-responsive EV charging infrastructure."

    "abstract": "Neighborhood smoothing methods achieve minimax-optimal rates for estimating edge probabilities under graphon models, but their use for statistical inference has remained limited. The main obstacle is that classical neighborhood smoothers select data-driven neighborhoods and average edges using the same adjacency matrix, inducing complex dependencies that invalidate standard concentration and normal approximation arguments. We introduce a leave-one-out modification of neighborhood smoothing for undirected simple graphs. When estimating a single entry P_ij, the neighborhood of node i is constructed from an adjacency matrix in which the jth row and column are set to zero, thereby decoupling neighborhood selection from the edges being averaged. We show that this construction restores conditional independence of the centered summands, enabling the use of classical probabilistic tools for inference. Under piecewise Lipschitz graphon assumptions and logarithmic degree growth, we derive variance-adaptive concentration inequalities based on Bousquet's inequality and establish Berry-Esseen bounds with explicit rates for the normalized estimation error. These results yield both finite-sample and asymptotic confidence intervals for individual edge probabilities. The same leave-one-out structure also supports an honest cross-validation scheme for tuning parameter selection, for which we prove an oracle inequality. The proposed estimator retains the optimal row-wise mean-squared error rates of classical neighborhood smoothing while providing valid entrywise uncertainty quantification."

    "abstract": "Occupancy prediction provides critical geometric and semantic understanding for robotics but faces efficiency-accuracy trade-offs. Current dense methods suffer computational waste on empty voxels, while sparse query-based approaches lack robustness in diverse and complex indoor scenes. In this paper, we propose DiScene, a novel sparse query-based framework that leverages multi-level distillation to achieve efficient and robust occupancy prediction. In particular, our method incorporates two key innovations: (1) a Multi-level Consistent Knowledge Distillation strategy, which transfers hierarchical representations from large teacher models to lightweight students through coordinated alignment across four levels, including encoder-level feature alignment, query-level feature matching, prior-level spatial guidance, and anchor-level high-confidence knowledge transfer and (2) a Teacher-Guided Initialization policy, employing optimized parameter warm-up to accelerate model convergence. Validated on the Occ-Scannet benchmark, DiScene achieves 23.2 FPS without depth priors while outperforming our baseline method, OPUS, by 36.1% and even better than the depth-enhanced version, OPUS†. With depth integration, DiScene† attains new SOTA performance, surpassing EmbodiedOcc by 3.7% with 1.62$\\times$ faster inference speed. Furthermore, experiments on the Occ3D-nuScenes benchmark and in-the-wild scenarios demonstrate the versatility of our approach in various environments.

However, training a single general-purpose LRM across diverse domains remains challenging due to pronounced domain heterogeneity. Through a systematic study of two widely used strategies, Sequential RL and Mixed RL, we find that both incur substantial cross-domain interference at the behavioral and gradient levels, resulting in limited overall gains. To address these challenges, we introduce **M**odular **G**radient **S**urgery (**MGS**), which resolves gradient conflicts at the module level within the transformer. When applied to Llama and Qwen models, MGS achieves average improvements of 4.3 (16.6\\%) and 4.5 (11.1\\%) points, respectively, over standard multi-task RL across three representative domains (math, general chat, and instruction following). Further analysis demonstrates that MGS remains effective under prolonged training.

However, given the large space in which robots operate, anticipating possible failures when designing tests is challenging. This paper presents a mapping study by considering robotics testing papers and relating them to the software testing theory. We consider 247 robotics testing papers and map them to software testing, discussing the state-of-the-art software testing in robotics with an illustrated example, and discuss current challenges. Forming the basis to introduce both the robotics and software engineering communities to software testing challenges. Finally, we identify open questions and lessons learned."

Storytelling demands abstraction, simplification, and pedagogical creativity-qualities that are not often well-captured by standard summarization metrics. Meanwhile, factual hallucinations are critical in scientific contexts, yet, detectors often misclassify legitimate narrative reformulations or prove unstable when creativity is involved. In this work, we propose StoryScore, a composite metric for evaluating AI-generated scientific stories. StoryScore integrates semantic alignment, lexical grounding, narrative control, structural fidelity, redundancy avoidance, and entity-level hallucination detection into a unified framework. Our analysis also reveals why many hallucination detection methods fail to distinguish pedagogical creativity from factual errors, highlighting a key limitation: while automatic metrics can effectively assess semantic similarity with original content, they struggle to evaluate how it is narrated and controlled."

We investigate evaluation reliability by holding generation conditions constant while varying target language. Using synthetic customer-support dialogues generated with identical parameters across Estonian, Finnish, and Hungarian, we test whether automatic metrics and LLM-as-a-judge scoring produce stable model rankings across these morphologically rich, related Finno-Ugric languages. With a small set of Estonian native speaker annotations as a reference point, we find systematic ranking instabilities: surface-level metrics (lexical diversity, surface and semantic similarity) maintain cross-language stability, but pragmatic judgments (coherence, instruction-following) exhibit rank inversions and near-zero correlations. Because generation is controlled, these inconsistencies reflect how judge scoring behaves differently across languages rather than true model differences. This controlled design provides a diagnostic probe: evaluation methods that fail to maintain stability under identical generation conditions signal transfer failure before deployment. Our findings suggest that zero-shot judge transfer is unreliable for discourse-level assessment in morphologically rich languages, motivating language-specific calibration against targeted human baselines. We release our controlled generation protocol, synthetic data, and evaluation framework to enable replication across language families at https://github.com/isaac-chung/cross-lingual-stability-judges."

Experiments in a simulator calibrated from 61{,}619 hotel bookings (1{,}088 independent runs) show: (i) no statistically detectable difference from a maturity-buffer DQN baseline in stationary settings; (ii) positive effects under in-family parameter shifts, with significant gains in 5 of 10 shift scenarios after Holm--Bonferroni correction (up to 12.4\\%); and (iii) consistent degradation under structural misspecification, where the choice model assumptions are violated (1.4--2.6\\% lower revenue).

    "abstract": "The rapid digitalization of customer service has intensified the demand for conversational agents capable of providing accurate and natural interactions. In the Algerian context, this is complicated by the linguistic complexity of Darja, a dialect characterized by non-standardized orthography, extensive code-switching with French, and the simultaneous use of Arabic and Latin (Arabizi) scripts. This paper introduces DziriBOT, a hybrid intelligent conversational agent specifically engineered to overcome these challenges. We propose a multi-layered architecture that integrates specialized Natural Language Understanding (NLU) with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), allowing for both structured service flows and dynamic, knowledge-intensive responses grounded in curated enterprise documentation. To address the low-resource nature of Darja, we systematically evaluate three distinct approaches: a sparse-feature Rasa pipeline, classical machine learning baselines, and transformer-based fine-tuning. Our experimental results demonstrate that the fine-tuned DziriBERT model achieves state-of-the-art performance. These results significantly outperform traditional baselines, particularly in handling orthographic noise and rare intents. Ultimately, DziriBOT provides a robust, scalable solution that bridges the gap between formal language models and the linguistic realities of Algerian users, offering a blueprint for dialect-aware automation in the regional market."

Future telescopes like the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) will soon look for life on rocky worlds around Sun-like stars, so it is critical that we understand how to distinguish habitable planets from inhabited planets. However, it remains unknown if life is necessary to maintain a habitable planet, or how all of the components of an evolving planet impact habitability over time. To address these open questions, we present a coupled interior-atmosphere evolution model of the Earth without life from 50 Myr to 5 Gyr that reproduces 19 key observations of the pre-industrial Earth within measurement uncertainties after 4.5 Gyr. We also produce a reflected light spectrum covering the possible wavelength range of HWO. Our findings support the view that life is not required to maintain habitable surface conditions. The model presented here is apt for predicting the long-term habitability of Earth-like exoplanets via evolving bulk properties. By generating realistic reflected light spectra from evolved atmospheric states, this model represents significant progress towards whole-planet modeling, which may ultimately provide a robust abiotic baseline for interpreting biosignature observations with HWO."

Truly open-source models are important for transparency and for enabling a deeper and more precise understanding of LLM internals and development, including biases, generalization, and multilinguality. Motivated by recent advances demonstrating the effectiveness of parallel data in improving multilingual performance, we conduct controlled and comprehensive experiments to study the effectiveness of parallel data in continual pretraining of LLMs. Our findings show that using only parallel data is the most effective way to extend an LLM to new languages. Using just 34.7B tokens of parallel data and 180 hours on 8x NVIDIA H200 GPUs, we built OpenSeal, the first truly open Southeast Asian LLM that rivals the performance of existing models of similar size."

Neural operators offer a promising route by learning mappings between function spaces and enabling resolution-independent inference, yet they typically require supervised data. Physics-informed neural networks address this limitation through unsupervised training with physical constraints but often suffer from unstable convergence and limited generalization capability. To overcome these issues, we introduce a multi-stage physics-informed training strategy that achieves convergence by progressively enforcing boundary conditions in the loss landscape and subsequently incorporating interior residuals. At each stage the optimizer is re-initialized, acting as a continuation mechanism that restores stability and prevents gradient stagnation. We further propose the Physics-Informed Spline Fourier Neural Operator (PhIS-FNO), combining Fourier layers with Hermite spline kernels for smooth residual evaluation. Across canonical benchmarks, PhIS-FNO attains a level of accuracy comparable to that of supervised learning, using labeled information only along a narrow boundary region, establishing staged, spline-based optimization as a robust paradigm for physics-informed operator learning."

In this work, a novel approach is introduced to study a sample of seven LL~GRBs with their multi-wavelength observations to investigate leptohadronic processes during their prompt emission phases. The relative energy densities in magnetic fields, non-thermal electrons, and protons are constrained, with the latter defining the cosmic-ray (CR) loading factor. Our results suggest that LL~GRBs exhibit diverse emission processes, as confirmed by a machine-learning analysis of the fitted parameters. Across the seven LL~GRBs, we find the posterior medians of the CR loading factor in the range of $ξ_p \\sim 0.2$--$1.6$. GRB~060218 and GRB~100316D, the lowest-luminosity bursts ($L_{γ, \\rm iso} \\sim 10^{46}$-$10^{47}\\rm~erg~s^{-1}$) consistent with the shock-breakout (SBO) scenario, yield the highest CR loading factor and therefore are expected to produce neutrinos more efficiently. Our model predicts the expected number of neutrino signals that are consistent with current limits but would be detectable with next-generation neutrino observatories. These results strengthen the case for LL~GRBs as promising sources of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos and motivate real-time searches for coincident LL~GRB and neutrino events. Next-generation X-ray and MeV facilities will be critical for identifying more LL~GRBs and strengthening their role in multi-messenger astrophysics."

A central challenge is to achieve strong utility guarantees for meaningful downstream analysis. Many existing methods ensure uniform accuracy over broad query classes, such as all Lipschitz functions, but this level of generality often leads to suboptimal rates for statistics of practical interest. Since many common data analysis queries exhibit smoothness beyond what worst-case Lipschitz bounds capture, we ask whether exploiting this additional structure can yield improved utility. We study the problem of generating $(\\varepsilon,δ)$-differentially private synthetic data from a dataset of size $n$ supported on the hypercube $[-1,1]^d$, with utility guarantees uniformly for all smooth queries having bounded derivatives up to order $k$. We propose a polynomial-time algorithm that achieves a minimax error rate of $n^{-\\min \\{1, \\frac{k}{d}\\}}$, up to a $\\log(n)$ factor. This characterization uncovers a phase transition at $k=d$. Our results generalize the Chebyshev moment matching framework of (Musco et al., 2025; Wang et al., 2016) and strictly improve the error rates for $k$-smooth queries established in (Wang et al., 2016). Moreover, we establish the first minimax lower bound for the utility of $(\\varepsilon,δ)$-differentially private synthetic data with respect to $k$-smooth queries, extending the Wasserstein lower bound for $\\varepsilon$-differential privacy in (Boedihardjo et al., 2024)."

Since evaluating the system requires a realistic patient simulator that responds to the system's questions, we adopt a well-established simulator along with patient profiles from MIMIC-IV. We further adapt it to describe symptoms vaguely to reflect real-world patients during early clinical encounters.

We present NeuEdge, a framework that combines adaptive SNN models with hardware-aware optimization for edge deployment. NeuEdge uses a temporal coding scheme that blends rate and spike-timing patterns to reduce spike activity while preserving accuracy, and a hardware-aware training procedure that co-optimizes network structure and on-chip placement to improve utilization on neuromorphic processors. An adaptive threshold mechanism adjusts neuron excitability from input statistics, reducing energy consumption without degrading performance. Across standard vision and audio benchmarks, NeuEdge achieves 91-96% accuracy with up to 2.3 ms inference latency on edge hardware and an estimated 847 GOp/s/W energy efficiency.

However, existing pruning techniques often suffer severe degradation on generative reasoning tasks. Through a systematic study across multiple model families, we find that tasks requiring multi-step reasoning are particularly sensitive to depth reduction. Beyond surface-level text degeneration, we observe degradation of critical algorithmic capabilities, including arithmetic computation for mathematical reasoning and balanced parenthesis generation for code synthesis. Under realistic post-training constraints, without access to pretraining-scale data or compute, we evaluate a simple mitigation strategy based on supervised finetuning with Self-Generated Responses. This approach achieves strong recovery on classification tasks, retaining up to 90\\% of baseline performance, and yields substantial gains of up to 20--30 percentage points on generative benchmarks compared to prior post-pruning techniques. Crucially, despite these gains, recovery for generative reasoning remains fundamentally limited relative to classification tasks and is viable primarily at lower pruning ratios. Overall, we characterize the practical limits of layer pruning for generative reasoning and provide guidance on when depth reduction can be applied effectively under constrained post-training regimes."

Recent methods have introduced image-level controls alongside with text prompts, using prior images to extract conditional information such as edges, segmentation and depth maps. While effective, these methods apply conditions uniformly across the entire image, limiting localized control. In this paper, we propose a novel methodology to enable precise local control over user-defined regions of an image, while leaving to the diffusion model the task of autonomously generating the remaining areas according to the original prompt. Our approach introduces a new training framework that incorporates masking features and an additional loss term, which leverages the prediction of the initial latent vector at any diffusion step to enhance the correspondence between the current step and the final sample in the latent space.

Conventional vision-based methods that use deep-learning approaches for person recognition provide image information but are sensitive to lighting and visibility conditions and often violate privacy regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union. Typically, detection systems based on deep learning require annotated data for training. Collecting and annotating such data, however, is highly time-consuming and due to manual treatments not necessarily error free. Therefore, this paper presents a privacy-compliant approach based on Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems LiDAR (MEMS-LiDAR), which exclusively captures anonymized 3D point clouds and avoids personal identification features. To compensate for the large amount of time required to record real LiDAR data and for post-processing and annotation, real recordings are augmented with synthetically generated scenes from the CARLA simulation framework. The results demonstrate that the hybrid data improves the average precision by 44 percentage points compared to a model trained exclusively with real data while reducing the manual annotation effort by 50 %. Thus, the proposed approach provides a scalable, cost-efficient alternative to purely real-data-based methods and systematically shows how synthetic LiDAR data can combine high performance in person detection with GDPR compliance in an industrial environment."

It integrates adaptive mechanisms to learn how emotional and contextual signals propagate through time and across platforms. On a cross-platform dataset spanning $7$ platforms and 2.37M posts collected between 2021 and 2025, \\textsc{Dreams} achieves state-of-the-art performance in predicting misinformation engagements, reaching a mean absolute percentage error of $19.25$\\%.

However, beyond linear regression, the theoretical advantage of full-batch gradient descent (GD, which always reuses all the data) over one-pass stochastic gradient descent (online SGD, which uses each data point only once) remains unclear. In this work, we consider learning a $d$-dimensional single-index model with a quadratic activation, for which it is known that one-pass SGD requires $n\\gtrsim d\\log d$ samples to achieve weak recovery. We first show that this $\\log d$ factor in the sample complexity persists for full-batch spherical GD on the correlation loss; however, by simply truncating the activation, full-batch GD exhibits a favorable optimization landscape at $n \\simeq d$ samples, thereby outperforming one-pass SGD (with the same activation) in statistical efficiency. We complement this result with a trajectory analysis of full-batch GD on the squared loss from small initialization, showing that $n \\gtrsim d$ samples and $T \\gtrsim\\log d$ gradient steps suffice to achieve strong (exact) recovery."

    "abstract": "Autoregressive language models (ARMs) suffer from the reversal curse: after learning that \"$A$ is $B$\", they often fail on the reverse query \"$B$ is $A$\". Masked diffusion-based language models (MDMs) exhibit this failure in a much weaker form, but the underlying reason has remained unclear. A common explanation attributes this mitigation to the any-order training objective. However, observing \"[MASK] is $B$\" during training does not necessarily teach the model to handle the reverse prompt \"$B$ is [MASK]\". We show that the mitigation arises from architectural structure and its interaction with training. In a one-layer Transformer encoder, weight sharing couples the two directions by making forward and reverse attention scores positively correlated. In the same setting, we further show that the corresponding gradients are aligned, so minimizing the forward loss also reduces the reverse loss. Experiments on both controlled toy tasks and large-scale diffusion language models support these mechanisms, explaining why MDMs partially overcome a failure mode that persists in strong ARMs."

However, most eHMI studies rely on developer-crafted message-action pairs, which are difficult to adapt to diverse and dynamic traffic contexts. A promising alternative is to use Large Language Models (LLMs) as action designers that generate context-conditioned eHMI actions, yet such designers lack perceptual verification and typically depend on fixed prompts or costly human-annotated feedback for improvement. We present See2Refine, a human-free, closed-loop framework that uses vision-language model (VLM) perceptual evaluation as automated visual feedback to improve an LLM-based eHMI action designer. Given a driving context and a candidate eHMI action, the VLM evaluates the perceived appropriateness of the action, and this feedback is used to iteratively revise the designer's outputs, enabling systematic refinement without human supervision. We evaluate our framework across three eHMI modalities (lightbar, eyes, and arm) and multiple LLM model sizes. Across settings, our framework consistently outperforms prompt-only LLM designers and manually specified baselines in both VLM-based metrics and human-subject evaluations. Results further indicate that the improvements generalize across modalities and that VLM evaluations are well aligned with human preferences, supporting the robustness and effectiveness of See2Refine for scalable action design."

    "abstract": "Explosive demands for LLMs often cause user queries to accumulate in server queues, requiring efficient routing (query-LLM matching) and scheduling (query prioritization) mechanisms. Several online algorithms are being deployed, but they overlook the following two key challenges inherent to conversational LLM services: (1) unsatisfied users may retry queries, increasing the server backlog, and (2) requests for ``explicit\" feedback, such as ratings, degrade user experiences. In this paper, we develop a joint routing and scheduling algorithm that leverages ``implicit\" feedback inferred from user retrial behaviors. The key idea is to propose and study the framework of contextual queueing bandits with multinomial logit feedback (CQB-MNL). CQB-MNL models query retrials, as well as context-based learning for user preferences over LLMs. Our algorithm, anytime CQB (ACQB), achieves efficient learning while maintaining queue stability by combining Thompson sampling with forced exploration at a decaying rate. We show that ACQB simultaneously achieves a cumulative regret of $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\sqrt{t})$ for routing and a queue length regret of $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(t^{-1/4})$ for any large $t$. For experiments, we refine query embeddings via contrastive learning while adopting a disjoint parameter model to learn LLM-specific parameters. Experiments on SPROUT, EmbedLLM, and RouterBench datasets confirm that both algorithms consistently outperform baselines."

However, scaling approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search to high recall under strict latency SLOs remains fundamentally constrained by memory capacity and I/O bandwidth. Disk-based vector search systems suffer severe latency degradation at high accuracy, while fully in-memory solutions incur prohibitive memory costs at billion-scale. Despite the central role of caching in traditional databases, vector search lacks a general query-level caching layer capable of amortizing repeated query work. We present QVCache, the first backend-agnostic, query-level caching system for ANN search with bounded memory footprint. QVCache exploits semantic query repetition by performing similarity-aware caching rather than exact-match lookup. It dynamically learns region-specific distance thresholds using an online learning algorithm, enabling recall-preserving cache hits while bounding lookup latency and memory usage independently of dataset size. QVCache operates as a drop-in layer for existing vector databases. It maintains a megabyte-scale memory footprint and achieves sub-millisecond cache-hit latency, reducing end-to-end query latency by up to 40-1000x when integrated with existing ANN systems. For workloads exhibiting temporal-semantic locality, QVCache substantially reduces latency while preserving recall comparable to the underlying ANN backend, establishing it as a missing but essential caching layer for scalable vector search."

However, interacting with real environments online can be risky and costly, motivating offline federated RL (FRL), where local devices learn from fixed datasets. Despite its promise, offline FRL may break down under low-quality, heterogeneous data. Offline RL tends to get stuck in local optima, and in FRL, one device's suboptimal policy can degrade the aggregated model, i.e., policy pollution. We present FORLER, combining Q-ensemble aggregation on the server with actor rectification on devices. The server robustly merges device Q-functions to curb policy pollution and shift heavy computation off resource-constrained hardware without compromising privacy. Locally, actor rectification enriches policy gradients via a zeroth-order search for high-Q actions plus a bespoke regularizer that nudges the policy toward them. A $δ$-periodic strategy further reduces local computation. We theoretically provide safe policy improvement performance guarantees. Extensive experiments show FORLER consistently outperforms strong baselines under varying data quality and heterogeneity."

Over time, these models have evolved to capture more nuanced properties, such as the heterogeneity of relationships, leading to the concept of multilayer networks. However, the analysis and evaluation of methods for these structures is often hindered by the limited availability of large-scale empirical data. As a result, graph generators are commonly used as a workaround, albeit at the cost of introducing systematic biases. In this paper, we address the inverse-generator problem by inferring the configuration parameters of a multilayer network generator, mABCD, from a real-world system. Our goal is to identify parameter settings that enable the generator to produce synthetic networks that act as digital twins of the original structure. We propose a method for estimating matching configurations and for quantifying the associated error. Our results demonstrate that this task is non-trivial, as strong interdependencies between configuration parameters weaken independent estimation and instead favour a joint-prediction approach."

This transition is accompanied by gate-tunable spin currents of Edelstein and spin Hall type, whose behavior reflects the underlying electron wavefunction interference. Notably, the Edelstein current shows an inflection point at the critical Rashba strength, signaling the crossover from weak localization to weak antilocalization. In the presence of an in-plane magnetic field we also report a transition in angular periodicity of the magnetoresistance -- from $π$ to $2π$ -- arising from the interplay between spin-orbit interaction and Zeeman coupling. These results establish a direct link between quantum coherence, charge-to-spin conversion, and geometric confinement in mesoscopic systems."

We introduce a multi-agent system formalized as a finite-horizon Markov Decision Process (MDP) with a directed acyclic structure. Each agent corresponds to a specific role or decision stage (e.g., content, business, or legal review in a compliance workflow), with predefined transitions representing task escalation or completion. Epistemic uncertainty is quantified at the agent level using Monte Carlo estimation, while system-level uncertainty is captured by the MDP's termination in either an automated labeled state or a human-review state. We illustrate the approach through a case study in AI safety evaluation for self-harm detection, implemented as a multi-agent compliance system. Results demonstrate improvements over a single-agent baseline, including up to a 19\\% increase in accuracy, up to an 85x reduction in required human review, and, in some configurations, reduced processing time."

Feature augmentation enriches a base table by discovering and integrating features from related tables through join operations. However, scaling this process to complex schemas with many tables and multi-hop paths remains challenging. Feature augmentation must address three core tasks: identify promising join paths that connect the base table to candidate tables, execute these joins to materialize augmented data, and select the most informative features from the results. Existing approaches face a fundamental tradeoff between effectiveness and efficiency: achieving high accuracy requires exploring many candidate paths, but exhaustive exploration is computationally prohibitive. Some methods compromise by considering only immediate neighbors, limiting their effectiveness, while others employ neural models that require expensive training data and introduce scalability limitations. We present Hippasus, a modular framework that achieves both goals through three key contributions. First, we combine lightweight statistical signals with semantic reasoning from Large Language Models to prune unpromising join paths before execution, focusing computational resources on high-quality candidates. Second, we employ optimized multi-way join algorithms and consolidate features from multiple paths, substantially reducing execution time. Third, we integrate LLM-based semantic understanding with statistical measures to select features that are both semantically meaningful and empirically predictive. Our experimental evaluation on publicly available datasets shows that Hippasus substantially improves feature augmentation accuracy by up to 26.8% over state-of-the-art baselines while also offering high runtime performance."

We propose Logic-Guided Vector Fields (LGVF), a neuro-symbolic framework that injects symbolic knowledge, specified as differentiable relaxations of logical constraints, into flow matching generative models. LGVF couples two complementary mechanisms: (1) a training-time logic loss that penalizes constraint violations along continuous flow trajectories, with weights that emphasize correctness near the target distribution; and (2) an inference-time adjustment that steers sampling using constraint gradients, acting as a lightweight, logic-informed correction to the learned dynamics. We evaluate LGVF on three constrained generation case studies spanning linear, nonlinear, and multi-region feasibility constraints. Across all settings, LGVF reduces constraint violations by 59-82% compared to standard flow matching and achieves the lowest violation rates in each case. In the linear and ring settings, LGVF also improves distributional fidelity as measured by MMD, while in the multi-obstacle setting, we observe a satisfaction-fidelity trade-off, with improved feasibility but increased MMD. Beyond quantitative gains, LGVF yields constraint-aware vector fields exhibiting emergent obstacle-avoidance behavior, routing samples around forbidden regions without explicit path planning."

In this work, we investigate the potential benefits of symmetry within the quantum statistical query ($\\QSQ$) model, which is a natural quantum analog of classical $\\SQ$. Our results uncover three distinct phenomena: (i) we obtain an exponential separation between $\\QSQ$ and $\\SQ$ on a permutation-invariant function class; (ii) we establish query complexity lower bounds for $\\QSQ$ learning that match, up to constant factors, the corresponding classical $\\SQ$ lower bounds for most commonly studied symmetries; however, the potential advantages may occur under highly skewed orbit distributions; and (iii) we further identify a tolerance-based separation exists, where quantum learners succeed at noise levels that render classical $\\SQ$ algorithms ineffective.

However, fusing such AI-based measurements in an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) requires quantifying the DNNs' uncertainty and outlier rejection capabilities. This paper presents the benefits of reformulating the measurement equation in AI-based, object-relative state estimation. By deriving an EKF using the direct object-relative pose measurement, we can decouple the position and rotation measurements, thus limiting the influence of erroneous rotation measurements and allowing partial measurement rejection. Furthermore, we investigate the performance and consistency improvements for state estimators provided by replacing the fixed measurement covariance matrix of the 6-DoF object-relative pose measurements with the predicted aleatoric uncertainty of the DNN."

In this paper, I argue for a shift from inference-only accelerators to ultrafast on-chip learning, in which both inference and training execute directly within the FPGA fabric under deterministic, sub-microsecond latency constraints. Bringing learning into the same real-time datapath as inference would enable closed-loop systems that adapt as fast as the physical processes they control, with applications spanning quantum error correction, cryogenic qubit calibration, plasma and fusion control, accelerator tuning, and autonomous scientific experiments.

This paper introduces an end-to-end LRF design space exploration methodology and a specialized design tool for optimizing FC layers on RISC-V processors. Using Tensor Train Decomposition (TTD) offered by TensorFlow T3F library, the proposed work prunes the LRF design space by excluding first, inefficient decomposition shapes and second, solutions with poor inference performance on RISC-V architectures. Compiler optimizations are then applied to enhance custom T3F layer performance, minimizing inference time and boosting computational efficiency. On average, our TT-decomposed layers run 3x faster than IREE and 8x faster than Pluto on the same compressed model. This work provides an efficient solution for deploying DNNs on edge and embedded devices powered by RISC-V architectures."

Understanding how such beliefs transfer across tasks and shape delegation is therefore critical for the design of multipurpose AI systems. We report a preregistered experiment (N=240; 7,200 trials) in which participants interacted with a controlled AI simulation across grammar checking, travel planning, and visual question answering, each with fixed, domain-typical accuracy levels. Delegation was operationalized as a binary reliance decision: accepting the AI's output versus acting independently, and belief dynamics were evaluated against Bayesian benchmarks. We find three main results. First, participants do not reset beliefs between tasks: priors in a new task depend on posteriors from the previous task, with a 10-point increase predicting a 3-4 point higher subsequent prior. Second, within tasks, belief updating follows the Bayesian direction but is substantially conservative, proceeding at roughly half the normative Bayesian rate. Third, delegation is driven primarily by subjective beliefs about AI accuracy rather than self-confidence, though confidence independently reduces reliance when beliefs are held constant. Together, these findings show that users form global, path-dependent expectations about multipurpose AI systems, update them conservatively, and rely on AI primarily based on subjective beliefs rather than objective performance. We discuss implications for expectation calibration, reliance design, and the risks of belief spillovers in deployed LLM-based interfaces."

However, real-world scenarios present numerous open-ended problems where fixed tools often fail to meet task requirements. Furthermore, the lack of self-optimization mechanisms means that erroneous tool outputs can mislead the LLM's responses. Additionally, the construction of existing tools entails significant manual effort, which consequently constrains their applicability. Recognizing that the reasoning traces of LLMs encapsulate implicit problem-solving capabilities, we propose UCT, a novel training-free framework that transforms agents from tool users to tool creators. This approach harvests reasoning experiences and distills them into reusable assets. This method transforms the agent from a mere tool user into a tool creator, enabling adaptive tool creation and self-updating during the inference process. We also introduce a memory consolidation mechanism to maintain the tool library, ensuring high reusability of retained experiential memory for subsequent reasoning tasks. This novel automated tool construction paradigm continuously improves tool quality during reasoning, allowing the overall agent system to progress without additional training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method serves as a novel paradigm for enhancing the capabilities of TIR models. In particular, the significant performance gains achieved +20.86%$\\uparrow$ and +23.04%$\\uparrow$ on benchmarks across multi-domain mathematical and scientific reasoning tasks validate the self-evolving capability of the agent."

However, recent evidence suggests that improvements in CoT capabilities often come with redundant reasoning processes, motivating a key question: Can LLMs acquire a fast-thinking mode analogous to human System 1 reasoning? To explore this, our study presents a self-sampling framework based on activation steering for efficient CoT learning. Our method can induce style-aligned and variable-length reasoning traces from target LLMs themselves without any teacher guidance, thereby alleviating a central bottleneck of SFT-based methods-the scarcity of high-quality supervision data. Using filtered data by gold answers, we perform SFT for efficient CoT learning with (i) a human-like dual-cognitive system, and (ii) a progressive compression curriculum. Furthermore, we explore a self-evolution regime in which SFT is driven solely by prediction-consistent data of variable-length variants, eliminating the need for gold answers. Extensive experiments on math benchmarks, together with cross-domain generalization tests in medicine, show that our method yields stable improvements for both general and R1-style LLMs. Our data and model checkpoints can be found at https://github.com/DYR1/S3-CoT."

While recent advances in continual parameter-efficient tuning (PET) of pretrained models show promise, they typically rely on multiple training epochs and explicit task cues, limiting their effectiveness in GCL scenarios. Moreover, existing methods often lack targeted design and fail to address two fundamental challenges in continual PET: how to allocate expert parameters to evolving data distributions, and how to improve their representational capacity under limited supervision. Inspired by the fruit fly's hierarchical memory system characterized by sparse expansion and modular ensembles, we propose FlyPrompt, a brain-inspired framework that decomposes GCL into two subproblems: expert routing and expert competence improvement. FlyPrompt introduces a randomly expanded analytic router for instance-level expert activation and a temporal ensemble of output heads to dynamically adapt decision boundaries over time. Extensive theoretical and empirical evaluations demonstrate FlyPrompt's superior performance, achieving up to 11.23%, 12.43%, and 7.62% gains over state-of-the-art baselines on CIFAR-100, ImageNet-R, and CUB-200, respectively.

To address these issues, we propose IntraSlice, a framework that applies block-wise module-intra PCA compression pruning. By leveraging the structural characteristics of Transformer modules, we design an approximate PCA method whose transformation matrices can be fully fused into the model without additional parameters. We also introduce a PCA-based global pruning ratio estimator that further considers the distribution of compressed activations, building on conventional module importance. We validate our method on Llama2, Llama3, and Phi series across various language benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves superior compression performance compared to recent baselines at the same compression ratio or inference speed."

This study introduces Generalizable Predictive Prompt Selection (GPS), which performs Bayesian inference towards prompt difficulty using a lightweight generative model trained on the shared optimization history. Intermediate-difficulty prioritization and history-anchored diversity are incorporated into the batch acquisition principle to select informative prompt batches. The small predictive model also generalizes at test-time for efficient computational allocation.

Existing approaches typically rely on table linearization or normalized grid modeling.

To address this issue, we propose an Orthogonal Hierarchical Decomposition (OHD) framework that constructs structure-preserving input representations of complex tables for LLMs. OHD introduces an Orthogonal Tree Induction (OTI) method based on spatial--semantic co-constraints, which decomposes irregular tables into a column tree and a row tree to capture vertical and horizontal hierarchical dependencies, respectively. Building on this representation, we design a dual-pathway association protocol to symmetrically reconstruct semantic lineage of each cell, and incorporate an LLM as a semantic arbitrator to align multi-level semantic information. We evaluate OHD framework on two complex table question answering benchmarks, AITQA and HiTab. Experimental results show that OHD consistently outperforms existing representation paradigms across multiple evaluation metrics."

We focus on dominant drivers within the OECD and a broad GVAR sample covering over 90\\% of world GDP. Our approach identifies dominant drivers from a high-dimensional concentration matrix estimated row by row using two complementary variable-selection methods, LASSO and the one-covariate-at-a-time multiple testing (OCMT) procedure. Dominant countries are selected by ordering the columns of the concentration matrix by their norms and applying a criterion based on consecutive norm ratios, combined with economically motivated restrictions to rule out pseudo-dominance. The United States emerges as a global dominant driver, while France and Japan act as robust regional hubs representing European and Asian components, respectively. Including these dominant drivers as regressors for all countries yields statistically significant forecast gains over autoregressive benchmarks and country-specific LASSO models, particularly during periods of heightened global volatility. The proposed framework is flexible and can be applied to other macroeconomic and energy variables with network structure or spatial dependence."

In this work, we address the off-policy problem in a zero-shot setting by discovering a theoretical connection of successor measures to stationary density ratios. Using this insight, our algorithm can infer optimal importance sampling ratios, effectively performing a stationary distribution correction with an optimal policy for any task on the fly. We benchmark our method in motion tracking tasks on SMPL Humanoid, continuous control on ExoRL, and for the long-horizon OGBench tasks. Our technique seamlessly integrates into forward-backward representation frameworks and enables fast-adaptation to new tasks in a training-free regime. More broadly, this work bridges off-policy learning and zero-shot adaptation, offering benefits to both research areas."

DoA estimation is cast as a multi-label classification problem on a discretized angular grid, while rain-rate estimation is formulated as a multi-class classification task. We then propose a multi-task deep CNN with a shared feature extractor and two task-specific heads, trained using an uncertainty-weighted objective to automatically balance the two losses. Numerical results in a two-source scenario show that the proposed network achieves lower DoA RMSE than classical baselines and provides accurate rain-rate classification at moderate-to-high SNRs."

At test-time, GVP-WM first generates a video plan from initial and goal observations, then projects the video guidance onto the manifold of dynamically feasible latent trajectories via video-guided latent collocation. In particular, we formulate grounding as a goal-conditioned latent-space trajectory optimization problem that jointly optimizes latent states and actions under world-model dynamics, while preserving semantic alignment with the video-generated plan. Empirically, GVP-WM recovers feasible long-horizon plans from zero-shot image-to-video-generated and motion-blurred videos that violate physical constraints, across navigation and manipulation simulation tasks."

As a result, the cybersecurity risk landscape is changing in fundamental ways. Agentic AI systems can plan, act, collaborate, and persist over time, functioning as participants in complex socio-technical ecosystems rather than as isolated software components. Although recent work has strengthened defenses against model and pipeline level vulnerabilities such as prompt injection, data poisoning, and tool misuse, these system centric approaches may fail to capture risks that arise from autonomy, interaction, and emergent behavior. This article introduces the 4C Framework for multi-agent AI security, inspired by societal governance. It organizes agentic risks across four interdependent dimensions: Core (system, infrastructure, and environmental integrity), Connection (communication, coordination, and trust), Cognition (belief, goal, and reasoning integrity), and Compliance (ethical, legal, and institutional governance). By shifting AI security from a narrow focus on system-centric protection to the broader preservation of behavioral integrity and intent, the framework complements existing AI security strategies and offers a principled foundation for building agentic AI systems that are trustworthy, governable, and aligned with human values."

Here, we construct and investigate a Liouvillian exceptional structure based on a driven-dissipative Kerr-cat qubit. Through numerical simulations, we reveal a quantum phase transition occurring at the LEP characterized by a sudden change in dynamical behavior from underdamped oscillations to overdamped relaxations as visualized via Wigner functions and Bloch sphere trajectories. Notably the negativity of the Wigner function serves as a direct signature of genuine quantum coherence unattainable in conventional single-qubit non-Hermitian systems. Furthermore, we introduce the phase difference between the off-diagonal elements of the Liouvillian eigenmatrices as a novel parameter to quantify the transition. Our results establish the Kerr-cat qubit as a novel continuous-variable setting for exploring dissipative quantum criticality and intrinsic non-Hermitian physics."

Missing data is traditionally viewed as a limitation because it reduces the information available to analysts and can degrade model performance. In this work, we take an alternative perspective and study missing data from a privacy preservation standpoint. Intuitively, when features are missing, less information is revealed about individuals, suggesting that missingness could inherently enhance privacy. We formalize this intuition by analyzing missing data as a privacy amplification mechanism within the framework of differential privacy. We show, for the first time, that incomplete data can yield privacy amplification for differentially private algorithms."

To address these, we introduce FlashTrace, an efficient multi-token attribution method that employs span-wise aggregation to compute attribution over multi-token targets in a single pass, while maintaining faithfulness. Moreover, we design a recursive attribution mechanism that traces importance through intermediate reasoning chains back to source inputs. Extensive experiments on long-context retrieval (RULER) and multi-step reasoning (MATH, MorehopQA) tasks demonstrate that FlashTrace achieves over 130x speedup over existing baselines while maintaining superior faithfulness. We further analyze the dynamics of recursive attribution, showing that even a single recursive hop improves faithfulness by tracing importance through the reasoning chain."

Its accurate and reliable estimation is essential for timely risk control and informed decision-making. We propose to use the quantile regression forest in the offline-simulation-online-estimation (OSOA) framework. Specifically, the quantile regression forest is trained offline to learn the relationship between the online VaR and risk factors, and real-time VaR estimates are then produced online by incorporating observed risk factors. To further ensure reliability, we develop a conformalized estimator that calibrates the online VaR estimates. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to leverage conformal calibration to estimate real-time VaR reliably based on the OSOA formulation. Theoretical analysis establishes the consistency and coverage validity of the proposed estimators. Numerical experiments confirm the proposed method and demonstrate its effectiveness in practice."

High-level semantic SSL (e.g., DINO) relies on global tokens that are forced to be location-invariant for augmentation alignment, a process that inherently discards the spatial coordinates required for reconstruction. Conversely, generative SSL (e.g., MAE) preserves dense feature grids for reconstruction but fails to produce high-level abstractions. We introduce STELLAR, a framework that resolves this tension by factorizing visual features into a low-rank product of semantic concepts and their spatial distributions. This disentanglement allows us to perform DINO-style augmentation alignment on the semantic tokens while maintaining the precise spatial mapping in the localization matrix necessary for pixel-level reconstruction. We demonstrate that as few as 16 sparse tokens under this factorized form are sufficient to simultaneously support high-quality reconstruction (2.60 FID) and match the semantic performance of dense backbones (79.10% ImageNet accuracy). Our results highlight STELLAR as a versatile sparse representation that bridges the gap between discriminative and generative vision by strategically separating semantic identity from spatial geometry.

This flexibility allows both homogeneous (Laplace equation) and inhomogeneous (Poisson equation) problems to be solved efficiently using iterative or fast direct solvers, with only the material parameters and source terms modified according to the transformation. The method is formulated within a finite difference framework, where the modified material properties are computed from the coordinate transformation equations, either analytically or numerically. This enables accurate treatment of arbitrary geometric shapes while retaining the simplicity of a uniform grid solver. Numerical experiments confirm that the method achieves second-order accuracy , and offers a straightforward pathway to integrate fast solvers such as multigrid methods on the uniform computational grid."

    "abstract": "Multimodal reward models are crucial for aligning multimodal large language models with human preferences. Recent works have incorporated reasoning capabilities into these models, achieving promising results. However, training these models suffers from two critical challenges: (1) the inherent noise in preference datasets, which degrades model performance, and (2) the inefficiency of conventional training methods, which ignore the differences in sample difficulty. In this paper, we identify a strong correlation between response entropy and accuracy, indicating that entropy can serve as a reliable and unsupervised proxy for annotation noise and sample difficulty. Based on this insight, we propose a novel Entropy-Guided Training (EGT) approach for multimodal reasoning reward models, which combines two strategies: (1) entropy-guided data curation to mitigate the impact of unreliable samples, and (2) an entropy-guided training strategy that progressively introduces more complex examples. Extensive experiments across three benchmarks show that the EGT-trained model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art multimodal reward models."

    "abstract": "Long-range Rydberg molecules (LRMs) form when a highly excited Rydberg electron scatters from ground-state atoms inside its orbit, creating oscillatory, long-range potentials. We present a combined theoretical and experimental study of caesium dimers correlated to 402P3/2 Rydberg states, with an emphasis on decay via autoionisation (associative ionisation). Our model includes a relativistic treatment of electron-atom scattering with spin-orbit coupling, the perturber's hyperfine structure, and coupling of vibrational levels to a continuum of short-range decay channels. Calculated potential-energy curves predict two families of wells: outer wells near the classical outer turning point supporting long-lived states, and inner wells at shorter range whose lifetimes are limited by tunneling and subsequent vibronic decay. Using photoassociation in an ultracold Cs gas and an analysis of pulsed-field-ionisation signals which are highly selective for the detection of molecules, we assign resonances by binding energy and measure lifetimes. The measured lifetimes of inner-well states increase systematically with increasing detuning and agree with calculated lifetimes; detection of Cs2+ product ions supports autoionisation as a dominant channel. We show that the lifetimes are strongly reduced by spin-orbit interactions in the transient Cs-collision complex, which lift the near-degeneracy in Omega observed for states in the outer well and control the inner-well binding. The identified states also provide promising pathways to create ultracold molecules in ion-pair states."

To address this gap, we introduce VIBE, the Visual Instruction Benchmark for Image Editing with a three-level interaction hierarchy that captures deictic grounding, morphological manipulation, and causal reasoning. Across these levels, we curate high-quality and diverse test cases that reflect progressively increasing complexity in visual instruction following. We further propose a robust LMM-as-a-judge evaluation framework with task-specific metrics to enable scalable and fine-grained assessment. Through a comprehensive evaluation of 17 representative open-source and proprietary image editing models, we find that proprietary models exhibit early-stage visual instruction-following capabilities and consistently outperform open-source models. However, performance degrades markedly with increasing task difficulty even for the strongest systems, highlighting promising directions for future research."

In the second, the \\textit{discrete} model, the $l_e$ labels of each edge $e$ are chosen uniformly at random from a set $\\{1,2,\\ldots,T\\}$. In both models we study the existence of \\textit{$δ$-temporal motifs}. Here a $δ$-temporal motif consists of a pair $(H,P)$, where $H$ is a fixed static graph and $P$ is a partial order over its edges. A temporal graph $\\mathcal{G}=(G,λ)$ contains $(H,P)$ as a $δ$-temporal motif if $\\mathcal{G}$ has a simple temporal subgraph on the edges of $H$ whose time labels are ordered according to $P$, and whose life duration is at most $δ$. We prove \\textit{sharp existence thresholds} for all $δ$-temporal motifs, and we identify a qualitatively different behavior from the analogous static thresholds in Erdos-Renyi random graphs. Applying the same techniques, we then characterize the growth of the largest $δ$-temporal clique in the continuous variant of our random temporal graphs model. Finally, we consider the \\textit{doubling time} of the reachability ball centered on a small set of vertices of the random temporal graph as a natural proxy for temporal expansion.

Traditional cross-country data collection relies on extensive on-road driving, making it costly and inefficient to identify representative locations. To address this, we propose a street-view-guided data acquisition strategy that leverages publicly available imagery to identify places of interest (POI). Two POI scoring methods are introduced: a KNN-based feature distance approach using a vision foundation model, and a visual-attribution approach using a vision-language model. To enable repeatable evaluation, we adopt a collect-detect protocol and construct a co-located dataset by pairing the Zenseact Open Dataset with Mapillary street-view images. Experiments on traffic sign detection, a task particularly sensitive to cross-country variations in sign appearance, show that our approach achieves performance comparable to random sampling while using only half of the target-domain data. We further provide cost estimations for full-country analysis, demonstrating that large-scale street-view processing remains economically feasible. These results highlight the potential of street-view-guided data acquisition for efficient and cost-effective cross-country model adaptation."

To address this issue, we propose DERL, a Disentangled Expert Representation Learning framework for robust MSA. Specifically, DERL employs hybrid experts to adaptively disentangle multimodal inputs into orthogonal private and shared representation spaces. A multi-level reconstruction strategy is further developed to provide collaborative supervision, enhancing both the expressiveness and robustness of the learned representations. Finally, the disentangled features act as modality experts with distinct roles to generate importance-aware fusion results. Extensive experiments on two MSA benchmarks demonstrate that DERL outperforms state-of-the-art methods under various missing-modality conditions. For instance, our method achieves improvements of 2.47% in Acc-2 and 2.25% in MAE on MOSI under intra-modal missingness."

While game theory provides a principled framework for such interactions, existing solvers struggle to handle mixed information structures that combine simultaneous (Nash) and hierarchical (Stackelberg) decision-making. We study N-robot forest-structured mixed-hierarchy games, in which each robot acts as a Stackelberg leader over its subtree while robots in different branches interact via Nash equilibria. We derive the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) first-order optimality conditions for this class of games and show that they involve increasingly high-order derivatives of robots' best-response policies as the hierarchy depth grows, rendering a direct solution intractable. To overcome this challenge, we introduce a quasi-policy approximation that removes higher-order policy derivatives and develop an inexact Newton method for efficiently solving the resulting approximated KKT systems. We prove local exponential convergence of the proposed algorithm for games with non-quadratic objectives and nonlinear constraints. The approach is implemented in a highly optimized Julia library (MixedHierarchyGames.jl) and evaluated in simulated experiments, demonstrating real-time convergence for complex mixed-hierarchy information structures."

If the essential goal of education is to foster critical thinking and original perspectives, assessment must also shift its paradigm from quality to originality. This study proposes Argument Rarity-based Originality Assessment (AROA), a framework for automatically evaluating argumentative originality in student essays. AROA defines originality as rarity within a reference corpus and evaluates it through four complementary components: structural rarity, claim rarity, evidence rarity, and cognitive depth. The framework quantifies the rarity of each component using density estimation and integrates them with a quality adjustment mechanism, thereby treating quality and originality as independent evaluation axes. Experiments using human essays and AI-generated essays revealed a strong negative correlation between quality and claim rarity, demonstrating a quality-originality trade-off where higher-quality texts tend to rely on typical claim patterns. Furthermore, while AI essays achieved comparable levels of structural complexity to human essays, their claim rarity was substantially lower than that of humans, indicating that LLMs can reproduce the form of argumentation but have limitations in the originality of content."

To address these issues, in this work, we propose S1-NexusAgent, a self-evolving agent framework designed for multidisciplinary scientific research. S1-NexusAgent adopts a hierarchical Plan-and-CodeAct execution paradigm, decoupling global scientific planning from subtask-level tool execution through a dual-loop architecture, thereby enabling stable modeling of complex research workflows. The system natively supports the Model Context Protocol (MCP), integrates up to thousands of cross-disciplinary scientific tools, and achieves efficient orchestration of heterogeneous research tools via intention-aware dynamic tool retrieval and hot-plug mechanisms. To address long-context and large-scale data challenges in scientific settings, S1-NexusAgent introduces object-reference-based sparse context management, which enables sub-task context isolation and intermediate result compression. Building on this, a Critic Agent automatically evaluates complete execution trajectories and distills high-quality research paths into reusable Scientific Skills, forming a closed loop for continuous self-evolution, which is valuable for sustainable and long-horizon scientific research. Experiments on authoritative scientific benchmarks involving long-horizon planning and complex specialized tool orchestration, including biomini-eval (biology), ChemBench (chemistry), and MatSciBench (material science), demonstrate that S1-NexusAgent achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating its effectiveness and generalization capability in complex scientific tasks."

However, despite the impressive progress achieved by CNN- and Transformer-based models, their performance often deteriorates when applied across diverse environments due to severe domain discrepancies. Direct joint training on multiple datasets, which intuitively should enhance generalization, instead results in negative transfer, as shared and domain-specific representations become entangled. To address this challenge, we propose the Feature Separation and Cross-Attention Network FSCA-Net, a unified framework that explicitly disentangles feature representations into domain-invariant and domain-specific components. A novel cross-attention fusion module adaptively models interactions between these components, ensuring effective knowledge transfer while preserving dataset-specific discriminability. Furthermore, a mutual information optimization objective is introduced to maximize consistency among domain-invariant features and minimize redundancy among domain-specific ones, promoting complementary shared-private representations. Extensive experiments on multiple crowd counting benchmarks demonstrate that FSCA-Net effectively mitigates negative transfer and achieves state-of-the-art cross-dataset generalization, providing a robust and scalable solution for real-world crowd analysis."

Although existing methods can generate full-body talking avatars with simple human motion, extending this task to grounded human-object interaction (GHOI) remains an open challenge, requiring the avatar to perform text-aligned interactions with surrounding objects. This challenge stems from the need for environmental perception and the control-quality dilemma in GHOI generation. To address this, we propose a novel dual-stream framework, InteractAvatar, which decouples perception and planning from video synthesis for grounded human-object interaction. Leveraging detection to enhance environmental perception, we introduce a Perception and Interaction Module (PIM) to generate text-aligned interaction motions. Additionally, an Audio-Interaction Aware Generation Module (AIM) is proposed to synthesize vivid talking avatars performing object interactions. With a specially designed motion-to-video aligner, PIM and AIM share a similar network structure and enable parallel co-generation of motions and plausible videos, effectively mitigating the control-quality dilemma. Finally, we establish a benchmark, GroundedInter, for evaluating GHOI video generation. Extensive experiments and comparisons demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in generating grounded human-object interactions for talking avatars. Project page: https://interactavatar.github.io"

For example, Discrete Element Method (DEM) simulations are often confined to single-wheel tests, which obscures coupled wheel-vehicle-controller interactions and prevents joint optimization of mechanical design and control. This paper presents a Bayesian optimization framework that co-designs rover wheel geometry and steering controller parameters using high-fidelity, full-vehicle closed-loop simulations on deformable terrain. Using the efficiency and scalability of a continuum-representation model (CRM) for terramechanics, we evaluate candidate designs on trajectories of varying complexity while towing a fixed load. The optimizer tunes wheel parameters (radius, width, and grouser features) and steering PID gains under a multi-objective formulation that balances traversal speed, tracking error, and energy consumption. We compare two strategies: simultaneous co-optimization of wheel and controller parameters versus a sequential approach that decouples mechanical and control design. We analyze trade-offs in performance and computational cost. Across 3,000 full-vehicle simulations, campaigns finish in five to nine days, versus months with the group's earlier DEM-based workflow. Finally, a preliminary hardware study suggests the simulation-optimized wheel designs preserve relative performance trends on the physical rover. Together, these results show that scalable, high-fidelity simulation can enable practical co-optimization of wheel design and control for off-road vehicles on deformable terrain without relying on prohibitively expensive DEM studies. The simulation infrastructure (scripts and models) is released as open source in a public repository to support reproducibility and further research."

The LRU combine the fast incremental processing capability of recurrent neural networks (RNN) with the efficient parallel training of state space models (SSM), while reliably modelling dynamic stroke characteristics. We conducted recognition experiments with random rotation angle up to $\\pm 180^{\\circ}$ on three subsets of the CASIA-OLHWDB1.1 dataset: digits, English upper letters, and Chinese radicals.

Recently, Logit Lens was also shown to be applicable in autoregressive Vision-Language Models (VLMs), where it illustrates the conceptual content of image tokens in the form of heatmaps, e.g., which image tokens are likely to depict the concept of cat in a given image. However, the visual content of image tokens often gets diffused to language tokens, and consequently, the locality of visual information gets mostly destroyed, which renders Logit Lens visualization unusable for explainability. To address this issue, we introduce a complementary loss to next-token prediction (NTP) to prevent the visual tokens from losing the visual representation inherited from corresponding image patches. The proposed Logit Lens Loss (LLL) is designed to make visual token embeddings more semantically aligned with the textual concepts that describe their image regions (e.g., patches containing a cat with the word \"cat\"), without requiring any architectural modification or large-scale training. This way, LLL constrains the mixing of image and text tokens in the self-attention layers in order to prevent image tokens from losing their localized visual information. As our experiments show, LLL not only makes Logit Lens practically relevant by producing meaningful object confidence maps in images, but also improves performance on vision-centric tasks like segmentation without attaching any special heads."

Existing mitigations via prompting or supervised fine-tuning fail to generalize, as they modify surface behavior without changing the optimization objective that makes bias cues predictive. To address this gap, we propose Epistemic Independence Training (EIT), a reinforcement learning framework grounded in a key principle: to learn independence, bias cues must be made non-predictive of reward. EIT operationalizes this through a balanced conflict strategy where bias signals are equally likely to support correct and incorrect answers, combined with a reward design that penalizes bias-following without rewarding bias agreement. Experiments on Qwen3-4B demonstrate that EIT improves both accuracy and robustness under adversarial biases, while preserving performance when bias aligns with truth. Notably, models trained only on bandwagon bias generalize to unseen bias types such as authority and distraction, indicating that EIT induces transferable epistemic independence rather than bias-specific heuristics.

Yet vision-language models (VLMs) increasingly consume chart images in automated analysis pipelines, and a growing body of benchmark evidence indicates that this human-centered knowledge base does not straightforwardly transfer to machine audiences. Machines exhibit different encoding performance patterns, process images through patch-based tokenization rather than holistic perception, and fail on design patterns that pose no difficulty for humans-while occasionally succeeding where humans struggle. Current approaches address this gap primarily by bypassing vision entirely, converting charts to data tables or structured text. We argue that this response forecloses a more fundamental question: what visual representations would actually serve machine cognition well? This paper makes the case that the visualization field needs to investigate machine-oriented visual design as a distinct research problem. We synthesize evidence from VLM benchmarks, visual reasoning research, and visualization literacy studies to show that the human-machine perceptual divergence is qualitative, not merely quantitative, and critically examine the prevailing bypassing approach. We propose a conceptual distinction between human-oriented and machine-oriented visualization-not as an engineering architecture but as a recognition that different audiences may require fundamentally different design foundations-and outline a research agenda for developing the empirical foundations the field currently lacks: the beginnings of a \"machine Bertin\" to complement the human-centered knowledge the field already possesses."

By leveraging the properties of quantum superposition and quantum entanglement, the study illustrates how communicating parties can securely obtain a shared secret while preventing adversaries from intercepting it. The experiments are conducted using the IBM Quantum Platform to demonstrate the feasibility of the BB84 and E91 protocols on actual quantum hardware. The evaluation considers several metrics, including entropy, Independent and Identically Distributed (IID), and error-rate verifications."

DMMs may either adhere to their market-making agreements and offer immediacy during periods of heavy selling pressure, or they might lean-with-the-wind to profit from private information. We test these competing theories during extreme (downward) price movements, which we detect using a novel methodology. We show that DMMs provide liquidity when the selling pressure is concentrated on a single stock, but consume liquidity (leaving liquidity provision to slower traders) when several stocks are affected."

    "abstract": "Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in video generation; however, the high computational cost of the denoising process remains a major bottleneck. Existing approaches have shown promise in reducing the number of diffusion steps, but they often suffer from significant quality degradation when applied to video generation. We propose Guided Progressive Distillation (GPD), a framework that accelerates the diffusion process for fast and high-quality video generation. GPD introduces a novel training strategy in which a teacher model progressively guides a student model to operate with larger step sizes. The framework consists of two key components: (1) an online-generated training target that reduces optimization difficulty while improving computational efficiency, and (2) frequency-domain constraints in the latent space that promote the preservation of fine-grained details and temporal dynamics. Applied to the Wan2.1 model, GPD reduces the number of sampling steps from 48 to 6 while maintaining competitive visual quality on VBench. Compared with existing distillation methods, GPD demonstrates clear advantages in both pipeline simplicity and quality preservation."

We introduce CritiqueCrew, a Figma tool that supports designers through conversational critique. CritiqueCrew generates multi-faceted insights by implementing a multi-perspective orchestration of distinct expert roles (UX, PM, Engineer). It translates abstract critiques into concrete actions via in context feedback and interactive remediation. Across two independent controlled studies (Total N=48), CritiqueCrew significantly improved both design quality and subjective experience compared to a traditional static checker. Furthermore, our results confirm that the structured orchestration of expert roles-rather than a unified model-is key to fostering trust and creativity support. Our work demonstrates how AI can shift from a \"problem auditor\" to a \"solution co-creator\" by integrating multi-perspective dialogue with interactive repair, offering design implications for future creative tools."

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly vulnerable to Prompt Injection (PI) attacks, where adversarial instructions hidden within retrieved contexts hijack the model's execution flow. Current defenses typically face a critical trade-off: prevention-based fine-tuning often degrades general utility via the \"alignment tax\", while detection-based filtering incurs prohibitive latency and memory costs. To bridge this gap, we propose RedVisor, a unified framework that synthesizes the explainability of detection systems with the seamless integration of prevention strategies. To the best of our knowledge, RedVisor is the first approach to leverage fine-grained reasoning paths to simultaneously detect attacks and guide the model's safe response. We implement this via a lightweight, removable adapter positioned atop the frozen backbone. This adapter serves a dual function: it first generates an explainable analysis that precisely localizes the injection and articulates the threat, which then explicitly conditions the model to reject the malicious command. Uniquely, the adapter is active only during this reasoning phase and is effectively muted during the subsequent response generation. This architecture yields two distinct advantages: (1) it mathematically preserves the backbone's original utility on benign inputs; and (2) it enables a novel KV Cache Reuse strategy, eliminating the redundant prefill computation inherent to decoupled pipelines. We further pioneer the integration of this defense into the vLLM serving engine with custom kernels. Experiments demonstrate that RedVisor outperforms state-of-the-art defenses in detection accuracy and throughput while incurring negligible utility loss."

    "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has catalyzed significant breakthroughs in complex LLM reasoning within verifiable domains, such as mathematics and programming. Recent efforts have sought to extend this paradigm to open-ended tasks by employing LLMs-as-a-Judge to provide sequence-level rewards for policy optimization. However, these rewards are inherently sparse, failing to provide the fine-grained supervision necessary for generating complex, long-form trajectories. Furthermore, current work treats the Judge as a black-box oracle, discarding the rich intermediate feedback signals encoded in it. To address these limitations, we introduce Grad2Reward, a novel framework that extracts dense process rewards directly from the Judge's model inference process via a single backward pass. By leveraging gradient-based attribution, Grad2Reward enables precise token-level credit assignment, substantially enhancing training efficiency and reasoning quality. Additionally, Grad2Reward introduces a self-judging mechanism, allowing the policy to improve through its own evaluative signals without training specialized reward models or reliance on superior external Judges. The experiments demonstrate that policies optimized with Grad2Reward achieve outstanding performance across diverse open-ended tasks, affirming its effectiveness and broad generalizability."

Recent behavior cloning methods further leverage expressive generative models, such as diffusion models and flow matching, to represent multimodal action distributions. However, policies pretrained in this manner often exhibit limited generalization and require additional fine-tuning to achieve robust performance at deployment time. Such adaptation must preserve the global exploration benefits of pretraining while enabling rapid correction of local execution errors.We propose \\emph{Residual Flow Steering} (RFS), a data-efficient reinforcement learning framework for adapting pretrained generative policies. RFS steers a pretrained flow-matching policy by jointly optimizing a residual action and a latent noise distribution, enabling complementary forms of exploration: local refinement through residual corrections and global exploration through latent-space modulation. This design allows efficient adaptation while retaining the expressive structure of the pretrained policy.We demonstrate the effectiveness of RFS on dexterous manipulation tasks, showing efficient fine-tuning both in simulation and in real-world settings when adapting pretrained base policies.Project website:https://weirdlabuw.github.io/rfs."

Here, we examine how changes in fluid viscosity and rheological properties affect the locomotion of the marine bacterium Vibrio fischeri and its ability to produce luminescence through cell--cell communication. We track the three-dimensional motion of single cells in well-defined fluids with different physical properties and measure the luminescence emitted by cell populations. We find that fluids with higher viscosity cause V. fischeri to spend more time in a slower, turning-focused swimming mode, which reduces how effectively cells spread out and encounter the chemical signals required to activate luminescence. As a result, luminescence first increases and then decreases in Newtonian fluids, but decreases monotonically in fluids that exhibit non-Newtonian rheological behavior. Computer simulations based on our measurements confirm that the ability of cells to explore their surroundings plays a central role in determining when and how strongly they communicate. These findings reveal a direct link between the physical environment, bacterial movement, and collective behavior, and offer new insight into how microorganisms adapt to complex fluid habitats, including those found inside animal hosts."

    "abstract": "Characterisation of structural discontinuity sets in exposed rock faces of underground mine cavities is essential for assessing rock-mass stability, excavation safety, and operational efficiency. UAV and other mobile laser-scanning techniques provide efficient means of collecting point clouds from rock faces. However, the development of a robust and efficient approach for automatic characterisation of discontinuity sets in real-world scenarios, like fully enclosed rock faces in cavities, remains an open research problem. In this study, a new approach is proposed for automatic discontinuity set characterisation that uses a single-shot filtering strategy, an innovative cyclic orientation transformation scheme and a hierarchical clustering technique. The single-shot filtering step isolates planar regions while robustly suppressing noise and high-curvature artefacts in one pass using a signal-processing technique. To address the limitations of Cartesian clustering on polar orientation data, a cyclic orientation transformation scheme is developed, enabling accurate representation of dip angle and dip direction in Cartesian space. The transformed orientations are then characterised into sets using a hierarchical clustering technique, which handles varying density distributions and identifies clusters without requiring user-defined set numbers. The accuracy of the method is validated on real-world mine stope and against ground truth obtained using manually handpicked discontinuity planes identified with the Virtual Compass tool, as well as widely used automated structure mapping techniques. The proposed approach outperforms the other techniques by exhibiting the lowest mean absolute error in estimating discontinuity set orientations in real-world stope data with errors of 1.95° and 2.20° in nominal dip angle and dip direction, respectively, and dispersion errors lying below 3°."

Existing approaches mainly either verbalize graphs into natural language, which leads to excessive token consumption and scattered attention, or transform graphs into trainable continuous embeddings (i.e., soft prompt), but exhibit severe misalignment with original text tokens. To solve this problem, we propose to incorporate one special token <SOG_k> to fully represent the Structure Of Graph within a unified token space, facilitating explicit topology input and structural information sharing. Specifically, we propose a topology-aware structural tokenizer that maps each graph topology into a highly selective single token. Afterwards, we construct a set of hybrid structure Question-Answering corpora to align new structural tokens with existing text tokens. With this approach, <SOG_k> empowers LLMs to understand, generate, and reason in a concise and accurate manner. Extensive experiments on five graph-level benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our method, achieving a performance improvement of 9.9% to 41.4% compared to the baselines while exhibiting interpretability and consistency. Furthermore, our method provides a flexible extension to node-level tasks, enabling both global and local structural understanding.

Although emerging unified understanding-generation models have improved intent comprehension, they still struggle to accomplish tasks involving complex knowledge reasoning within a single model. Moreover, constrained by static internal priors, these models remain unable to adapt to the evolving dynamics of the real world. To bridge these gaps, we introduce Mind-Brush, a unified agentic framework that transforms generation into a dynamic, knowledge-driven workflow. Simulating a human-like 'think-research-create' paradigm, Mind-Brush actively retrieves multimodal evidence to ground out-of-distribution concepts and employs reasoning tools to resolve implicit visual constraints. To rigorously evaluate these capabilities, we propose Mind-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark comprising 500 distinct samples spanning real-time news, emerging concepts, and domains such as mathematical and Geo-Reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Mind-Brush significantly enhances the capabilities of unified models, realizing a zero-to-one capability leap for the Qwen-Image baseline on Mind-Bench, while achieving superior results on established benchmarks like WISE and RISE."

It supports a wide range of visual understanding tasks like visual grounding, local image retrieval, and global image retrieval. ObjEmbed enjoys three key properties: (1) Object-Oriented Representation: It captures both semantic and spatial aspects of objects by generating two complementary embeddings for each region: an object embedding for semantic matching and an IoU embedding that predicts localization quality. The final object matching score combines semantic similarity with the predicted IoU, enabling more accurate retrieval. (2) Versatility: It seamlessly handles both region-level and image-level tasks. (3) Efficient Encoding: All objects in an image, along with the full image, are encoded in a single forward pass for high efficiency. Superior performance on 18 diverse benchmarks demonstrates its strong semantic discrimination."

To overcome these limitations, we leverage the blendshape signals provided by commercial VR headsets as expression inputs. Our framework consists of three key components: (1) Blendshape Distribution Alignment (BDA), which applies linear regression to align the headset-provided blendshape distribution to a canonical input space; (2) an Expression Parameter Mapper (EPM) that maps the aligned blendshape signals into an expression parameter space for controlling Gaussian head avatars; and (3) a Mapper-integrated Avatar (MiA) that incorporates EPM into the avatar learning process to ensure distributional consistency. Furthermore, OFERA establishes an end-to-end pipeline that senses and maps expressions, updates Gaussian avatars, and renders them in real-time within VR environments. We show that EPM outperforms existing mapping methods on quantitative metrics, and we demonstrate through a user study that the full OFERA framework enhances expression fidelity while preserving avatar realism. By enabling real-time and photorealistic avatar expression control, OFERA significantly improves telepresence in VR communication.

A simple linear classifier trained on the frozen features of modern Vision Foundation Models , including Perception Encoder, MetaCLIP 2, and DINOv3, establishes a new state-of-the-art. Through a comprehensive evaluation spanning traditional benchmarks, unseen generators, and challenging in-the-wild distributions, we show that this baseline not only matches specialized detectors on standard benchmarks but also decisively outperforms them on in-the-wild datasets, boosting accuracy by striking margins of over 30\\%. We posit that this superior capability is an emergent property driven by the massive scale of pre-training data containing synthetic content. We trace the source of this capability to two distinct manifestations of data exposure: Vision-Language Models internalize an explicit semantic concept of forgery, while Self-Supervised Learning models implicitly acquire discriminative forensic features from the pretraining data. However, we also reveal persistent limitations: these models suffer from performance degradation under recapture and transmission, remain blind to VAE reconstruction and localized editing. We conclude by advocating for a paradigm shift in AI forensics, moving from overfitting on static benchmarks to harnessing the evolving world knowledge of foundation models for real-world reliability."

Furthermore, we reveal that the soft modes at the M and K points are nearly degenerate in energy, indicating a delicate balance in which either mode could potentially freeze. The K-point mode simultaneously softens toward the transition temperature ($T_{\\rm C}$) in a manner nearly identical to the M-point mode.

In the first phase, we conduct facial data acquisition and evaluate reconstruction performance using utterance data and emotional data. In the second phase, we carry out a comprehensive user evaluation comparing three progressive conditions: utterance only, utterance and emotional data, and a control condition involving extensive data. Findings from 24 participants engaged in simulated face-to-face conversations reveal that targeted utterance and emotional data achieve comparable levels of perceived realism, naturalness, and telepresence, while reducing training time and data usage when compared to the extensive data collection approach.

    "abstract": "Cross-domain fake news detection (CD-FND) transfers knowledge from a source domain to a target domain and is crucial for real-world fake news mitigation. This task becomes particularly important yet more challenging when the target domain is previously unseen (e.g., the COVID-19 outbreak or the Russia-Ukraine war). However, existing CD-FND methods overlook such scenarios and consequently suffer from the following two key limitations: (1) insufficient modeling of high-level semantics in news and user engagements; and (2) scarcity of labeled data in unseen domains. Targeting these limitations, we find that large language models (LLMs) offer strong potential for CD-FND on unseen domains, yet their effective use remains non-trivial. Nevertheless, two key challenges arise: (1) how to capture high-level semantics from both news content and user engagements using LLMs; and (2) how to make LLM-generated features more reliable and transferable for CD-FND on unseen domains. To tackle these challenges, we propose DAUD, a novel LLM-Based Domain-Aware framework for fake news detection on Unseen Domains. DAUD employs LLMs to extract high-level semantics from news content. It models users' single- and cross-domain engagements to generate domain-aware behavioral representations. In addition, DAUD captures the relations between original data-driven features and LLM-derived features of news, users, and user engagements. This allows it to extract more reliable domain-shared representations that improve knowledge transfer to unseen domains. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that DAUD outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both general and unseen-domain CD-FND settings."

    "abstract": "Extending 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to 4D physical simulation remains challenging. Based on the Material Point Method (MPM), existing methods either rely on manual parameter tuning or distill dynamics from video diffusion models, limiting the generalization and optimization efficiency. Recent attempts using LLMs/VLMs suffer from a text/image-to-3D perceptual gap, yielding unstable physics behavior. In addition, they often ignore the surface structure of 3DGS, leading to implausible motion. We propose FastPhysGS, a fast and robust framework for physics-based dynamic 3DGS simulation:(1) Instance-aware Particle Filling (IPF) with Monte Carlo Importance Sampling (MCIS) to efficiently populate interior particles while preserving geometric fidelity; (2) Bidirectional Graph Decoupling Optimization (BGDO), an adaptive strategy that rapidly optimizes material parameters predicted from a VLM. Experiments show FastPhysGS achieves high-fidelity physical simulation in 1 minute using only 7 GB runtime memory, outperforming prior works with broad potential applications."

Phoenix addresses the fragmentation of today's C/C++ pointer analysis ecosystem by cleanly separating IR construction, constraint generation, solver backends, and client-facing queries, making analyses easy to compare, swap, and compose while exposing explicit precision-performance trade-offs. We evaluate Phoenix against SVF under two representative configurations: a flow- and context-insensitive setting and a more precise flow- and context-sensitive setting, on 28 GNU coreutils programs. Phoenix delivers robust speedups in the baseline configuration (up to 2.88x) and remains competitive, and often faster, even in the stronger precision regime (up to 2.91x), without a systematic runtime penalty. In production, Phoenix serves as the analysis substrate for static analysis and fuzzing tools that have uncovered hundreds of new bugs and enabled deployments reporting more than 1000 bugs found in an industrial toolchain."

    "abstract": "Activation-based steering enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to exhibit targeted behaviors by intervening on intermediate activations without retraining. Despite its widespread use, the mechanistic factors that govern when steering succeeds or fails remain poorly understood, as prior work has relied primarily on black-box outputs or LLM-based judges. In this study, we investigate whether the reliability of steering can be diagnosed using internal model signals. We focus on two information-theoretic measures: the entropy-derived Normalized Branching Factor (NBF), and the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between steered activations and targeted concepts in the vocabulary space. We hypothesize that effective steering corresponds to structured entropy preservation and coherent KL alignment across decoding steps. Building on a reliability study demonstrating high inter-judge agreement between two architecturally distinct LLMs, we use LLM-generated annotations as ground truth and show that these mechanistic signals provide meaningful predictive power for identifying successful steering and estimating failure probability. We further introduce a stronger evaluation baseline for Contrastive Activation Addition (CAA) and Sparse Autoencoder-based steering, the two most widely adopted activation-steering methods."

    "abstract": "Product-formula (PF) based quantum simulation is a promising approach for simulating quantum systems on near-term quantum computers. Achieving a desired simulation precision typically requires a polynomially increasing number of Trotter steps, which remains challenging due to the limited performance of current quantum hardware. To alleviate this issue, post-processing techniques such as the multi-product formula (MPF) have been introduced to suppress algorithmic errors within restricted hardware resources. In this work, we propose a dual-channel multi-product formula that achieves a two-fold improvement in Trotter error scaling. As a result, our method enables the target simulation precision to be reached with approximately half the circuit depth compared to conventional MPF schemes. Importantly, the reduced circuit depth directly translates into lower physical error mitigation overhead when implemented on real quantum hardware. We demonstrate that, for a fixed CNOT count as a measure of quantum circuit, our proposal yields significantly smaller algorithmic errors, while the sampling error remains essentially unchanged."

    "abstract": "Semantic segmentation of microscopy images is a critical task for high-throughput materials characterisation, yet its automation is severely constrained by the prohibitive cost, subjectivity, and scarcity of expert-annotated data. While physics-based simulations offer a scalable alternative to manual labelling, models trained on such data historically fail to generalise due to a significant domain gap, lacking the complex textures, noise patterns, and imaging artefacts inherent to experimental data. This paper introduces a novel framework for labour-free segmentation that successfully bridges this simulation-to-reality gap. Our pipeline leverages phase-field simulations to generate an abundant source of microstructural morphologies with perfect, intrinsically-derived ground-truth masks. We then employ a Cycle-Consistent Generative Adversarial Network (CycleGAN) for unpaired image-to-image translation, transforming the clean simulations into a large-scale dataset of high-fidelity, realistic SEM images. A U-Net model, trained exclusively on this synthetic data, demonstrated remarkable generalisation when deployed on unseen experimental images, achieving a mean Boundary F1-Score of 0.90 and an Intersection over Union (IOU) of 0.88. Comprehensive validation using t-SNE feature-space projection and Shannon entropy analysis confirms that our synthetic images are statistically and featurally indistinguishable from the real data manifold. By completely decoupling model training from manual annotation, our generative framework transforms a data-scarce problem into one of data abundance, providing a robust and fully automated solution to accelerate materials discovery and analysis."

    "abstract": "Motivated by the study of how daily temperature affects soybean yield, this article proposes a simultaneous functional quantile regression (FQR) model featuring a locally sparse bivariate slope function indexed by both quantile and time and linked to a functional predictor. The slope function's local sparsity means it holds non-zero values only in certain segments of its domain, remaining zero elsewhere. These zero-slope regions, which vary by quantile, indicate times when the functional predictor has no discernible impact on the response variable. This feature boosts the model's interpretability. Unlike traditional FQR models, which fit one quantile at a time and have several limitations, our proposed method can handle a spectrum of quantiles simultaneously. We tested the new approach through simulation studies, demonstrating its clear advantages over standard techniques. To validate its practical use, we applied the method to soybean yield data, pinpointing the time periods when daily temperature doesn't affect yield. This insight could be crucial for agricultural planning and crop management."

This work presents a rigorous evaluation of VLQ pair production across $e^{-}e^{+}$ collision modes at future linear colliders with center-of-mass energies ranging from 14~TeV to 100~TeV. Our analysis demonstrates that longitudinal beam polarization is a transformative tool for enhancing signal sensitivity. We find that $e^{-}e^{+}$ annihilation consistently yields superior cross-sections compared to photon fusion processes across a mass range of 500--3000~GeV. By optimizing beam helicity to specific configurations, such as $P_{e^{-}} = -0.8$ and $P_{e^{+}} = +0.6$, the production cross-section can be maximized to 120~fb at $\\sqrt{s} = 3$~TeV. We further establish that the Left-Right Asymmetry ($A_{LR}$) serves as a robust discriminator for the chiral structure of new physics, peaking at 0.16 under full polarization. Additionally, we show that effective luminosity can be enhanced to 95\\% of the total luminosity, while high polarization degrees significantly suppress relative uncertainties in the effective polarization. These results provide a quantitative roadmap for optimizing discovery potential and minimizing systematic errors in future high-energy physics experiments."

From a theoretical perspective, we introduce a gradient-weighted modification of the coupled complex-boundary method (CCBM) incorporating an \\(H^1\\)-type term, and formulate the reconstruction as a regularized optimization problem over bounded admissible coefficients. We establish continuity and differentiability of the forward map, Lipschitz continuity of the modified cost functional, existence of minimizers, stability with respect to noisy data, and convergence under vanishing noise. From a numerical perspective, reconstructions are computed using a Sobolev-gradient descent scheme and evaluated through extensive numerical experiments across a range of noise levels, boundary inputs, and coefficient structures. In the reported tests, for sufficiently large but not excessive $H^1$-weights, the modified CCBM is observed to yield more stable reconstructions and to reduce certain high-frequency artifacts. Across the numerical scenarios considered in this study, the method often demonstrates favorable stability and robustness properties relative to several classical boundary-based formulations, although performance remains problem- and parameter-dependent. A projection-based extension further supports stable recovery of piecewise-constant diffusion coefficients in multi-subregion test cases. Our results indicate that, as long as all subdomains share a portion of the boundary, the proposed CCBM-based Tikhonov regularization approach with a pick-a-point strategy enables stable and reliable reconstruction of diffusion parameters."

    "abstract": "The doubly-robust (DR) estimator is popular for evaluating causal effects in observational studies and is often perceived as more desirable than inverse probability weighting (IPW) or outcome modeling alone because it provides extra protection against model misspecification. However, double robustness is an asymptotic property that may not hold in finite samples. We investigate how the finite sample performance of the DR estimator depends on the degree of covariate overlap between comparison groups. Using analytical illustrations and extensive simulations under various scenarios with different degrees of covariate overlap and model specifications, we examine the bias and variance of the DR estimator relative to IPW and outcome modeling estimators. We find that: (i) specification of the outcome model has a stronger influence on the DR estimates than specification of the propensity score model, and this dominance increases as overlap decreases; (ii) with poor overlap, the DR estimator generally amplifies the adverse consequences of extreme weights (large bias and/or variance) regardless of model specifications, and is often inferior to both the IPW and outcome modeling estimators. As a practical guide, we recommend always first checking the degree of overlap in applications. In the case of poor overlap, analysts should consider shifting the target population to a subpopulation with adequate overlap via methods such as trimming or overlap weighting."

This paper revisits the technical challenges of path-gain calculation from angle-resolved wideband measurements, with emphasis on angular-domain power integration where the scan beams are inherently non-orthogonal and simple power summation leads to biased omni-equivalent power estimates. We first formulate the synthesized-isotropic narrowband power in a unified matrix form and introduce a beam-accumulation correction factor, including an offset-averaged variant to mitigate scalloping due to off-grid angles. The proposed framework is validated through simulations using channel models and 154~GHz corridor measurements."

Early dual-tower Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle with cross-modality compositional reasoning required for this task. Recently, adapting generative Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for retrieval offers a promising direction. However, we identify that this adaptation strategy overlooks a fundamental issue: adapting a generative MLLM into a single-embedding discriminative retriever triggers a paradigm conflict, which leads to Capability Degradation - the deterioration of native fine-grained reasoning after retrieval adaptation. To address this challenge, we propose ReCALL (Recalibrating Capability Degradation), a model-agnostic framework that follows a diagnose-generate-refine pipeline: Firstly, we diagnose cognitive blind spots of the retriever via self-guided informative instance mining. Next, we generate corrective instructions and triplets by CoT prompting the foundation MLLM and conduct quality control with VQA-based consistency filtering. Finally, we refine the retriever through continual training on these triplets with a grouped contrastive scheme, thereby internalizing fine-grained visual-semantic distinctions and realigning the discriminative embedding space of retriever with intrinsic compositional reasoning within the MLLM. Extensive experiments on CIRR and FashionIQ show that ReCALL consistently recalibrates degraded capabilities and achieves state-of-the-art performance. Code will be released soon."

    "abstract": "While deep learning models like Vision Transformer (ViT) have achieved significant advances, they typically require large datasets. With data privacy regulations, access to many original datasets is restricted, especially medical images. Federated learning (FL) addresses this challenge by enabling global model aggregation without data exchange. However, the heterogeneity of the data and the class imbalance that exist in local clients pose challenges for the generalization of the model. This study proposes a FL framework leveraging a dynamic adaptive focal loss (DAFL) and a client-aware aggregation strategy for local training. Specifically, we design a dynamic class imbalance coefficient that adjusts based on each client's sample distribution and class data distribution, ensuring minority classes receive sufficient attention and preventing sparse data from being ignored. To address client heterogeneity, a weighted aggregation strategy is adopted, which adapts to data size and characteristics to better capture inter-client variations. The classification results on three public datasets (ISIC, Ocular Disease and RSNA-ICH) show that the proposed framework outperforms DenseNet121, ResNet50, ViT-S/16, ViT-L/32, FedCLIP, Swin Transformer, CoAtNet, and MixNet in most cases, with accuracy improvements ranging from 0.98\\% to 41.69\\%. Ablation studies on the imbalanced ISIC dataset validate the effectiveness of the proposed loss function and aggregation strategy compared to traditional loss functions and other FL approaches.

    "abstract": "Federated multi-task learning (FMTL) seeks to collaboratively train customized models for users with different tasks while preserving data privacy. Most existing approaches assume model congruity (i.e., the use of fully or partially homogeneous models) across users, which limits their applicability in realistic settings. To overcome this limitation, we aim to learn a shared representation space across tasks rather than shared model parameters. To this end, we propose Muscle loss, a novel contrastive learning objective that simultaneously aligns representations from all participating models. Unlike existing multi-view or multi-model contrastive methods, which typically align models pairwise, Muscle loss can effectively capture dependencies across tasks because its minimization is equivalent to the maximization of mutual information among all the models' representations. Building on this principle, we develop FedMuscle, a practical and communication-efficient FMTL algorithm that naturally handles both model and task heterogeneity. Experiments on diverse image and language tasks demonstrate that FedMuscle consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, delivering substantial improvements and robust performance across heterogeneous settings."

However, evaluating softmax, a core component of transformer architectures, remains particularly challenging in HE due to its multivariate structure, the large dynamic range induced by exponential functions, and the need for accurate division during normalization. In this paper, we propose MGF-softmax, a novel softmax reformulation based on the moment generating function (MGF) that replaces the softmax denominator with its moment-based counterpart. This reformulation substantially reduces multiplicative depth while preserving key properties of softmax and asymptotically converging to the exact softmax as the number of input tokens increases. Extensive experiments on Vision Transformers and large language models show that MGF-softmax provides an efficient and accurate approximation of softmax in encrypted inference. In particular, it achieves inference accuracy close to that of high-depth exact methods, while requiring substantially lower computational cost through reduced multiplicative depth."

    "abstract": "Agroecosystem, which heavily influenced by human actions and accounts for a quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs), plays a crucial role in mitigating global climate change and securing environmental sustainability. However, we can't manage what we can't measure. Accurately quantifying the pools and fluxes in the carbon, nutrient, and water nexus of the agroecosystem is therefore essential for understanding the underlying drivers of GHG and developing effective mitigation strategies. Conventional approaches like soil sampling, process-based models, and black-box machine learning models are facing challenges such as data sparsity, high spatiotemporal heterogeneity, and complex subsurface biogeochemical and physical processes. Developing new trustworthy approaches such as AI-empowered models, will require the AI-ready benchmark dataset and outlined protocols, which unfortunately do not exist. In this work, we introduce a first-of-its-kind spatial-temporal agroecosystem GHG benchmark dataset that integrates physics-based model simulations from Ecosys and DayCent with real-world observations from eddy covariance flux towers and controlled-environment facilities. We evaluate the performance of various sequential deep learning models on carbon and nitrogen flux prediction, including LSTM-based models, temporal CNN-based model, and Transformer-based models. Furthermore, we explored transfer learning to leverage simulated data to improve the generalization of deep learning models on real-world observations. Our benchmark dataset and evaluation framework contribute to the development of more accurate and scalable AI-driven agroecosystem models, advancing our understanding of ecosystem-climate interactions."

Minima trains a lightweight convolutional predictor to estimate layer- and patch-level sensitivity, applies a mixture of Tucker, tensor-train, and tensor-ring decompositions to low-sensitivity regions, performs a short healing fine-tune, and executes the resulting operators with custom Triton and CUDA kernels. The reduced memory footprint enables speculative decoding with a small draft model and a larger verifier. On Qwen3-32B at an 8k-token context window, Minima reduces peak VRAM from 64 GiB to 40 GiB. For a single active request, throughput increases from 40 tokens per second (baseline) to 50 tokens per second (Minima) and 75 tokens per second (Minima with speculative decoding). Under 50 parallel requests, throughput is 34, 44, and 53 tokens per second respectively, showing that Minima remains effective under high concurrency even when speculative decoding gains compress. We position Minima relative to recent tensor-network, low-rank plus quantization, and cross-layer sharing methods, and argue that it is a practical step toward more aggressive structural compression via shared tensor backbones with tiny per-layer adapters."

However, prevailing two-stage methods yield task-agnostic representations, decoupling them from downstream objectives. Recent prompt-based approaches attempt to fix this but introduce two challenges: they often lack explicit spatial priors, causing spatially incoherent inter-region modeling, and they lack robust mechanisms for explicit task-semantic alignment. We propose ToPT, a two-stage framework that delivers spatially consistent fusion and explicit task alignment. ToPT consists of two modules: spatial-aware region embedding learning (SREL) and task-aware prompting for region embeddings (Prompt4RE). SREL employs a Graphormer-based fusion module that injects spatial priors-distance and regional centrality-as learnable attention biases to capture coherent, interpretable inter-region interactions. Prompt4RE performs task-oriented prompting: a frozen multimodal large language model (MLLM) processes task-specific templates to obtain semantic vectors, which are aligned with region embeddings via multi-head cross-attention for stable task conditioning. Experiments across multiple tasks and cities show state-of-the-art performance, with improvements of up to 64.2\\%, validating the necessity and complementarity of spatial priors and prompt-region alignment.

We introduce \\Ours, a Variance-Informed Predictive allocation strategy that allocates a given rollout budget to the prompts in the incumbent batch to minimize the expected gradient variance of the policy update. At each iteration, \\Ours~uses a lightweight Gaussian process model to predict per-prompt success probabilities based on recent rollouts.

Here, we propose a Unified and Versatile Multimodal Multi-Task Learning (UV-M3TL) framework to simultaneously recognize driver behavior, driver emotion, vehicle behavior, and traffic context, while mitigating inter-task negative transfer. Our framework incorporates two core components: dual-branch spatial channel multimodal embedding (DB-SCME) and adaptive feature-decoupled multi-task loss (AFD-Loss). DB-SCME enhances cross-task knowledge transfer while mitigating task conflicts by employing a dual-branch structure to explicitly model salient task-shared and task-specific features. AFD-Loss improves the stability of joint optimization while guiding the model to learn diverse multi-task representations by introducing an adaptive weighting mechanism based on learning dynamics and feature decoupling constraints. We evaluate our method on the AIDE dataset, and the experimental results demonstrate that UV-M3TL achieves state-of-the-art performance across all four tasks. To further prove the versatility, we evaluate UV-M3TL on additional public multi-task perception benchmarks (BDD100K, CityScapes, NYUD-v2, and PASCAL-Context), where it consistently delivers strong performance across diverse task combinations, attaining state-of-the-art results on most tasks."

Attractors in state space can be studied using Branched Manifold Analysis through Homologies: this strategy constructs a cell complex from a cloud of points in state space and uses homology groups to characterize its topology. The approach, however, does not consider the action of the flow on the cell complex. The procedure is here extended to take this fundamental property into account, as done with templates. The goal is achieved endowing the cell complex with a directed graph that prescribes the flow direction between its highest dimensional cells. The tandem of cell complex and directed graph, baptized templex, is shown to allow for a sophisticated characterization of chaotic attractors and for an accurate classification of them. The cases of a few well-known chaotic attractors are investigated -- namely the spiral and funnel Rössler attractors, the Lorenz attractor and the Burke and Shaw attractor. A link is established with their description in terms of templates."

However, existing RL based approaches for flow matching models typically rely on numerous denoising steps, while suffering from sparse and imprecise reward signals that often lead to suboptimal alignment. To address these limitations, we propose Temperature Annealed Few step Sampling with Group Relative Policy Optimization (TAFS GRPO), a novel framework for training flow matching text to image models into efficient few step generators well aligned with human preferences. Our method iteratively injects adaptive temporal noise onto the results of one step samples. By repeatedly annealing the model's sampled outputs, it introduces stochasticity into the sampling process while preserving the semantic integrity of each generated image. Moreover, its step aware advantage integration mechanism combines the GRPO to avoid the need for the differentiable of reward function and provide dense and step specific rewards for stable policy optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TAFS GRPO achieves strong performance in few step text to image generation and significantly improves the alignment of generated images with human preferences. The code and models of this work will be available to facilitate further research."

For a genus-0 closed surface, many efficient algorithms can map the surface to the sphere; consequently, a broad class of task-driven genus-0 mapping problems can be reduced to constructing a high-quality spherical self-map. However, existing approaches often face a trade-off between satisfying task objectives (e.g., landmark or feature alignment), maintaining bijectivity, and controlling geometric distortion. We introduce the Spherical Beltrami Differential (SBD), a two-chart representation of quasiconformal self-maps of the sphere, and establish its correspondence with spherical homeomorphisms up to conformal automorphisms. Building on the Spectral Beltrami Network (SBN), we propose a neural optimization framework BOOST that optimizes two Beltrami fields on hemispherical stereographic charts and enforces global consistency through explicit seam-aware constraints. Experiments on large-deformation landmark matching and intensity-based spherical registration demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework. We further apply the method to brain cortical surface registration, aligning sulcal landmarks and jointly matching cortical sulci depth maps, showing improved task fidelity with controlled distortion and robust bijective behavior."

    "abstract": "Multimodal time series forecasting is crucial in real-world applications, where decisions depend on both numerical data and contextual signals. The core challenge is to effectively combine temporal numerical patterns with the context embedded in other modalities, such as text. While most existing methods align textual features with time-series patterns one step at a time, they neglect the multiscale temporal influences of contextual information such as time-series cycles and dynamic shifts. This mismatch between local alignment and global textual context can be addressed by spectral decomposition, which separates time series into frequency components capturing both short-term changes and long-term trends. In this paper, we propose SpecTF, a simple yet effective framework that integrates the effect of textual data on time series in the frequency domain. Our method extracts textual embeddings, projects them into the frequency domain, and fuses them with the time series' spectral components using a lightweight cross-attention mechanism. This adaptively reweights frequency bands based on textual relevance before mapping the results back to the temporal domain for predictions. Experimental results demonstrate that SpecTF significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models across diverse multi-modal time series datasets while utilizing considerably fewer parameters.

This paper introduces a novel perspective, demonstrating that attention value vectors capture sentence semantics more effectively than hidden states. We propose Value Aggregation (VA), a simple method that pools token values across multiple layers and token indices. In a training-free setting, VA outperforms other LLM-based embeddings, even matches or surpasses the ensemble-based MetaEOL. Furthermore, we demonstrate that when paired with suitable prompts, the layer attention outputs can be interpreted as aligned weighted value vectors. Specifically, the attention scores of the last token function as the weights, while the output projection matrix ($W_O$) aligns these weighted value vectors with the common space of the LLM residual stream. This refined method, termed Aligned Weighted VA (AlignedWVA), achieves state-of-the-art performance among training-free LLM-based embeddings, outperforming the high-cost MetaEOL by a substantial margin. Finally, we highlight the potential of obtaining strong LLM embedding models through fine-tuning Value Aggregation."

To bridge this gap, we introduce LatentMorph, a novel framework that seamlessly integrates implicit latent reasoning into the T2I generation process. At its core, LatentMorph introduces four lightweight components: (i) a condenser for summarizing intermediate generation states into compact visual memory, (ii) a translator for converting latent thoughts into actionable guidance, (iii) a shaper for dynamically steering next image token predictions, and (iv) an RL-trained invoker for adaptively determining when to invoke reasoning.

Extensive experiments demonstrate that LatentMorph (I) enhances the base model Janus-Pro by $16\\%$ on GenEval and $25\\%$ on T2I-CompBench; (II) outperforms explicit paradigms (e.g., TwiG) by $15\\%$ and $11\\%$ on abstract reasoning tasks like WISE and IPV-Txt, (III) while reducing inference time by $44\\%$ and token consumption by $51\\%$; and (IV) exhibits $71\\%$ cognitive alignment with human intuition on reasoning invocation."

Motivated by this insight, we reformulate AIGI detection as a Reference-Comparison problem that verifies consistency with the real-image manifold rather than fitting specific forgery cues. We propose MIRROR (Manifold Ideal Reference ReconstructOR), a framework that explicitly encodes reality priors using a learnable discrete memory bank. MIRROR projects an input into a manifold-consistent ideal reference via sparse linear combination, and uses the resulting residuals as robust detection signals. To evaluate whether detectors reach the \"superhuman crossover\" required to replace human experts, we introduce the Human-AIGI benchmark, featuring a psychophysically curated human-imperceptible subset. Across 14 benchmarks, MIRROR consistently outperforms prior methods, achieving gains of 2.1% on six standard benchmarks and 8.1% on seven in-the-wild benchmarks. On Human-AIGI, MIRROR reaches 89.6% accuracy across 27 generators, surpassing both lay users and visual experts, and further approaching the human perceptual limit as pretrained backbones scale.

    "abstract": "Regular sound correspondences constitute the principal evidence in historical language comparison. Despite the heuristic focus on regularity, it is often more an intuitive judgement than a quantified evaluation, and irregularity is more common than expected from the Neogrammarian model. Given the recent progress of computational methods in historical linguistics and the increased availability of standardized lexical data, we are now able to improve our workflows and provide such a quantitative evaluation. Here, we present the balanced average recurrence of correspondence patterns as a new measure of regularity. We also present a new computational method that uses this measure to identify cognate sets that lack regularity with respect to their correspondence patterns. We validate the method through two experiments, using simulated and real data. In the experiments, we employ leave-one-out validation to measure the regularity of cognate sets in which one word form has been replaced by an irregular one, checking how well our method identifies the forms causing the irregularity. Our method achieves an overall accuracy of 85\\% with the datasets based on real data. We also show the benefits of working with subsamples of large datasets and how increasing irregularity in the data influences our results. Reflecting on the broader potential of our new regularity measure and the irregular cognate identification method based on it, we conclude that they could play an important role in improving the quality of existing and future datasets in computer-assisted language comparison."

We introduce HieraNav, a multi-granularity, open-vocabulary goal navigation task where agents interpret natural language instructions to reach targets at four semantic levels: scene, room, region, and instance. To this end, we present Language as a Map (LangMap), a large-scale benchmark built on real-world 3D indoor scans with comprehensive human-verified annotations and tasks spanning these levels. LangMap provides region labels, discriminative region descriptions, discriminative instance descriptions covering 414 object categories, and over 18K navigation tasks. Each target features both concise and detailed descriptions, enabling evaluation across different instruction styles. LangMap achieves superior annotation quality, outperforming GOAT-Bench by 23.8% in discriminative accuracy using four times fewer words. Comprehensive evaluations of zero-shot and supervised models on LangMap reveal that richer context and memory improve success, while long-tailed, small, context-dependent, and distant goals, as well as multi-goal completion, remain challenging.

While prior works mainly focus on point-wise and pair-wise evaluation paradigms. Rubric-based evaluation, where LLMs select a score from multiple rubrics, has received less analysis. In this work, we show that rubric-based evaluation implicitly resembles a multi-choice setting and therefore has position bias: LLMs prefer score options appearing at specific positions in the rubric list. Through controlled experiments across multiple models and datasets, we demonstrate consistent position bias. To mitigate this bias, we propose a balanced permutation strategy that evenly distributes each score option across positions. We show that aggregating scores across balanced permutations not only reveals latent position bias, but also improves correlation between the LLM-as-a-Judge and human. Our results suggest that rubric-based LLM-as-a-Judge is not inherently point-wise and that simple permutation-based calibration can substantially improve its reliability."

This paper presents AgriHubi, a domain-adapted retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system for Finnish-language agricultural decision support. AgriHubi integrates Finnish agricultural documents with open PORO family models and combines explicit source grounding with user feedback to support iterative refinement. Developed over eight iterations and evaluated through two user studies, the system shows clear gains in answer completeness, linguistic accuracy, and perceived reliability. The results also reveal practical trade-offs between response quality and latency when deploying larger models.

In this paper, we propose Hierarchical Adaptive Eviction (HAE), a KV cache eviction framework that optimizes text-visual token interaction in MLLMs by implementing Dual-Attention Pruning during pre-filling (leveraging visual token sparsity and attention variance) and a Dynamic Decoding Eviction Strategy (inspired by OS Recycle Bins) during decoding. HAE minimizes KV cache usage across layers, reduces computational overhead via index broadcasting, and theoretically ensures superior information integrity and lower error bounds compared to greedy strategies, enhancing efficiency in both comprehension and generation tasks. Empirically, HAE reduces KV-Cache memory by 41\\% with minimal accuracy loss (0.3\\% drop) in image understanding tasks and accelerates story generation inference by 1.5x while maintaining output quality on Phi3.5-Vision-Instruct model."

To address these gaps, we propose Test-time Improvement Diagnostic Evaluation (TIDE), an agent-agnostic and environment-agnostic framework that decomposes TTI into three comprehensive and interconnected dimensions. The framework measures (1) the overall temporal dynamics of task completion and (2) identifies whether performance is primarily constrained by recursive looping behaviors or (3) by burdensome accumulated memory. Through extensive experiments across diverse agents and environments, TIDE highlights that improving agent performance requires more than scaling internal reasoning, calling for explicitly optimizing the interaction dynamics between the agent and the environment."

However, the internal dynamics of this compressed state remain largely opaque. In this work, we present a comprehensive study on the runtime state dynamics of state-of-the-art Linear Attention models. We uncover a fundamental phenomenon termed State Rank Stratification, characterized by a distinct spectral bifurcation among linear attention heads: while one group maintains an effective rank oscillating near zero, the other exhibits rapid growth that converges to an upper bound. Extensive experiments across diverse inference contexts reveal that these dynamics remain strikingly consistent, indicating that the identity of a head,whether low-rank or high-rank,is an intrinsic structural property acquired during pre-training, rather than a transient state dependent on the input data. Furthermore, our diagnostic probes reveal a surprising functional divergence: low-rank heads are indispensable for model reasoning, whereas high-rank heads exhibit significant redundancy. Leveraging this insight, we propose Joint Rank-Norm Pruning, a zero-shot strategy that achieves a 38.9\\% reduction in KV-cache overhead while largely maintaining model accuracy."

We provide solver-annotated solutions and comprehensively evaluate LLMs by feasibility, solution optimality, and reasoning efficiency. Experiments across a wide range of modern LLMs show that high-performing models achieve strong feasibility and solution quality on small instances, but both degrade as instance size grows, even if more tokens are used for reasoning. We also observe systematic effects across the taxonomy: set-based tasks are relatively easy, whereas graph-structured problems and bottleneck objectives lead to more frequent failures."

Existing methods perform token routing based on sliding-window partitions, resulting in position-based selection and fails to capture token-specific global importance. Meanwhile, linear attention further suffers from distribution shift caused by learnable feature maps that distort pretrained feature magnitudes. Motivated by these limitations, we propose STILL, an intra-layer hybrid linearization framework for efficiently linearizing LLMs. STILL introduces a Self-Saliency Score with strong local-global consistency, enabling accurate token selection using sliding-window computation, and retains salient tokens for sparse softmax attention while summarizing the remaining context via linear attention. To preserve pretrained representations, we design a Norm-Preserved Feature Map (NP-Map) that decouples feature direction from magnitude and reinjects pretrained norms. We further adopt a unified training-inference architecture with chunk-wise parallelization and delayed selection to improve hardware efficiency. Experiments show that STILL matches or surpasses the original pretrained model on commonsense and general reasoning tasks, and achieves up to a 86.2% relative improvement over prior linearized attention methods on long-context benchmarks."

While classical survival models such as Cox remain widely adopted in standard practice, they rely on restrictive assumptions, including linear covariate relationships and proportional hazards over time, that often fail to capture real-world clinical dynamics. Recent deep learning approaches like DeepSurv and DeepHit offer improved expressivity but sacrifice interpretability, limiting clinical adoption where trust and transparency are paramount. Hybrid models incorporating Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), such as CoxKAN, have begun to address this trade-off but remain constrained by the semi-parametric Cox framework. In this work we introduce SurvKAN, a fully parametric, time-continuous survival model based on KAN architectures that eliminates the proportional hazards constraint. SurvKAN treats time as an explicit input to a KAN that directly predicts the log-hazard function, enabling end-to-end training on the full survival likelihood. Our architecture preserves interpretability through learnable univariate functions that indicate how individual features influence risk over time. Extensive experiments on standard survival benchmarks demonstrate that SurvKAN achieves competitive or superior performance compared to classical and state-of-the-art baselines across concordance and calibration metrics. Additionally, interpretability analyses reveal clinically meaningful patterns that align with medical domain knowledge."

For example, we consider token pruning with reactivating tokens from preserved representations, but the increased computational efficiency of this method results in decreased stability from the preserved representations, leading to poorer dense prediction performance at deeper layers. In this work, we introduce Reg4Pru, a training regularisation technique that mitigates token-pruning performance loss for segmentation. We compare our models on the FIVES blood vessel segmentation dataset and find that Reg4Pru improves average precision by an absolute 46% compared to the same model trained without routing. This increase is observed using a configuration that achieves a 29% relative speedup in wall-clock time compared to the non-pruned baseline. These findings indicate that Reg4Pru is a valuable regulariser for token reduction strategies."

To compare causal models, we propose a distance metric based on cross-model predictive error, and empirically validate the hypothesis that predictors trained on one causal model degrade when evaluated on sufficiently distant models. Finally, we instantiate counterfactual evaluation under (i) controlled causal shifts between generating models and (ii) timestamp shuffling as a stochastic distortion with measurable causal distance.

In this paper, we present Focus-dLLM, a novel training-free attention sparsification framework tailored for accurate and efficient long-context dLLM inference. Based on the finding that token confidence strongly correlates across adjacent steps, we first design a past confidence-guided indicator to predict unmasked regions.

To further reduce overhead, this strategy reuses identified sink locations across layers, leveraging the observed cross-layer consistency.

A prominent approach is to fine-tune an existing model with an unlearning loss that retains overall utility. The space of suitable unlearning loss functions is vast, making the search for an optimal loss function daunting. Additionally, there might not even exist a universally optimal loss function: differences in the structure and overlap of the forget and retain data can cause a loss to work well in one setting but over-unlearn or under-unlearn in another. Our approach EvoMU tackles these two challenges simultaneously. An evolutionary search procedure automatically finds task-specific losses in the vast space of possible unlearning loss functions. This allows us to find dataset-specific losses that match or outperform existing losses from the literature, without the need for a human-in-the-loop. This work is therefore an instance of automatic scientific discovery, a.k.a. an AI co-scientist. In contrast to previous AI co-scientist works, we do so on a budget: We achieve SotA results using a small 4B parameter model (Qwen3-4B-Thinking), showing the potential of AI co-scientists with limited computational resources.

An eternal dominating set extends this concept by placing mobile guards on the vertices of D. In response to an infinite sequence of attacks on unoccupied vertices, a guard can move to the attacked vertex from an adjacent position, ensuring that the new guards configuration remains a dominating set. In the one (all) guard(s) move model, only one (multiple) guard(s) moves(may move) per attack. The set of vertices representing the initial configuration of guards in one(all) guard move model is the eternal dominating set (m-eternal dominating set) of G. The minimum size of such a set in one(all) guard move model is called the eternal domination number (m-eternal domination number) of G, respectively. Given a graph G and an integer k, the m-Eternal Dominating Set asks whether G has an m-eternal dominating set of size at most k. In this work, we focus mainly on the computational complexity of m-Eternal Dominating Set in subclasses of chordal graphs. For split graphs, we show a dichotomy result by first designing a polynomial-time algorithm for K1,t-free split graphs with t\\le 4, and then proving that the problem becomes NP-complete for t\\ge 5. We showed that the problem is NP-hard on undirected path graphs. Moreover, we exhibit the computational complexity difference between the variants by showing the existence of two graph classes such that, in one, both Dominating Set and m-Eternal Dominating Set are solvable in polynomial time while Eternal Dominating Set is NP-hard, whereas in the other, Eternal Dominating Set is solvable in polynomial time and both Dominating Set and m-Eternal Dominating Set are NP-hard. Finally, we present a graph class where Dominating Set is NP-hard, but m-Eternal Dominating Set is efficiently solvable."

The differential magnetoresistance shows nonmonotonic behavior, a signature of electron pairing in the hydrodynamic regime. Theoretical models that account for both the influence of these interactions on shear stress relaxation and viscosity changes from electron heating show good agreement with the data. The nonlinear regime thus reveals how such correlated states govern the hydrodynamic behavior of the electron fluid. Our findings establish the nonlinear transport regime as a powerful probe for dissecting the complex interplay of correlated electron states and momentum relaxation in the hydrodynamic flow of an electron fluid."

    "abstract": "The construction of the Hamiltonian matrix \\textbf{H} is an essential, yet computationally expensive step in \\textit{ab-initio} device simulations based on density-functional theory (DFT). In homogeneous structures, the fact that a unit cell repeats itself along at least one direction can be leveraged to minimize the number of atoms considered and the calculation time. However, such an approach does not lend itself to amorphous or defective materials for which no periodicity exists. In these cases, (much) larger domains containing thousands of atoms might be needed to accurately describe the physics at play, pushing DFT tools to their limit. Here we address this issue by learning and directly predicting the Hamiltonian matrix of large structures through equivariant graph neural networks and so-called augmented partitioning training. We demonstrate the strength of our approach by modeling valence change memory (VCM) cells, achieving a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 3.39 to 3.58 meV, as compared to DFT, when predicting the Hamiltonian matrix entries of systems made of $\\sim$5,000 atoms. We then replace the DFT-computed Hamiltonian of these VCMs with the predicted one to compute their energy-resolved transmission function with a quantum transport tool. A qualitatively good agreement between both sets of curves is obtained. Our work provides a path forward to overcome the memory and computational limits of DFT, thus enabling the study of large-scale devices beyond current \\textit{ab-initio} capabilities"

To address this, MLV-Edit employs a divide-and-conquer strategy for segment-wise editing, facilitated by two core modules: Velocity Blend rectifies motion inconsistencies at segment boundaries by aligning the flow fields of adjacent chunks, eliminating flickering and boundary artifacts commonly observed in fragmented video processing; and Attention Sink anchors local segment features to global reference frames, effectively suppressing cumulative structural drift. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that MLV-Edit consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of temporal stability and semantic fidelity."

    "abstract": "Accurate and comprehensive atomic data are essential for the modelling of stellar spectra. Uncertainties in the oscillator strengths of specific lines used for abundance analyses directly translate into uncertainties in the derived elemental abundances; incomplete or biased atomic data sets can impart significant errors in non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) modelling. Theoretical calculations of atomic data are therefore crucial to supplement the limited experimental results. In this work, we present extensive atomic data, including oscillator strengths, transition rates, and lifetimes for 1730 electric-dipole (E1) transitions among 107 levels in neutral sulphur (S I) using the multi-configuration Dirac-Hartree-Fock (MCDHF) and relativistic-configuration-interaction (RCI) methods. These levels belong to the configurations $\\mathrm{3p^3np (n=3-7)}$, $\\mathrm{3p^3nf (n=4,5)}$, $\\mathrm{3s3p^5}$, $\\mathrm{3p^3ns (n=4-7)}$, and $\\mathrm{3p^3nd (n=3-6)}$. The accuracy of the computed transition rates is assessed by combining the comparison of the differences in transition rates between the Babushkin and Coulomb gauges with a cancellation-factor (CF) analysis. Approximately 16% of the ab initio results achieved an accuracy classification of A-B, corresponding to uncertainties within 10%, as defined by the Atomic Spectra Database of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST ASD). Applying a fine-tuning technique was found to significantly improve the accuracy of the results in the Coulomb gauge, thereby improving the consistency between the Babushkin and Coulomb gauges; about 24% of the fine-tuned transition data are assigned to the accuracy classes A-B."

While the method performs well in computations, a rigorous convergence theory has remained unavailable. We observe that the iteration admits a reformulation as an alternating-projection scheme on Sobolev spaces $H^m$, $m\\ge 0$. At a solution, the Gâteaux differentials of the projection maps are the linear projections onto the corresponding tangent spaces. We prove that these tangent spaces are transverse, and hence the linearization of the alternating-projection map is a contraction by classical Hilbert-space theory for alternating projections. Building on this geometric characterization, we prove linear convergence in $H^2$ of the splitting method on the two-dimensional torus $\\mathbb{T}^2$ for initial data sufficiently close to a solution $u\\in H^4$. To the best of our knowledge, this yields the first rigorous convergence result for this splitting method in the periodic setting and provides a functional-analytic explanation for its observed numerical robustness."

    "abstract": "Information-driven methods from machine learning and artificial intelligence for exploring the optical response of metasurfaces and, more generally, photonic systems rely on well-annotated datasets for training. For metasurfaces made from a periodic or aperiodic arrangement of scatterers, the primary information encoding their response is the optical properties of these individual scatterers. In the linear regime, that response is entirely contained in the transition or T-matrix of the individual scatterer. However, despite the widespread use of these T-matrices in exploring advanced photonic materials within the larger community, there is no common infrastructure for distributing them with consistent metadata and a standard representation. That would be important to avoid the repetitive, resource-intensive computation of these T-matrices by researchers worldwide and to enable data-driven research. To overcome this limitation, we introduce the Daphona T-matrix portal at https://tmatrix.scc.kit.edu/, a web-based platform for interactive searching, filtering, and exporting standardized data containing structure-property relations for a wide range of scatterers, as expressed by their T-matrices. Besides introducing this infrastructure, we demonstrate how the available data enables addressing scientific questions in the broader context of information-driven research. The multiple illustrative examples in our contribution cover both surrogate forward models and inverse design models, and operate either directly on the T-matrix or alternatively on optical observables of metasurfaces made from these scatterers."

Our approach features three key components: (1) hierarchical coarse-to-fine relation extraction that mitigates long-tail bias, (2) evidence-guided Chain-of-Thought feedback that grounds structural suggestions in source text, and (3) semantic initialization that enables structural validation for unseen entities. The two modules enhance each other iteratively-KGE provides structure-aware feedback to refine LLM extractions, while validated triples progressively improve KGE representations. We evaluate LEC-KG on Chinese Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) reports, demonstrating substantial improvements over LLM baselines, particularly on low-frequency relations.

We increase the initial neon abundance by a factor 2-4 with respect to the \"standard\" abundances obtained by scaling the solar values down to the metallicity of this cluster, and explore the average abundances in the ejecta obtained by adopting smaller mass-loss rates. Higher neon produces higher sodium in the AGB envelope. Lowering the mass-loss rate allows both to keep reasonably large sodium abundances and to increase the depletion of oxygen and magnesium. A balance between the lower mass-loss rates and the necessity of not increasing too much the episodes of third dredge up gives a neon abundance larger by a factor two and a mass-loss rate smaller by a factor four as best compromise. Comparison with the abundances in NGC 2808 shows a better agreement than the standard models for all the patterns of abundances, but the extreme stars (group E) requires models slightly less rich in iron. t Thus, we propose that the extreme population in NGC 2808 is composed of stars having a slightly smaller metallicity, and sketch a possible scenario for its formation, in the framework of the hierarchical clusters assembly scenario. Abundances of potassium are larger by $\\sim 0.2 dex$ in the E group, but the explanation in terms of burning of the initial argon requires a drastic increase of the relevant cross section. The abundances of neon and argon at low metallicities may be an important tool to better reproduce the abundances of light elements in the framework of the AGB model for globular clusters."

We consider repository comprehension and generation to be inverse processes within a unified cycle: generation expands intent into implementation, while comprehension compresses implementation back into intent. To address this, we propose RPG-Encoder, a framework that generalizes the Repository Planning Graph (RPG) from a static generative blueprint into a unified, high-fidelity representation. RPG-Encoder closes the reasoning loop through three mechanisms: (1) Encoding raw code into the RPG that combines lifted semantic features with code dependencies; (2) Evolving the topology incrementally to decouple maintenance costs from repository scale, reducing overhead by 95.7%; and (3) Operating as a unified interface for structure-aware navigation. In evaluations, RPG-Encoder establishes state-of-the-art repository understanding on SWE-bench Verified with 93.7% Acc@5 and exceeds the best baseline by over 10% on SWE-bench Live Lite. These results highlight our superior fine-grained localization accuracy in complex codebases. Furthermore, it achieves 98.5% reconstruction coverage on RepoCraft, confirming RPG's high-fidelity capacity to mirror the original codebase and closing the loop between intent and implementation."

However, current approaches face a critical trade-off: text-based WMs sacrifice visual fidelity, while the inability of visual WMs in precise text rendering led to their reliance on slow, complex pipelines dependent on numerous external models. We propose a novel paradigm: visual world modeling via renderable code generation, where a single Vision-Language Model (VLM) predicts the next GUI state as executable web code that renders to pixels, rather than generating pixels directly. This combines the strengths of both approaches: VLMs retain their linguistic priors for precise text rendering while their pre-training on structured web code enables high-fidelity visual generation. We introduce gWorld (8B, 32B), the first open-weight visual mobile GUI WMs built on this paradigm, along with a data generation framework (gWorld) that automatically synthesizes code-based training data. In extensive evaluation across 4 in- and 2 out-of-distribution benchmarks, gWorld sets a new pareto frontier in accuracy versus model size, outperforming 8 frontier open-weight models over 50.25x larger. Further analyses show that (1) scaling training data via gWorld yields meaningful gains, (2) each component of our pipeline improves data quality, and (3) stronger world modeling improves downstream mobile GUI policy performance."

Evaluated across five distinct domains--basketball, football, badminton, cargo pickup, and reactive fighting--HumanX successfully acquires 10 different skills and transfers them zero-shot to a physical Unitree G1 humanoid. The learned capabilities include complex maneuvers such as pump-fake turnaround fadeaway jumpshots without any external perception, as well as interactive tasks like sustained human-robot passing sequences over 10 consecutive cycles--learned from a single video demonstration.

Subsequently, their different continuum versions are checked on the harmonic oscillator, to choose the symmetric ordering as a possibly correct choice for all Hamiltonians. Spotted mathematical subtleties in the simple case serve as a clue to the general solution. Finally, a general justification for the symmetric order is provided by deriving the continuum path integral starting from the exact discrete case by a renormalization procedure in the imaginary time frequency domain. While the role of Weyl order has already been found, the paper provides the missing proof of its suitability for every Hamiltonian and simplifies the previously established construction by referring only to creation and annihilation operators (without position and momentum operators)."

    "abstract": "Wilson loops are essential objects in QCD and have been pivotal in scale setting and demonstrating confinement. Various generalizations are crucial for computations needed in effective field theories. In lattice gauge theory, Wilson loop calculations face challenges, including excited-state contamination at short times and the signal-to-noise ratio issue at longer times. To address these problems, we develop a new method by using neural networks to parametrize interpolators for the static quark-antiquark pair. We construct gauge-equivariant layers for the network and train it to find the ground state of the system. The trained network itself is then treated as our new observable for the inference. Our results demonstrate a significant improvement in the signal compared to traditional Wilson loops, performing as well as Coulomb-gauge Wilson-line correlators while maintaining gauge invariance. Additionally, we present an example where the optimized ground state is used to measure the static force directly, as well as another example combining this method with the multilevel algorithm. Finally, we extend the formalism to find excited-state interpolators for static quark-antiquark systems. To our knowledge, this work is the first study of neural networks with a physically motivated loss function for Wilson loops."

    "abstract": "Bayesian optimization (BO) is a popular, sample-efficient technique for expensive, black-box optimization. One such problem arising in manufacturing is that of maximizing the reliability, or equivalently minimizing the probability of a failure, of a design which is subject to random perturbations - a problem that can involve extremely rare failures ($P_\\mathrm{fail} = 10^{-6}-10^{-8}$). In this work, we propose two BO methods based on Thompson sampling and knowledge gradient, the latter approximating the one-step Bayes-optimal policy for minimizing the logarithm of the failure probability. Both methods incorporate importance sampling to target extremely small failure probabilities. Empirical results show the proposed methods outperform existing methods in both extreme and non-extreme regimes."

    "abstract": "Large language Models (LLMs) have achieved significant breakthroughs across diverse domains; however, they can still produce unreliable or misleading outputs. For responsible LLM application, Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) techniques are used to estimate a model's uncertainty about its outputs, indicating the likelihood that those outputs may be problematic. For LLM reasoning tasks, it is essential to estimate the uncertainty not only for the final answer, but also for the intermediate steps of the reasoning, as this can enable more fine-grained and targeted interventions. In this study, we explore what UQ metrics better reflect the LLM's ``intermediate uncertainty''during reasoning. Our study reveals that an LLMs' incorrect reasoning steps tend to contain tokens which are highly sensitive to the perturbations on the preceding token embeddings. In this way, incorrect (uncertain) intermediate steps can be readily identified using this sensitivity score as guidance in practice. In our experiments, we show such perturbation-based metric achieves stronger uncertainty quantification performance compared with baseline methods such as token (generation) probability and token entropy. Besides, different from approaches that rely on multiple sampling, the perturbation-based metrics offer better simplicity and efficiency."

SafeGround leverages a distribution-aware uncertainty quantification method to capture the spatial dispersion of stochastic samples from outputs of any given model. Then, through the calibration process, SafeGround derives a test-time decision threshold with statistically guaranteed false discovery rate (FDR) control. We apply SafeGround on multiple GUI grounding models for the challenging ScreenSpot-Pro benchmark. Experimental results show that our uncertainty measure consistently outperforms existing baselines in distinguishing correct from incorrect predictions, while the calibrated threshold reliably enables rigorous risk control and potentials of substantial system-level accuracy improvements. Across multiple GUI grounding models, SafeGround improves system-level accuracy by up to 5.38\\% percentage points over Gemini-only inference."

    "abstract": "Robotic imitation learning typically requires models that capture multimodal action distributions while operating at real-time control rates and accommodating multiple sensing modalities. Although recent generative approaches such as diffusion models, flow matching, and Implicit Maximum Likelihood Estimation (IMLE) have achieved promising results, they often satisfy only a subset of these requirements. To address this, we introduce PRISM, a single-pass policy based on a batch-global rejection-sampling variant of IMLE. PRISM couples a temporal multisensory encoder (integrating RGB, depth, tactile, audio, and proprioception) with a linear-attention generator using a Performer architecture. We demonstrate the efficacy of PRISM on a diverse real-world hardware suite, including loco-manipulation using a Unitree Go2 with a 7-DoF arm D1 and tabletop manipulation with a UR5 manipulator. Across challenging physical tasks such as pre-manipulation parking, high-precision insertion, and multi-object pick-and-place, PRISM outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion policies by 10-25% in success rate while maintaining high-frequency (30-50 Hz) closed-loop control. We further validate our approach on large-scale simulation benchmarks, including CALVIN, MetaWorld, and Robomimic. In CALVIN (10% data split), PRISM improves success rates by approximately 25% over diffusion and approximately 20% over flow matching, while simultaneously reducing trajectory jerk by 20x-50x. These results position PRISM as a fast, accurate, and multisensory imitation policy that retains multimodal action coverage without the latency of iterative sampling."

To generate that exact image, she guides a generative model with multiple rounds of prompting and arrives at an image $x^{p*}$. Although $x^{p*}$ is reasonably close to $x^\\ast$, Alice finds it difficult to close that gap using language prompts. This paper aims to narrow this gap by observing that even after language has reached its limits, humans can still tell when a new image $x^+$ is closer to $x^\\ast$ than $x^{p*}$. Leveraging this observation, we develop MultiBO (Multi-Choice Preferential Bayesian Optimization) that carefully generates $K$ new images as a function of $x^{p*}$, gets preferential feedback from the user, uses the feedback to guide the diffusion model, and ultimately generates a new set of $K$ images. We show that within $B$ rounds of user feedback, it is possible to arrive much closer to $x^\\ast$, even though the generative model has no information about $x^\\ast$. Qualitative scores from $30$ users, combined with quantitative metrics compared across $5$ baselines, show promising results, suggesting that multi-choice feedback from humans can be effectively harnessed for personalized image generation."

ROG decomposes a multi-operator query into a sequence of single-operator sub-queries and grounds each step in compact, query-relevant neighborhood evidence. Intermediate answer sets are cached and reused across steps, improving consistency on deep reasoning chains. This design reduces compounding errors and yields more robust inference on complex and negation-heavy queries. Overall, ROG provides a practical alternative to embedding-based logical reasoning by replacing learned operators with retrieval-grounded, step-wise inference. Experiments on standard KG reasoning benchmarks show consistent gains over strong embedding-based baselines, with the largest improvements on high-complexity and negation-heavy query types."

As a remedy, we introduce a latent variable to account for this uncertainty and derive a variational lower bound on the mutual information between paired embeddings. Our derivation yields a simple regularization term for standard SSL objectives. The resulting method, which we call AdaSSL, applies to both contrastive and distillation-based SSL objectives, and we empirically show its versatility in causal representation learning, fine-grained image understanding, and world modeling on videos."

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in multimodal reward models (RMs) have significantly propelled the development of visual generation. Existing frameworks typically adopt Bradley-Terry-style preference modeling or leverage generative VLMs as judges, and subsequently optimize visual generation models via reinforcement learning. However, current RMs suffer from inherent limitations: they often follow a one-size-fits-all paradigm that assumes a monolithic preference distribution or relies on fixed evaluation rubrics. As a result, they are insensitive to content-specific visual cues, leading to systematic misalignment with subjective and context-dependent human preferences. To this end, inspired by human assessment, we propose UnifiedReward-Flex, a unified personalized reward model for vision generation that couples reward modeling with flexible and context-adaptive reasoning. Specifically, given a prompt and the generated visual content, it first interprets the semantic intent and grounds on visual evidence, then dynamically constructs a hierarchical assessment by instantiating fine-grained criteria under both predefined and self-generated high-level dimensions. Our training pipeline follows a two-stage process: (1) we first distill structured, high-quality reasoning traces from advanced closed-source VLMs to bootstrap SFT, equipping the model with flexible and context-adaptive reasoning behaviors; (2) we then perform direct preference optimization (DPO) on carefully curated preference pairs to further strengthen reasoning fidelity and discriminative alignment. To validate the effectiveness, we integrate UnifiedReward-Flex into the GRPO framework for image and video synthesis, and extensive results demonstrate its superiority."

We implement the Spectral-normalized Neural Gaussian Process (SNGP), a set of lightweight modifications that apply spectral normalization and replace the final dense layer with a Gaussian process layer to improve single-model uncertainty estimation and OOD detection. We evaluate SNGP vs. deterministic and MonteCarlo dropout on six datasets across three biomedical classification tasks: white blood cells, amyloid plaques, and colorectal histopathology. SNGP has comparable in-distribution performance while significantly improving uncertainty estimation and OOD detection. Thus, SNGP or related models offer a useful framework for uncertainty-aware classification in digital pathology, supporting safe deployment and building trust with pathologists."

    "abstract": "Computed Tomography (CT) plays a vital role in inspecting the internal structures of industrial objects. Furthermore, achieving high-quality CT reconstruction from sparse views is essential for reducing production costs. While classic implicit neural networks have shown promising results for sparse reconstruction, they are unable to leverage shape priors of objects. Motivated by the observation that numerous industrial objects exhibit rectangular structures, we propose a novel \\textbf{N}eural \\textbf{A}daptive \\textbf{B}inning (\\textbf{NAB}) method that effectively integrates rectangular priors into the reconstruction process. Specifically, our approach first maps coordinate space into a binned vector space. This mapping relies on an innovative binning mechanism based on differences between shifted hyperbolic tangent functions, with our extension enabling rotations around the input-plane normal vector. The resulting representations are then processed by a neural network to predict CT attenuation coefficients. This design enables end-to-end optimization of the encoding parameters -- including position, size, steepness, and rotation -- via gradient flow from the projection data, thus enhancing reconstruction accuracy. By adjusting the smoothness of the binning function, NAB can generalize to objects with more complex geometries. This research provides a new perspective on integrating shape priors into neural network-based reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NAB achieves superior performance on two industrial datasets. It also maintains robust on medical datasets when the binning function is extended to more general expression. The code will be made available."

    "abstract": "Land management intensity shapes ecosystem service provision, socio-ecological resilience and is central to sustainable transformation. Yet most land use models emphasise economic and biophysical drivers, while socio-psychological factors influencing land managers' decisions remain underrepresented despite increasing evidence that they shape land management choices. To address this gap, we develop a generic behavioural extension for agent-based land use models, guided by the Theory of Planned Behaviour as an overarching conceptual framework. The extension integrates environmental attitudes, descriptive social norms and behavioural inertia into land managers' decisions on land management intensity. To demonstrate applicability, the extension is coupled to an existing land use modelling framework and explored in stylised settings to isolate behavioural mechanisms. Results show that socio-psychological drivers can significantly alter land management intensity shares, landscape configuration, and ecosystem service provision. Nonlinear feedbacks between these drivers, spatial resource heterogeneity, and ecosystem service demand lead to emergent dynamics that are sometimes counter-intuitive and can diverge from the agent-level decision rules. Increasing the influence of social norms generates spatial clustering and higher landscape connectivity, while feedbacks between behavioural factors can lead to path dependence, lock-in effects, and the emergence of multiple stable regimes with sharp transitions. The proposed framework demonstrates how even low levels of behavioural diversity and social interactions can reshape system-level land use outcomes and provides a reusable modelling component for incorporating socio-psychological processes into land use simulations. The approach can be integrated into other agent-based land use models and parameterised empirically in future work."

In this work, we present a unified view that frames these interventions as dynamic weight updates induced by a control signal, placing them within a single conceptual framework. Building on this view, we propose a unified preference-utility analysis that separates control effects into preference, defined as the tendency toward a target concept, and utility, defined as coherent and task-valid generation, and measures both on a shared log-odds scale using polarity-paired contrastive examples. Across methods, we observe a consistent trade-off between preference and utility: stronger control increases preference while predictably reducing utility. We further explain this behavior through an activation manifold perspective, in which control shifts representations along target-concept directions to enhance preference, while utility declines primarily when interventions push representations off the model's valid-generation manifold. Finally, we introduce a new steering approach SPLIT guided by this analysis that improves preference while better preserving utility.

    "abstract": "The study of Locally Checkable Labelings (LCLs) has led to a remarkably precise characterization of the distributed time complexities that can occur on bounded-degree trees. A central feature of this complexity landscape is the existence of strong gap results, which rule out large ranges of intermediate complexities. While it was initially hoped that these gaps might extend to more general graph classes, this has turned out not to be the case. In this work, we investigate a different direction: we remain in the class of trees, but allow arbitrarily large degrees. We focus on the polynomial regime ($Θ(n^{1/k} \\mid k \\in \\mathbb{N})$) and show that whether polynomial gap results persist in the unbounded-degree setting crucially depends on how LCLs are generalized beyond bounded degrees. We first demonstrate that if one allows LCLs to be defined using infinitely many local configurations, then the polynomial gaps disappear entirely: for every real exponent $0 < r \\leq 1$, there exists a locally checkable problem on trees with deterministic LOCAL complexity $Θ(n^r)$. Rather than stopping at this negative result, we identify a natural class of problems for which polynomial gap results can still be recovered. We introduce Locally Finite Labelings (LFLs), which formalize the intuition that ''every node must fall into one of finitely many local cases'', even in the presence of unbounded degrees. Our main result shows that this restriction is sufficient to restore the polynomial gaps: for any LFL $Π$ on trees with unbounded degrees, the deterministic LOCAL complexity of $Π$ is either - $Θ(n^{1/k})$ for some integer $k \\geq 1$, or - $O(\\log n)$. Moreover, which case applies, and the corresponding value of $k$, can be determined solely from the description of $Π$."

Furthermore, constraining the octupole deformation with triangular flow $v_{3}$ proves to be difficult due to significant sensitivity to the uncertain nuclear structure of the gold reference system.

We adopt a two-stage end-to-end learning paradigm: a policy is first pre-trained on diverse procedurally generated terrains, followed by rapid fine-tuning on high-fidelity meshes reconstructed from real-world captures. Specifically, we develop a feed-forward, efficient, and high-fidelity geometry reconstruction pipeline using RGB-D inputs, ensuring both speed and quality during test-time training. We demonstrate that TTT-Parkour empowers humanoid robots to master complex obstacles, including wedges, stakes, boxes, trapezoids, and narrow beams.

We also highlight the significance of 3D magnetic null points, which in our simulation can separate the FTEs into multiple flux ropes. Near the null points, the coiled FTE magnetic field lines are rerouted towards Earth, so that the magnetic footpoints are planted near the Region 1 ionospheric current system. The helicities of the flux ropes are organized by the y-component (GSE) of the magnetic field at the Earth's magnetopause. This occurs in our simulation due to the absence of a y-component of the interplanetary magnetic field, which would normally supply the FTE guide field that determines the helicity. We observe Alfvenic, Earthward-flowing field-aligned currents generated near the magnetopause that correlate with the passage of FTEs nearby. These pulses of current coincide with the formation of rotational geoelectric field structures, that appear near the noon meridian and propagate around the auroral oval towards the nightside."

We handle special cases when multilayer data is incomplete or when there is photo-conversion in the interface as with sensors. We implement interactions with surface micro-roughness and predict the corresponding angular distribution using a Monte Carlo implementation of the Harvey-Shack scatter theory for a microroughness power spectrum. Finally, we simulate surface interaction with contamination from dust or condensation using Mie scattering applied efficiently to individual contaminants. The combination of these implementations can efficiently simulate rough to polished surfaces of arbitrary materials that are fully cleaned or dusty. The observational consequences includes complex wavelength and spatial-dependent photometric errors, the dominant effect of the wings of point-spread-functions, dust rings, and wavelength and angle-dependent throughput losses. We find agreement with the point-spread-function wings of WIYN ODI observations of bright stars and properties of dust rings, and demonstrate the ability to disentangle mirror microroughness from the turbulence PSF patterns. The comprehensive numerical implementation of surface interactions has wide applicability in non-astronomical applications as well."

    "abstract": "Molecular function is largely determined by structure. Accurately aligning molecular structure with natural language is therefore essential for enabling large language models (LLMs) to reason about downstream chemical tasks. However, the substantial cost of human annotation makes it infeasible to construct large-scale, high-quality datasets of structure-grounded descriptions. In this work, we propose a fully automated annotation framework for generating precise molecular structure descriptions at scale. Our approach builds upon and extends a rule-based chemical nomenclature parser to interpret IUPAC names and construct enriched, structured XML metadata that explicitly encodes molecular structure. This metadata is then used to guide LLMs in producing accurate natural-language descriptions. Using this framework, we curate a large-scale dataset of approximately $163$k molecule-description pairs. A rigorous validation protocol combining LLM-based and expert human evaluation on a subset of $2,000$ molecules demonstrates a high description precision of $98.6\\%$. The resulting dataset provides a reliable foundation for future molecule-language alignment, and the proposed annotation method is readily extensible to larger datasets and broader chemical tasks that rely on structural descriptions."

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong reasoning abilities in solving complex real-world problems. Yet, the internal mechanisms driving these complex reasoning behaviors remain opaque. Existing interpretability approaches targeting reasoning either identify components (e.g., neurons) correlated with special textual patterns, or rely on human-annotated contrastive pairs to derive control vectors. Consequently, current methods struggle to precisely localize complex reasoning mechanisms or capture sequential influence from model internal workings to the reasoning outputs. In this paper, built on outcome-oriented and sequential-influence-aware principles, we focus on identifying components that have sequential contribution to reasoning behavior where outcomes are cumulated by long-range effects. We propose Integrated Policy Gradient (IPG), a novel framework that attributes reasoning behaviors to model's inner components by propagating compound outcome-based signals such as post reasoning accuracy backward through model inference trajectories. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our approach achieves more precise localization and enables reliable modulation of reasoning behaviors (e.g., reasoning capability, reasoning strength) across diverse reasoning models."

Prominently, two structures in the scope of the conjecture have log-space equivalent CSPs if they are pp-bi-interpretable, or equivalently, if their polymorphism clones are topologically isomorphic. The latter gives rise to the algebraic approach which regards structures with topologically isomorphic polymorphism clones as equivalent and seeks to identify structural reasons for hardness or tractability in topological clones. We establish that the equivalence relation of pp-bi-interpretability underlying this approach is reasonable: On the one hand, we show that it is decidable under mild conditions on the templates; this improves a theorem of Bodirsky, Pinsker and Tsankov (LICS'11) on decidability of equality of polymorphism clones. On the other hand, we show that within the much larger class of transitive $ω$-categorical structures without algebraicity, the equivalence relation is of lowest possible complexity in terms of descriptive set theory: namely, it is smooth, i.e., Borel-reduces to equality on the real numbers. On our way to showing the first result, we establish that the model-complete core of a structure that has a finitely bounded Ramsey expansion (which might include all structures of the Bodirsky-Pinsker conjecture) is computable, thereby providing a constructive alternative to previous non-constructive proofs of its existence."

In the present study, a simulated AI classified images of railway trespassers as dangerous or not. To explain which features it has used, other images from the dataset were shown that activate the AI in a similar way. These concept images varied in three relevant features (i.e., a person's distance to the tracks, direction, and action) and in an irrelevant feature (i.e., scene background). When the AI uses a feature in its decision, this feature is retained in the concept images, otherwise the images randomize over it (e.g., same distance, varied backgrounds). Participants rated the AI more favorably when it retained relevant features. For the irrelevant feature, they did not mind in general, and sometimes even preferred it to be retained. This suggests that people may not recognize it when an AI model relies on irrelevant features to make its decisions."

The synthesis of this rheological analogue simplifies appreciably the calculation of the power spectrum for Brownian motion within viscoelastic materials such as Maxwell fluids, Jeffreys fluids, subdiffusive materials, or in dense viscous fluids that give rise to hydrodynamic memory."

    "abstract": "Current time-series forecasting models are primarily based on transformer-style neural networks. These models achieve long-term forecasting mainly by scaling up the model size rather than through genuinely autoregressive (AR) rollout. From the perspective of large language model training, the traditional training process for time-series forecasting models ignores temporal causality. In this paper, we propose a novel training method for time-series forecasting that enforces two key properties: (1) AR prediction errors should increase with the forecasting horizon. Any violation of this principle is considered random guessing and is explicitly penalized in the loss function, and (2) the method enables models to concatenate short-term AR predictions for forming flexible long-term forecasts. Empirical results demonstrate that our method establishes a new state-of-the-art across multiple benchmarks, achieving an MSE reduction of more than 10% compared to iTransformer and other recent strong baselines. Furthermore, it enables short-horizon forecasting models to perform reliable long-term predictions at horizons over 7.5 times longer. Code is available at https://github.com/LizhengMathAi/AROpt"

In addition, a top-3 layer based mixture-of-experts (MoE) is used to fuse high-level and low-level features for effective spoofed utterance detection. For speaker verification, we adapt a low-complexity convolutional neural network that fuses 2D and 1D features at multiple scales, trained with the SphereFace loss. Additionally, contrastive circle loss is applied to adaptively weight positive and negative pairs within each training batch, enabling the network to better distinguish between hard and easy sample pairs. Finally, fixed imposter cohort based AS Norm score normalization and model ensembling are used to further enhance the discriminative capability of the speaker verification system."

    "abstract": "Backpropagation, the foundational algorithm for training neural networks, is typically understood as a symbolic computation that recursively applies the chain rule. We show it emerges exactly as the finite-time relaxation of a physical dynamical system. By formulating feedforward inference as a continuous-time process and applying Lagrangian theory of non-conservative systems to handle asymmetric interactions, we derive a global energy functional on a doubled state space encoding both activations and sensitivities. The saddle-point dynamics of this energy perform inference and credit assignment simultaneously through local interactions. We term this framework ''Dyadic Backpropagation''. Crucially, we prove that unit-step Euler discretization, the natural timescale of layer transitions, recovers standard backpropagation exactly in precisely 2L steps for an L-layer network, with no approximations. Unlike prior energy-based methods requiring symmetric weights, asymptotic convergence, or vanishing perturbations, our framework guarantees exact gradients in finite time. This establishes backpropagation as the digitally optimized shadow of a continuous physical relaxation, providing a rigorous foundation for exact gradient computation in analog and neuromorphic substrates where continuous dynamics are native."

While exciton-polaritons in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) offer a promising platform, their practical utility is often impeded by fixed interaction parameters and an intrinsic trade-off between nonlinearity and oscillator strength. Here, we report electrically tunable dipolar polaritons in a dual-gated bilayer MoS2 microcavity, demonstrating in situ reshaping of the dispersion and modulation of the light-matter coupling strength via the quantum-confined Stark effect. Crucially, this architecture enables a giant polariton-polariton interaction strength tunable by a factor of seven. This nonlinearity enhancement arises from a synergistic interplay, in which the electric field amplifies the microscopic dipolar repulsion while simultaneously optimizing the macroscopic excitonic Hopfield coefficient. Furthermore, electrostatic doping serves as an independent control knob to switch the system between strong and weak coupling regimes. Our findings bridge the gap between strong optical coupling and giant dipolar nonlinearities, establishing the TMD homobilayer as a versatile platform for engineering programmable correlated many-body states on a chip."

In this paper, we study nonparametric inference with an IV under a separable binary treatment choice model, which posits that the odds of the probability of taking the treatment, conditional on the instrument and the treatment-free potential outcome, factor into separable components for each variable. While nonparametric identification of smooth functionals of the treatment-free potential outcome among the treated, such as the average treatment effect on the treated, has been established under this model, corresponding nonparametric efficient estimation has proven elusive due to variationally dependent nuisance parameters defined in terms of counterfactual quantities. To address this challenge, we introduce a new variationally independent parameterization based on nuisance functions defined directly from the observed data. This parameterization, coupled with a novel fixed-point argument, enables the use of modern machine learning methods for nuisance function estimation. We characterize the semiparametric efficiency bound for any smooth functional of the treatment-free potential outcome among the treated and construct a corresponding semiparametric efficient estimator without imposing any unnecessary restriction on nuisance functions. Furthermore, we describe a straightforward generative model justifying our identifying assumptions and characterize empirically falsifiable implications of the framework to evaluate our assumptions in practical settings. Our approach seamlessly extends to nonlinear treatment effects, population-level effects, and nonignorable missing data settings. We illustrate our methods through simulation studies and an application to the Job Corps study."

This raises a basic question: are CFM and IFM genuinely different, or are they two descriptions of the same underlying dynamics? We show that they coincide for a natural subclass of IFM that we call forward-only IFM. Specifically, we construct a bijection between CFM and forward-only IFM. We further show that general IFM is strictly more expressive: it includes EFM and other interaction fields that cannot be realized within the standard CFM formulation. Finally, we highlight how this duality can benefit both frameworks: it provides a probabilistic interpretation of forward-only IFM and yields novel, IFM-driven techniques for CFM."

Strong theoretical results are known in this setting, achieving nearly-tight $Θ(\\sqrt{T})$-regret bounds. However, such detailed feedback can be unrealistic, and recent research has investigated more restricted settings such as trajectory feedback, where the agent observes all the visited state-action pairs, but only a single \\emph{aggregate} reward. In this paper, we consider a far more restrictive ``fully bandit'' feedback model for episodic MDPs, where the agent does not even observe the visited state-action pairs -- it only learns the aggregate reward. We provide the first efficient bandit learning algorithm for episodic MDPs with $\\widetilde{O}(\\sqrt{T})$ regret. Our regret has an exponential dependence on the horizon length $\\H$, which we show is necessary. We also obtain improved nearly-tight regret bounds for ``ordered'' MDPs; these can be used to model classical stochastic optimization problems such as $k$-item prophet inequality and sequential posted pricing. Finally, we evaluate the empirical performance of our algorithm for the setting of $k$-item prophet inequalities; despite the highly restricted feedback, our algorithm's performance is comparable to that of a state-of-art learning algorithm (UCB-VI) with detailed state-action feedback."

Two-dimensional position reconstruction is enabled by segmentation of the two detector faces into orthogonal strip contacts, enabling a pixelized analysis. The depth of an interaction cannot be measured directly but must be inferred from the charge collection time difference between the two faces of the detector. Here, we demonstrate for the first time the depth calibration of a detector with the COSI satellite geometry read out using an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) developed for the COSI mission. In this work, we map collection time difference to depth using the Julia-based simulation package SolidStateDetectors.jl and validate it with comparison to the timing distributions observed in data. We also use simulations and data to demonstrate the depth resolution on a per-pixel basis, with >90% of pixels having <0.9 mm (FWHM) resolution at 59.5 keV and <0.6 mm (FWHM) resolution at 122.1 keV."

    "abstract": "While vision-language-action (VLA) models for embodied agents integrate perception, reasoning, and control, they remain constrained by two critical weaknesses: first, during grasping tasks, the action tokens generated by the language model often exhibit subtle spatial deviations from the target object, resulting in grasp failures; second, they lack the ability to reliably recognize task completion, which leads to redundant actions and frequent timeout errors. To address these challenges and enhance robustness, we propose a lightweight, training-free framework, VLA-SCT. This framework operates as a self-correcting control loop, combining data-driven action refinement with conditional logic for termination. Consequently, compared to baseline approaches, our method achieves consistent improvements across all datasets in the LIBERO benchmark, significantly increasing the success rate of fine manipulation tasks and ensuring accurate task completion, thereby promoting the deployment of more reliable VLA agents in complex, unstructured environments."

While control theories in the rapid-driving and slow-driving limits have been developed, to the best of our knowledge there is no general optimization method applicable to intermediate timescales. We introduce an optimal-control framework to minimize dissipated work and work variance, defined via the two-point measurement scheme, in open quantum systems governed by time-dependent Lindblad master equations. By introducing an auxiliary operator, we convert the history-dependent work variance into a time-local integral, enabling efficient gradient-based optimization beyond slow or rapid driving regimes. Applying our method, we find that in the coherent spin-boson model the optimized protocol can switch discontinuously between distinct locally optimal solutions as the relative weight between dissipation and fluctuations is varied. Moreover, for a single-level quantum dot coupled to a fermionic reservoir, the optimized fluctuation-minimizing protocol develops a qualitatively different multi-step structure that is not captured by approaches based on slow- or rapid-driving limits."

    "abstract": "Establishing a unified origin that simultaneously accounts for the wide-band diffuse flux and recent ultra-high-energy (UHE) detections is a pressing challenge in multi-messenger astrophysics. Successive shock regimes in shock-breakout candidates, most notably low-luminosity gamma-ray bursts (LL GRBs), naturally introduce distinct physical environments producing a multi-component neutrino flux extending from 10 TeV to the UHE regime. Integrating prompt and afterglow phases within a unified dynamical framework yields a self-consistent explanation for this broadband emission. In this work, we discuss this framework, building on MWL observations. We show that the prompt emission from GRB~060218-like events accounts for $\\gtrsim 10\\%$ of the diffuse flux at 100~TeV, while GRB~100316D-like configurations predict a distinct flux peak near $10^{-9}\\rm~GeV~cm^{-2}~s^{-1}~sr^{-1}$ at 100~PeV, providing a physical interpretation for the 220 PeV KM3-230213A event. This decoupling explains the lack of low-energy counterparts for individual UHE detections while maintaining consistency with the total diffuse neutrino flux. Ultimately, this framework identifies SBO-like LL~GRBs as a unifying origin for these phenomena, providing a physical link across a wide band from 10 TeV to EeV energies testable by next-generation observatories, including GRAND, IceCube-Gen2, and RNO-G."

We propose physics-based CBCT simulation to provide geometrically aligned training pairs by construction, combined with evaluation using geometric alignment metrics against input CBCT rather than biased ground truth. On two independent pelvic datasets, models trained on synthetic data achieved superior geometric alignment (Normalized Mutual Information: 0.31 vs 0.22) despite lower conventional intensity scores. Intensity metrics showed inverted correlations with clinical assessment for deformably registered data, while Normalized Mutual Information consistently predicted observer preference across registration methodologies (rho = 0.31, p < 0.001). Clinical observers preferred synthetic-trained outputs in 87% of cases, demonstrating that geometric fidelity, not intensity agreement with biased ground truth, aligns with clinical requirements."

While a sharp gapped plasma mode exists deep in the CFL phase, we demonstrate that it is damped near the proposed continuous phase transition between CFL and FL. This plasmon-damping phenomenon originates from emergent gauge fields and a Dirac-fermion-like spectrum. Similar features also occur in other continuous deconfined topological phase transitions, such as the Laughlin to superfluid transition in a bosonic system. In particular, this damping behavior extends over a finite range across the phase boundary, and, hence, we expect it to persist even when the transition is weakly first-order. Furthermore, we analyze the behavior of the Drude weight, the wavevector-dependent conductivity, and the chiral mirror effect across these topological phase transitions."

Using techniques of Fourier-Laplace transforms, we first prove the existence of mild solutions for continuous initial data. Using a recently obtained pointwise representation of the fractional material derivative, we then identify a necessary and sufficient condition on the source term that guaranties the solution to remain a probability density for all times (non-negativity and unit mass). Motivated by the need to preserve these probabilistic properties in computations, we construct a finite-volume discretization that is probability conservative by construction. We establish discrete stability and a convergence result for the continuous weak solution as space and time steps tend to zero. Extensive numerical experiments validate the scheme: total mass is conserved, non-negativity is maintained, and the computed solutions reproduce the known analytic representations of the probability density functions associated with the Lévy walk process. The combined theoretical and numerical framework provides a reliable tool for studying anomalous transport governed by fractional dynamics."

Using a linear vibronic coupling model, we derive the free energy along the adiabatic energy gap and demonstrate analytically that as the gap approaches zero, an infinite free-energy barrier arises around the CI seam. Molecular dynamics simulations of the methaniminium cation on the S$_1$ surface confirm this prediction: trajectories can approach regions with small adiabatic gaps, but never reach the CI seam, even if the CI corresponds to a region of lowest potential energy. These results clarify why MQC methods successfully capture nonadiabatic behavior without sampling exact degeneracies and agree with recent findings that classical trajectories can sense the presence of CIs without visiting them."

Previous work has assessed situated brushing and linking in a virtual reality simulation of a supermarket scenario. Here, we replicate and extend the previous approach by studying brushing and linking in an actual physical space with augmented reality, while further improving the highlighting techniques. Using a video see-through display, we compare augmented reality with virtual reality.

Prior methods devote the full rank budget to error reconstruction, which is suboptimal when $\\mathbf{W}$ has intrinsic low-rank structure and quantization corrupts dominant directions. We propose Structured Residual Reconstruction (SRR), a rank-allocation framework that preserves the top-$k$ singular subspace of the activation-scaled weight before quantization, quantizes only the residual, and uses the remaining rank $r-k$ for error reconstruction. We derive a theory-guided criterion for selecting $k$ by balancing quantization-exposed energy and unrecoverable error under rank constraints. We further show that resulting $\\mathbf{Q} + \\mathbf{L}\\mathbf{R}$ parameterization naturally supports Quantized Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (QPEFT), and stabilizes fine-tuning via gradient scaling along preserved directions.

    "abstract": "Firmware identification is a core component of firmware analysis technology, whose primary purpose is to provide sufficient information for subsequent analysis processes. Among such information, Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) information is particularly critical – without it, reverse engineering and firmware simulation cannot be carried out. However, currently there is no effective tool for identifying the ISA of monolithic firmware. This paper presents an new identification method based on a filter mechanism to address the issue of ISA identification for monolithic firmware. By studying multiple instances of instruction set architectures, our key observation is that certain instructions appear in pairs, and we summarize the concept of Instruction Pairs and develop a mechanism to extract and filter binary blocks, which integrates instruction pairs and the logical correctness analysis of the P-Code Intermediate Representation (IR). Furthermore, we build a prototype of FBFISADetector, a monolithic firmware ISA identification system based on the filter mechanism. This system uses the aforementioned methods to extract and filter binary blocks and determines the ISA of tested firmware by the number of remaining binary blocks. Finally, we evaluate our work, and the results show that: In the test of 870 ARM-Cortex M architecture samples from the monolithic firmware dataset, the identification accuracy reaches 98%; in the test of more than 15,000 ELF files covering 5 ISAs (ARM, RISC-V64, MIPS, POWERPC, TRICORE), the overall identification accuracy is as high as 99%. Meanwhile, we verify the code region hit effect of the instruction pair filtering mechanism and the IR analysis filtering mechanism based on the above ELF file dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that the final binary blocks have high credibility regarding their attribution to the current ISA."

By integrating the robust integral of the sign of error (RISE) technique with the backstepping approach, a continuous control law is developed that ensures asymptotic tracking and robustness against uncertainties and disturbances without employing neural or fuzzy approximators, which not only guarantees the boundedness of the closed-loop signals, but also remains the computation complexity at a low level.

This paper resolves this dilemma by introducing a novel neural-enhanced physics (NEP) paradigm, which enables highly data-efficient adaptation to different physical core dimensions while maintaining high fidelity. We demonstrate this paradigm with the neural-enhanced dynamic circuit model (NE-DCM), where a physics-based circuit handles dimension-aware electromagnetic dynamics while a data-efficient neural network accurately captures complex material hysteresis. This architecture, based on a principled decoupling of physics and material behavior, yields a key practical advantage: a highly data-efficient workflow. The neural network is trained only once using quasi-static data for a given material, while the physics-based model requires only minimal calibration for new core dimensions. Validated on TDK N87 toroidal cores of different sizes under diverse excitations, the NE-DCM demonstrates superior accuracy, waveform generality, and—most critically—data-efficient transferability across core dimensions, outperforming both purely model-driven and purely data-driven models. The extensibility of the paradigm is further confirmed through successful validation on a second, distinctly different ferrite material (TDK T65). This work establishes the NEP paradigm as a robust and extensible foundation for the next generation of magnetic component design tools."

When users use pre-trained encoders to avoid pre-training cost, they may suffer from backdoor attack. In other words, attackers can inject backdoors into these encoders, and trigger backdoors to evade malicious traffic detection. Thus it is necessary to detect the backdoors of these encoders before they are deployed. However, it is challenging, because: (1) traffic triggers are generated dynamically, (2) and encoders output embedding vectors. We hope to use the explanation collapse phenomenon (i.e., backdoor injection changes explanation results) to overcome these challenges. However, existing explanation algorithms are not suitable, because: (1) encoders output embedding vectors, (2) and encoders have no detection boundary. Thus it is necessary to design a special explanation algorithm. We propose MEB, a backdoor detection framework for pre-training based malicious traffic detection. In the detection framework of MEB, we use detection datasets and the explanation algorithm to calculate detection features, and input them into meta classifiers. We detect backdoors according to the prediction results of meta classifiers. In the explanation algorithm of MEB, we calculate the distance between the embedding vectors of explained samples and the embedding vector centroids of benign/malicious samples. We use the gradients of explained samples to the distance to calculate the explanation results. We implement and evaluate MEB in two typical malicious traffic datasets and two typical pre-training algorithms. Experiment results show that MEB can achieve higher detection accuracy and efficiency than baseline detection algorithms."

To address these security challenges, this work introduces an integrated framework for identity authentication and trust evaluation in ICVs. The proposed solution comprises two core components. The initial component is a privacy-preserving authentication mechanism that safeguards the vehicle’s real identity through the dynamic generation of pseudoidentities, partial keys, and message signatures. Subsequently, a multidimensional trust evaluation model is established, incorporating direct, indirect, contextual, and comprehensive trust factors. This model is enhanced by an adaptive threshold mechanism designed to dynamically discriminate between anomalous and malicious behaviors. Empirical evaluations under common attack vectorsincluding man-in-the-middle, selective misbehavior, and coordinated attacksdemonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework. When benchmarked against established algorithms such as BTCMV, MSTFM, and TOW, our method achieves consistently higher performance, with precision, recall, and F-score metrics all sustaining values above 82 percent."

    "abstract": "Facial beauty prediction (FBP) is a challenging computer vision task due to the inherent subjectivity and cultural variation of human aesthetic perception. Conventional deep learning models approach FBP as a standard regression problem, predicting a single, deterministic score for each face. This approach fails to capture the natural disagreement among human raters and can be sensitive to biases within the training data. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that reframes FBP as an uncertainty-aware learning problem. Our method leverages a deep convolutional neural network with dual prediction heads to estimate not a single score, but a full Gaussian probability distribution over the beauty scores, parameterized by its mean (μ) and variance (σ<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>). The variance explicitly models the aleatoric uncertainty inherent in the subjective labels. By optimizing the model with a Gaussian Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL) loss, our framework learns to predict both the most likely beauty score and its associated confidence. This approach provides a richer, more interpretable output, where higher variance indicates greater ambiguity or disagreement in aesthetic ratings. We demonstrate through extensive experiments on the widely-used SCUT-FBP5500 benchmark that our uncertainty-aware model not only achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing previous methods, but also provides valuable insights into the subjective nature of facial attractiveness. We achieve a Pearson Correlation Coefficient of 0.925, a Mean Absolute Error of 0.187, and a Root Mean Squared Error of 0.241."

    "abstract": "Binary code similarity detection (BCSD) is critical for ensuring software security and reliability; however, current approaches often fall short in capturing comprehensive program semantics. Existing methods typically rely on isolated code or structural embeddings; others apply naive strategies to combine these embeddings, which limits their effectiveness—particularly in complex scenarios such as cross-architecture and cross-optimization binary comparisons. To address these limitations, we propose BinFuse, a lightweight framework designed for high-performance BCSD through the efficient fusion of code and structural semantics. BinFuse introduces a novel Markov matrix construction for fine-grained code feature extraction and employs an enhanced concrete autoencoder (CAE) for optimal feature selection. These extracted features are then assigned as node attributes to construct a fused semantic control flow graph (FSCFG), which is then jointly modeled by a Siamese network to enable accurate and efficient code similarity detection. Experimental results show that BinFuse achieves an impressive accuracy of 96.3% in complex scenarios, significantly outperforming established baselines such as Asm2Vec and Gemini in multiple evaluation metrics. Notably, BinFuse achieves accuracy comparable to the state-of-the-art IoTSim while reducing the detection time by 15%. The favorable balance between accuracy and efficiency achieved by BinFuse underscores its potential as a practical and scalable solution for BCSD in complex scenarios, thereby contributing to the development of more secure and trustworthy software systems."

    "abstract": "Accurate fault diagnosis of electric submersible pumps (ESPs) poses significant challenges, primarily due to two factors: the scarcity of labeled fault samples and the complex temporal dependencies inherent in multi-sensor monitoring data. To overcome these issues, we propose a Transformerembedded Discriminative Prototypical Network (TDPN). Within this framework, a multivariate time series Transformer encoder (MTSTE) is utilized to capture long-range temporal patterns and cross-sensor correlations, thereby generating robust sequential representations under dynamic operating conditions. Based on these embeddings, an adaptive discriminative loss (ADL) is further designed to refine the metric space for few-shot classification. Specifically, ADL minimizes intra-class dispersion through center-based constraints and introduces adaptive interclass margins to enhance discrimination among prototypes. By jointly leveraging MTSTE and ADL, TDPN effectively addresses both the scarcity of labeled data and the complexity of temporal dependencies. Experimental results on real-world offshore ESP datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed approach."

In contrast, we present a multi-phase allocation method that addresses scalability and accuracy by dividing the problem into smaller sub-problems of day and shift allocation, which significantly reduces number of computational variables and allows for targeted objective functions, ultimately enhancing both efficiency and accuracy. Each subproblem is modeled as a Integer Programming Problem (IPP), with solutions sequentially feeding into the subsequent subproblem.

A test circuit was constructed to simulate typical defects. Ultra-high frequency (UHF), high-frequency current (HFCT), and ultrasonic sensors were employed to synchronously monitor discharge signals. The Phase-Resolved Partial Discharge (PRPD) patterns and statistical signal features-including kurtosis, skewness, form factor, and peak factor-across different discharge stages were analyzed. The Exponential Moving Average (EMA) change rate was introduced to dynamically assess the defect evolution trend. Furthermore, a fault identification model based on Support Vector Machine (SVM) was developed. Features from multiple sensors were dimensionality-reduced using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and model parameters were optimized via crossvalidation. The results indicate that the identification accuracy using a single sensor ranged between 64% and 69%, while multisensor feature fusion significantly enhanced the accuracy to 89%. The method proposed in this study provides an effective technical approach for the early monitoring and precise diagnosis of interturn faults in oil-paper insulation, holding significant value for improving the early warning capability against sudden transformer failures."

    "abstract": "With the growing reliance on cloud services for large-scale data management, preserving the security and privacy of outsourced datasets has become increasingly critical. While encrypting data and queries can prevent direct content exposure, recent research reveals that adversaries can still infer sensitive information via access pattern and search path analysis. However, existing solutions that offer strong access pattern privacy often incur substantial performance overhead. In this paper, we propose a novel privacy-preserving range query scheme over encrypted datasets, offering strong security guarantees while maintaining high efficiency. To achieve this, we develop secure l earned spatial index (SLS-INDEX), a secure learned index that integrates the Paillier cryptosystem with a hierarchical prediction architecture and noise-injected buckets, enabling data-aware query acceleration in the encrypted domain. To further obfuscate query execution paths, SLS-INDEX- based Range Queries (SLRQ) employs a permutation-based secure bucket prediction protocol. Additionally, we introduce a secure point extraction protocol that generates candidate results to reduce the overhead of secure computation. We provide formal security analysis under realistic leakage functions and implement a prototype to evaluate its practical performance. Extensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that SLRQ significantly outperforms existing solutions in query efficiency while ensuring dataset, query, result, and access pattern privacy."

To address the inherent sensitivity limitations of conventional protection schemes based on steady-state quantities, this paper presents a detection mechanism utilizing transient information. A transient zero-sequence equivalent network for single-phase-to-ground faults is established, from which the differential equation of the fault loop is derived to quantitatively analyze the mathematical relationship between transient voltage and current. Based on this analysis, a transient zero-sequence power is defined, and a directional criterion based on short-window integration is developed. This method identifies the fault by leveraging the flow characteristics of electromagnetic energy during the initial fault stage, effectively overcoming the attenuation effect of transition resistance on fault signatures. Theoretical analysis and validation with measured data demonstrate that this technique can significantly enhance the detection capability for high-impedance faults in the $10 \\mathrm{k} \\Omega$ range, providing effective technical support for wildfire risk prevention and control."

The case study focuses on the DEUTSCHL subset of the Essen Folksong Collection, comprising over 4,000 melodies from German-speaking regions alongside a newly digitized and standardized corpus of lyrics. The interface is organized into interconnected dashboards that support two modes of interaction: distant reading, for statistical comparison of corpora, subcorpora, and user-defined sets; and close reading, for detailed visualizations of individual melodies and their associated texts. Synchronized visualizations — including rhythm course plots and sentiment polarity diagrams — allow dynamic filtering by metadata, musical parameters, or lyrical content. Emotion-based analysis, largely independent of language, further opens possibilities for comparative research across culturally diverse collections. Designed for accessibility, the system enables scholars without programming expertise to engage deeply with digitized sources. Grounded in UX research with 47 musicologists and five music theorists, the project demonstrates how integrating text analysis into music digital libraries can enhance search, navigation, and classification, transforming repositories into active research environments that foster discovery, interpretation, and cross-disciplinary inquiry."

    "abstract": "The remote desktop is widely used in enterprise environments. To improve its security, Zero Trust is generally introduced to replace the traditional perimeter-based model with dynamic trust evaluation and continuous verification. However, for the remote desktop system, where access chain topology can be abstracted as a graph consists of users, terminals, VMs and connections between them, classical dynamic trust evaluation approaches rely simply on users’ features collected from user-terminal interactions. They ignore features from remained parts of graph, such as terminal itself (as access medium) and status of virtual machines (as access target). Recent graph neural network (GNN) models are dedicated to fusing features from multiple sources in graph structure; however, they are often designed for low-heterogeneity domains and are thus not well suited to the heterogeneous interactions in remote desktop access. To address these challenges, we propose a heterogeneous graph neural network (HGNN) framework for trust evaluation in remote desktop systems. In particular, we model users, terminals, and virtual machines as distinct node types and represent their interactions as a heterogeneous graph, upon which we apply HGNN to aggregating multi-type relational information. This enables comprehensive and adaptive trust estimation tailored to the characteristics of remote desktop environments. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms baselines in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score in the trust-level prediction task, confirming the effectiveness of heterogeneous graph modeling and neural-based aggregation in improving trust evaluation performance."

This paper develops a comprehensive physical model for a TEC module. Designed with MATLAB Simscape's thermal and electric blocks, it is capable of realistically modeling the thermal behavior for the device with particular interest in cooling performance at disparate ambient temperatures. A critical simplification assumption is to maintain the hot side heat sink fixed at 50°C, thus removing the complexities of temperature regulation on the cold side. To rein in the TEC's operational disturbances and instabilities emanating from the external environment, a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) control structure is introduced and optimized. Simulation results confirm the PID controller's ability to control the cold-side temperature with superior stability and fast response to setpoint variations and high precision even when subjected to variations in ambient conditions. This work substantiates the validity of the model by employing Simscape to carry out design studies and points out the viability of the PID controller towards realizing high-quality thermal management with TEC-based systems."

Traditional safety evaluations often fail to detect these subtle, context-dependent flaws. To address this, we introduce a scalable red-teaming framework designed to systematically attack and expose latent gender bias vulnerabilities in foundational models. Our framework operationalizes bias as an exploit, leveraging three distinct attack patterns—Latent Bias Elicitation, Forced-Choice Discrimination, and Stereotype-Amplifying Narrative Generation—to bypass safeguards and compel biased outcomes. We deployed this framework in a large-scale offensive campaign against a cohort of globally significant models, including the GPT, Claude, Gemini, and leading Chinese foundational model series. The attacks successfully manipulated all targets into producing statistically significant discriminatory outputs, proving that inherent bias is an operationally exploitable vulnerability. We discovered asymmetric weaknesses: English-centric models were attacked to exhibit strong male bias in Chinese contexts, while Chinese-centric models were vulnerable to similar male-biased exploits across both languages. This work provides concrete demonstration of socio-cultural bias as a potent and scalable attack vector, establishing the necessity of adversarial red-teaming for building trustworthy AI. All attack data and scripts are open-sourced to facilitate further security audits."

    "abstract": "The use of millimeter-wave (mmWave) bands is essential for increasing the capacity of mobile networks. However, the link quality (LQ) in mmWave bands is highly sensitive to signal blockage caused by obstacles, making it necessary to predict future LQ and adaptively control wireless communication to maintain stable connectivity. Deep neural network (DNN)-based LQ prediction using physical space information, such as the positions of user equipment (UE) and surrounding obstacles, enables proactive control by anticipating user movement and blockage events. However, the number of blocking obstacles is generally unknown in advance, and conventional supervised learning approaches require separate models for each environment, limiting their scalability. To address this limitation, we propose a common LQ prediction model that can flexibly adapt to environments with varying numbers of blocking obstacles. As an evaluation scenario, we considered an indoor 5G environment where one UE holder and several pedestrians walk, causing two types of LQ degradation: self-blocking due to UE holder and blocking due to pedestrians. Experimental results from indoor commercial 5G experiments under three pedestrian-density scenarios demonstrate that the proposed single model can accurately predict future LQ in all cases. We also analyze the contribution of physical space information, showing that position, direction, and velocity are important for the UE holder, whereas position alone is sufficient for pedestrians."

Therefore, effectively detecting optimization bugs is essential to guarantee the correctness and trustworthiness of deep learning compilers.In this paper, we present ORThrus, an automatic approach to effectively detect optimization bugs in deep learning compilers. Conceptually, our approach develops a non-optimizing reference compiler to an optimizing compiler, then to detect optimization bugs by comparing the discrepancies in the two compilers’ outputs. Obtaining a non-optimizing reference compiler is challenging, because existing deep learning compilers provide limited control over optimizations. We thus propose a novel approach dubbed optimization resistance transformation that structurally transforms an input deep learning model from an optimizable form to an unoptimizable form that the deep learning compiler can no longer perform the potential optimizations. We build a prototype for our approach and evaluate it in an extensive testing campaign on two widely-used deep learning compilers TVM and ONNXRuntime. ORThrus detects 21 bugs, of which 9 are non-crash optimization bugs and 1 is missed by the state-of-the-art tool NNSmith even with its cross reference feature enabled. Meanwhile, ORThrus introduces negligible execution overhead."

    "abstract": "Economic viability in the circular economy depends on accurately determining residual value of products and components after use. However, there is a lack of systematic methods for assessing this residual value. As products traverse multiple lifecycle phases, their economic potential is influenced by factors such as usage intensity, degradation, and market dynamics. The digital shadow, a data-driven representation of a physical product, offers the opportunity to capture and analyze these lifecycle data. This paper introduces a methodology to leverage digital shadows for the determination of residual value. By enabling data-driven residual value assessments, the framework supports informed decision-making for economically viable utilization strategies within the circular economy."

    "abstract": "The escalating complexity of network threats and the inherent class imbalance in traffic data present formidable challenges for modern Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel in modeling topological structures and Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs) are proficient in capturing time-series dependencies, a framework that synergistically integrates both while explicitly addressing data imbalance remains an open challenge. This paper introduces a novel deep learning framework, named Gated Temporal Convolutional Network and Graph (GTCN-G), engineered to overcome these limitations. Our model uniquely fuses a Gated TCN (G-TCN) for extracting hierarchical temporal features from network flows with a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) designed to learn from the underlying graph structure. The core innovation lies in the integration of a residual learning mechanism, implemented via a Graph Attention Network (GAT). This mechanism preserves original feature information through residual connections, which is critical for mitigating the class imbalance problem and enhancing detection sensitivity for rare malicious activities (minority classes). We conducted extensive experiments on two public benchmark datasets, UNSW-NB15 and ToN-IoT, to validate our approach. The empirical results demonstrate that the proposed GTCN-G model achieves state-ofthe-art performance, significantly outperforming existing baseline models in both binary and multi-class classification tasks."

The study responds to a gap in existing maturity models, which are weakly connected to the needs of managers responsible for improving organizational processes, insufficiently practical, and rarely empirically validated. The proposed assessment method integrates diagnostic and recommendation functions and is designed to support both the evaluation of the current state and the identification of actionable steps leading to higher maturity levels. The research follows a design-oriented methodology and combines a systematic literature review, expert assessment, pilot studies, and a empirical evaluation among organizations of different sizes and sectors. The resulting method introduces a structured set of obligatory and optional criteria, as well as tailored recommendations that can be further adapted to the context of specific organizations. Empirical findings demonstrate that users perceive the method as clear, useful, and aligned with organizational practice, and that the recommendations provide meaningful guidance for improvement. The study shows that integrating prescriptive mechanisms with maturity assessment reduces the gap between diagnosis and implementation and enables the design of realistic development trajectories. The article concludes with a discussion of limitations, practical implications, and directions for future research, including sector-specific validation and digitalization of the assessment tool."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a lightweight three-dimensional convolutional neural network (3D-CNN) for human activity recognition (HAR) using event-based vision data. Privacy preservation is a key challenge in human monitoring systems, as conventional frame-based cameras capture identifiable personal information. In contrast, event cameras record only changes in pixel intensity, providing an inherently privacy-preserving sensing modality. The proposed network effectively models both spatial and temporal dynamics while maintaining a compact and computationally efficient design. To address class imbalance and enhance generalization, focal loss with class reweighting and targeted data augmentation strategies are employed. The model is trained and evaluated on a composite dataset derived from the Toyota Smart Home and ETRI datasets. Experimental results demonstrate an F1-score of 0.9415 and an overall accuracy of 94.17%, outperforming benchmark 3D-CNN architectures such as C3D, ResNet3D, and MC3_18 by up to 3%. It also has approximately 10 times fewer parameters than the second best benchmark network. These results highlight the potential of event-based deep learning for developing accurate, efficient, and privacy-aware human action recognition systems suitable for real-world applications."

Notably, LLMs are known to be vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks, where adversaries craft malicious inputs to induce harmful or unethical outputs. In this paper, motivated by the unique effectiveness and scalability of In-Context Learning (ICL) in LLMs, we explore its potential to modulate the safety alignment of LLMs. Specifically, we propose the In-Context Attack (ICA), which employs harmful demonstrations to subvert LLMs' safety, and the In-Context Defense (ICD), which bolsters their resilience through examples that demonstrate refusal to produce harmful responses. By adjusting the distribution of safety in LLM outputs through adversarial demonstrations, our proposed in-context attack and defense facilitate effective manipulation of their alignment. We first provide theoretical insights to illustrate how minimal in-context demonstrations can efficiently alter safety alignment. Empirically, we validate ICA and ICD across multiple models, datasets, and attack baselines, showing their efficacy and scalability for red-teaming evaluations and robust safeguards for real-world deployment. Overall, our work unveils the pivotal yet understudied role of ICL in LLM safety, opening new avenues for understanding and improving them."

Effective scheduling and management of these systems are critical in both academic research and industrial applications. This paper focuses on robotic flow shop scheduling involving multi-type parts production under interval pickup constraints, where both part sequences and robot operations must be determined simultaneously. To address this complex scheduling problem, a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model is developed, incorporating three valid inequalities to improve model compactness and strengthen solution performance. The proposed model is tested on an illustrative instance consisting of five machines and eight parts, solved using the Gurobi Optimizer. Computational results validate the effectiveness and feasibility of the model, demonstrating its potential for practical application in automated robotic manufacturing environments."

The focus was on 189 final-year students from ten universities, all of whom had taken entrepreneurship and innovation-related courses. The results of data analysis using multiple regression suggests that an entrepreneurial attitude and perceived behavioural control had the strongest and most significant effect on student intention and were the most significant predictors of learning outcome. These findings have implications for improving the design of courses in entrepreneurship to better address the needs of those students who are considering starting their own businesses."

TSDs serve as facilities where an external TT can decouple a tractor and chassis with container loaded, with unmanned tractors transporting the containers to the CT, reducing external TT dwell time. In this study, a container drayage model incorporating chassis operations and a CT dwell time measurement model was developed and used in numerical experiments to evaluate the strategy. The results revealed that the strategy reduces CT dwell time and improves TT operational efficiency. The effects were particularly significant in scenarios with severely limited TT availability. Moreover, the study demonstrated that inadequate management of chassis reallocation could result in chassis accumulation within the depot, potentially creating new bottlenecks in the transportation process."

The privacy paradox in branded mobile apps is much more severe than in social network sites. We consider contextual factors because privacy protection settings are too complex to be understood. It is a trade-off between outcomes of privacy issues and efforts to deal with them. We consider customers’ need to use branded mobile apps. It is a trade-off between essential/optional benefits and required/additional personal information. Results are from analyzing 482 valid data collected by an online survey. The influence of contextual factors (habit) has the greatest impact, followed by monetary rewards and perceived risks. Habit is external to users’ calculations of privacy risks and benefits. Users may unconcern privacy disclosure because of their habits, they may feel more comfortable and engagement more. Perceived benefit has no significant effect. Privacy fatigue directly and indirectly influences engagement thru perceived risks. Perceived relevance directly influences engagement and perceived benefits.

By leveraging multimodal information and diffusion-based generation, the method injects perturbations into high-entropy regions to maximize structural disruption while maintaining perceptual fidelity. Furthermore, we conduct an information-theoretic analysis from both topological and embedding perspectives to interpret the adversarial generation process. Experiments indicate SEMA outperforms previous methods on diverse face recognition models, with the attack success rate improved by up to 18.6% in the best case."

In this paper, we propose CAHS-Attack, a CLIP-Aware Heuristic Search attack method. CAHS-Attack integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to perform fine-grained suffix optimization, leveraging a constrained genetic algorithm to preselect high-potential adversarial prompts as root nodes, and retaining the most semantically disruptive outcome at each simulation rollout for efficient local search. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art attack performance across both short and long prompts of varying semantics.

While Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption (CP-ABE) enables fine-grained policy enforcement, existing schemes face two key limitations: high computational overhead on resource-constrained client devices and the lack of efficient verification mechanisms for outsourced decryption results from semi-trusted cloud servers. In this paper, we propose VO-PABE (Verifiable and Optimized Public-device ABE), an efficient outsourced CP-ABE scheme with authority-auditable verification. Our approach leverages an optimized bilinear group structure combined with enhanced hash and pairing computation techniques to concentrate most operations within smaller groups, significantly improving encryption/decryption efficiency. Under the public equipment environment framework, VO-PABE achieves secure outsourced computation via novel conversion keys. Furthermore, we design an authoritative verification mechanism using ciphertext-embedded verifiable parameters to ensure the correctness of outsourced decryption results. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VO-PABE reduces user-side computational overhead by 30% compared to state-of-the-art schemes while successfully enabling verifiable outsourcing. Importantly, VO-PABE achieves adaptive security under the Generic Group Model (GGM)."

First, by analyzing large-scale bibliographic data, we quantitatively demonstrate that bibliographic fields, such as author, title, and journal, possess unique lexical features that can be statistically distinguished without syntactic parsing. Based on this finding, we define two new metrics, Candidate Coverage and Reference Coverage, to evaluate the similarity with candidate records. Our framework improves robustness against title-less citation styles, which are challenging for SBMV. Our method predicts the presence of a title based on the lexical features of the reference string and adaptively modifies the validation logic.

In this work, we propose Implementation-Level Provable Security, a new paradigm that defines security in terms of structurally verifiable resilience against real-world attack surfaces during deployment. To demonstrate its feasibility, we present SEER (Secure and Efficient Encryption-based Erasure via Ransomware), a file destruction system that repurposes and reinforces the encryption core of Babuk ransomware. SEER incorporates key erasure, entropy validation, and execution consistency checks to ensure a well-constrained, auditable attack surface. Our evaluation shows that SEER achieves strong irrecoverability guarantees while maintaining practical performance. This work demonstrates a shift from abstract theoretical models toward practically verifiable implementation-layer security."

    "abstract": "This study aims to support a process of learning new knowledge by experienced worksite people who are not good at studying. To realize this approach, emulsification, a chemical principle, was applied. This principle allows objects that are difficult to mix, such as water and oil, to coexist. Applying this idea, the study proposes a tool, named learning priority diagram (LPD), with a tree diagram that assists workers in acquiring new knowledge based on their experience. The research begins with describing the concept model to mix knowledge and experience based on the original emulsification process, and then proceeds to develop LPD and initially implement it. Finally, the above trial also confirms the utility of the proposal. The obtained results shows that LPD is effective to a certain extent for initial research purpose, and the requirement of improving the method within a range that do not interfere with the learning process are discussed as future study focus."

    "abstract": "Hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) require an effective energy management strategy (EMS) to optimize energy use and reduce emissions. Parallel HEVs, in particular, depend on intelligent control strategies to manage the power split between the internal combustion engine and the electric motor, as well as to regulate the state of charge of the battery (SoC). This work aims to evaluate and compare two EMS schemes for an ADVISOR-simulated parallel HEV. One, 'Fuzzy Emissions Mode,' is a rule-based scheme that comes pre-installed in ADVISOR. The other is a fuzzy logic EMS optimized by the author using a genetic algorithm. Simulations were conducted using a programmed driving schedule to measure key performance metrics, including the required torque, power split between the electric and combustion powertrains, evolution of the battery state of charge, and exhaust emissions. The results show that the GA fuzzy-optimized EMS outperforms the benchmark by providing a more balanced torque delivery, improved state-of-charge management, and lower emissions. These findings demonstrate the potential of intelligent optimization techniques to improve the efficiency and sustainability of energy management in parallel hybrid vehicles, supporting the advancement of environmentally friendly transportation technologies."

While smart contracts encode critical business logic, their low-level implementations remain difficult for auditors and regulators to interpret. To bridge this semantic gap, we propose a structure-aware instruction-tuning framework that translates Solidity functions into Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) diagrams using large language models (LLMs). Our approach constructs a high-quality dataset of 15K Solidity-BPMN pairs through embedding-based clustering, prompt engineering, and multi-template augmentation. We fine-tune DeepSeek-Coder using LoRA for efficient domain adaptation, enabling the model to generate syntactically valid and semantically faithful BPMN structures. Experimental results show that our fine-tuned model outperforms GPT-4o, Gemini, and baseline LLMs in both structural precision and semantic fidelity. This work lays the groundwork for structure-level explainability of smart contracts and supports future research in code-to-process modeling and blockchain compliance analysis."

Fortunately, Intelligent Reflecting Surface (IRS) can address above challenges by dynamically adjusting the phase, amplitude, and polarization of reflecting signals, thus finally change the wavefront and enable the signal coherent superposition at receivers, resulting in improved signal quality, which can be further adopted to promote the performance of the Integrated Communication, Navigation, and remote Sensing (ICNS). Inspired by these advantages, this article investigates the potential applications of IRS in future satellite constellations. We first provide a comprehensive review of satellite communication systems and IRS, along with their capabilities. By leveraging their respective advantages and specific characteristics, we further explore the applications of IRS deployment in satellites, including the Internet of Everything (IoE), deep space exploration, positioning and navigation, and secret communications. A case study of the IRS-secured satellite framework is presented to prevent air and space Eavesdroppers (Eves), further demonstrating its security advantages. Finally, we discuss the future perspectives of IRS-assisted satellite communication systems."

    "abstract": "In today’s software development environment, third-party libraries (TPLs) enhance productivity but also introduce security risks. Effective Software Composition Analysis (SCA) is crucial for managing these risks. Yet, existing SCA tools for C/C++ projects struggle with challenges like detecting modified and nested TPLs, precise version representation, and comprehensive TPL databases. In modern software development, third-party libraries (TPLs) are commonly used to boost functionality and save development time. However, this convenience introduces security risks. We introduce OSSDetector, a new SCA tool that addresses these issues. OSSDetector uses sliding window and fuzzy hashing techniques to generate detailed signatures, improving detection of modified TPLs. It features a \"Nested TPL Function Filtering\" algorithm to accurately identify and filter nested TPL functions, and a \"TPL Recognition\" algorithm based on import ratios and function paths to determine the TPLs used in the software. It also addresses version representation by using function weights and release times. To overcome the lack of a comprehensive TPL database, we have developed a large database with 29,416 C/C++ TPLs and 767,405 versions. Experimental results demonstrate that OSSDetector surpasses state-of-the-art tools, achieving better precision (85.52%), recall (79.82%), and F1 score (82.57%), and higher precision (84.27%) at the library version level."

Although full parameter fine-tuning is powerful, it is resource-intensive and can easily overfit on imbalanced data. We propose Adaptive Progressive Fine-Tuning (APFT), a strategy that automates this complex process. APFT employs a staged layer unfreezing process guided by an event-triggered mechanism; instead of relying on a fixed schedule, phase transitions are automatically initiated based on real-time training stability metrics like loss volatility and performance plateaus. Upon transition, a cosine annealing scheduler is re-initialized, and weight decay is adaptively increased to regularize the newly trainable parameters. Experiments on the long-tailed HISTORY-X4 archival dataset indicate that APFT significantly outperforms all baselines, including full fine-tuning and LoRA. The advantage is most pronounced on tailed labels, where our APFT method achieves a $19.9 \\%$ relative improvement in text-to-image $m A P \\text{@} 10$ over the strongest baseline, demonstrating its ability to effectively adapt to new domains while preserving foundational knowledge."

    "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate an air-to-ground (A2G) wireless network system where multiple uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) provide downlink communication coverage for mobile ground users (GUs). This system accounts for UAVs progressively depleting their energy during coverage provision, ceasing operations when their energy reserves fall below a predefined threshold. We aim to maximize cumulative system throughput over the task period while satisfying the minimum fairness requirement through joint trajectory control and resource allocation (JTCRA) optimization. To meet the fairness requirement, enhancing system robustness is critical; energy-sufficient UAVs must autonomously assist GUs that lose connectivity when their serving UAVs terminate operations. Therefore, we propose a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) framework with a parameter-sharing architecture to solve this problem. As conventional parameter sharing is restricted to homogeneous agents with identical observation-action spaces, we design a dual-agent structure: a trajectory agent (Traj-agent) and a communication agent (Comm-agent) are deployed for each UAV. This separation organizes the heterogeneous tasks of trajectory control and resource allocation into distinct homogeneous agent groups, facilitating effective parameter sharing within each type. Based on this framework, we apply two alternative algorithms: an MAPPO-based JTCRA algorithm and a QMIX-based JTCRA algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of our proposed JTCRA algorithms, which maintain service continuity for GUs through intelligent trajectory control, thereby minimizing the adverse impact of coverage gaps."

Traditional Three-Dimensional (3D) localization methods remain costly due to their reliance on large-scale specialized infrastructure deployments. Achieving a favorable balance between positioning accuracy and infrastructure cost presents persistent challenges in developing practical 3D localization systems. To address the limitation, this paper proposes a low-cost 3D localization algorithm based on error optimal estimation. Firstly, a novel 3D error model is established which uses pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) step-length drift and heading drift to characterize error sources. Secondly, a multi-data fusion adaptive extended Kalman filter (DA-EKF) is proposed which dynamically adjusts error parameters in real-time to enhance positioning accuracy. Additionally, an absolute initial position estimation technique combining PDR and Round-Trip-Time measurements is provided which enhances stability and convergence speed of the absolute initial position prediction. Finally, experiments show 0.081 m line-of-sight (LOS)/1.75 m non-line-of-sight (NLOS) accuracy with 75% fewer base stations (BSs), reducing errors by 77.35% versus baselines."

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) is a popular paradigm enabling clients to jointly train a global model without sharing raw data. However, FL is known to be vulnerable towards backdoor attacks due to its distributed nature. As participants, attackers can upload model updates that effectively compromise FL. More critically, existing defenses are mostly designed under independent-and-identically-distributed (iid) settings, hence neglecting the fundamental non-iid characteristic of FL. Here we propose FLBuff for tackling backdoor attacks even under non-iids. The main challenge for such defenses is that non-iids shorten the distance between benign and malicious updates, rendering them harder to separate. FLBuff is inspired by our insight that non-iids can be modeled as omni-directional expansion in representation space while backdoor attacks as uni-directional. This leads to the key design of FLBuff, i.e., a supervised-contrastive-learning model extracting penultimate-layer representations to create a large in-between buffer layer. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that FLBuff consistently outperforms state-of-the-art defenses. Code is at https://github.com/xingyushu/FLBuff."

By analyzing equipment operating data under different scenarios, concepts such as confidence are used to understand association rules, clarifying the operating laws and correlation characteristics of equipment. Using the mined association rules, a multi-scenario scheduling optimization model for VPP equipment is constructed with the goals of minimizing economic costs and maximizing environmental benefits.

Experimental results show that in terms of gas energy output, the total gas energy output in period 1 under high, medium, and low scenarios is $150 \\mathrm{~kW}, 300 \\mathrm{~kW}$, and 500 kW respectively, effectively utilizing energy and ensuring power supply; in terms of user comfort loss, the average loss under the three scenarios is about 4 yuan, 6 yuan, and 8 yuan respectively; in the scenario of high renewable energy output + low load, the incentive cost is mostly between 50 and 150 yuan in each period with small fluctuations, effectively reducing operating costs."

    "abstract": "In the formal modeling and verification of trusted concurrent systems (such as distributed trusted computing platforms and secure communication protocols), the complex inter-leaving of behaviors easily triggers state space explosion, greatly reducing the efficiency of model checking. Although Colored Petri Nets (CPNs) can effectively represent concurrent behaviors and data interactions, their models often contain a large number of redundant structures irrelevant to the properties to be verified, thereby impairing the efficiency of verifying the core properties of trusted systems. This paper proposes a CPN model reduction method based on Unrelated Transitions—transitions in the model that have no data relationship with the properties to be verified. By identifying and eliminating behaviors irrelevant to the properties to be verified, the method achieves efficient state space reduction while ensuring the consistency of property verification results, thus providing technical support for the verification of trusted systems. Specifically, through data-flow analysis of property formulas, Unrelated Transitions with no data interaction with the target properties are identified. Then, all behaviors of the reduced model elements are integrated into adjacent model components. On the premise of preserving the model behaviors and their relationships (such as sequence, choice, and concurrency) unchanged, operations including arc expression encapsulation, conditional transfer, and arc redirection are employed to reduce the number of irrelevant nodes while ensuring the model remains connected and executable. Experimental results show that the state space of the reduced model is significantly compressed, and the verification results of the properties to be verified remain completely consistent before and after reduction, which demonstrates the effectiveness and correctness of the proposed method in improving the efficiency of modeling and verification for trusted systems."

However, the open nature of the IoV exposes it to various security threats, including the spread of malicious data and trust violations. To address these challenges, we propose a Filter-Based Trust Evaluation (FTE) system, which combines direct and indirect trust evaluation metrics to assess the trustworthiness of vehicles. The proposed system utilizes a Kalman filter-based approach to fuse predicted and measured trust values, allowing for dynamic and accurate trust assessments. Our extensive simulations show that FTE outperforms existing trust management schemes, demonstrating superior accuracy, efficiency, and robustness, even in environments with high malicious vehicle ratios. The results highlight the potential of FTE for secure and reliable operation in the IoV systems."

Grounded in TSA theory, it tests whether familiar teams achieve higher situation awareness (SA) and teamwork perception than unfamiliar ones. 20 pairs of participants (10 unfamiliar groups; 10 familiar groups) were recruited to complete a manufacturing monitoring task. Familiar groups outperformed unfamiliar groups in level 1 SA (perception), likely due to shared expectations and coordination habits. Unfamiliar teams demonstrated significantly higher level 3 SA (projection) after collaborative discussion, as they engaged in a more deliberate communication and active coordination under stress. While familiarity supports early-stage cue detection, unfamiliarity may promote deeper information processing and adaptability in complex tasks. Practical implications include combining the stability of familiar teams with structured communication strategies to optimize TSA."

To train effective models to effectively predict reproducibility-oriented sentiments and further systematically study their correlation with reproducibility, we introduce the CC30k dataset, comprising a total of 30,734 citation contexts in machine learning papers. Each citation context is labeled with one of three reproducibility-oriented sentiment labels: Positive, Negative, or Neutral, reflecting the cited paper’s perceived reproducibility or replicability. Of these, 25,829 are labeled through crowdsourcing, supplemented with negatives generated through a controlled pipeline to counter the scarcity of negative labels. Unlike traditional sentiment analysis datasets, CC30k focuses on reproducibility-oriented sentiments, addressing a research gap in resources for computational reproducibility studies. The dataset was created through a pipeline that includes robust data cleansing, careful crowd selection, and thorough validation. The resulting dataset achieves a labeling accuracy of $\\mathbf{9 4 \\%}$. We then demonstrated that the performance of three large language models significantly improves on the reproducibility-oriented sentiment classification after fine-tuning using our dataset. The dataset lays the foundation for large-scale assessments of the reproducibility of machine learning papers. The CC30k dataset and the Jupyter notebooks used to produce and analyze the dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/lamps-lab/CC30k."

Existing detection methods often struggle with three critical challenges: performance degradation due to video compression, a limited capacity to detect subtle audio-visual semantic inconsistencies, and excessive computational latency for real-time deployment. This paper introduces a lightweight, multi-modal framework designed to address these limitations. Our method employs a dual-stream architecture for parallel analysis of visual and auditory signals. Key contributions include: a novel dynamic frequency band selection module that adaptively isolates and enhances faint forgery artifacts from heavily compressed video streams; a phoneme-aligned cross-modal verification system that precisely quantifies lip-audio temporal desynchronization to detect semantic mismatches; and a lightweight hybrid architecture integrating ResNet3D and Mamba for efficient spatiotemporal modeling. Validated on benchmarks like CelebDF and FaceForensics++, our method achieves a state-of-the-art trade-off, delivering accuracy competitive with leading methods at a fraction of the computational cost, thus enabling practical real-time deployment."

    "abstract": "Binary Code Similarity Detection (BCSD) identifies functions with similar functionality across binaries. Reverse engineers leverage BCSD techniques to locate critical functions in software, thereby compromising associated functional modules. This poses significant challenges for software protection. Although code obfuscation can counter BCSD, existing methods typically apply global, undifferentiated obfuscation, leading to unnecessary code size and runtime overhead. This paper proposes ReinObf, a reinforcement learning-optimized method for lightweight and differentiated obfuscation. In the LLVM intermediate representation of functions, we implement a custom pass to extract statistical and structural features from basic blocks and construct Attributed Control Flow Graphs (ACFGs). A hierarchical RL agent encodes ACFGs using graph neural networks, selects critical blocks and optimal obfuscation methods, then iteratively generates optimized obfuscation sequences that maximize evasion effectiveness while minimizing overhead. Experimental validation demonstrates that ReinObf effectively evades BinDiff, jTrans, CLAP, and Gemini, with an average similarity of 0.391. Compared to OLLVM’s combined obfuscation, it reduces code size overhead by 66.3% and runtime overhead by 34.7%, achieving a favorable security-performance tradeoff."

Combined with the torque balance and energy conversion relationship during the braking process, calculation models for braking distance, temperature change, and braking duration were constructed. Simulation verification shows that the established model can accurately describe the dynamic characteristics of the braking system, providing theoretical support for the optimization of braking performance in flight tests."

The diagnostic core is an improved deep model enhanced with transfer learning to remain effective under small-sample regimes and distribution shifts across boards and process corners. In experiments with twelve representative fault types (short, open, and parameter drift among others), the framework achieves 98.7% average accuracy, an 11.3 -point improvement over a single-feature baseline, while keeping end-toend latency under 5 ms on an industrial edge GPU.

We consider a two-tier offloading framework, where each multi-antenna terminal can optionally offload its local tasks to either multiple mobile-edge servers for distributed computation or the cloud server for centralized computation. The above offloading problem is formulated as a mixed-integer programming and non-convex problem, which can be decomposed into three sub-problems, namely, distributed offloading decision, beamforming design, and execution scheduling mechanism. First, the continuous relaxation and penalty-based techniques are applied to tackle the distributed offloading strategy. Then, the weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE) and successive convex approximation (SCA)-based lower bound are utilized to design the integrated communication and sensing (ISAC) beamforming. Finally, the other resources can be judiciously scheduled to minimize the maximum latency. A rigorous convergence analysis and numerical results substantiate the effectiveness of our method. Furthermore, simulation results demonstrate the benefits of multi-point cooperation in cell-free massive MIMO-enabled ICCS and reveal the trade-off between the number of involved APs and the resulting latency, highlighting the inherent interplay among communication, sensing, and computation."

    "abstract": "Acoustic Holography is an emerging field where mid-air ultrasound is controlled and manipulated for novel and exciting applications. These range from mid-air haptics, volumetric displays, contactless fabrication, and even chemical and biomedical applications such as drug delivery. To develop these applications, a software framework to predict acoustic behaviour and simulating resulting effects, such as applied forces or scattering patterns is desirable. There have been various software libraries and platforms that attempt to fill this role, but there is yet to be a single piece of software that acts as a ‘full-stack’ solution. We define this full-stack as the process from abstraction to physicalisation starting with setup, modelling acoustic propagation, transducer phase retrieval, sound field analysis, and control of the acoustic holographic hardware itself. Existing methods fail to fulfil one or more of these categories. To address this, we present AcousTools, a Python-based acoustic holography library, designed to support the full suite of acoustic holographic applications and we show AcousTools’s ability to meet each step of the full-stack’s requirements. AcousTools has the potential to become the standard code library for acoustic holography, with the uniquely complete suite of features wrapped in a language that is known to be easy to use, AcousTools will increase the ability for researchers to develop novel applications as well as accurately review other’s work. The full-stack, aside from software, will also be useful for researchers – providing a way to view and compare methodologies by understanding where they fit into the stack."

Existing solutions often suffer from centralized control, inflexible access policies, and weak privacy guarantees. To address these, we propose a blockchain-based, privacy-preserving scheme that integrates threshold proxy re-encryption and zero-knowledge proofs. Patients’ encrypted medical records are stored in private cloud environments, while access control is enforced through a threshold proxy re-encryption mechanism. Dynamic rekeying and delegation are supported through re-encryption key redistribution. For insurance verification, we generate zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge (zk-SNARKs) based on arithmetic circuits that represent the insurance policy requirements. These proofs are verified on-chain without revealing any underlying medical information. Security and performance analyses demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed system. Experimental results show that our scheme supports sub-100 ms re-encryption cycles, reduces zero-knowledge proof generation time by over 90% compared to other zk-SNARK schemes, and imposes low on-chain computational overhead. These findings demonstrate the feasibility and potential suitability for real-world privacy-preserving medical data sharing and insurance evaluation."

However, Rust programs are susceptible to memory and thread safety issues, making dynamically analyzing Rust issues imperative. Unfortunately, a dynamic analysis framework for Rust is still lacking, hampering the advancement of dynamic analysis for Rust and posing security risks for the language.In this paper, we present RuDyna, the first Rust native dynamic analysis framework to the best of our knowledge. Our framework aims to instrument Rust programs and provide a set of hooks for monitoring runtime events. To this end, we first propose instrumenting the Rust MIR with three rules designed for satisfying its constraints. We then present four instrument strategies to inject various runtime events on MIR. Finally, we develop a hierarchical strategy to instrument configurable hooks to reduce overheads. We implement RuDyna by extending Rust’s official rustc compiler and hooks are provided as a Rust library. We conduct evaluation on a set of micro-benchmarks and 4 real-world large Rust projects. Experimental results indicate that RuDyna preserves the original semantics of programs, with an acceptable runtime overhead ranging from 1.1 × to 3.6 ×, which aligns with built-in instrumentation in rustc and similar frameworks for other languages. Moreover, we implement six analyses based on RuDyna, demonstrating its practical usability."

The optimization problem is formulated as a Mixed-Integer Non-linear Programming (MINLP) problem with variables of WPT duration, offloading decisions and energy allocation. To solve this problem, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based framework, which employs a neural network architecture combining convolutional and fully connected layers to output offloading decisions. Additionally, we design an optimization algorithm for joint optimization of WPT duration and offloading proportions. Numerical results demonstrate the proposed method achieves better performance than the existing DRL methods, which demonstrates the efficiency of the proposed method."

    "abstract": "As smart cities emerge, Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs) are rapidly growing in scale and advancing in development. With more vehicles connecting to the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), the demand for robust security and privacy protection becomes critical. Multiple authentication schemes have been proposed in VANETs research to tackle these challenges. Despite extensive research, existing solutions still face fundamental security challenges, such as privacy leaks and modelling attacks, and there is an urgent need to find a breakthrough between security and efficiency. Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) are the most promising solution to physical attack problems, leveraging the inherent non-replicability of their physical structure and clever system design to resist physical attacks. However, with the development of artificial intelligence technology, existing authentication schemes using PUF technology are susceptible to machine learning-based modelling attacks. We propose a hybrid PUF-based scheme that disrupts mapping relationships by employing obfuscated challenge-response pairs (CRPs), making it difficult for attackers to establish a stable model even if they obtain partial CRP data. We formally prove its security within the Real-Or-Random (ROR) model, and compared to other schemes, our approach simultaneously satisfies both security and efficiency requirements."

Existing photovoltaic power prediction methods have problems such as insufficient capture of time-series dependencies, poor model generalization ability, and vulnerability to seasonal changes. To address these issues, this paper proposes a photovoltaic power prediction method based on an improved Transformer and continual learning. This method innovatively addresses the catastrophic forgetting problem caused by seasonal changes in meteorological features. It establishes multi-scale correlations between meteorological factors and power generation via a hybrid convolutionTransformer architecture. Additionally, it constructs a dynamic knowledge distillation framework and incorporates a memory replay mechanism to effectively mitigate the interference from seasonal meteorological trend changes. Comparative experimental results show that this method performs prominently in error control and data fitting, with overall prediction performance superior to compared algorithms, enabling more accurate prediction of photovoltaic power generation."

    "abstract": "Memory safety vulnerabilities remain a critical threat to software security, often leading to system crashes, data leakage, and service disruptions. Existing deep learning-based detection methods mainly rely on intra-procedural analysis, which limits their ability to capture complex memory behaviors involving pointer variable flows across function boundaries. This study proposes IpGAT, an InterProcedural memory vulnerability detection framework based on Graph Attention Network (GAT) that aims to overcome the limitations of intra-procedural approaches by modeling cross-function data flows of pointer variables. IpGAT constructs an Interprocedural Program Call Graph (IpCG) that integrates Abstract Syntax Trees (AST), Control Flow Graphs (CFG), and Data Flow Graphs (DFG) to represent memory-sensitive function interactions. The IpCG is embedded using Word2Vec and then fed into a GAT for vulnerability classification. Experimental results show that IpGAT achieves an accuracy of 88.9%, a precision of 86.5%, and an F1-score of 89.1%, significantly outperforming six state-of-the-art tools and intra-procedural baselines. Furthermore, IpGAT successfully identified eight real-world memory safety vulnerabilities in open-source projects such as ffdshow, Libav, Seamonkey, and VLC, all of which have been confirmed in the CVE database. By incorporating interprocedural analysis and graph-based learning, IpGAT effectively captures the semantics of memory-sensitive operations and demonstrates strong generalizability across both benchmark datasets and real-world software."

To overcome this limitation, we present a computer vision-based approach that accurately detects text-areas within structured tables. Our framework integrates a Faster R-CNN-based object detector with the RLSA algorithm to perform table detection and text-area recognition in sequence. In our experiments using 124 annotated text-areas, the proposed method achieved an F1 Score of 0.93 for online text and 0.67 for offline text. This technique not only improves OCR performance but also lays the groundwork for ontology-based document analysis, contributing to the broader goal of document digitization."

    "abstract": "AI is spreading rapidly, creating significant social and economic value while also raising concerns about its high energy use and environmental sustainability. While prior studies have predominantly focused on the energy-intensive nature of the training phase, the cumulative environmental footprint generated during large-scale service operations, particularly in the inference phase, has received comparatively less attention and remains difficult to compare across studies due to inconsistent boundaries and disclosure practices. To bridge this gap, this study conducts a scoping review of methodologies and evidence on AI carbon footprint assessment. We analyze the classification and standardization status of existing AI carbon measurement tools and methodologies, and comparatively examine the environmental impacts arising from both training and inference stages, and synthesize inference evaluation into a benchmark-oriented framework. In addition, we identify how multidimensional factors such as model size, prompt complexity, serving environments, and system boundary definitions shape the resulting carbon footprint. Our review reveals critical limitations in current AI carbon accounting practices, including methodological inconsistencies, technology-specific biases, and insufficient attention to end-to-end system perspectives. Building on these insights, we propose future research and governance directions: (1) establishing standardized and transparent universal measurement protocols with clear boundary, functional-unit, and disclosure requirements, (2) designing dynamic evaluation frameworks that incorporate user behavior and service-level operating conditions, (3) developing life-cycle monitoring systems that encompass embodied emissions, and (4) advancing multidimensional sustainability assessment framework that balance model performance with environmental efficiency. This paper provides a foundation for interdisciplinary dialogue aimed at building a sustainable AI ecosystem and offers a baseline guideline for researchers and policymakers seeking to evaluate AI environmental impacts across technical, social, and operational dimensions."

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are inherently vulnerable to link stealing attacks, as their structural aggregation mechanisms may inadvertently leak training graph data. Existing link stealing methods primarily rely on posterior similarity for inference but suffer from critical limitations: inherent semantic bias (e.g., misclassifying semantically similar but unconnected nodes) and insufficient structural information, which constrain attack performance. To address these issues, we propose TLSA (Transfer Learning-based Link Stealing Attack), a novel framework that captures generalized structural knowledge from multi-domain heterogeneous graphs based on cross-domain knowledge transfer, and merges it with posterior similarity to enhance attack performance. The cross-domain knowledge transfer is enabled by integrating partially leaked target subgraphs with shadow graphs. Specifically, TLSA designs a triple-level alignment mechanism, including node feature reconstruction, which unifies heterogeneous posterior dimensions across domains; trainable hub nodes with gradient-driven topological optimization, forming bidirectional learning loops that bridge target and shadow domains; and domain adversarial training, which minimizes graph distribution distance and ensures deep semantic consistency across domains. Since its extracted structure-aware features are fused with node-pair semantic similarity, TLSA generates enhanced attack features for accurate edge existence prediction, significantly improving link stealing performance. Extensive experiments on diverse graph datasets validate the effectiveness of TLSA."

Existing data poisoning attacks in RAG predominantly operate at the instance level, targeting individual queries, which fall short in real-world scenarios where attackers often seek broader influence. In this paper, we introduce a more general and impactful attack paradigm, in which all queries belonging to a target category are forced into generating attacker-desired outputs, while maintaining accurate responses for unrelated queries. To this end, we propose CatPoison, the first category-oriented knowledge poisoning attack against RAG. We formulate CatPoison as an optimization problem aimed at generating a set of generalized poisoned texts crafted by a black-box attacker. Extensive experiments across standard RAG benchmarks demonstrate that CatPoison achieves substantially higher attack success rates compared to prior poisoning baselines. Our findings expose a previously overlooked vulnerability in semantic-level retrieval and highlight the urgent need for defenses tailored to category-oriented knowledge corruption."

In this paper, alignment involves safeguarding the model against producing harmful or inappropriate content and ensuring its outputs are aligned with ethical guidelines. Existing alignment works have primarily focused on making the outputs of large language models(LLMs) harmless. However, the integration of multimodal information into MLLM inputs can lead to unintended or undesirable responses, thereby undermining the original alignment mechanisms of LLMs. When image, audio, or video information is contained in queries, MLLMs cannot guarantee the safe alignment of responses. In this study, we first collect VAdvBench to demonstrate that the additional multimodal inputs can easily break the safeguards of LLMs in MLLMs, highlighting the security vulnerabilities in these MLLMs. To address this issue, we propose SafeMLLM, a safety alignment framework designed for MLLMs. SafeMLLM aligns multimodal content by transforming multimodal inputs into a unified space, enabling MLLM to effectively block multimodal harmful information. In addition, since the current multimodal safety alignment works only consider images as additional modality inputs and lack benchmarks for other modalities like audio and video, we propose a pipeline to collect and synthesize a multimodal safety alignment benchmark, MLGuard, to evaluate the safety alignment performance on multimodal queries. The experiment results on MLGuard demonstrate that our SafeMLLM effectively rejects harmful instructions containing multimodal queries of image, audio, and video, ensuring robust safety alignment across diverse multimodal inputs.

    "abstract": "Insider threat detection presents a significant challenge due to the deceptive nature of malicious behaviors, which often resemble legitimate user operations. However, existing approaches typically model system logs as flat event sequences, thereby failing to capture the inherent frequency dynamics and multiscale disturbance patterns embedded in user behavior. To address these limitations, we propose Log2Sig, a robust anomaly detection framework that transforms user logs into multivariate behavioral frequency signals, introducing a novel representation of user behavior. Log2Sig employs Multivariate Variational Mode Decomposition (MVMD) to extract IMFs, which reveal behavioral fluctuations across multiple temporal scales. Based on this, the model further performs joint modeling of behavioral sequences and frequency-decomposed signals: the daily behavior sequences are encoded using a Mamba-Based temporal encoder to capture long-term dependencies, while the corresponding frequency components are linearly projected to match the encoder’s output dimension. These dual-view representations are then fused to construct a comprehensive user behavior profile, which is fed into a multilayer perceptron for precise anomaly detection. Experimental results on the CERT r4.2 and r5.2 datasets demonstrate that Log2Sig significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both accuracy and F1 score."

Our scheme preserves the privacy of both the data owner’s datasets and the user’s queries, except that the user learns the query results. We introduce a communication-efficient secure top-k protocol and construct two secure kNN search protocols: a protocol that searches kNN results exactly, and a more efficient approximate protocol that leverages clustering-based preprocessing. For the clustering-based protocol, we also design an efficient cluster retrieval approach and a compact kNN search phase. Experiments on three large real-world datasets containing 1M/10M samples with 96/128 dimensions demonstrate that the proposed kNN search protocols achieve a speedup of 2.77× to 10.67× compared to the state-of-the-art scheme."

    "abstract": "With the continuous development of power systems, non-pure resistive loads are increasingly being integrated into power systems, impacting power quality and transmission efficiency. Therefore, this paper proposes a power quality improvement strategy based on dynamic adaptive SVPWM control and SVG reactive power compensation. A reactive current detection method is established based on instantaneous reactive power theory, and a dual closed-loop current and voltage reactive power compensation model for SVG is developed, with its working principle analyzed. Furthermore, a dynamic adaptive SVPWM control method is proposed, which adjusts switching frequency and pulse position dynamically to optimize the current waveform. Finally, simulations are conducted to compare scenarios with and without the compensation device under different loads. The results demonstrate that the proposed strategy can enhance the power factor and effectively improve power quality."

    "abstract": "Concepts in Software Engineering and Artificial Intelligence are often taught by using games as motivation. The structured nature of a game makes it easier to understand the decisions that an agent must make, and it gives us a platform for defining suitable algorithms. In this paper, we point out that this well-known approach can be effectively used in the classroom to support diversity and inclusion. We present two lesson plans for teaching programming concepts using traditional Indigenous games for motivation. These lessons are just as effective as they would be using games from some other cultural context. However, using Indigenous games has several advantages. First, the use of these games can create a more inclusive classroom environment, where we are pushing away from a model where cultural artefacts from the colonial culture implicitly have primacy. Moreover, drawing games from a variety of cultural contexts helps to reduce any bias towards students from any particular cultural tradition. Finally, using these games provides an opportunity to add a little bit of indigenous history and culture into the classroom in a natural way."

    "abstract": "As industrial control systems converge with networked infrastructures, both enterprise and IIoT environments are increasingly exposed to evolving cyber threats. However, existing IDS models struggle with imbalanced data distributions, weak generalization to unknown attacks, and limited ability to capture discriminative temporal-semantic patterns from scarce labeled data. To address these challenges holistically, we propose the Multi-Branch Convolutional Generative Aggregation Network with Semantic-Guided Fusion Memory (MBCGAN-SGFM), a unified two-stage framework that integrates generative minority-class augmentation and semantically guided detection. In the first stage, the Multi-Branch Convolutional Generative Aggregation Network (MBCGAN) employs parallel convolutional branches and residual feature aggregation to synthesize class-consistent minority samples, thereby enriching the training distribution while preserving intrinsic semantic structure. In the second stage, we propose a Semantic-Guided Fusion Memory (SGFM) module that integrates temporal and contextual features through semantic-aware fusion, with a memory refinement mechanism that adaptively updates latent representations to capture evolving traffic patterns. Class-Level semantic prototypes, learned via contrastive objectives, are embedded as structural guidance signals within both the fusion and memory update processes, enabling semantic feedback to modulate feature integration over time. Extensive evaluations on the CICIDS2017 and ML-EdgeIIoT datasets show that MBCGAN-SGFM achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines, especially in detecting minority and previously unseen threats under few-shot and zero-shot conditions."

Existing solutions based on advanced cryptography, such as Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) or Private Information Retrieval (PIR), often incur prohibitive computational or communication overheads, limiting their practical deployment. This paper introduces PrivANN, a fully oblivious system for private approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search that leverages Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). PrivANN employs a read-optimized Oblivious RAM (ORAM) protocol to defend against side-channel leakage, introduces a novel shuffling mechanism that decouples costly offline preparation from fast online operations and incorporates a novel oblivious Top-k selection algorithm. We formally prove PrivANN’s security guarantees and demonstrate its real-world performance. Our evaluation shows that PrivANN improves throughput by 2.4x over state-of-the-art FHE-based systems while achieving superior search quality, and reduces client-side communication overhead from gigabytes to kilobytes compared to PIR-based approach."

In this work, we evaluate various content-based embeddings, either by directly encoding metadata or by constructing richer user and item profiles using LLMs with internal reasoning. These embeddings are integrated into standard collaborative filtering models without modifying their architectures. Using a real-world library dataset enriched through external book databases, we show that on average, content-based embeddings improve recommendation performance by $40 \\%$ in recall and NDCG over baseline models, and LLM-generated profiles further improve performance and provide compact, interpretable representations. Our findings suggest that LLMgenerated profiles and reasoning not only enhance explainability, but also improve recommendation quality in sparse, real-world environments."

However, keyword matching methods only perform simple string matching, resulting in low retrieval efficiency. Therefore, this paper studies an enhanced method for knowledge retrieval in typical power scenario scheduling based on BFS algorithm. Systematically integrate knowledge of power dispatching, form a network architecture consisting of entity relationship entity triplets, and determine the graph structure through complex entity recognition and relationship extraction techniques. Using BFS algorithm to detect effective scheduling solutions, traversing scheduling paths and analyzing them with structured knowledge graph, and identifying all possible solutions. Based on the results of the first two stages, the optimal power scheduling scheme is generated by using retrieval enhancement technology and a reordering machine to recall scheduling schemes with high similarity using cosine similarity. The experimental results show that in terms of retrieval enhancement effect, the scheduling strategy generated by this method reduces the monthly average line loss rate from 4.8% of the original strategy to 3.3%; In the comprehensive score, the BERTScore and Agent Score of this method significantly outperformed the comparison methods in the three rounds of dialogue; In terms of retrieval efficiency, the retrieval time range of this method is $0.5-1.2$ seconds. The experiment shows that this method can effectively reduce line loss, provide high-quality knowledge support, have high retrieval efficiency, and improve the reliability and real-time scheduling of power systems."

We formulate the EVRP-WCL as a mixed-integer linear program on an incomplete network and benchmark three solution strategies: (i) the exact model solved directly in Gurobi, (ii) the same model solved after a Network-Reduction Heuristic (NRH) converts the graph into a complete multigraph, and (iii) an Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS) applied to the reduced network. Results on grids up to 12 × 12 verify that NRH preserves optimality while shrinking solve times, and grids up to 25 x 25 showcase that ALNS consistently reaches high-quality solutions for large instances that are superior to the exact solver. A cost-equivalent comparison with stationary-charging EVRP shows wireless charging lanes (WCL) eliminate time-penalty stops, offsetting their higher energy prices and frequently producing lower total cost. These findings establish WCLs as a viable charging alternative for logistics fleets."

Particles in FDSS-PSO dynamically alternate between two velocity update rules based on their real-time performance. This strategy is governed by an adaptive inertia weight that ensures a smooth, non-linear transition from exploration to exploitation without requiring manual parameter tuning. The performance of FDSS-PSO is rigorously evaluated against 13 state-of-the-art algorithms, including six PSO variants and six recent metaheuristics, on the CEC 2022 benchmark suite and a complex UAV spiral trajectory tracking problem. Experimental results demonstrate that FDSS-PSO achieves statistically superior accuracy and convergence speed, confirming its robustness and effectiveness as a highly competitive optimizer for complex real-world engineering challenges.

    "abstract": "Adversarial attacks have gained significant research interest for their ability to expose vulnerabilities in deep neural networks. However, current studies on visual adversarial attacks predominantly focus on improving attack efficiency or success rates, typically constraining perturbation magnitudes using l<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">p-</inf>norm while overlooking the critical requirement for human imperceptibility of adversarial examples. Although globally minor perturbations are generated, they may introduce localized artifacts (e.g., abnormal brightness or perceptible texture anomalies) that compromise visual stealthiness. To address this issue, we propose an attention-inverse perturbation (AIP) strategy, which restricts perturbations to visually non-attentive regions (e.g., backgrounds) identified through class activation mapping techniques, thereby minimizing visual discrepancies between adversarial and clean examples. Our strategy can be seamlessly integrated into existing attack methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed AIP strategy achieves superior performance across perceptual similarity metrics (e.g., MS-SSIM, VIF, and LPIPS) with only marginal trade-offs in attack success rate, offering a practical solution for balancing imperceptibility and attack efficacy."

    "abstract": "Vulnerability attacks targeting smart contracts have caused significant losses of digital assets. Many approaches based on static analysis, fuzzing, and deep learning have been proposed for detecting contract vulnerabilities. However, most existing methods only support vulnerability detection within individual contracts. When contracts interact with each other through external calls, these methods fail to perform effective cross-contract security analysis, leading to false negatives and false positives. To address these limitations, we propose CrossMiner, a deep learning-based approach for vulnerability detection in contract interaction scenarios. CrossMiner enables comprehensive risk assessment for cross-contract security through trace analysis of function call chains. Specifically, CrossMiner first constructs a cross-contract dependency graph based on function call chains to effectively model inter-contract dependencies and network dynamics, and collect semantic information about contract interactions. Then, it employs a heterogeneous graph neural network with a two-level attention mechanism to finely extract and integrate complex features from the dependency graph, ultimately achieving precise risk assessment and vulnerability detection. We evaluate the effectiveness of CrossMiner on three types of smart contract vulnerabilities: reentrancy, timestamp dependency, and transaction state dependency. Experimental results demonstrate that CrossMiner achieves the best performance among all baseline methods, improving detection accuracy by 5.52%, 4.94%, and 5.60% for these vulnerabilities, and the F1 scores are improved by 5.44%, 5.02%, and 5.40%, respectively."

Traditional 2D-based assembly manuals have been found to negatively impact workers, as they are limited in the amount of information they can convey. In response, this study aims to develop and evaluate a system that leverages augmented reality (AR) technology to facilitate a more intuitive understanding of assembly procedures. The functionality evaluation was conducted on three aspects: startup time, scene transition time, and the accuracy of the AR marker. The startup time was slightly longer than the standard, while the scene transition time was within the standard. The AR marker was able to be recognized to a certain extent. An experiment was conducted to compare AR with 3D, 2D, and paper-based manuals. After the experiment, a questionnaire and interviews were conducted regarding the usability of the application. While several challenges were observed in the use of the AR manual, the results suggest that it holds significant potential for future applications."

Major industries heavily rely on plastics like the health, transport, electronics, food and beverage are some of the industries that widely utilize plastic material, which has kept their demand and usage rising. Poor methods of plastic waste disposal and low rates of recycling in countries like Kenya has led to massive environmental pollution by plastics mainly as plastic bags and bottles lying everywhere in the environment, across the country on land and water bodies. Close to, 260,000 tons of plastic material are produced in Kenya on annual basis with only 15% being recycled with the rest being disposed to the environment. This has created an urgent need to increase recycling of waste plastic and mitigate the environmental crisis caused. The main objective of the study is to develop a plastic pyrolysis plant to reduce the high levels of plastic pollution. Since plastic are made from crude fossil oil, pyrolysis can be used to turn the plastics back to oil. Plastic waste pyrolysis can be used to process large quantities mixed plastic waste in mixed form and help overcome the challenge of sorting required by other recycling methods with less pre-treatment, which reduces labor requirement, time and related costs. The design process involved investigation of the design parameters for the pyrolysis process, selection of appropriate machines that are efficient, cost competitive, and environmentally friendly."

However, existing high arc erosion intensity and difficulty in predicting lifespan remain key issues limiting their engineering reliability. To address this, this paper proposes a complex lifespan prediction model integrating thermo-electrical-mechanical multi physics coupling mechanisms (GSSR). First, a finite element arc erosion module is developed, taking into account the effects of Joule heating, Lorentz force, and transient thermal stress, while incorporating the influence of graphene thermal diffusion networks and silver particle reinforcement on the material’s local heat-mass transfer behavior. Subsequently, an erosion mass loss function is established based on a nonlinear Arrhenius-Maxwell stress coupling law, characterizing the evolution of molten pits and material vaporization under multiple arc impacts. On this basis, a Bayesian fatigue damage accumulation layer is introduced, and experimental discharge sequences and performance degradation data are used for dynamic parameter calibration, enabling periodic prediction of contact lifespan evolution. Experimental results show that the model predicts erosion mass with an error of less than 6.3%."

Specifically, biphase coding, majority vote, and two-stage positioning strategies are introduced to mitigate message randomness, receiver noise, and fingerprinting errors. Besides, the achievable sum rate and energy efficiency (EE) are obtained, and the optimal DC power setting is derived to achieve the best communication performance. Results show that the positioning accuracy improves with the number of light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and as user moves closer to the room center, follows an inverted U-shaped trend with user height, and could achieve the same accuracy as the AC-based positioning method using metaheuristic algorithms but in less time. Moreover, under perfect and imperfect successive interference cancellation (pSIC/ipSIC), both the system sum rate and EE initially increase with DC power and then decrease. A small-scale experiment is also carried out to verify the proposed DC-based positioning method. This work offers a good reference for VLPC system research."

    "abstract": "The ubiquitous presence of clouds in optical remote sensing images (RSIs) degrades image quality. Thin and fragmented clouds often exhibit low contrast and diverse morphology in complex scenes, which poses a significant challenge for accurate detection. To address the current challenges in thin cloud detection, this study proposes an Adaptive Cloud Detection Network in Remote Sensing Images via Local-Global Spatial Context (LSCNet). It aims to process thin cloud features within global and local spatial contexts, thereby improving the accuracy and robustness of thin cloud detection in complex environments. Specifically, the network simulates a dual perspective by constructing a Mamba-based Multiscale Fusion (MDF) block. This block utilizes learnable fusion weights to adaptively integrate differential and complementary information, thereby capturing thin cloud variations across both spatial and spectral dimensions in RSIs. Additionally, we propose a Local Gated Mamba (LGM) block for detailed feature enhancement. This module utilizes a spatial gating mechanism inspired by Long Short-Term Memory to capture key thin-cloud features and suppress residual background noise. By fully leveraging the spatial structure and morphology of thin clouds and building connections between thin cloud features across different spatial scales, the module achieves precise segmentation of cloud and ground features, thereby boosting the classification performance for thin and thick clouds in identical observational contexts. Extensive experiments conducted on the L8-Biome dataset and the WHUS2-CD+ dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms other existing cloud detection methods."

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) are widely applied in Network-based Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) due to their high accuracy. However, DNNs are highly susceptible to adversarial attacks, which generate malicious traffic to evade NIDS detection. Existing approaches often adapt adversarial attacks from computer vision (CV) tasks to the NIDS domain, overlooking the fundamental differences between CV and NIDS. This results in two major issues: 1) The generated network traffic may become invalid, 2) The generated traffic may lose its original attack semantics. To address these issues, this paper proposes an adversarial attack specifically designed for NIDS. Instead of directly generating flow-level features, our approach incrementally generates packet-level features to construct adversarial traffic. During the generation process, the semantic integrity of the traffic is monitored at each stage, effectively avoiding the issues of invalid traffic and semantic loss observed in existing methods. We evaluate our attack algorithm against current NIDS models using the CIC-UNSW-NB15, CIC-DDoS2019, and CIC-IDS-2017 datasets. The proposed method achieves an average evasion success rate of 92.78%, while ensuring that the generated adversarial traffic remains semantically consistent with the original malicious traffic."

The problem is formulated as a multi-period facility location problem that incorporates annual fluctuations in enrolled students, the irreversibility of closures, and realistic institutional and geographical constraints. The objective function includes student assignment costs based on distance, penalties for splitting student groups, school closure costs, penalties for underutilized capacity, and penalties for imbalance across grades. In preprocessing, we construct forecast data based on historical birth and enrollment records and propose a customized definition of school closure costs to reflect practical considerations and enhance the realism of the model. Numerical experiments using real-world data from Hamamatsu City in Shizuoka Prefecture, which is known as a typical depopulated area in Japan. The experimental results showed a tendency for schools in depopulated areas to be prioritized for closure and identified cases consistent with actual closure plans, which suggests potential applicability of the proposed model to real-world decision-making."

This paper introduces a vision based framework for fully automated landing system that allows a drone to accurately estimate moving platform motion and achieve landing on it. using only its onboard camera sensor. To regulate the UAV’s motion, a PID controller is developed based on the target’s position in the image plane. Unlike approaches that rely on external localization specialized infrastructure, including motion-capture setups or Global Positioning System (GPS), the proposed method operates efficiently without any external support, It necessitates no prior awareness of the moving landing target’s position. The framework’s efficacy is confirmed using high-fidelity simulations within the Gazebo environment and ROS, with results demonstrating that the proposed strategy consistently achieves precise and reliable landings on moving platforms."

    "abstract": "The emerging low-altitude economy leverages airspace below 1000 meters for intensive commercial and social aerial activities, where integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) service in 6G network for aircraft is critical to ensuring safe and efficient operations. However, aircraft often operate under constrained wireless resources, particularly in areas with limited or no network coverage. In such settings, exhaustive sensing and data communication among neighboring nodes lead to uncoordinated competition and prohibitive overhead. This paper investigates the ISAC service modeling and scheduling in aerial-vehicle-to-everything (Aerial-V2X) networks, which provides continuous high-accuracy sensing without compromising communication throughput under constrained resource budgets. First, we design a reconfigurable ISAC waveform tailored for aircraft, enabling flexible resource partitioning for both cellular communication (aerial vehicle-to-infrastructure, A-V2I) and cooperative sensing (aerial vehicle-to-vehicle, A-V2V). Second, we formulate a joint sensing-communication service model under this waveform and cast the optimization problem in a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). Third, a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) approach is developed to perform decentralized scheduling of sensing actions for each aircraft, minimizing time-frequency resource consumption. Experiments and trace-driven evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method can reduce sensing overhead by up to 70% compared to benchmark policies, while maintaining satisfactory communication and sensing performance."

    "abstract": "Attribute-based encryption (ABE) provides fine-grained access control over encrypted data without restricting itself to a single access policy, making it applicable to diverse scenarios such as cloud environments. However, existing bilinear pairing-based ABE schemes are vulnerable to quantum attacks, while lattice-based ABE schemes typically lack flexible and efficient user or attribute revocation mechanisms. To address these challenges, this paper presents a fine-grained revocable attribute-based encryption (FR-ABE) scheme based on the ring learning with errors (RLWE) assumption. We introduce a two-dimensional attribute structure and an extended Shamir’s secret sharing method, which together support multi-valued attributes and flexible threshold access policies, while reducing storage and computational overhead. Furthermore, We have devised a fine-grained revocation mechanism that functions at both the attribute and user levels, thereby accommodating the frequent role and permission changes. The attribute authority centrally manages attribute revocation through an indirect revocation method, eliminating the need to re-run the sampling algorithm and instead relying solely on polynomial-level operations, which reduces time overhead. User revocation is implemented using a binary tree structure, which updates only the ciphertext and leaves all keys unchanged. Theoretical analysis suggests that our scheme performs well in terms of both computational and storage overhead, and experimental findings further corroborate its superiority. The security analysis establishes the scheme’s selective security under the RLWE assumption."

While fuzzy hashing has traditionally been successful at clustering malware samples based on their structural similarities, its potential as an active defense tool remains largely unexplored. This study investigates the application of fuzzy hashing for the static analysis of malware binaries to identify common vulnerabilities prevalent in malware, serving as a proactive security measure. We utilized a labeled dataset comprising real-world and synthetic Windows binaries to evaluate six fuzzy hashing algorithms for full binary classification and two for function-level matching. Our results indicate that, while fuzzy hashing is effective in simpler tasks such as malware classification and binary-level vulnerability detection, its performance decreases in more complex scenarios, including multi-class vulnerability identification and matching functions from real-world malware. Moreover, we observed a significant drop in performance, by up to 50%, when transitioning from synthetic to actual malware functions. These findings highlight both the potential and limitations of fuzzy hashing in vulnerability analysis, emphasizing the necessity for more robust techniques to detect vulnerable patterns in real-world malware."

Current research on NWDAF data security primarily adopts federated learning framework, which trains models locally to avoid privacy leakage risks. However, existing NWDAF federated learning studies mostly rely on idealized assumptions, failing to adequately address two critical issues in real-world network deployments: 1) uneven data distribution across different regions, and 2) differentiated optimization requirements for high priority security regions. To solve these problems, we propose a region dual-factor aware federated learning framework for NWDAF (NWDAF-FedRDA), specifically designed to handle regional data imbalance and security priority differences in core networks. The framework comprises three core components: 1) Model parameter distribution: enabling allocation of global model parameters to regional nodes; 2) Local training: performing regional data preprocessing and model training; 3) Region dual-factor aware aggregation: computing regional weights through awareness factors and executing global model aggregation. Experimental evaluations across four network scenarios demonstrate the framework’s performance in anomaly detection tasks. Results show that compared to baseline methods, our framework exhibits significant advantages in uneven data distribution environments while effectively enhancing model performance for high-priority security regions."

To this end, we present a new scheme, named EC-UNIT, which comprises three innovative designs aiming to Enhance cross domain Correspondence for UNIT. Specifically, 1) we propose Multi-level Style Embedding to extract multi-level style features for fusion while imposing our newly designed Hierarchical Consistency Constraints on both the content and style features (MSE&HCC), aiming to retain more style representations and facilitate feature disentanglement; 2) we develop Semantic Perceptual Matching (SPM) to minimize the semantic distribution discrepancy between the generated image and the input image by leveraging the multimodal model CLIP, dedicated to enhancing semantic consistency; 3) considering that previous works have struggled to control the image translation using pixel-level visual consistency constraints, we design Visual Perceptual Guidance (VPG) to reduce the perceptual distance between the generated image and the style input in VGG feature space, devoted to enhancing visual perceptual correspondence, thereby preventing the generation of unrealistic image details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our EC-UNIT is more stable and outperforms current SOTA competitors in terms of image quality and diversity as well as both content and style consistency."

    "abstract": "Although traditional intrusion detection systems can identify unknown attacks based on established patterns, they are incapable of the fine-grained classification needed to distinguish one from another. Moreover, the prohibitive cost of adapting a detection model to new threats without degrading its existing capabilities severely impedes its effectiveness against emerging attacks. To address these challenges, we propose a Multi-View Learning Framework for Class-Incremental Unknown Attack Detection (MVL-AD). This framework designs a contrastive error autoencoder (CE-AE) for each class to build multiple differentiated learners. These learners calculate anomaly scores from diverse perspectives to comprehensively characterize the attack profile. We apply anomaly detection algorithms to the attack profiles to identify unknown attacks. These identified unknown attacks are classified into distinct categories using Mini-Batch K-Means, with the optimal number of clusters determined by the Calinski-Harabasz (CH) index. Furthermore, MVL-AD incorporates an adaptive updating mechanism to improve its detection performance on both known and unknown attacks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MVL-AD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in stability, scalability, and practicability."

    "abstract": "In recent years, abnormal global climate change has led to frequent extreme weather events. Icing on power equipment caused by rain, snow, and freezing conditions has resulted in numerous disasters for power grids. After icing occurs at substations, safe and effective de-icing methods must be implemented to prevent severe icing failures. Traditional manual chipping methods may cause equipment damage and pose risks to personnel safety. To address this, this paper conducts numerical simulations of hot-air de-icing for high-voltage electrical equipment in substations. A computational model for hot-air de-icing of post insulators is established, employing a jet heat transfer model to perform segmented heat transfer calculations on the equivalent cylindrical segments of the entire post insulator. Based on an engineering computational model, numerical simulations utilize $\\mathbf{1 1 0 k V}$ post insulators as calculation parameters for de-icing heat transfer analysis. Results indicate that hot air velocity, hot air temperature, and ambient temperature all influence de-icing effectiveness, with hot air velocity and temperature having the most significant impact. Reduced de-icing time comes at the cost of increased energy consumption. Practical engineering applications should comprehensively evaluate both de-icing duration and energy expenditure to determine optimal hot air de-icing parameters."

    "abstract": "Construction sites are dynamic where workers are exposed to multiple hazardous environmental factors, such as noise and dust, inducing acute stress responses. Existing regulatory guidelines focus on long-term exposure and lack tools to assess short-term stress under combined environmental conditions. To address this gap, this research proposes a framework for estimating the stress probability distribution of construction workers using only heart rate data. The process consists of three main tasks: (1) a heart rate–based stress state classification model estimates stress probability; (2) the relationship between environmental factors and estimated stress probability is quantified using Bayesian Ridge Regression; and (3) a Gaussian Process Network (GPN), weighted by regression-derived coefficients, models individual stress prediction uncertainty and is aggregated using a Mixture of Gaussians. The model reveals synergistic effects; stress probability significantly increases above 80 dB for noise and 11 μg/m<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup> for dust, with compounded effects emerging when noise exceeds 80 dB and dust exceeds 8.75 μg/m<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup>. These findings provide quantitative insights into acute stress under multiple environmental factors, supporting data-driven safety and environmental management on construction sites."

Even though researchers have explored the adoption of different technologies in multiple functionalities within supply chains, current literature lacks a holistic view of the digital transformation process of supply chains, which entails the strategic adoption of technologies in supply chain operations. This study evaluates the status of digital transformation literature in supply chain management, thereby contributing to the body of knowledge by providing a synthesized evaluation of the digital transformation models and frameworks developed by researchers. Findings show that the existing digital transformation models lack the ability to guide the process with a holistic view, and that scholarly work is dispersed across different stages of the strategy management process."

    "abstract": "Frequency response analysis (FRA) of power transformers is a fundamental test for transformers. In practical on-site applications, long test cables are required to conveniently inject the test signal into the measuring instrument. At the same time, the response signal in this test can be as low as the microvolt level. Because of the test cables, the measurement of such small signals is strongly affected by the test environment, wiring conditions, and sudden external radio-frequency interference. It is therefore common that repeated measurements under ostensibly identical conditions yield inconsistent results, which complicates correct assessment of the transformer condition. From both theoretical analysis and experimental verification, this paper investigates the influence of test cables on transformer FRA measurements. A development concept for a multichannel transformer frequency response characteristic test device based on radio-frequency ($\\mathbf{R F}$) communication technology is proposed, and a prototype has been developed. Trial applications on transformers and comparison with existing test data show that the prototype achieves good test performance."

    "abstract": "Website fingerprinting (WF) attacks exploit distinctive traffic patterns to identify the specific web page a user visits over anonymized connections. While traditional WF attacks have achieved impressive results, they are typically evaluated in abundant labeled data settings and assume that website traffic features remain static. This assumption is often unrealistic in real-world scenarios. Recent methods either rely on deep learning, which still requires large amounts of labeled data, or employ self-supervised pre-training to ease this demand. However, they leave clustering information crucial for few-shot WF attacks underexplored, leaving ample room for performance gains. In this paper, we propose a novel self-supervised pre-training model for few-shot WF attacks, called Swapped Contrastive Clustering (SwCC). SwCC proposes a comprehensive and principled data augmentation scheme, combining Tor-tailored transformations with statistical procedures to foster robust and discriminative feature learning for WF attacks. SwCC further introduces an innovative dual-level contrastive learning framework that jointly leverages instance-level and prototype-based objectives, which can further perform latent-space clustering on extracted features in WF attacks. Our pre-trained model can be fine-tuned in few-shot learning scenarios and achieves state-of-the-art(SOTA) performance on few-shot WF attack tasks. Under a 5-shot learning setting in a closed-world scenario, our SwCC achieves up to 83.5% accuracy when the evaluation traces are collected from an environment unseen by the WF adversary, outperforming the SOTA methods."

Among various approaches, the MCDM-based scoring method has gained attention for incorporating multidimensional factors with interpretability. However, the absence of a structured framework for selecting evaluation criteria limits its ability to capture the distinct characteristics of startups. To address, this study proposes an integrated framework employing the balanced scorecard (BSC) to organize evaluation dimensions in a systematic manner. For each perspective, RFM-based methods are developed to assess elements such as investment history and human capital maturity. The proposed integrative framework enables a more systematic and effective assessment of early-stage startup, contributing to strategic decision making in high uncertainty environments."

The methodology consisted of hydrodistillation as a nonlinear system subject to Lipschitz conditions and observability properties. Based on this framework, the structure of the observer was derived using algebraic parameterizations, and stability conditions were established using the second Lyapunov method. The simulation results demonstrated that the proposed observer was capable of accurately estimating the internal variables of the system. This approach can serve as a basis for designing monitoring and fault diagnosis systems, representing a step toward safer operation of oil extraction techniques."

    "abstract": "The Matter protocol has rapidly become the new standard for secure and interoperable IoT connectivity, adopted by major industry players and integrated into millions of devices. A core feature of Matter is its ability to support device sharing across users and controllers. However, as vendors independently implement Matter and blend it with their proprietary ecosystems, significant inconsistencies emerge. These inconsistencies result in heterogeneous user capabilities depending on which Matter Controller (MC) or OEM app is used, introducing a new and largely unexplored class of security risks. In this work, we present the first systematic study on security risks stemming from heterogeneous Matter controller implementations in shared device environments. We analyze 18 major IoT vendors and uncover a novel category of vulnerabilities, which we term MCG (Matter Controller Gaps), where differences in controller capabilities can enable unauthorized access or stealthy device manipulation. To uncover these flaws at scale, we develop MCG-Checker, a semi-automated analysis tool that combines large language models and UI automation to detect control disparities across Matter controllers and OEM apps. Using MCG-Checker, we evaluate 14 Matter controllers and 8 OEM apps, discovering 5 previously unknown attack vectors affecting top vendors such as Google, Apple, and Amazon Alexa. Our work reveals critical design and implementation issues in current Matter deployments. We offer concrete recommendations for protocol designers, vendors, and end users to address these gaps, contributing to more secure and predictable IoT ecosystems."

This paper proposes a multi-objective optimization design method for motors integrating Kriging prediction models with the NSGA-II algorithm: an electromagnetic and thermal simulation model is established using Motor-CAD, a sample set is generated via Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS), and prediction models for efficiency and cogging torque are constructed based on the Kriging algorithm. With efficiency maximization and cogging torque minimization as objectives, while constraining output torque and back EMF, the NSGA-II algorithm generates the Pareto optimal frontier and solves for the optimal solution. Research indicates that the optimized motor achieves an output torque of $2230.3 \\mathrm{~N} \\cdot \\mathrm{~m}$, meeting the field requirement of $2230 \\mathrm{~N} \\cdot \\mathrm{~m}$; Efficiency reached 94.64%, meeting energy-saving enhancement standards; cogging torque decreased to $13.21 \\mathrm{~N} \\cdot \\mathrm{~m}$, outperforming the field requirement of $20 \\mathrm{~N} \\cdot \\mathrm{~m}$ and improving motor operational stability.

Results show that the proposed scheme significantly reduces current and voltage distortion at the point of common coupling while maintaining reasonable device capacity and life-cycle cost.

    "abstract": "Partial shading in solar energy systems presents a significant challenge for traditional maximum power point tracking (MPPT) methods, which often fail to identify the global maximum power point (GMPP) due to the presence of many local maxima in the power-voltage (P-V) curve. This paper introduces a novel modified metaheuristic-inspired Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) method, called the Carpet Weaver Optimization Approach (CWOA), specifically developed to enhance tracking efficiency in shaded settings. The proposed method employs a specific metaheuristic strategy to dynamically analyze the P-V curve and precisely distinguish between local and global maxima. The method utilizes dynamic discovery processes to ensure rapid convergence to the global maximum, regardless of differing shading patterns. Comparative simulation results indicate that the improved CWOA-based method significantly outperforms with an average efficiency of 98.09% and a mean tracking time of 0.86 seconds compared to traditional and other metaheuristic MPPT techniques, such as Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and the Arithmetic Optimization Algorithm (AOA), showcasing enhanced tracking accuracy, swift response times, and increased power output. This work introduces an innovative method to augment the performance of photovoltaic systems in complex shadowing conditions, thereby raising the dependability and efficiency of solar energy extraction."

The Triangle Model focuses exclusively on the facial region by filtering out non-essential background content. Next, the DCT pyramid decomposes the image into multiple frequency levels, capturing detailed structural information. Statistical metrics, including mean, variance, and entropy, are applied to the low-frequency components, ensuring a compact feature representation. The refined features are then fed into a neural network, which is trained through backpropagation to classify different subjects accurately. Comprehensive evaluations on benchmark datasets such as ORL, Yale, and AR dataset demonstrate the system's effectiveness in achieving both high recognition accuracy and computational efficiency. Its strong performance across varying facial conditions confirms the suitability of the proposed method for practical face recognition applications."

Archival references are relatively rare, occurring in about 1% of footnotes and endnotes in History papers, books, and theses. This sparsity, combined with the variable writing styles, makes it difficult to train a robust identifier for archival references.

    "abstract": "Access control is a security mechanism designed to ensure that only authorized users can access specific resources. Cross-domain access control involves access to resources across different organizations, institutions, or applications. Traditional access control, however, which handles authentication and authorization separately in centralized environments, faces challenges in identity dispersion, privacy leakage, and diversified permission requirements, failing to adapt to cross-domain scenarios. Thus, there is an urgent need for a new access control mechanism that empowers autonomous control over user identity and resources, addressing the demands for privacy-preserving authentication and flexible authorization in cross-domain scenarios.To address cross-domain access control challenges, we propose POLARIS, a unified and extensible architecture that enables policy-based, verifiable and privacy-preserving access control across different domains. POLARIS features a structured commitment mechanism for reliable, fine-grained, policy-based identity disclosure. It further introduces VPPL, a lightweight policy language that supports issuer-bound evaluation of selectively revealed attributes. A dedicated session-level security mechanism ensures binding between authentication and access, enhancing confidentiality and resilience to replay attacks.We implement a working prototype and conduct comprehensive experiments, demonstrating that POLARIS effectively provides scalable, privacy-preserving, and interoperable access control across heterogeneous domains. Our results highlight the practical viability of POLARIS for enabling secure and privacy-preserving access control in decentralized, cross-domain environments."

    "abstract": "High-Resolution Range Profile (HRRP), which contains rich discriminative information about targets, is widely used in radar automatic target recognition. However, the aspect sensitivity of HRRP data limits recognition performance in scenarios with missing or varying aspects, while noise and other disturbances also distort HRRP waveforms, impairing recognition. To address these issues, inspired by causal theory, this paper proposes an HRRP target recognition framework comprising an Unsupervised Dynamic-Attribute Feature Disentanglement Network (UDAFD-Net) and an HRRP Recognition Network (HRRP-RecNet) in cascade. UDAFD-Net employs an asymmetric variational inference architecture to decompose HRRP sequence samples into dynamic features (related to aspect variations, noise, and other disturbances) and attribute features (solely linked to target types). A counterfactual regularization constraint is integrated into the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) loss to block spurious correlations between dynamic and attribute features, ensuring their independence. Finally, the disentangled attribute features and their corresponding type labels are used to train HRRP-RecNet, ensuring that recognition results depend only on the target's intrinsic attributes, free from irrelevant factors. Experiments on the aircraft electromagnetic simulation dataset and the measured dataset demonstrate that the proposed method achieves higher accuracy and stronger robustness in HRRP target recognition without requiring any aspect labels or prior knowledge of disturbances."

    "abstract": "Partially Relevant Video Retrieval (PRVR) aims to retrieve videos that match a given textual query only partially. This task is inherently challenging due to the modality gap between text and video, which is further exacerbated by the partial semantic correspondence between linguistic descriptions and visual content. To address these challenges, we propose a bidirectional cross-modal alignment mechanism that collaboratively optimizes both visual and textual modalities. In the visual modality, a major difficulty lies in the absence of visual cues that directly correspond to textual semantics, limiting the models ability to align visual representations with textual meanings under unsupervised conditions. To overcome this issue, we construct a semantic-visual association library, which stores paired visual and textual features with semantic annotations. During training, the model dynamically retrieves the most semantically similar visual samples from this library based on the current visual feature vector. These retrieved samples, preliminarily associated with semantics via cross-modal matching, are used to form dynamic anchors that guide visual representation learning. By leveraging these enriched visual features, the model progressively refines the visual representations to achieve better alignment with the corresponding textual inputs, thereby enhancing cross-modal consistency. In the textual modality, we enhance textual representations by integrating semantically aligned visual features selected from the same association library, further narrowing the modality gap. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets under partial semantic correspondence scenarios demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

HBMT yields succinct proofs (depth ≈ 14 on our test set) with verified roots, enabling forensics-ready attestations and chain anchoring. CL-GIE operates under tight latency budgets: per-record HBMT verification is ∼0.02 ms, while meta-model scoring remains sub-millisecond, sustaining real-time pipelines. Empirically, CL-GIE surpasses one-class, reconstruction, clustering, and rules baselines. A stacked variant attains state-of-the-art ROC (AUC= 0.991), while isotonic meta-calibration maximizes area under the precision–recall curve (AP = 0.852), reflecting robustness at low prevalence. Confusion matrices corroborate high recall and specificity (e.g., stacked: TP = 480, FN = 23, TN = 9398, FP = 99), aligning with clinical detection priorities and low false-positive exposure. An ablation-driven weight sweep shows that ethics signals and cross-layer drift are pivotal at the optimal operating point, with validation F1≈0.81–0.88 across calibrated and stacked settings. Radar and correlation analyses further indicate balanced gains across AUROC, AUPR, F1, specificity, and calibration metrics. Overall, CL-GIE delivers a principled, explainable, and audit-capable integrity layer for ethically governed gene-editing workflows, unifying cryptographic proofs, drift-aware detection, and policy transparency under a single evaluative framework."

    "abstract": "Baud-rate sampling offers significant reductions in power consumption and implementation complexity for coherent data center interconnects (DCIs), but imposes stricter requirements on timing recovery. In this paper, we propose a polarization- crosstalk-tolerant baud-rate timing recovery scheme, termed nonlinear Mueller & Müller (NL-MM), tailored for coherent DCIs. By introducing a smooth nonlinear function into the timing error detector (TED), the proposed scheme alleviates the performance degradation observed in conventional sign-MM schemes under polarization crosstalk. Simulation results confirm strong robustness across various conditions, including polarization angle variations, phase rotations, amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) noise, and different normalized loop bandwidths (NLBWs). Specifically, the proposed scheme resolves the failure of sign-MM under severe polarization mixing, which causes distorted signal distributions and introduces multiple zero-crossings in the S-curve of the sign-MM, leading to incorrect timing lock positions. At a polarization angle of <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$45^\\circ$</tex-math></inline-formula>, it achieves a reduction in timing mean square error (MSE) of up to 37 dB compared to sign-MM. Experimental validation is conducted using a 70 km 118 Gbaud polarization-multiplexed 16QAM system. Under small NLBW, the proposed scheme incurs only a 0.8 dB OSNR penalty relative to an improved Gardner scheme (at 2 SPS). Under large NLBW, it delivers OSNR gains of 3.62 dB and 0.37 dB over the sign-MM and improved Gardner schemes, respectively, due to significantly reduced timing jitter. These results demonstrate the robustness and practical effectiveness of the proposed scheme for polarization- and phase-impaired coherent optical links."

However ISCC systems are still facing serious channel fading and obstacle occlusion problems, which are expected to be solved by the emerging simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS). In this paper, we propose a STAR-RIS-assisted ISCC framework, where the computational tasks from users are offloaded to a base station (BS) for processing with the assistance of a STAR-RIS, and the results are subsequently downloaded back to the corresponding users. Notably, target sensing operation is executed concurrently throughout the process of result downloading. To enhance communication efficiency, the non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) scheme is incorporated. The number of offloading bits of users is maximized by optimizing the uplink-downlink resource of the network, including the received beamforming vector, active beamforming vector, time slot, phase shift of STAR-RIS, and computational resource. In order to solve the highly complex non-convex problem, we employ the block coordinate descent (BCD) framework to decompose the proposed problem into three subproblems. The convex-concave procedure (CCCP) method is used to deal with the nonconvex constraints. For the rank-1 constraints, the semidefinite relaxation (SDR) approach and the penalty method are invoked. The numerical results show that: 1) the application of STAR-RIS significantly improves the offloading capability of the network, 2) the NOMA scheme significantly outperforms the orthogonal multiple access (OMA) scheme, and 3) comparing with other benchmark schemes, the proposed algorithm significantly improves the overall network performance."

    "abstract": "The pervasive presence of multimodal fake news significantly threatens network trustworthiness and information security, which urgently demands the development of advanced detection methodologies. However, existing methods encounter considerable challenges: (1) the complexity of integrating multi-granularity information and mitigating domain biases amplified by pretrained models; (2) the heterogeneity and inconsistency of domain-specific trust standards; (3) the formidable difficulty in migrating and aligning cross-modal trust, especially when handling modality conflicts and discrepancies; and (4) inadequate assurance of security and trustworthiness in information fusion mechanisms. To address these issues, this paper introduces DTAHF-Net, a novel framework for Domain-Trust Alignment and Hierarchical Fusion for Multimodal Fake News Detection. DTAHF-Net begins by extracting multi-granularity features via BERT, MAE, and CLIP. It subsequently incorporates an Adaptive Domain Trust Representation Layer for dynamic adaptation to domain-specific trustworthiness, followed by a Cross-Domain Trust Alignment Module employing consistency detection and contrastive learning for robust trust migration and alignment. Finally, a Secure Multi-View Fusion Layer with domain-adaptive gating enables trustworthy hierarchical fusion. Empirical evaluations conducted on three real-world datasets, encompassing both Chinese and English news, demonstrate that DTAHF-Net significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baseline models (e.g., MMDFND), achieving accuracy and F1-score improvements of 1.9% and 1.5%, respectively."

SEUs can cause configuration corruption and further functional failure. Triple modular redundancy (TMR) is often used to mitigate this risk. However, common mode failure, which is an inherent flaw of the traditional TMR architecture, limits the effectiveness of mitigating SEUs. Therefore, aiming at CPU-centric TMR systems, we propose an approach to restructure the redundant modules in the TMR architecture. Three instruction set architecture (ISA)-heterogeneous CPUs, which are functionally equivalent, introduce difference into the utilization of configuration memory, and thus eliminate the common mode failure. Further, we propose an analytical method based on Markov model to estimate the SEU reliability for both TMR architectures, and efficiently prove the SEU reliability improvement of the ISA-heterogeneous TMR architecture. Finally, by investigating the derived SEU reliability, we offer guidance on how to design an ISA-heterogeneous TMR system to realize higher reliability."

Aiming at the limitations of the traditional Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) in processing transient signals such as voltage sag, this paper proposes an improved power measurement algorithm based on Db4 wavelet packet transform. Firstly, the influence mechanism of voltage sag on power measurement is analyzed, and a mathematical model of power error during sag is established. Subsequently, based on the wavelet multi-resolution decomposition theory, a wavelet packet transform signal processing model is constructed to effectively separate fundamental and distorted components through signal decomposition and reconstruction. Finally, simulation experiments are conducted to verify the algorithm performance. Two types of voltage sag signals (single variation and composite variation) are set up, and the measurement accuracy of fundamental power and distorted power is compared and analyzed. The results show that the algorithm achieves a measurement accuracy of the order of $10^{-2}$ under complex sag signal conditions, which can effectively extract sag characteristics, suppress measurement errors caused by transient interference, and provide technical support for high-precision power measurement under transient operating conditions of UHVDC transmission systems."

In this paper, we propose VLAH, a lightweight and verifiable framework for ANN search. VLAH integrates locality-sensitive hashing with a compressed trie structure for efficient bucket verification and employs the in-bucket HNSW index to accelerate candidate retrieval. To ensure result integrity, we design a hybrid verification object that combines Merkle-based prefix proofs, neighbor-bucket consistency, and graph search trace validation. By integrating blockchain technology, we further enhance the integrity of the scheme. We theoretically analyze the complexity of our scheme and the correctness and integrity guarantees of the query results in lightweight verification. Experimental results on real high-dimensional datasets show that VLAH achieves competitive search performance with significantly reduced verification costs, bridging the gap between efficiency and verifiability in large-scale ANN systems."

We define the studied problem as a two-echelon system incorporating three interdependent decisions: joint location optimization of automated kiosks and drone launchpads, two-step allocation (kiosk-launchpad and launchpad-demand area), and launchpad-specific drone fleet sizing. The problem is initially formulated as a profit-maximizing mixed-integer nonlinear program, which is then equivalently reformulated into a mixed-integer linear program to efficiently optimize the relevant decisions while ensuring computational traceability. Extensive numerical experiments based on Shenzhen data reveal that optimal deployment strategies yield stable profit margins of approximately 14–15%, providing quantitative validation of the economic potential of drone-based delivery systems. We also derive several valuable strategic insights based on the results. These insights reveal that in early-stage operations, enhancing infrastructure density is an effective strategy, while in more mature phases, stimulating demand becomes the key to further profitability growth. Additionally, profit volume is mainly driven by launchpad deployments (enabling service coverage), whereas profit margin is governed by the spatial efficiency (i.e., the deployments) of kiosk layouts (influencing delivery costs). Together, these findings offer practical and valuable guidance on whether and how to implement drone delivery systems, contributing to the ongoing development of the low-altitude logistics economy."

This design effectively thwarts attack primitives such as out-of-bounds memory access, illegal instruction execution, and privilege escalation. It is suitable for various application scenarios, including storage device controllers, low-power network devices, and educational platforms for computer architecture."

A Traffic Congestion Management System was designed and implemented on a 240-meter-long departure road in Hong Kong. The system utilizes laser-based occupancy sensors for high-accuracy detection, LED signage for dynamic driver guidance, and Power over Ethernet (PoE) technology for simplified installation and energy efficiency. Real-time data communication enables predictive analysis and preventative maintenance, ensuring optimal performance.Preliminary testing showed acceptable accuracy and precision, though a minor 2–4 second delay in LED sign activation was observed.

Firstly, the process of cable assembly inspection method was introduced, which mainly included the standard template generation stage and the assembly error detection stage. Then, the generation process of the two templates for key components of cable harness and the standard cable laying path were elaborated based on the CAD model of the assembly. The key components template included the location information of the cable components. The laying path template included binary data of the cable path.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are being integrated into information retrieval pipelines within digital library systems for tasks such as re-ranking and filtering. However, a challenge arises from the observed disagreement between different LLMs in borderline classification cases, raising concerns about how this variability impacts downstream retrieval and the integrity of digital library collections. This study examines disagreement between two open-weight LLMs, LLaMA and Qwen, when tasked with evaluating a corpus of scholarly abstracts based on their contribution to Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We isolate subsets of documents where model disagreement occurs and examine their lexical properties, rank-order behavior, and classification predictability. Our results demonstrate that this model disagreement is not random: it concentrates in ambiguous cases, produces divergent top-k outputs under shared scoring functions, and is separable with AUCs above 0.74 using logistic regression. These findings suggest that LLM-based filtering introduces structured variability in document retrieval, even under controlled prompting and shared ranking logic. We propose using classification disagreement as an object of analysis in retrieval evaluation, particularly in subjective or thematic search tasks."

    "abstract": "The N4 interface, which connects the Session Management Function (SMF) and the User Plane Function (UPF) via the PFCP protocol in the 5G core network, is vulnerable to attacks such as unauthorized access and signaling injection. These threats can lead to session interruptions and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. Due to the stealthy nature of such anomalies, existing detection methods struggle with issues such as sample imbalance and ambiguous category boundaries. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a dual-stage anomaly detection framework based on the distribution characteristics of signaling. First, we statistically analyze the distributional differences between normal and abnormal PFCP signaling to uncover behavioral patterns and define precise categories of anomalies, each associated with a specific probabilistic model. Then, a Dual-Stage Abnormal Detection Framework (DSAF) is developed, integrating a KNN-based distance detector with a deep learning classifier to achieve hierarchical detection of abnormal signaling on the N4 interface. Experimental results on a real-world PFCP dataset demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms mainstream detection approaches in terms of accuracy, recall, and F1 score, providing solid theoretical and technical support for signaling security in 5G core networks."

    "abstract": "The paper constitutes a model of the final jump that occurs during the encounter between a negative downward stepped leader and an upward connecting leader in cloud to ground lightning. The gap is first covered by negative and positive streamers, followed by leader bridging. Voltage collapse yields substantial impulse current determined by both the gap and stepped leader characteristics. A model is formulated for the leader bridging and subsequent current impulse flow, during which the negative downward leader is simulated as a lossy transmission line. Within the range of variables investigated the following findings are reported. With neutral charge point in the cloud at a height of 4500 m, ambient ground field of 8 kV/m, a 10 m ground mast and prospective return stroke current in the range of 10-100 kA, the model resulted in final jump gaps in the range of 7-27 m. The average leader bridging speed is found to vary in the range of 5-16 m/μs. The final jump impulse current is evaluated in the 2-12 kA range corresponding to 10-20% of the subsequent prospective return stroke current. The final jump impulse current is therefore substantially larger than the preceding corona bursts. The input surge impedance of the downward leader at the instant of final jump varies in the range 1.6 kohm to 2.8 kohm. Results with a height of charge cloud point origin Hcs of 2500 m have been added and showed very significant increase in the final jump gap length and impulse current amplitude but a moderate reduction in the leader input surge impedance. The discharge phase of the final jump is therefore established as a distinct prerequisite for the formation of the return stroke. In principle the final jump impulse current can be measured on instrumented towers, discarding prior upward leader current and corona pulses from adjacent branches. It can also be estimated from remote electric field measurement, with due consideration to the specific speed of the resulting signal propagating along the stepped leader. In this paper whenever possible comparison of the model results with field measurement is made and found satisfactory."

    "abstract": "Soil moisture is vital for studying hydrological processes, vegetation growth, and climate change. Recently, Global Navigation Satellite System-Reflectometry (GNSS-R) technology has shown great potential for soil moisture monitoring. However, most existing GNSS-R algorithms rely empirically on multiple land surface parameters, which increases model complexity and the risk of overfitting. This study investigates underlying surface influencing factors for soil moisture retrieval and developes a new soil moisture retrieval with considering the factors that influence the relationship between GNSS-R measurements and surface soil moisture, using Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System (CYGNSS) data in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River (23.5°N-35°N, 110°E-123°E). Monthly CYGNSS reflectivity and SMAP soil moisture data from 2019 to 2024 are analyzed with consideration of influencing factors such as elevation, slope, biomass, land use, tree height, and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Results show the following key findings: (1) Reflectivity exhibits a significant correlation with soil moisture, with 84.05% displaying a positive correlation. (2) Over the six-year period from 2019 to 2024, the correlation between SMAP soil moisture and CYGNSS reflectivity shows clear seasonal variability, with lower correlations in spring and autumn and higher correlations in summer and winter, peaking in summer. (3) Geodetector analysis revealed that land use had the most significant effect on soil moisture in the single-factor analysis, while biomass and reflectivity had the strongest interaction in the two-factor analysis, characterized by nonlinear enhancement. (4) A retrieval scheme was designed based on the influencing factors, and its accuracy was validated using the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) machine learning algorithm. The root mean square error (RMSE) of the soil moisture retrieval using all selected features was 0.0526 cm<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup>/cm<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup>.

The ensemble integrates three models: a Supervised Contrastive Learning model, a SciBERT-based model, and a BertGCN model. Our framework distinguishes the resource types (dataset vs. software) and providers (author vs. third-party). To train and evaluate EnSU, we compiled a dataset, OADS-1K, comprising 1,129 manually annotated sentences containing URLs along with their expanded contexts. Our model outperforms all baseline classifiers, including a large language model-based approach, with the best F 1 -score of 90%.

While combining these resources is desirable, we empirically demonstrate that naively concatenating them results in a noisy label space that severely degrades model performance. To overcome this critical limitation, we introduce CyberNER, a large-scale, unified corpus created by systematically harmonizing four prominent datasets (CyNER, DNRTI, APTNER, and Attacker) onto the STIX 2.1 standard. Our principled methodology resolves semantic ambiguities and consolidates over 50 disparate source tags into 21 coherent entity types. Our experiments show that models trained on CyberNER achieve a substantial performance gain, with a relative F1-score improvement of approximately 30% over the naive concatenation baseline. By publicly releasing the CyberNER corpus, we provide a crucial, standardized benchmark that enables the creation and rigorous comparison of more robust and generalizable entity extraction models for the cybersecurity domain."

This paper undertakes a comprehensive review of studies focusing on the inspection of various transportation infrastructure types utilizing UAVs during the O&M phase. The research employs a two-pronged approach: first, conducting a bibliometric analysis to identify research hotspots and developmental trends in the field; second, adopting a content-based analysis across three key dimensions—inspection objects, inspection methodologies, and inspection planning strategies. The results underscore the critical need for the development of multimodal data fusion technologies and dynamic UAV path planning approaches. This study contributed to deepening the understanding of the current progress and obstacles in UAV-based infrastructure O&M inspection and providing valuable insights for guiding future research directions, ultimately fostering the advancement of smarter and more sustainable transportation infrastructure management."

To tackle this issue, an adaptive TVF-EMD noise reduction method is proposed. A non-uniform B-spline time-varying filter dynamically tracks signal time-varying characteristics via cutoff frequency to suppress mode mixing. The Aquila Optimizer optimizes TVF-EMD’s bandwidth threshold and B-spline order, using the correlation coefficient of kurtosis as the fitness function to enhance decomposition accuracy. The JADE algorithm eliminates noise residuals in effective components, overcoming limitations of traditional single-channel noise reduction. Simulations show a 13.09 dB signal-to-noise ratio improvement under -15 dB strong noise interference. After noise reduction, the test signal’s envelope spectral eigenfrequency discrimination is significantly improved, offering an effective reference for bearing fault diagnosis."

It is challenging, especially when the video background is noisy and non-stationary. Tensor factorization has been widely adopted in foreground detection under static backgrounds owing to its efficacy in handling complex high-dimensional data, such as color images and videos. However, conventional tensor factorization is incapable of uncertainty quantification and foreground segmentation under a non-stationary background. To address this limitation, penalized Bayesian tensor factorization (PBTF) is proposed in this work to enhance the robustness of foreground segmentation under non-stationary background by explicitly leveraging temporal characteristics of the foreground into the segmentation, and to measure the uncertainty by considering the distributions of the tensor factorization model parameters. Its superior performance over state-of-the-art methods is demonstrated through multiple real-world case studies."

    "abstract": "To improve semiconductor yield and quality, it is critical to both identify diverse defect patterns within each chip and ensure the consistency of process data for reliable defect analysis and yield prediction. Traditionally, defect map classification methods were limited to predefined defect types and specific fail grades, making it impossible to extract defect occurrence indices for newly emerging patterns in new products. Engineers had no choice but to manually review and count such defects chip by chip—a process impractical for high-volume production. Meanwhile, missing process data is often ignored or filled using simple statistics such as mean or median, reducing analysis accuracy. This paper proposes an integrated machine learning framework to automate chip defect map clustering and process data imputation. We utilize Deep Embedded Clustering (DEC) to classify multiple defect types per chip without predefined labels, learning latent representations from text-based fail grade and spatial data. Experimental results show the proposed models significantly improve classification speed, accuracy, and imputation fidelity, enabling real-time defect monitoring and process optimization even for new products and evolving chip designs."

Although several models exist for estimating the critical current of REBCO wires, a widely accepted fitting function that simultaneously accounts for magnetic field strength, field orientation, and temperature seems to be absent. In this work, we introduce an empirical fitting function based on the softplus formulation that captures all three dependencies. The proposed model is fitted to experimental data from various manufacturers and demonstrates good agreement across a wide range of temperatures and field orientations. Additionally, we discuss the quantification of uncertainties associated with both the fitted parameters and the predicted critical currents. By deriving analytical expressions for confidence intervals using a log-transformed regression framework, we provide statistical measures of reliability for each prediction. These uncertainty estimates are critical for ensuring safe and robust operation of superconducting systems, enabling probabilistic design margins and informed engineering decisions"

    "abstract": "This paper develops learning-enabled safe controllers for linear systems subject to system uncertainties and bounded disturbances. Given the disturbance zonotope, the data based closed-loop dynamics (CLDs) are first characterized using a matrix zonotope (MZ), and refined through several steps to yield a constrained matrix zonotope (CMZ). This refinement is achieved by introducing conformal equality constraints that eliminate incompatible disturbance realizations. More precisely, prior knowledge and observed data are used separately to construct CMZ representations of disturbance sequences that conform to both data and prior knowledge, and are intersected by the initial MZ of the disturbance sequence, producing a refined CMZ. This approach reduces conservatism. To further reduce the conservativeness, we unify open-loop learning with closed-loop learning by presenting a novel set-membership identification method that models open loop dynamics as a CMZ. The prior knowledge serves as an initial feasible open-loop model set (FOLMS) ofthis CMZ, which is refined into a posterior set whenever new informative online data becomes available. This posterior FOLMS then adaptively replaces the prior knowledge set employed in the disturbance elimination of the closed-loop learning process. The resulting refined parameterized set of CLD is subsequently leveraged to directly and adaptively learn a controller that robustly enforces safety. Toward this goal, we formulate a linear programming problem that guarantees λ contractiveness of a polyhedral safe set. A simulation example is provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and support the theoretical results."

    "abstract": "Amidst rapid advancements in precision and translational medicine, cross-institutional and cross-regional sharing of medical research data is increasingly critical. However, such data contains sensitive patient privacy and institutional intellectual property, subject to stringent security and ethical constraints, while cloud adoption exacerbates data leakage risks – making the balance between data utility and privacy protection a core challenge. As a key solution for medical data sharing, existing Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE) schemes suffer from limitations including unidirectional privacy protection, difficulty in tracing key leakage, and inefficient policy matching. To address these, we propose PSI-TR-ABE, a Private Set Intersection-based Traceable Policy-Hidden ABE scheme, which integrates Private Set Intersection(PSI) protocols with Paillier homomorphic encryption to achieve bidirectional policy-attribute privacy protection, employs an Linear Secret Sharing Scheme(LSSS)-based policy pre-verification mechanism to reduce futile decryption, and embeds hashed user identities into key structures for precise traceability. Theoretical proofs and comparative evaluations demonstrate enhanced efficiency without compromising security, providing a novel solution for secure and efficient medical data sharing."

    "abstract": "With the continual escalation of cyberattack tactics, zero-day exploits and advanced persistent threats (APTs) characterized by high stealth and dynamic evolution have posed significant challenges to traditional honeypot systems. Existing approaches are limited in service fidelity, interactive intelligence, and awareness of attacker intent, making it difficult to effectively lure advanced attackers or reconstruct threat chains from massive volumes of log data. To address these challenges, this paper introduces large language models (LLMs) as the core driving force to construct an architecture that integrates log-driven data governance with dynamic response generation. Leveraging the semantic understanding and generative capabilities of LLMs, the proposed method enables fine-grained identification of attacker intent, reconstruction of event sequences, and adaptive responses driven by retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), thereby realizing an intelligent closed-loop defense. This innovative integration overcomes the constraints of traditional static rules and low interaction emulation, achieving attack intent analysis and adaptive deception response, and providing an efficient pathway for proactive threat hunting. During a 25day deployment in a real production network environment, the system utilized 25 diversion nodes and 8 types of emulated services to capture over 1.39 million raw attack logs. Analysis revealed multiple attack attempts targeting 9 known Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) vulnerabilities, along with a substantial number of high-severity attacks for which specific CVE identifiers could not be determined. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly improves both the accuracy of threat awareness and the timeliness of response, providing reliable support for the evolution of intelligent defense mechanisms."

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across multiple parties while preserving data privacy. It has been widely adopted in sensitive domains such as healthcare and finance. As a result, the trained models themselves have become critical intellectual property. To prevent unauthorized use or distribution, watermarking techniques are commonly employed to verify model ownership. However, these mechanisms introduce new attack surfaces. Existing attacks typically assume the presence of watermarks and focus on their removal or forgery, overlooking a critical preliminary step: detecting whether a watermark exists. Furthermore, current approaches often rely on coarse-grained perturbation strategies that degrade model performance, limiting the practicality of such attacks. This paper proposes FedProbe, an attack framework from the perspective of an internal FL participant. FedProbe aims to detect and selectively remove embedded watermarks while minimizing the impact on model utility. It first detects the presence of a watermark by combining minimal inversion perturbation optimization with outlier detection. Then, it identifies critical pathways by analyzing neuron-level response differences under reversed triggers and performs fine-grained interventions via targeted neuron-level parameter replacement. Experimental results show that FedProbe achieves over 99% confidence in watermark detection across three mainstream datasets and various watermarking methods. Simultaneously, it reduces watermark verification success rates to 24% while keeping primary task performance degradation within 3%, demonstrating strong generalizability and robustness."

    "abstract": "Bipartite graphs are instrumental for modeling interactions between heterogeneous entities. When outsourcing (α, β)-core community search to the cloud, preserving structural and query privacy is critical. Prior solutions, while aiming to protect privacy, often incur high communication overhead, rely on strong assumptions such as dual non-colluding servers, and may remain vulnerable to leakage of fine-grained access patterns or result sizes. We propose BiCore-Index PHE, an index-driven encrypted query framework under a practical proxy-cloud architecture. Our scheme stores two compact encrypted tables with precomputed thresholds and evaluates traversal in a branch-free manner using bitwise equality (BCDA), proxy-assisted oblivious comparisons (OGTC), and a ciphertext-level MUX controlled by encrypted type bits, thereby mitigating access-pattern leakage under the bounded-leakage model defined in our leakage function. On two real-world graphs, BiCore-Index PHE consistently outperforms a re-implemented state-of-the-art baseline: query time improves by about 10× and traversal iterations drop by over 90%. Communication is reduced by more than 96%. Index encryption remains <5s and token generation <6μs on the largest subsets, exhibiting near-linear scalability. We prove simulation-based security under the semi-honest, non-colluding proxy–cloud model, showing that each party’s view can be efficiently simulated from its specified leakage function, ensuring confidentiality of the graph, query parameters, and intermediate traversal states."

Previous methods treated open-pit mines as simple land cover types for extraction, often leading to confusion with bare land due to similarities in texture and color. This paper proposes a height knowledge-embedded network for open-pit mine extraction, namely MHNet, leveraging elevation information to enhance mine detection. The framework consists of two key components: mine height simulation and height knowledge embedding. To obtain elevation information, an height simulator is introduced to model the elevation variations of mines. Through joint learning, the framework simultaneously supervises the localization of open-pit mines and the learning of elevation variations, enabling the extraction of more robust mine features. The proposed method automatically simulates pseudo-labels for elevation estimation using the mining patterns of open pit mines, making the proposed framework compatible with arbitrary semantic segmentation models and eliminating the need for additional sample collection costs. The proposed method demonstrates superior performance on a self-constructed high-resolution remote sensing open-pit mine extraction dataset."

    "abstract": "Pre-trained Transformer models have demonstrated remarkable ability in learning generalizable feature representations for encrypted traffic analysis, driving the development of effective methods in this field. Their separate hidden and output layer architecture supports efficient multi-task joint classification. However, in real-world multi-task scenarios, these models face challenges due to high computational overhead and performance degradation on individual tasks during joint training. To address these, we introduce ET-FS (Encrypted Traffic Classification via Functional Specialization), a novel three-stage framework for efficient multi-task training in encrypted traffic classification. In the first stage, ET-FS constructs a multi-task joint model based on pre-trained encrypted traffic models and task groups, followed by joint fine-tuning using single-task labeled datasets. In the second stage, we propose an innovative method to assess the nature of tasks within the model and groups, allowing identification of optimal parameters. In the third stage, we leverage the functional specialization of multi-head attention in Transformer architectures, introducing a partially frozen multi-task fine-tuning strategy. Specifically, during the final phase of training, only a selected proportion of task-related attention heads are updated, while irrelevant heads are frozen, mitigating gradient interference between tasks. Experimental results show that the ET-FS Final Model, trained with the proposed framework, is applicable across diverse scenarios. With sufficient resources, it surpasses baselines on all tasks and metrics, achieving 93% accuracy for app classification, 98% for service classification, and over 99% for other tasks. Even with limited resources and imbalanced datasets, it maintains robust performance and good generalization, highlighting its practical potential for encrypted traffic classification."

    "abstract": "Large-language models (LLMs) can produce factually false or ungrounded information. This occurs when the language model, being fundamentally a statistical model, generates inaccurate or non-existent information with high confidence in response to a given query. This phenomenon is particularly dangerous in safety-critical systems and involves risks when LLMs are used to access or control hardware such as robots, sensors, and other internet-of-things (IoT) applications. Additionally, in automation-rich industrial environments, effective human–machine cooperation depends on maintaining a shared and adaptive understanding of complex situations. Distributed Situation Awareness (DSA) provides a framework for how awareness emerges collectively across networks of operators, robots, sensors, digital interfaces, and LLM based Artificial Intelligent (AI) systems. LLMs can fuse fragmented data streams into coherent, actionable context, enabling Extended Reality (XR) technologies to strengthen DSA by embedding digital cues into physical workflows. While this process improves coordination and adaptability, it also makes reliable and verifiable model outputs essential, as hallucinations can erode operator trust and compromise distributed decision-making. Therefore, mitigation of hallucinations becomes essential for sustaining stable human–AI teaming. We present three industrial projects where LLMs are at the forefront, highlighting practical approaches for hallucination mitigation and demonstrating a transition from online to offline model."

    "abstract": "In industrial applications, obtaining sufficient fault samples is challenging due to factors like sensor installation difficulties and limited fault occurrence. Consequently, small sample size becomes an inevitable obstacle for data-driven fault diagnosis. The Inception network demonstrates strong performance in bearing fault diagnosis, particularly under small sample conditions owing to its structural advantages. However, the commonly used Inception network suffers from poor interpretability and is prone to overfitting. To address these issues, this paper proposes a physics-guided Inception network (PG-Inception), leveraging the physical characteristics of bearing vibration signals to guide the design of its parameters and structure. First, the input length and size are designed based on rules derived from the fault characteristic frequency and shaft rotation frequency. Next, by analyzing the acceleration response within a single fault period and considering possible fault types, the convolution kernel size and the number of parallel branches in PG-Inception are determined. Finally, the effectiveness of PG-Inception is validated using the Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) and the Paderborn University (PU) bearing dataset. The experimental results indicate that under small sample conditions, PG-Inception achieves significantly higher accuracy, faster convergence, and stronger stability compared to the baseline Inception, validating the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method."

In this paper, we leverage on lightweight cryptographic primitives to develop an authentication protocol that is not only efficient but also robust against typical IoMT threats. The performance evaluation carried out shows that our approach reduced the computation complexity by 58.26% while thwarting threats such as session key disclosure, privileged insider, offline guessing, replay, side-channeling and session hijacking. In addition, the formal security analysis using Burrows–Abadi–Needham (BAN) logic demonstrates the robustness of the mutual authentication procedures."

To address this limitation, we propose a lattice-based puncturable identity-based match-making encryption (PIB-ME) scheme, and design a revocable data sharing system with bilateral access control (RDSS-BAC) tailored for cloud-assisted IoV. We formalize the definition and security model of PIB-ME and prove its security under the RLWE assumption. The proposed PIB-ME enables bilateral access control between communicating vehicles, supports key puncturing for flexible revocation, and achieves post-quantum security. Security analysis demonstrates that, in addition to privacy and authenticity, the scheme resists tampering, collusion, and quantum attacks. Finally, theoretical complexity analysis and experimental evaluation confirm the efficiency and practicality of our scheme in cloud-assisted IoV scenarios."

In this paper, we propose a novel method, Flatness-Aware Attack (FAA), which explicitly models the local stability of adversarial regions to enhance transferability. FAA incorporates two regularization terms to penalize sharp loss increases and gradient amplification within the perturbation neighborhood, encouraging the adversarial example to lie in flatter regions that generalize across models. A first-order approximation strategy is adopted to efficiently optimize the regularization without introducing high computational cost. FAA is lightweight and easily compatible with existing attack frameworks and plug-and-play. Extensive experiments on ImageNet demonstrate that FAA significantly improves transferability on both standard and adversarially trained models. Furthermore, combining FAA with input transformation techniques consistently yields better performance, verifying its broad applicability."

    "abstract": "Federated Distillation (FD) offers significant advantages over conventional Federated Learning (FL) by transmitting model outputs (logits) instead of model parameters, reducing communication costs and supporting heterogeneous model architectures. However, FD systems remain vulnerable to poisoning attacks, where local logits are manipulated to corrupt the global aggregation process. The current defense mechanism, represented by SVAFD, attempts to counter malicious updates using cosine similarity. However, we find that such a method fails to detect subtle perturbations and scale variations in logits. To expose these weaknesses, we propose the Federated Distillation Similarity-Based Attack (FDSA), a three-stage attack comprising peak shuffle, mean regression, and dynamic scaling. FDSA subtly manipulates client logits to evade detection while significantly degrading the robustness of server-side aggregation. By altering class priorities, increasing logit entropy, and dynamically adjusting scaling factors, FDSA maintains high cosine similarity to mask its malicious intent. Experiments on FMNIST and SVHN show that FDSA surpasses five state-of-the-art baseline attacks in reducing model accuracy, with ablation studies confirming its robustness across diverse settings.

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across distributed data sources through local computations and aggregation of model parameters, thereby preserving data privacy. Federated split learning (FSL) extends this paradigm by partitioning deep neural networks and transmitting only intermediate feature representations instead of raw data, thus offering dual-layered privacy protection while mitigating computational bottlenecks. However, identifying optimal split points in dynamic and heterogeneous environments to balance model performance, privacy preservation, and computational efficiency remains a significant challenge. To address these limitations, this paper proposes an adaptive state augmentation method based on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Our method employs dynamic k-values and relevance scoring to retrieve key historical states from a memory repository, fuses current and historical features using an hourglass encoder and soft attention mechanisms, and generates high-fidelity augmented states via a residual-derived decision module. The resulting augmented states incorporate historical contextual insights, enhancing the agent’s environmental awareness and enabling more precise and reliable split decisions. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that, compared to conventional reinforcement learning techniques, the proposed method maintains model accuracy while reducing average training time by 25%–40% and significantly mitigating load imbalances and vulnerability to data leakage."

Several LLMs (CodeT5, CodeT5+, CodeLLaMA, and QWEN2.5-Math) are evaluated using Word Error Rate (WER), Character Error Rate (CER), BLEU, sacreBLEU, and the LaTeX-specific TeXBLEU metric. Training and testing rely on the MathBridge dataset, supplemented with a new audio subset of 1,000 samples recorded under consumer-grade conditions to simulate real-world usage.

However, providing customers with exclusive personalization and immersive experience through an e-commerce platform is a challenge. To provide a better shopping experience, luxury retailers have been developing virtual stores using the metaverse. Using real-time reconfigured product layouts, the retailer can dynamically change the display of a large number of products for customers. However, luxury retailers have difficulty changing the evaluation criteria for personalized and data-driven customer experiences because of the changing environment from two- to three-dimensional. Therefore, this study proposes a fuzzy-based metaverse retail layout optimization model to enhance dynamic product layouts in luxury retail environments by considering six real-time behavioral criteria. The results show that the proposed model can guide strategic product placement and improve the virtual shopping experience of customers. This study enhances metaverse commerce, luxury retail, and intelligent decision systems that offer a practical approach to digital transformation."

Although operational and technological drivers of agility have been extensively studied, the strategic contribution of human resource (HR) practices to SCA remains relatively unexplored. This study assesses and ranks seven key HR practices-Training & Development, Performance Management, Employee Empowerment, Talent Acquisition & Retention, Communication & Collaboration, Flexible Work Arrangements, and Strategic Workforce Planning-using the Best-Worst Method (BWM), a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) tool. Drawing on expert opinions from HR and supply chain domains, Performance Management was found to be the most impactful, followed by Training & Development and Employee Empowerment. The findings underscore the importance of performance-driven systems, continuous learning, and employee autonomy in boosting supply chain flexibility and responsiveness. This study provides a structured approach for decision-makers to align HR strategies with agility goals and enriches theory by incorporating human capital into the SCA framework. Future research can apply hybrid MCDM methods across varied industries and regions."

    "abstract": "As demands for clock accuracy and jitter tolerance increase in high-speed data communications, traditional phaselocked loops (PLLs) with fixed bandwidth have reached a bottleneck for stability and adaptivity in complex environments. In this paper, a high-stability clock recovery circuit is proposed based on an adaptive-bandwidth PLL model, improved from the classic second-order analog PLL model. It builds a hybrid control structure with loop filtering that includes both dual-path and gain scheduling mechanisms, and a digital control module based on real-time phase noise estimation techniques geared to dynamically change the bandwidth to quickly compensate for either frequency offset or jitter. At the same time, a nonlinear phase detector with a quantization error structure is designed to relate to lock robustness, even under burst data and a spread-spectrum signal. The model represents a hybrid of the high-speed response capabilities of the analog domain and adaptive capabilities of the digital domain under highly-precise recovery performance across various data patterns and SNR levels. Experimental results indicate that this proposed AB-PLL circuit improves lock-in time by 32.4% over traditional architectures."

    "abstract": "Wireless sensor networks (WSN) have become critical in monitoring and collecting data in various fields of our contemporary lives, such as healthcare, smart cities, and environmental sensing. However, these networks suffer from the limited energy resources of the sensor nodes that rely on non-rechargeable and non-replaceable batteries, which poses a significant challenge to the network's lifetime and performance. Researchers proposed the Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy (LEACH) protocol based on an energy-efficient clustering approach for wireless sensor networks. Despite its advantages in rationalizing energy consumption, it suffers from issues such as early node death and uneven load distribution due to the random selection of cluster heads. This paper presents a review of various recently proposed protocols in scientific studies based on LEACH, highlighting the improvements made to reduce energy consumption and extend network lifetime, such as cluster head selection mechanisms, hybrid clustering techniques, and multi-hop communication. The study analyzes different optimization strategies by comparing their performance based on metrics, such as energy efficiency, network lifetime, and the amount of data transmitted. Finally, this review points to the current challenges in developing more robust and adaptive clustering protocols in energy-constrained wireless sensor network environments."

    "abstract": "As networks become more complex and interconnected, they grow more vulnerable to sophisticated cyberattacks. CyberBattleSim provides a simulation platform for modeling complex attack-defense interactions. This paper presents a real-time defense framework based on deep reinforcement learning, integrating Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C). While prior research has primarily focused on improving attacker strategies such as Rapid ActorCritic (RAC) and Double Deep Q-Learning (DDQL), this work shifts attention to defender adaptability. The proposed Parallel Proximal Policy Optimization (PPPO) framework combines PPO’s policy stability with A3C’s asynchronous parallelism to enable rapid adaptation to evolving threats. Simulation results demonstrate that PPPO outperforms baseline approaches, including Deep Q-Learning and random policies in terms of cumulative rewards and network availability. Notably, PPPO maintains high availability even under multiple attacker scenarios. Real-time evaluations reveal a peak response latency of 0.005 seconds when utilizing five parallel agents. Comparative experiments further highlight the efficiency of GPU-based implementations, which achieve significantly faster training than CPU-based versions. These findings underscore the effectiveness and scalability of PPPO in enabling adaptive, autonomous defense mechanisms. This study contributes to advancing deep reinforcement learning applications in cybersecurity by providing a robust and real-time defense strategy capable of mitigating unknown and dynamic attacks in complex network environments."

The proposed approach targets coordinated manipulation scenarios where multiple robotic arms collaboratively transfer objects across work zones, requiring precise placement, handover, and reachability. To address spatial constraints and inter-robot coordination challenges, a two-stage optimization process is introduced. In the first stage, a Genetic Algorithm (GA) determines optimal robot placements within a discretized workspace, ensuring reachable zones and equidistant alignment for task sharing. In the second stage, joint-space motion planning is performed using trajectory interpolation to generate feasible, synchronized motions for each robot. The system is implemented in the Unity simulation environment using Niryo NED robotic arms, and supports dynamic task execution including pick, handover, and place operations across multiple cycles. Experimental results demonstrate successful coordination among three robots with realistic joint movements and collision-free transitions. The framework provides a scalable and intuitive method for designing collaborative robotic systems, with implications for smart manufacturing cells and autonomous manipulation workflows."

The CLD identifies twelve major feedback loops across six interrelated subsystems: Distribution & Logistics, Demand & Consumption, Cost & Investment, Regulation & Policy, Technology & Innovation, and Industry & Market Adoption. These loops reflect the reinforcing and balancing dynamics that affect supply chain performance indicators such as cost efficiency, responsiveness, scalability, and sustainability. Key findings reveal that infrastructure limitations, regulatory delays, and investment uncertainties are primary constraints to optimal distribution. Based on the CLD analysis, five policy recommendations are proposed to enhance supply chain performance: aligning infrastructure investment with regional demand, performance-based subsidy allocation, digital innovation in logistics, adoption-driven policy design, and regulatory streamlining. The results provide a structured framework for energy policymakers and stakeholders to improve the effectiveness and resilience of Indonesia’s natural gas distribution system during its clean energy transition."

The safety requirements of hot rolling production make it impossible for the optimization model to interact with the actual system in real-time. At the same time, the complex process parameters are challenging to general optimization models. To address the problem, an offline reinforcement learning model is proposed to optimize the control parameters and improve the quality of the steel strips. Based on real steel strip production data, an offline reinforcement learning dataset is constructed using keypoint truncation and graded reward design. A selective dataset-constrained offline reinforcement learning method is proposed to achieve conditional selection of the optimal action from the entire offline dataset. The Fitted Q-Evaluation method is used to evaluate model performance. The proposed optimization framework realizes the optimization and evaluation of rolling control parameters in a completely offline state. The experimental results show that the proposed model has a better optimization effect on the control parameters and provides effective support for improving the quality of steel strips."

    "abstract": "With the rapid advancement of Internet of Things (IoT) technology, the security and utilization of data outsourced to the cloud is a prerequisite for IoT application in actual production. Attribute-based keyword search (ABKS) has emerged as a powerful primitive for fine-grained search over encrypted data for IoT. While recent advanced ABKS schemes support more abundant functions and query structures, they do not consider multi-owner setting. Moreover, these schemes typically rely on a single trusted attribute authority for user certificate verification and private key distribution. This centralization creates a single point of failure and raises security concerns, such as key escrow. Furthermore, the existence of malicious entities necessitates verification mechanisms. However, most existing approaches introduce unvetted third-party validators, leading to reliability issues and privacy risks. Nevertheless, in numerous schemes, malicious entities persist in operational status, thereby compromising systemic security. To address these challenges, we propose ABKS with user-generated keys (ABKS-UGK), which decentralizes key generation to individual data users, fundamentally resolving the key escrow vulnerabilities in traditional schemes. It not only leverages blockchain’s immutability for secure result verification, but also incorporates a revocation mechanism against malicious entities. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate its efficiency and reliability, making it suitable for secure, verifiable data sharing in real world."

However, it is difficult to evaluate the performance of Li-ion battery with online approaches due to its complicated degradation mechanisms and environmental impacts. Health indicators (HIs) can commit to solve such issues, and they can provide abundant information on battery’s degradation and current performance. By conducting a literature review, this paper summarizes existing HIs of Li-ion battery. Based on their extraction methods, the HIs are classified into direct HIs and indirect HIs. After that, the methods to realize state of health (SOH) estimation and remaining useful life (RUL) prediction of Li-ion battery with HIs are summarized. It is found that direct HIs are more popularly used thanks to their simple calculation process and good accuracy of prediction; while indirect HIs are less adopted due to its complexity in the extraction and processing, and they are more suitable for complex working conditions due to its inclusion of degradation mechanisms. Finally, future directions for the development of performance evaluation of Li-ion battery are proposed."

Second, the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is employed to determine the subjective weights aggregating expert evaluations, while the Entropy Weighting Method ensures the objectivity of evaluation indicators. Combined weighting is then applied to establish comprehensive weights. Subsequently, an improved TOPSIS evaluation model is established by introducing gray correlation to enhance the single Euclidean distance metric, thereby addressing the limitations of the original criterion. Simultaneously, the assessment values obtained from the model are used to compare the quality of power supply, yielding a comprehensive and objective overall evaluation result. Finally, case studies validate that the proposed method overcomes the limitations of singleweighting approaches, minimizes information loss, and brings weighting closer to actual outcomes, demonstrating the capability to accurately and effectively achieve comprehensive power quality assessment."

    "abstract": "Reversely switched dynistor (RSD) is a two-terminal semiconductor switch with high critical switched current rising rate and peak forward current, and is triggered by the reverse pre charge current which is generated through the pre-charge capacitor and pre-charge circuit. If the trigger charge is not sufficient, the residual voltage can occur on RSD at turn-on, increasing the power loss and even leading to damage. In this study, a trigger protection circuit is proposed, to protect RSD from being damaged by high power loss caused by high residual voltages at insufficient trigger charges through connecting a trigger protection branch in parallel. In the experiments, the peak residual voltage of the RSD is reduced by up to 55.6% under insufficient trigger charges—from 1800 V to 800 V. Under this condition, the trigger protection circuit shunts the RSD current, reducing the RSD current rising rate and residual voltage. On the other hand, the trigger protection circuit also protects the RSD by preventing its turn-on during the discharge process under extremely insufficient trigger conditions. In this situation, the residual voltage of the RSD approaches the charging voltage of the main capacitor and the impedance of RSD branch is high, diverting nearly all the main current through the trigger protection branch, reducing the power loss of RSD significantly. More importantly, the shunting effect of the trigger protection branch to the main current is small at sufficient trigger charges. The trigger protection circuit provides the protection for the normal and safe operations of RSD in pulsed power applications."

Our goal was to construct a sample to revisit fundamental questions about the size, nature, and persistence of the publicly archivable web, in particular, reconsidering the question, “How long does a web page last?” Although every web collection inevitably carries some bias, our sampling aimed to reduce imbalance by accounting for temporal coverage, domain frequency, URL depth, and MIME type. The dataset originates from IA’s ZipNum index, and includes URLs for HTML pages selected based on filename extensions for human interaction. Employing IA’s CDX API, we categorized URLs by their first capture date and MIME type, focusing on 92 million entries with text/html types. To balance the archival representation over the years, we extracted top-level URLs from deep links for earlier years where archiving was sparse. We aimed for consistent yearly sampling, with a target of 1 million URLs first archived during each of the 26 years of our study. Oversampling from popular domains like Yahoo and Twitter was addressed through logarithmic-scale downsampling. Various sampling strategies were employed to ensure a balanced representation across domains and time periods. This dataset, featuring TimeMaps of 27.3 million URLs, serves as a valuable resource for web archive studies and invites further exploration of web page durability and archival practices over time. Researchers can utilize the dataset to replicate sampling strategies and conduct new inquiries into the archived web."

    "abstract": "This paper considers a multi-location multi-item spare parts inventory problem considering holding-time-dependent obsolescence costs. The enterprise regards spare parts, the holding time of which is beyond a certain period, as obsolete parts. Thus, the quantity of obsolete parts depends on the holding time in inventory and is influenced by the withdrawal rule of spare parts. This paper measures the quantity of obsolete spare parts under two different rules. It is proved that the FIFO rule results in a lower number of obsolete parts than random withdrawal rule. Based on the obsolescence costs calculated under the FIFO rule, a two- stage model for spare parts order and reactive transshipment is developed under centralized management for a manufacturer operating multiple factories. The model minimizes the total cost of transshipment, ordering, and obsolescence under maximum inventory constraint. The effectiveness of the proposed model is validated through a real-world case study, demonstrating significant cost reductions compared to the current optimized (s, S) policy. Numerical results further indicate that the advantages of the proposed model become more pronounced when emergency order costs are high."

    "abstract": "Mail has become a crucial tool in daily work and communication, making the security testing of mail protocols essential for identifying potential vulnerabilities. Fuzzing, as one of the most widely adopted vulnerability discovery techniques, has evolved into an automated and mature method extensively applied in both software and protocol testing across industry. Recently, several fuzzers targeting network protocols have been proposed; however, they suffer from notable limitations. These include insufficient or imprecise representations of protocol states, often relying on generalized state models that fail to capture the specific internal states of individual protocols.In this paper, we address these limitations by proposing SPFuzz, a state-aware fuzzing approach for mail protocols based on program states. We investigate typical implementations of mail protocol services to determine how their internal program states interact with clients. First, we model the program state using key variables; then, we perform compile-time instrumentation to track these variables and infer runtime state transitions of the mail protocol implementations. Finally, we leverage the state information to prioritize test cases that are more likely to trigger new states and apply state feedback to refine the mutation strategy of a coverage-guided fuzzer. We implemented a prototype of SPFuzz and evaluated it on multiple real-world mail protocol programs. Experimental results demonstrate that SPFuzz significantly outperforms state-of-the-art fuzzers, including AFLNET and StateAFL, in terms of both code and state coverage. Specifically, SPFuzz achieves average improvements of 148.75% in the number of discovered states, 7.09% in state space coverage, 43.98% in map density, and 11.48% in branch coverage."

    "abstract": "The arrival of 5G era brings great convenience and unprecedented opportunities to human society under the new technical features of ultra-high speed, ultra-low latency, and mega-connectivity. As the management hub and \"brain\" of the 5G network architecture, the security of the core network is paramount. However, its evolution towards cloudification has led to frequent cybersecurity incidents; an attack on the 5G core network could trigger severe consequences. To address this, this paper first systematically analyzes potential vulnerabilities and attack paths within the 5G core network from an attacker’s perspective. Subsequently, an endogenous proactive defense architecture, grounded in the principles of dynamism, heterogeneity, and redundancy, is proposed. The working mechanism of this architecture is elaborated in detail, alongside a theoretical analysis of its security properties. To validate the efficacy of the proposed architecture, defensive performance was first compared across different schemes via simulation. The results demonstrate that our architecture achieves optimal defensive performance while significantly increasing the attacker’s cost. Furthermore, the proposed architecture was implemented on the Unified Data Management (UDM) network function within the open-source free5gc platform, and its enhanced protective capability was assessed through real-world attack testing. Experimental results indicate that the architecture effectively elevates the overall security posture of the 5G core network, introducing only marginal performance overhead."

    "abstract": "The increasing deployment of complex \"black box\" AI models in anomaly-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) for future networks has opened up a trust gap that requires human-interpretable explanations in order for analysts to feel confident in acting on alerts. Current approaches to Explainable AI (XAI), such as SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) and LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations), do not properly address the challenges inherent in the problem domain. These techniques fundamentally fail from a fidelity standpoint due to their incorrect assumption of independence between features that results in untrustworthy explanations, which are fundamentally based on correlated network data. We address these shortcomings by proposing HiFi-XAI, which leverages a new, novel framework to provide faithful and semantically rich explanations. HiFi-XAI introduces a model-agnostic Conditional Value Attribution Explanation (CVAE), a method based on probabilistic Shapley values that models feature dependencies to ensure explanations are derived from plausible data distributions. These high-fidelity attributions are then translated into actionable, natural-language narratives by a fine-tuned Large Language Model (LLM). We validate our framework through allaware scenario feature ablation studies on the CICIDS2017 and CICIOT2023 datasets. This demonstrates that CVAE consistently identifies more impactful features than SHAP and LIME across five anomaly-based IDS models. Furthermore, we deploy the HiFi-XAI to prove its practical feasibility and test it on a resource-constrained Raspberry Pi 4. Our work presents a complete, end-to-end solution for building trust in AI-driven IDS."

    "abstract": "The widespread deployment of deep learning-based face recognition systems raises significant concerns regarding the security and privacy of their stored facial templates. Unlike passwords, a compromised template is irrevocable and can be inverted to reconstruct the user’s original biometric data, leading to permanent privacy loss. To address this problem, various biometric cryptosystems based on fuzzy commitment(FC) have been introduced. However, FC suffers from two critical challenges when applied to facial templates: the real-valued templates and their high intra-class variations, which typically exceed the error-correction capacity of FC. Our scheme addresses these issues by binarizing the deep features via Sliding Window Grouping MinHash, subsequently applying a Fisher score-based mask to select stable bits, ultimately minimizing intra-class dissimilarity to enable robust matching with LDPC codes. Extensive experiments were conducted on publicly available benchmark datasets, including LFW, ColorFERET, CASIA-WebFace, and FEI. The results demonstrate that our scheme achieves high authentication accuracy while also fulfilling the critical security requirements for template protection: irreversibility, revocability, and unlinkability."

    "abstract": "Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable capability in vision–language understanding but remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks that bypass safety alignment. Existing methods often rely on structured input manipulations such as cross-modal signal shifting, adversarial visual injection, or semantic rephrasing, which compromise naturalness and degrade under stronger defenses. To address this, we propose Consistent Cross-Modal Backgrounds Attack (CCB-A), a jailbreak strategy that embeds benign and semantically aligned background cues across both image and text modalities. Leveraging such consistency, CCB-A dilutes safety-sensitive signals and subtly redirects model attention away from harmful content while maintaining semantic coherence. We evaluate CCB-A on six representative MLLMs, including both commercial and open-source systems, across MM-SafetyBench and HADES. Experiments show that CCB-A consistently surpasses strong baselines in harmfulness and attack success rate. Ablation and defense analyses further reveal that cross-modal semantic consistency is the key driver of its effectiveness, while current defense mechanisms remain insufficiently robust, suggesting that exploiting consistency across modalities constitutes an effective yet previously overlooked jailbreak strategy that exposes a critical vulnerability in current alignment techniques."

While the feasibility, implementation, and impact are studied in the literature, ownership schemes of mobile units have received limited attention. This paper aims to address the ownership dilemma of mobile units by developing two mathematical models for cost-effective MIS deployment. The first model considers all mobile units owned and operated by the service provider. The second adopts a mixed strategy, allowing for the temporary sharing (leasing) units when needed to minimize the total costs while satisfying demand across multiple locations overtime. A comparative analysis based on numerical example demonstrates under which conditions each ownership scheme is most advantageous."

Ensuring the availability, reliability, and performance of rolling stock assets such as locomotives and wagons is fundamental to maintaining competitiveness in global commodity markets.

This research first analyses the current state of IoT-enabled asset management in the Australian rail sector, using a combined lens of the ISO 55000 Asset Management Standard and IoT technologies to identify strategic gaps and opportunities. The analysis reveals a critical need for a unified, standards-aligned approach that effectively integrates technological innovation with strategic asset management practices. In response, the study proposes an integrated conceptual framework to enhance strategic alignment through IoT enabled asset management.

    "abstract": "The rapid development of unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) in coastal and port security highlights the need for cutting-edge defense strategies against the highly potential attackers. Motivated by this issue, this paper presents an adaptive, state-machine-based framework for USV defenders for coastal area protection tasks. The main approach dynamically transitions between three operational states: patrol, intercept, and engage. During the interception phase, rather than going directly to the attacker's location, the proposed method calculates an adaptive blocking distance based on the real-time prediction of the attacker's trajectory and a radial approach mechanism ensures that the defender stably covers along the line between the center of the protected area and the attacker. This approach can effectively prevent the attacker from reaching the center of the protected area. Experimental results with 3D simulator (with realistic physics and water dynamic implementation) show that the proposed mechanism effectively intercepts the attacker's progress with shorter path length, competitive path smoothness performance, and shows potential for practical applications in coastal and port defense applications. This study contributes to developing intelligent control strategies for autonomous maritime defense systems."

The adoption of artificial intelligence (Al) presents considerable potential to address these challenges. However, despite this recognized potential, many manufacturing companies struggle with low adoption rates due to the absence of coherent Al strategies, limited in-house expertise, and uncertainty about how Al can specifically address operational challenges. As a result, they often fail to identify and evaluate suitable AI-based solutions for their specific needs. This study presents the results of a systematic requirements elicitation process that forms the foundation for a future methodology to support the structured identification, evaluation, and selection of AI-based solutions in manufacturing companies. The requirements were derived through a systematic literature review and subsequently validated and enriched through semi-structured expert interviews.

To address this, we propose a leader-follower federated learning framework, where the server, with limited data but strong computational capacity, leverages client data for additional training. We introduce Federated Asymmetric Distillation (FedAD) to accommodate distinct server and client objectives: the server employs a weak-to-strong distillation strategy to correct inaccuracies from client models, while clients use Not-True Distillation to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. Comparative and ablation experiments show that, after federated training, the Res110-20 model improves accuracy by 14.55%, 7.15%, and 4.80% on CIFAR100, CIFAR10, and MNIST, respectively."

To support the assessment, a novel dataset with +10k harmful and harmless conversations is produced.

    "abstract": "Anomaly detection in Industrial Control Systems (ICS) is crucial for ensuring operational safety, preventing equipment damage, and maintaining production continuity in critical infrastructure. As ICS become increasingly complex and interconnected, anomaly detection faces significant challenges in maintaining system security and operational integrity. Traditional statistics-based methods fail to capture complex, high-dimensional industrial data patterns. Existing deep learning approaches primarily focus on time-domain analysis, struggling with normal operational noise and system oscillation anomalies, causing detection errors. Additionally, these methods rely solely on data-driven correlation patterns, missing anomalies that violate physical coupling relationships between ICS components, leading to false negatives. In this paper, we propose TF-Detector, a dual-scale anomaly detection framework that decomposes ICS data into time-domain and frequency-domain representations. To capture the process interaction between sensors, TF-Detector employs process graphs enhanced with dynamic correlation patterns to model industrial relationships, and utilizes graph neural networks to extract complex features. Comprehensive evaluations conducted on two real-world ICS datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods, improving average precision by 15.61% and 2.36%, respectively."

Due to the high computational complexity of conventional channel modeling approaches and their insufficient dynamic adaptation capabilities in non-stationary channel environments, this paper proposes a Physics-Constrained Conditional Variational Autoencoder (PC-CVAE) framework that integrates electromagnetic propagation laws with generative neural networks for accurate indoor corridor MIMO channel modeling. The proposed method combines a physically accurate ray-tracing channel generator with a multi-task learning strategy to simultaneously optimize channel reconstruction and physical parameter prediction, thereby ensuring both statistical authenticity and physical consistency of the generated channel matrices. Performance evaluations are conducted through comparisons with VAE, Beta-VAE, and CVAE methods. The results demonstrate that PC-CVAE achieves lower normalized mean square error and higher channel correlation compared to the other three baseline models, validating the effectiveness of incorporating physical constraints into CVAE-based channel modeling."

    "abstract": "Aiming at the problem of insufficient fault location accuracy within the Feeder Terminal Unit (FTU)-monitored section of distribution networks, a double-ended traveling wave location method integrating modulus transformation and wavelet analysis is proposed. The proposed method first employs Clark transformation to decouple three-phase voltage and current signals to suppress inter-phase coupling. Then, an adaptive convolution algorithm based on the Mexican Hat wavelet is designed to accurately extract the traveling wave head features. Finally, the fault distance is calculated using the double-ended time difference method. Through the synergistic optimization of modulus transformation and wavelet analysis, the simultaneous improvement of traveling wave feature extraction accuracy and anti-interference capability is achieved. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method, with its progressive processing of signal decoupling, feature extraction, and distance calculation, effectively enhances the accuracy and reliability of fault location within FTU-monitored sections."

    "abstract": "Multivariate anomaly detection is essential for ensuring stability in complex systems, where existing methods often fall short in addressing time-delay causal effects—the lag between anomaly occurrence and detection that allows systems to persist in faulty states, leading to escalated failures—and microscopic anomalies, subtle low-intensity deviations that evade capture due to insufficient modeling of nonlinear temporal dependencies and spatial structures. In this work, we introduce ST-GSP, a novel spatio-temporal graph structure perception model that constructs adaptive multivariate coupling networks via heuristic strategies integrating directed similarity measures and clustering algorithms, overcoming limitations of predefined graphs. By fusing convolutional long short-term memory (Conv-LSTM) networks with multichannel graph attention encoding layers, ST-GSP extracts deep spatio-temporal features to explicitly capture lagged causal effects and spatial couplings, while incorporating complex network structural measures such as degree centrality, betweenness centrality, closeness centrality, PageRank, and eigenvector centrality to quantify subtle structural deviations for enhanced microscopic anomaly perception. Reconstruction via variational autoencoders (VAE) combined with peak-over-threshold (POT) dynamic thresholding further bolsters robustness and real-time performance in noisy environments. Extensive experiments on six real-world datasets, including SMD, SMAP, MSL, ASD, SWaT and WADI, demonstrate ST-GSP’s superiority over benchmarks like MTAD-GAT, achieving average improvements of 5.2%, 4.8%, and 4.6% in precision, recall and F1-score, respectively, gaining AUCs of 0.9989 and 0.9986 on SMD and SMAP. This framework not only breaks bottlenecks in lag modeling and anomaly sensing but also provides a more robust, interpretable paradigm for multivariate time series anomaly detection in industrial IoT applications."

Previous studies focused on feature extraction and fusion across modalities but lacked collaborative optimization of modal features across different association graphs. While prediction models address data alignment and user preference enhancement, they overlook preference consistency and varying contributions of different modalities to recommendations. In light of these issues, this paper proposes a multimodal recommendation method that combines Modality Shared Encoding with Multidimensional Loss optimization (MSE-ML). We introduce a multi-view feature joint encoding module, leveraging modality sharing mechanism to enable collaborative optimization of item embeddings across the user item graph and multiple modality-aware item association graphs. Additionally, we design a multidimensional loss optimization strategy that simultaneously promotes modality alignment, preserves preference consistency, and enhance the contribution of weak modality. Experimental results on publicly available datasets show that MSE-ML outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of recommendation quality."

When examining the respective surface impedances at varying field, it is expected that the studied films perform at substantially diverse magnitudes of flux-flow resistivity, but also in well-differentiated pinning regimes, yet the obtained surface resistances of both samples are comparable, thus demonstrating that there is room for film optimization at the expense of certain compromise between the parameters involved."

Four critical pollution factors were tested: soluble deposit density (SDD), non-soluble deposit density (NSDD), wetting rate (Wt), and non-uniform pollution distribution (Pu/Pl).Using an L18 orthogonal array, reduced the experimental workload from 108 runs to just 18, yet still gave dependable numbers. The target was the highest possible voltage, therefore the \"larger-is-better\" signal-to-noise ratio was chosen as the yardstick.After the runs an analysis of variance showed that SDD causes about 65 % of the voltage shift, Wt causes 22 % and the other two factors share the rest. A simple regression equation rebuilt the flashover voltage with an R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> of 99.35 %.The combination that produced the highest flashover voltage was - top-to-bottom pollution ratio Pu/Pl = 1/5, NSDD = 0.15 mg/cm<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>, SDD = 0.05 mg/cm<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> and wetting rate Wt = 3 l/h.

    "abstract": "With the widespread popularity of Large Language Models (LLMs), the mixture of experts (MoE) has not only emerged as a key enabler for scaling up model capacity by significantly reducing computational demands, but also for giving rise to edge-computing empowered distributed LLMs with better prices, low latency, and regional privacy. Nonetheless, besides constraints in computational capability, edge-based LLM deployments also face challenges such as unreliable environments due to the limited security of edge devices. In this paper, we propose REMIS, an inference task scheduling scheme designed to enable MoE-based LLM services under untrustworthy computation conditions. Specifically, after an LLM is properly partitioned into shards and deployed across edge devices, REMIS dynamically schedules and activates experts on devices with lower loads and higher reliability. This strategy is effectively achieved through a deep reinforcement learning procedure that optimizes both servicing latency and inference credibility. Unlike most existing MoE-based schemes with fixed Top-K routing, REMIS operates in a novel plug-in manner, intelligently selecting experts to improve task adaptability. Numerical evaluations under various untrustworthy setups validate the superiority of our proposed scheme in both servicing latency and inference credibility."

Our system mirrors critical KPIs, including throughput, PRB utilisation, SINR, and latency, into the Digital Twin, where an RL agent trained via Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) learns optimal mitigation strategies. In our prototype, the RL agent identifies and blocks malicious handover attacks within 100 ms, maintaining service continuity and outperforming a DQN-based baseline. In a second prototype deployed on a containerised OpenAirInterface (OAI) 5G Core and FlexRIC-controlled RAN testbed, our xApp swiftly mitigates an E2 subscription flooding attack in under 100 ms, reducing abnormal PRB utilisation from 95% to nominal levels. TwinGuard demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of closed-loop, AI-driven cybersecurity in O-RAN systems, offering a blueprint for future trustworthy and resilient 6G networks."

This design significantly reduces manual intervention and mitigates risks associated with physical key handling. The solution was experimentally validated on IDQ Clavis3 and Cerberis3 devices and is broadly applicable to other QKD platforms that support only USB-based key input. Integration of lattice-based algorithms such as Kyber, Dilithium, and ML-DSA enables encapsulation and authentication of quantum-safe keys. Furthermore, a layered design using VPN and SSH channels provides robust cryptographic isolation for authentication material in transit.

    "abstract": "Large-scale low-Earth-orbit (LEO) satellite systems are increasingly valued for their ability to enable rapid and wide-area data exchange, thereby facilitating the collaborative training of artificial intelligence (AI) models across geographically distributed regions. Due to privacy concerns and regulatory constraints, raw data collected at remote clients cannot be centrally aggregated, posing a major obstacle to traditional AI training methods. Federated learning offers a privacy-preserving alternative by training local models on distributed devices and exchanging only model parameters. However, the dynamic topology and limited bandwidth of satellite systems will hinder timely parameter aggregation and distribution, resulting in prolonged training times. To address this challenge, we investigate the problem of scheduling federated learning over satellite networks and identify key bottle-necks that impact the overall duration of each training round. We propose a discrete temporal graph–based on-demand scheduling framework that dynamically allocates communication resources to accelerate federated learning. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves significant performance gains over traditional statistical multiplexing-based model exchange strategies, reducing overall round times by 14.20% to 41.48%. Moreover, the acceleration effect becomes more pronounced for larger models and higher numbers of clients, highlighting the scalability of the proposed approach."

    "abstract": "Side-channel attacks (SCAs) serve as a fundamental tool for evaluating the implementation security of cryptographic devices. In real-world acquisition scenarios, however, power consumption traces are frequently degraded by device clock jitter and external noise interference, resulting in pronounced temporal misalignment and signal distortion. As a result, the efficiency and stability of attack convergence are seriously restricted. To address this, we propose a correlation power analysis (CPA) framework that integrates successive variational mode decomposition (SVMD) and peak-anchor-based alignment (PA-CPA). Firstly, the method uses SVMD to adaptively decompose and reconstruct the original power consumption traces, effectively suppressing random interference and preserving leakage-relevant features. A robust anchor point sequence is then constructed and global linear resampling and local dynamic time warping (DTW) are combined to realise the segmental fine alignment of the power consumption traces. This improves feature synchronisation and alignment accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves higher attack success rates and faster convergence."

Each agent injects random perturbation into transmitted state information only in the first step, then follows the standard protocol. This design preserves the privacy of initial states of agents while maintaining fast and accurate average consensus. Simulations confirm the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and its advantages in convergence, accuracy, and computational efficiency."

However, as not all stories naturally encompass expert-derived questions, machine-generated questions need to serve as indispensable supplements to enrich the learning experience. Unfortunately, current text generation models fail to generate high-cognitive educational questions closely related to diverse knowledge of stories. To this end, we propose a novel framework that employs automatic prompt learning and fine-tuning to enable self-questioning to organize knowledge. Initially, we design an identifier to locate sentences containing knowledge within a given text, and then train a model to generate corresponding knowledge inferences. Each inference is concatenated with the learnable parameters to construct the prompt. Equipped with these prompts, pre-trained language models can be fine-tuned to generate questions and then their answers. These question and answer pairs are distillations of the reading’s knowledge. We evaluate the generation performance of our framework on an educational question-answering benchmark known as FairytaleQA. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework outperforms baselines according to automatic and manual evaluation metrics. Notably, our approach excels at generating diverse heuristic questions. Moreover, our work holds the potential to contribute significantly to the advancement of children’s education."

In RTK systems, users can utilize the correction data provided by a reference station (RS) to offset their location errors. However, due to the limited deployment and high cost of RS, some places are not covered by physical RS (within 30 kilometers). Therefore, a virtual reference station (VRS) RTK service is provided, where a server generates VRS for users and provides seamless cloud-based network RTK corrections without the need of a real RS. Despite the benefits of VRS services, it poses a risk to user location privacy, as users need to continuously report their standalone calculated positions to the server to obtain the service. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving approach for VRS services by multicasting correction data over mobile networks, where joined users can receive valid correction data from the base station in either inactive or connected mode. Experiment results show that the network delay is less than 40ms, throughput is about 16kbps, and the RTK positioning error is 4cm. Other qualitative analyses (such as service continuity and stability) also prove the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method."

    "abstract": "Detecting malicious clients in federated learning is particularly challenging when adversaries form the majority. Existing defenses often rely on auxiliary validation data, trusted reference clients, or restrictive attacker assumptions that rarely hold in practice. We introduce Passive Accuracy-Based Client Trust (PACT), a fully passive detector that operates without any probe or validation dataset. PACT estimates client trustworthiness by measuring the class-specific accuracy degradation each client update induces in the global model and by combining the mean and standard deviation of these degradations into a single trust score. Clients whose scores fall below a data-driven threshold, determined using Youden’s J statistic, are flagged as malicious. Experiments on MNIST, Fashion-Mnist, and CIFAR-10 demonstrate that PACT surpasses state-of-the-art baselines including Multi-Krum, FoolsGold, LFighter, and FedDMC under adversary ratios up to 80% in targeted label-flipping attacks. Runtime analysis shows that PACT introduces only modest computational overhead. Overall, PACT provides a practical and robust solution for adversary detection in federated learning deployments lacking auxiliary data or trusted participants."

    "abstract": "Accurate detection of early faults in power transformers is crucial for ensuring grid reliability. However, traditional methods suffer from weak generalization, reliance on large volumes of fault samples, and imprecise modeling of the normal state. To address these issues, this paper proposes an anomaly detection algorithm named NF-MetaAD, based on Normalizing Flows and Meta-Learning. This algorithm adopts an unsupervised paradigm of “modeling with normal data only.” It accurately learns the probability distribution of Dissolved Gas Analysis (DGA) data under healthy conditions using Normalizing Flows (NF) and achieves personalized adaptation for individual equipment in few-shot scenarios via meta-learning Prototypical Network. Combined with TF-IDF feature optimization and a “Logical OR” dual-model fusion strategy, it leverages the complementary advantages of global distribution modeling and local feature matching. Experiments on a public DGA dataset show that the NF-MetaAD framework achieves a detection accuracy of 95% for early low-intensity discharge faults, outperforming baseline methods such as a single Normalizing Flow model and the traditional TF-IDF-AD across all performance metrics, effectively avoiding missed and false detections of early faults. This research breaks through the technical bottleneck of industrial equipment fault detection in few-shot scenarios, providing a high-precision, easily deployable technical solution for transformer preventive maintenance, thereby holding significant engineering application value."

    "abstract": "This work introduces an enhanced operational amplifier architecture in which four flipped voltage follower (FVF) cells act as adaptive tail current sources to improve the performance of a conventional current mirror (CM)-based design. The FVF cells dynamically boost the differential pair current beyond the nominal bias level during the slewing interval, enabling a significantly higher slew rate and reduced settling time. By employing both n-channel and p-channel input stages driving cascode loads, the proposed dual FVF-controlled tail sources improve efficiency for both small- and large-signal operations. Additionally, the use of supplementary input devices increases the overall transconductance, thereby achieving higher DC gain and extended gain–bandwidth product. The amplifier was implemented in TSMC 0.18-μm CMOS technology and validated through measurements, demonstrating a DC gain of 73.3 dB, a unity-gain bandwidth of 98.4 MHz, and a slew rate of 102.7 V/μs. The circuit operates from a 1.8-V supply, driving a 16-pF capacitive load, with a power consumption of 642 μW."

    "abstract": "This study presents a detailed performance analysis of light-emitting diode (LED)–based optical wireless communication (OWC) systems for inter-satellite communication (ISC) in CubeSat constellations. Motivated by the stringent size, mass, and power constraints of small satellites, we investigate realistic system limitations, including LED modulation bandwidth, optical beam divergence, and environmental background noise from solar, lunar, and terrestrial sources. Analytical and simulation-based bit error rate models are developed for multiple modulation schemes, namely on-off keying (OOK), M-ary pulse position modulation (M-PPM), multiband carrierless amplitude and phase (m-CAP) modulation, and direct current-biased optical orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (DCO-OFDM). The proposed models consistently embed LED bandwidth limitations, inter-symbol interference, and realistic background-induced shot noise into all four modulation formats, and are validated against independent waveform-level Monte Carlo simulations. The results identify optimal operating regimes for each scheme based on data rate and power constraints, highlighting m-CAP as a strong candidate for high-throughput links and M-PPM for ultra-low-power telemetry. In particular, we quantify non-trivial design boundaries in terms of required Eb/N0 andtransmit power versus data rate, range, and background conditions, and show that, even under an intentionally optimistic avalanche photodiode model, PIN receivers remain more power efficient for the considered CubeSat LED links. Additionally, we quantify the influence of beamwidth and receiver field-of-view on alignment sensitivity and noise resilience. Our findings demonstrate that LED-based OWC can provide scalable, energy-efficient and spectrally agile ISC links, enabling robust communication within next-generation CubeSat missions"

Practical obstacles include the need to manually implement ROS 2 I/O and node structure even with a Simulink model, the requirement in ROS 2 to handle execution timing such as event-driven and timer-driven callbacks and multi-input synchronization, and the fact that parallelization often must be repeated for each target hardware configuration. Although <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Model-based Parallelizer</i> (MBP) can generate task-parallel code from Simulink models, its support for MATLAB/Simulink Toolbox blocks (e.g., ROS Toolbox) is limited, and lacking data parallelism, speedup is hard to obtain. This paper proposes a Simulink-to-ROS 2 parallel code generation method that automatically generates parallelized ROS 2 C++ nodes from Simulink models that include Toolbox blocks, eliminating manual node I/O implementation and extra parallelization effort. The proposed method converts Toolbox-dependent portions into an MBP-applicable representation while extracting ROS 2 metadata and applying SHIM-based core allocation. It preserves Toolbox-equivalent functionality while preventing excessive block reduction from degrading parallelism, and generates ROS 2 C++ nodes that support event-driven and timer-driven execution with optional multi-topic time synchronization. Functional correctness is validated through split-merge-based verification and back-to-back tests using identical rosbag2 inputs. Beyond single-node execution time, the method measures end-to-end pipeline execution time across multiple nodes and ROS 2 latency; variability is quantified using empirical WCET (maximum over 1,000 runs), jitter, and variance. Autoware Universe-derived ROS 2 nodes are evaluated on Raspberry Pi 4 and the Kalray MPPA Coolidge 2 platform, demonstrating up to 15.92 times speedup on a 16-core Coolidge configuration. In a WSL2 planning-to-control pipeline evaluation, increasing intra-node parallelism from 1 to 8 threads reduces mean latency from 87.41 ms to 20.67 ms, while ROS 2 communication and scheduling latency remains below 1% of a 100 ms cycle. These results demonstrate practical, reproducible high-performance ROS 2 deployment on embedded platforms using Toolbox-based MBD."

    "abstract": "Maritime trajectory modeling is crucial for ensuring the safety and efficiency of maritime transportation. However, the unique challenges of the open ocean-such as the lack of a pre-determined road network and infrequent vessel interactions-render traditional land-based route prediction systems inadequate. To overcome these obstacles, we present ST-Shape, a spatio-temporal trajectory indexing method designed to swiftly retrieve pertinent historical maritime trajectories, thereby facilitating long-term trajectory prediction. ST-Shape approximates trajectories using two-dimensional polygons and constructs the index with shape indices, thus preserving the spatio-temporal properties of each trajectory. Concurrently, we introduce a straightforward yet robust model that harnesses this indexed data to predict vessel movements. To underpin our research, we have curated a comprehensive maritime trajectory dataset from the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, classified according to diverse navigational scenarios. Our endeavor serves as a foundational step towards expedited spatio-temporal trajectory retrieval for maritime trajectory prediction, marking a significant stride in enhancing maritime safety and navigational efficiency."

Generating these trees comprises a significant computational cost for AVCs due to a large number of hash function calls. Correlated GGM (cGGM) trees have been proposed to halve the number of hash calls and Batched AVCs (BAVCs) using a single GGM tree were integrated in the FAEST signature scheme, which improves efficiency and reduces the signature sizes. This paper proposes BACON, a BAVC with aborts that leverages a single cGGM tree. BACON executes multiple instances of AVC in a single batch and enables an abort mechanism to probabilistically reduce the commitment size. We prove that BACON is secure under the ideal cipher model and the random oracle model. We also discuss the possible application of the proposed BACON and show the theoretical efficiency compared to state-of-the-art."

The fixed-route vehicle charging problem (FRVCP), where the sequence of customer visits is predetermined, is a fundamental subproblem in electric vehicle routing. The objective is to compute a route that includes a charging schedule to prevent battery depletion while minimizing the total time spent on travel and charging. In this paper, we focus on a derived problem of FRVCP assuming a linear charging function. Although our FRVCP remains NP-hard, we show that when the distance function and power consumption function have the same monotonic relationship, which is satisfied in many practical cases, the FRVCP can be solved exactly by a polynomial-time algorithm based on dynamic programming. Furthermore, through numerical experiments, we confirm that our proposed algorithms can solve instances with up to 1000 nodes in less than one second."

This paper proposes a hybrid metaheuristic that integrates an elitist Genetic Algorithm (GA) with Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS) to minimize fuzzy makespan. The GA excludes crossover and employs structured mutations (flip, swap, slide) with diversity-preserving strategies, while processing times are modeled as Triangular Fuzzy Numbers (TFNs) to capture real variability. ALNS is then applied to refine the best solution using adaptive destroy-and-repair operators. The proposed GA-ALNS is tested on five benchmark instances from Lei’s dataset and compared against three GA-based baselines: standalone GA, Decomposition-Integration Genetic Algorithm (DIGA), and Co-evolutionary Genetic Algorithm (CGA). Results show that GA-ALNS consistently outperforms all baselines across all instances, demonstrating the advantage of combining global exploration with adaptive local refinement for solving fFJSP under uncertainty."

Across stable, managed systems (IIoT, energy, network gear, automotive, avionics), our executed evaluation shows 60–94% byte reduction depending on RV coverage (60/80/95%), e. g., a 40k-entry log shrinks from ~10.68 MiB (full CEL) to ~0.61 MiB at 95% coverage. Codec overhead is modest (sub-ms per 1k events on x86 64/A72; sub-second end-to-end on Cortex-M for 40k events) and leaves cryptographic checks (AK/COSE, freshness, TPM PCR re-compute) unchanged.

    "abstract": "Wheat is a staple crop in over 40 countries, with Asia accounting for more than 40% of global cultivation. Long-term mapping of wheat cover is critical for agricultural management and food security. However, existing wheat mapping products face a key limitation in spatiotemporal coverage: they either offer broad spatial coverage for a single or few years, or provide long time series that are confined to specific regions. To address this gap, we propose DeepMapping, a hybrid deep learning framework designed to generate a consistent annual fractional wheat cover product at 250 m resolution from 2001 to 2023 over Asia. Our framework integrates Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformer models to extract complementary spatial and temporal features. It processes multi-resolution data, including 250 m and 500 m MODIS reflectance, alongside GLASS Leaf Area Index and Fractional Vegetation Cover products. The model is trained with fractions derived from the 10 m resolution WorldCereal 2021 map and refined with ancillary information such as coarse-resolution crop products, land cover data, and agricultural statistics to enhance reliability. By learning the relationship between short-term, high-resolution labels and long-term, coarse-resolution MODIS observations, DeepMapping is efficiently used to generates annual wheat fractional cover product over Asia at 250 m from 2001–2023. Wheat is a staple crop in over 40 countries, with Asia contributing more than 40% of global wheat cultivation.

Along with this trend, the scale of mobile devices and data traffic in the network is increasing explosively, resulting in huge transmission pressure on the backbone network, accompanied by serious security problems. All above call for a secure and high-throughput data communication system for 6G enabled massive IoT. In this paper, an Active-Trust based security Service Orchestration (ATSO) framework is proposed. First, the active-trust evaluation mechanism is introduced at the data acquisition layer, and direct trust is combined with indirect trust to accurately evaluate the trust of data providers. Then, service orchestration mechanism is proposed, which orchestrates data into services through edge devices to implement the service-oriented architecture, and conducts progressive aggregation at routing layer to form more advanced services. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that ATSO effectively improve performance in data security, energy efficiency and delay. Finally, we discuss the potential challenges in promoting the study of ATSO."

In this work, we introduce two novel components: (1) K-Span Select, a new span-level retrieval method that condenses a document into only the most informative regions, and (2) ScholarScore, a new multidimensional judging metric that balances factual reliability with linguistic clarity. The K-Span Select first produces an evidence-focused context, preserving over $87 \\%$ of gold evidence and reducing context size by $90 \\%$, after which multiple prompting strategies generate candidate answers using LLMs. Our LLM judges then select the best answer using ScholarScore. On the QASPER dataset, ROUGE-1 improves from 0.26 to 0.30, and Span-F1 increases by 3.4 points. On QASA, ROUGE-1 rises from 0.38 to 0.40, while Span-F1 remains the same as the earlier best. The results demonstrate that K-Span Select and LLM-based judging provide an effective and reliable pipeline for long-document scholarly question answering.

    "abstract": "Technological advancements are expanding the potential of hyperspectral image (HSI) analysis for Earth observation. Extracting insights from high-dimensional images led to various supervised artificial intelligence (AI) approaches. However, the world is not labeled, and acquiring ground truth (GT) is expensive. For certain tasks, such as estimating soil parameters, only coarse-grained, field-level measurements are available. We tackle the challenge of building (un)supervised AI models from weakly-labeled sets with image-level labels. We propose a comprehensive framework for estimating soil parameters from HSIs, and a spectrally- and spatially-informed algorithm for generating pseudolabels based on the original GT. We analyze the spatial variations of spectral pixel characteristics within the parcels (images) using superpixels, which group neighboring pixels based on their spectral features—superpixels are determined using unsupervised clustering. Then, the superpixels are clustered (based on the feature vectors calculated for the superpixels). The resulting clusters are either used to estimate soil parameters for the incoming unseen samples (pixels, superpixels, or images) in a fully unsupervised fashion, or are exploited to elaborate pseudolabels (at the superpixel level) which can be used to train supervised models. The experiments not only showed that our (un)supervised methods outperform the supervised state-of-the-art models on the HYPERVIEW benchmark, collocating HSIs and in-situ measurements of soil parameters, but also indicated that pseudolabels make the modeling process much easier and generalizable, and may be considered as de-noising of the originally acquired data. We release our models and pseudolabels to ensure reproducibility of our study."

    "abstract": "Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) is a fundamental problem in the field of affective computing. Although significant progress has been made in cross-modal interaction, it remains a challenge due to the insufficient reference context in cross-modal interactions. Current cross-modal approaches primarily focus on leveraging modality-level reference context within a individual sample for cross-modal feature enhancement, neglecting the potential cross-sample relationships that can serve as sample-level reference context to enhance the cross-modal features. To address this issue, we propose a novel multimodal retrieval-augmented framework to simultaneously incorporate cross-sample modality-level reference context and cross-sample sample-level reference context to enhance the multimodal features. In particular, we first design a contrastive cross-modal retrieval module to retrieve semantic similar samples and enhance anchor modality. To endow the model to capture both cross-sample and intra-sample information, we integrate two different types of prompts, modality-level prompts and sample-level prompts, to generate modality-level and sample-level reference contexts, respectively. Finally, we design a cross-modal retrieval-augmented encoder that simultaneously leverages modality-level and sample-level reference contexts to enhance the anchor modality. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our model on two publicly available datasets."

    "abstract": "Automating defect classification in electrospun polyacrylonitrile (PAN) nanofibers is essential for improving quality control and reducing the experimental effort required for scanning electron microscopy (SEM) based inspection. This study introduces a domain specific deep learning model for the accurate classification of nanofiber defects using a uniquely curated SEM dataset labeled into slightly defective, defective, and non-defective categories. Unlike conventional binary approaches, the proposed framework incorporates an intermediate class that captures subtle morphological deviations that are important for early stage defect recognition. A custom Nanofiber Classifier is developed and enhanced with a multiscale Inception module together with hyperparameters optimised through a genetic algorithm (GA), enabling expressive and discriminative feature extraction across heterogeneous fiber geometries. Evaluation against widely used pretrained architectures such as GoogleNet and AlexNet shows that the proposed model, although developed and trained entirely from scratch, achieves exceptional classwise performance with accuracy values of 98.64% for slightly defective, 99.16% for defective, and 99.18% for non defective samples. These findings demonstrate that a purpose built multiscale architecture provides an effective, reliable, and scalable solution for SEM based nanofiber quality assessment."

Modern machine learning data methods can be applied to detect multiple faults within patterns of data from several sensors, thereby reducing the number of added sensors needed. The problem then becomes to find a cost-effective set of sensors that can detect the maximum number of faults with the minimum number of sensors. We develop here an optimization trade-off strategy to compare the fault detection capability against the number of sensors needed given alternative fault detection algorithms. For a plastic extrusion process with four faults, we find all faults can be detected with five sensors, 90% of the faults can be detected with four sensors, and one can be detected with a single sensor of (barrel temperature). The approach can be applied to decide upon the number of sensors desired for the fault coverage needed."

This study presents an enhanced forward-model retrieval method for estimating VAM velocity and retrieving these radar products. The forward estimator employs a parameterized Gamma distribution and an unknown VAM velocity to estimate the radar-observed aliased reflectivity-velocity profile. Building on previous work by the authors, this paper introduces a mathematical formulation for the aliased radar reflectivity along with first application of the method to a real measurement case from VORTEX-SE 2017 campaign."

We conceptualize the blockchain as a management layer that enables the selective revelation of non-signers within a ring of nodes by disclosing their ephemeral values. This process refines the anonymity set and allows for the recovery of hidden signatures. Furthermore, we present a performance analysis based on a proof-of-concept implementation of hierarchical signatures on the Ethereum blockchain, evaluating operational costs to demonstrate the scheme's efficiency."

    "abstract": "Random chunks generation attack is a more sophisticated form of side-channel attack, where a deduplication request containing one or more target chunks and several randomly generated non-duplicate chunks is able to be constructed. Once the number of required chunks or linear combinations in response is equal to that of the non-duplicate chunks, the existence privacy of target chunks is immediately exposed. Once such an attack is launched in a hybrid mode, which means some of the target chunks are replaced with public ones with known existence, the probability of privacy exposure further increases. In order to address these challenges, we propose a novel splicing strategy based chunk level deduplication scheme, which effectively protects the existence privacy of target chunks. Specifically, with the help of short hash functions, we introduce a secure splicing strategy for tags that divides query tags into multiple ternary tag groups in an unpredictable manner from the perspective of the attacker, which is the basis for chunk splicing. Furthermore, a response table is constructed accordingly to require uploading of the corresponding number of linear combinations based on the number of non-duplicate tag groups, which is able to introduce obfuscation in a lightweight way. Security analysis and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can effectively resist the aforementioned attacks with controllable overhead, regardless of the number of target chunks in request."

As frequently happens in stochastic regimes, we consider the problem of finding a zero of the sum of two operators, where one is either unavailable in closed form or computationally expensive to evaluate, and shall therefore be approximated using a finite number of noisy oracle samples. Under the lens of algorithmic stability, we then derive probabilistic bounds on the distance between a true zero and the FB output without making specific assumptions about the underlying data distribution. We show that under weaker conditions ensuring the convergence of FB schemes, stability bounds grow proportionally to the number of iterations. Conversely, stronger assumptions yield stability guarantees that are independent of the iteration count. We then specialize our results to a popular FB stochastic Nash equilibrium seeking algorithm and validate our theoretical bounds on a control problem for smart grids, where the energy price uncertainty is approximated by means of historical data."

To address this deficiency, this qualitative study employs abductive reasoning and a multiple-case study approach to explore how service innovation can be more effectively understood and managed. Drawing on data from six diverse testbed companies, the research identifies key components critical to service innovation and synthesizes them into a generic service innovation model (SIM). The SIM provides a structured framework for organizations to systematically plan, organize, and monitor service innovation activities.

    "abstract": "Object detectors based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been widely applied for autonomous driving and industrial defect detection. Recent studies have shown that they are vulnerable to adversarial examples. Existing attack methods rely on the output of the object detector’s detection head to generate adversarial examples, which limits their applicability. Furthermore, optimizing the loss function of the object detector to generate adversarial perturbations can cause the perturbations to overfit to the source object detector, reducing the transferability of adversarial examples. To address these issues, we propose a novel adversarial example generation framework consisting of a spatial-frequency information masking (SFIM) method and two independent attack branches. The SFIM method masks partial spatial and frequency domain information of the augmented examples to generate diverse adversarial examples. The two independent attack branches, one targeting the backbone network and the other targeting the region proposal network (RPN), are fused with the SFIM method. The two attack branches do not rely on the output of the object detector’s detection head and are applicable to different attack scenarios. Extensive experiments on the PASCAL VOC and MS COCO datasets show that the adversarial examples generated by the proposed framework are highly transferable and can effectively attack black-box detectors of different architectures."

    "abstract": "Optical fiber distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) has attracted substantial interest for enabling extensive acoustic measurements. Among the most commonly deployed DAS technologies, the phase-sensitive optical time domain reflectometer encounters a key challenge: fading noise renders DAS incapable of recovering weak acoustic signals. Compared to commonly used image denoising methods such as block-matching 3D and 2D bilateral filtering, nonlocal means filtering (NLM) has been shown to effectively remove fading noise by leveraging the correlation of phase in the space-time domain, providing superior denoising performance. However, conventional NLM can lead to excessive smoothing of phase signals due to fading noise, thereby reducing the system’s spatial resolution. This paper proposes an SVD-NLM algorithm, which requires no training and does not modify the optical system hardware. It utilizes the singular value decomposition (SVD) characteristics to separate noise from signal to optimize the selection of singular values through parallel analysis, and conducts similarity measurement on the singular value vectors, ultimately weighting the low-rank reconstructed signals based on their similarity coefficients to yield the denoised signal. Through experiments, we confirmed that the proposed SVD-NLM achieves higher performance in suppressing fading noise without sacrificing spatial resolution, while avoiding the excessive smoothing issue associated with traditional NLM, the results show a peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of 31.751 dB and a structural similarity index (SSIM) of 0.9612. Finally, by connecting the DAS device to the underground optical fiber network on campus and processing the extracted vehicle trajectory signals with SVD-NLM, we have demonstrated the practical effectiveness of the proposed algorith."

The omnidirectional antenna, consisting of 12 head-to-end connected elements, exhibits a cosecant-squared radiation pattern in the elevation direction and an omnidirectional radiation pattern in the azimuth direction. The proposed SCPAA with 17 elements arranged on a 4 m diameter circular-ring exhibits a minimum sidelobe level of -7.65 dB and good 360° scanning performance. The measured VSWRs of the omnidirectional antenna elements are less than 2.0 over the 1.02–1.10 GHz band. In the azimuth direction, the minimum gain reaches 6.29 dBi at 1.06 GHz. The measured gain ripples of No.2 and No.11 antenna elements are ±0.52 dB and ±0.15 dB, respectively. In the elevation direction, the cosecant squared beam covers an airspace of 58° with a low sidelobe level of -22.3 dB. Compared with conventional mechanically scanned secondary surveillance radar (SSR) antennas, the proposed SCPAA has lower development and maintenance costs and enables higher data rates."

Agents verify model correctness and detect attacks, while a blockchain enforces consensus. The approach comprises two core elements: a suite of local validation mechanisms that produce unique \"integrity signatures\" from trained models, and a smart contract-driven protocol for managing node participation and collective validation. We designed and assessed several validator types, including those analyzing confusion matrices, model parameters, and responses to targeted input perturbations. A prototype was implemented with TensorFlow and Ethereum to evaluate the system’s resilience. Through extensive experiments on Fashion-MNIST with MLP and CNN models under data poisoning attacks, we demonstrate the method’s efficacy. A key finding is that a validator using test set confusion matrices can reliably identify malicious nodes, achieving perfect recall and a low false positive rate against single-class poisoning attacks. Our method successfully identifies and rejects malicious contributions, ensuring the integrity of the collaborative learning process."

However, the weak signatures of incipient faults are highly susceptible to noise, which compromises the reliability of fault section location. This paper investigates the directional characteristics of zero-sequence signals, which exhibit strong robustness under varying signal strengths, and proposes two location features: the correlation between zero-sequence current and the derivative of zerosequence voltage, and the dot product of zero-sequence current and zero-sequence voltage. An improved Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) algorithm is further employed to extract accurate low-frequency harmonics, ensuring the applicability of the features under different neutral grounding modes. Theoretically, the proposed features from the fault section reach maximum and minimum values, respectively. By jointly applying these features and mapping them into fault probabilities via the Laplace distribution, the adaptability of fault location under diverse discharge patterns is significantly improved. Validation using physical experiments and actual fault recordings confirms the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed method."

    "abstract": "Driven by advances in the standardization of NIST’s Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) algorithms, research on constructing Password Authenticated Key Exchange (PAKE) protocols using Key Encapsulation Mechanisms (KEMs) has gained considerable attention. Several PAKE protocols have established precise security requirements for the underlying KEM. Arriaga et al. introduced a PAKE protocol called CHIC, which requires the KEM to achieve anonymity under plaintext-checkable attacks (ANO-1PCA). An anonymous KEM does not leak any information about which public key was used for encryption. It protects the identities and privacy of participants and is critical in preventing identity-guessing attacks, therefore, anonymity is also called key-privacy. The anonymity of NIST PQC Round-3 candidates has recently been analyzed, some of which satisfied ANO-CCA.Huguenin-Dumittan and Vaudenay proposed two efficient constructions, T<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">CH</inf> and T<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">H</inf>, to create KEM from public-key encryption (PKE) schemes. Jiang et al. introduced T<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">RH</inf> based on T<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">H</inf>. These constructions can transform any OW-CPA PKE into an IND-qCCA KEM efficiently and avoid re-encryption. However, prior to this work, no research has been conducted to determine whether these constructions preserve or lift anonymity.In this paper, we proved that for any OW-CPA, DS-IND PKE, the construction KEM<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">RH</inf> = T<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">RH</inf>[PKE,H] achieves ANO1-CCA in the quantum random oracle model (QROM). We then construct a KEM called Kyber<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">RH</inf>, and provide an algorithm for the CHIC protocol using Kyber<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">RH</inf>."

    "abstract": "Federated Learning has garnered significant attention in practical applications due to its privacy-preserving properties but faces serious threats from backdoor attacks. Current defenses primarily rely on server-side anomaly detection and robust aggregation, but lack systematic strategies for proactively erasing backdoors from the perspective of attackers. To bridge this gap, we propose an efficient and stealthy federated backdoor removal framework. Specifically, our method incorporates a two-stage training approach: reinforced negative learning and positive memory recovery. In addition, we intro-duce a hybrid regularization strategy that combines dynamic L1 regularization with Elastic Weight Consolidation, together with a synchronized differential amplification mechanism for both weights and buffers and a global norm clipping strategy. These components collectively effectively erase backdoor effects, maintain main-task accuracy, and significantly reduce detection risk on the server side. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that, compared to existing backdoor unlearning methods, our approach decreases the success rate of the backdoor attack by up to 11% without compromising the primary precision. Furthermore, our method substantially improves the stealthiness of the update, reducing the L2 norm fluctuations to less than 33% of the baseline levels."

We develop three variants of ChatNVD using GPT-4o Mini (OpenAI), LLaMA 3 (Meta), and Gemini 1.5 Pro (Google). To evaluate their performance, we design a benchmark of structured queries derived from real CVE records, covering temporal, descriptive, and metric-based attributes. Our results show that GPT-4o Mini consistently outperforms the other models, achieving over 92% exact-match accuracy with lower hallucination and error rates.

It is focused on the cases where the underlying communication graph is directed and switching, and each agent is a multi-input multi-output block-triangular system with totally unknown and inherently nonlinear dynamics. They render the existing distributed control solutions infeasible. To surmount this challenge, a novel distributed mixed control strategy, composed of a group of robust decoupling constrained controllers and a set of PI-type gain adaption-based controllers, is developed in this paper. It ensures that the outputs of each follower evolve inside the prescribed constraint bands and track the leader outputs with the tunable settling time and accuracy, despite the topology switching. Moreover, it exhibits a prominent simplicity, in spite of the severe model uncertainties, without parameter identification, function approximation, disturbance estimation, or derivative calculation or estimation. The theoretical findings are illustrated by a comparative simulation on a team of planar mobile robots."

First, based on the clustering segmentation results of a single-frame point cloud, all independent point cloud clusters are projected onto the X–Z and Y–Z planes. Then, the Alpha Shape (AS) algorithm is applied to extract the two-dimensional contours of each projected point cloud cluster, and corresponding feature vectors are constructed based on the geometric properties of these contours. Finally, by leveraging the symmetry properties of non-diffuse reflection point cloud clusters, non-diffuse reflection noise points are identified through the computation of cosine similarity (CS) between feature vectors. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method achieves a correct removal rate of 91.44% for non-diffuse noise points and a false removal rate of 5.77% for non-noise points. Compared with similar approaches, the correct detection rate of non-diffuse noise points is improved by 2.71%, while the false detection rate of non-noise points is reduced by 1.49%. Each point cloud frame is processed in 0.0741 seconds. The proposed approach effectively eliminates non-diffuse reflection noise points in point cloud data, mitigating the adverse impact of non-diffuse objects on LiDAR data quality."

To address this problem, this paper presents RESA, an efficient secure aggregation protocol based on Ring Learning with Errors (RLWE) encryption. By replacing pairwise masking with the RLWE-based encryption scheme, gradients can be efficiently encrypted and decrypted. Furthermore, by combining Paillier homomorphic encryption with the homomorphic pseudorandom generator (HPRG) to aggregate all clients’ RLWE keys, our scheme effectively protects the privacy of honest clients. Also, the proposed protocol is resilient to client dropouts due to the application of secret sharing. The experimental results show that the proposed protocol achieves 5-10× speedup in the server-side computation, compared to Bell et al. (USENIX Security’23)."

The present study investigates the factors influencing recycling behavior and analyzes behavioral interventions that promote e-waste recycling, utilizing the Comprehensive Action Determination Model (CADM), which encompasses five psychological mechanisms: ecological behavior, situational influences, habitual processes, intentional processes, and normative processes. An empirical study including 271 individuals on Java Island was conducted in August 2024. The primary findings, derived from SEM-PLS, indicate that e-waste recycling behavior is highly affected by habit and the perceived difficulty or ease of engaging in e-waste recycling activities. The absence of e-waste recycling infrastructure impedes behavior and elucidates the intention-behavior gap. The findings suggest that the behavioral intervention promoting e-waste recycling can focus on developing e-waste recycling infrastructure, ensuring easy access to this infrastructure, providing sufficient information to overcome practical challenges, and enhancing individuals' self-efficacy to translate intentions into concrete actions, together with fostering habits that sustain commitment in daily routines, and building norms."

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) is an emerging computing paradigm to collaboratively train Machine Learning (ML) models across multi-source data while preserving privacy. The major challenge of “meaningful” implementation of FL for any ML model is how to guarantee that the federated ML model can achieve comparable performance compared to the global model trained using the combined data. Moreover, there are very limited studies on FL of functional regression models that analyze functional data, a commonly encountered type of data in many fields. This study develops the first-of-its-kind federated Gradient Boosting algorithm with the Least Squares Approximation (fed-GB-LSA) for efficient, privacy-preserving federated learning of the function-on-function regression with several distinct merits: (1) The GB-based algorithm allows the sparse selection of multivariate functional and non-functional features in the function-on-function regression prediction, which is not straightforward in the functional regression; (2) The parameter estimation by the GB algorithm results in separate sub-optimization problems with explicitly analytical solutions for each of the features, providing an efficient estimation algorithm for the function-on-function regression; (3) The LSA-enabled fed-GB provides a “one-shot” approach for FL that is communicationally and statistically efficient, providing theoretical guarantees to the federated model’s performance without data sharing across local servers. The proposed fed-GB-LSA is tested in extensive simulation studies by considering real-world challenges such as device heterogeneity and applied in a real-world dataset for privacy-preserving telemonitoring of Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA)."

Simulation studies conducted under standard driving cycles, including urban, suburban, and highway scenarios, demonstrate that the proposed controller achieves superior tracking accuracy with lower energy consumption compared to a classical PID. In addition, robustness evaluations under road grade variations and rolling resistance uncertainties confirm the ability of the MFC to maintain stable and efficient performance despite significant disturbances. The results obtained highlight the effectiveness of the suggested approach as a reliable and energy-efficient solution for electric vehicle speed regulation."

To fill this gap, we propose PIRL (Privacy-Preserving Information-theoretic Robust Learning), an information-theoretic representation learning framework designed to achieve jointly provable robustness and formal differential privacy (DP) guarantees. Our core idea is to learn a stochastic representation rigorously constrained by (ϵ,δ)-differential privacy through a unified optimization objective. This representation is forced to \"forget\" private information while being guided to preserve utility information essential for downstream tasks and to resist adversarial perturbations. We theoretically derive and characterize the intrinsic trade-offs among the model’s task utility, certified robustness, and differential privacy budget (ϵ,δ). Furthermore, we design a practical end-to-end training algorithm and conduct extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets. Experimental results show that, compared to existing methods, our framework achieves a superior Pareto frontier balancing these three core metrics."

    "abstract": "A radiation-scattering-integrated metasurface antenna is proposed to simultaneously achieve ultra-wideband radar cross section reduction (RCSR) and circularly polarized radiation. The unit cell of the proposed metasurface consists of a paperclip-shaped radiator, two right-angled metallic strips, and two parasitic metallic strips. When the unit cells are arranged into a checkerboard metasurface antenna and excited by a sequentially rotated feed network, the antenna simultaneously achieves ultra-wideband circularly polarized radiation and RCSR performances. Moreover, the RCSR bandwidth fully covers the antenna's radiation bandwidth. Simulation results indicate that the antenna exhibits a –10 dB impedance bandwidth of 57.72% (6.68–12.1 GHz), a 3 dB axial ratio (AR) bandwidth of 50.82% (6.75–11.35 GHz), and a peak realized gain of 16.72 dBic. In addition, the antenna achieves a monostatic RCSR greater than 10 dB from 5.6 to 15.1 GHz under normal incidence. Experimental results validate the proposed antenna's radiation and scattering performance."

    "abstract": "With the continuous growth of renewable energy installations, large-scale integration of power electronic converters introduces low-inertia and weak-damping characteristics to the grid, challenging system stability. Therefore, compatibility and robustness tests are necessary before these devices are connected to the power system. A grid emulator can generate reference voltages corresponding to faulted or disturbed conditions through a programmable power supply or a real-time simulation system, and subsequently amplifying them into three-phase voltages via a voltage-source converter to support real power exchange with the device under test. This paper investigates several representative power stage configurations, including centralized three-phase fullbridge converters, cascaded H-bridges, and input-parallel/outputseries topologies. The analysis illustrates the advantages of modular multilevel converter in voltage resolution and waveform fidelity. At the control level, voltage hysteresis control, PI control, PR/QPR control, repetitive control, and sliding-mode control are examined with respect to dynamic tracking behavior and disturbance rejection. These results provide a technical reference for topology selection and controller optimization in PHIL-based grid emulators. Finally, the key limitations of present grid emulators are identified, together with directions for future improvement."

However, 3D trajectories often contain sensitive information, and data cloud platforms may pose privacy leakage risks during data release. To address this, this paper proposes a method of personalized privacy protection for 3D data. It evaluates the similarity between trajectory points by integrating multi-dimensional features such as longitude, latitude, altitude, and speed, dynamically classifies trajectory points in 3D space, and computes category centers. A trajectory point evaluation model incorporating spatio-temporal characteristics is constructed to calculate and output the privacy utility evaluation values of trajectory points. Additionally, a personalized protection strategy is introduced, which dynamically allocates privacy budgets based on the distance from trajectory points to 3D category centers and their privacy utility evaluation values, achieving personalized privacy protection while balancing privacy and data usability.Experiments show that the method described in this paper significantly improves trajectory usability and privacy protection performance, demonstrating a good balance between privacy protection and data utility."

    "abstract": "As a key infrastructure of the Internet, the Domain Name System (DNS) is frequently abused because of its open-ness, which makes early detection of domain abuse a critical task in cybersecurity. However, most existing methods rely on external data sources such as webpage content or long-term DNS resolution logs, which are unavailable at the registration stage, delaying detection and limiting adaptability across attack types. To overcome these limitations, we propose DeFiAD, a unified framework for early-stage domain abuse detection that relies solely on multi-source static information available at registration, enabling detection at the beginning of the domain lifecycle. We first introduce UDIRP, a unified domain information representation paradigm, which maps multi-source heterogeneous DNS native data into three subspaces for model understanding, forming a unified multi-channel representation. Building on this representation, we design DCINet, a Deep & Cross Network–based feature interaction model that effectively learns and integrates multi-source heterogeneous features, improving robustness and adaptability across diverse domain abuse types. Experiments on phishing, DGA, and mixed-abuse datasets show that DeFiAD consistently achieves the best overall performance, improving detection accuracy by 4%–10% over existing methods while maintaining high inference efficiency, highlighting its practicality for timely deployment."

We formulate this problem as an integer programming model that minimizes the number of vehicles while ensuring both overall and time-specific coverage thresholds are met. The precision required for vehicle location introduces substantial computational complexity. To address this, we develop an Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS) algorithm equipped with problem-specific operators to improve solution efficiency. Numerical experiments using Shenzhen’s historical vehicle trajectory data show that the ALNS algorithm outperforms Gurobi, achieving faster computation with minimal gaps in solution quality. Sensitivity analysis demonstrates that fleet size increases with both coverage thresholds and time window scale. This work offers actionable insights for optimizing the large-scale deployment of mobile AED systems in urban environments."

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of artificial intelligence, the multi-agent pathfinding problem (MAPF) has emerged in recent years. It is regarded as an NP-Hard problem that involves coordinating the movements of multiple agents within the same environment to perform different tasks. In recent years, MAPF has found numerous applications in automated industrial scenarios, prompting the proposal of several learning-based methods to solve MAPF challenges. In fact, in industrial application scenarios, the completion of complex tasks can be hampered by the robots' limited observational abilities to perceive their environment. Therefore, it is necessary to combine the flexibility of humans with intelligent manufacturing to achieve high levels of flexibility, efficiency, and safety through human-machine collaboration. This study proposes a model for human-machine collaboration in MAPF scenarios, based on the characteristics of human-machine interactions. The effectiveness of a multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm in addressing dynamic MAPF problems in human-machine collaboration is verified. Finally, building on the classical multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm MAA2C, the A*-MAA2C algorithm is proposed. Ablation experiments have verified its superiority over the standard MAA2C algorithm."

    "abstract": "The wireless communication network, comprising billions of cloud, edge, and end devices, enables emerging applications such as the metaverse—an immersive virtual environment where experiences and user interactions converge. However, user interactions in the metaverse generate substantial amounts of private data (e.g., identity, location), raising significant privacy concerns despite their utility in training machine learning models. Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) offers solutions to these challenges, with Federated Learning (FL) serving as a decentralized framework that enables collaborative model training without exposing local data. Nevertheless, deploying FL in large-scale environments like the metaverse increases vulnerability to malicious attacks. To address this issue, we propose a blockchain-based FL architecture that enhances trust and security. The architecture integrates a multi-task FL strategy with blockchain sharding to boost system throughput and reduce resource consumption. By partitioning the blockchain into smaller shards, we lower computational demands and enable concurrent training of multiple models, improving efficiency. We also design a shard creation algorithm based on bipartite matching and a bandwidth scheduling mechanism that prioritizes reliable devices with informative data. Experimental results show that our architecture outperforms existing baselines across multiple evaluation metrics."

The controller is designed to ensure stable operation, rapid dynamic response, and robustness against disturbances. Its design follows three main stages: the selection of the appropriate sliding surface, the establishment of the convergence conditions to ensure the system stability, and the derivation of the control law. The effectiveness of the proposed SMC strategy is evaluated through simulations under severe operating conditions, including large variations in supply voltage and load resistance.

    "abstract": "Accurate photovoltaic (PV) power prediction is essential for efficient grid management. Due to the intermittent nature of solar radiation, unreliable predictions can cause energy imbalances and grid instability. Thus, enhancing prediction accuracy is crucial to ensure the reliability and efficiency of solar energy systems. In this context, this paper presents an evaluation of the prediction accuracy of PV energy production using two machine learning models: Random Forest (RF) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. Both models were trained on real data measurement of solar irradiance (E), ambient temperature (T<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">amb</inf>), and wind speed (Ws). To better assess the factors affecting model performance, various combinations of input features were explored. In particular, the cell temperature (T<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">c</inf>) was added as an additional variable, as it directly represents the real operating conditions of PV modules. Incorporating this feature helps capture thermal losses and efficiency fluctuations caused by temperature variations, thereby improving the alignment between the predicted and true PV power outputs. The models were evaluated using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Mean Relative Error (MRE). Results indicate that incorporating the predicted PV cell temperature (T<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">c</inf>) as an additional input feature reduced the RMSE by 10.25% for the RF model (from 9.221 to 8.276) and by 3.75% for the LSTM model (from 24.332 to 23.420).

    "abstract": "Accurate rate of penetration (ROP) prediction is essential for optimizing drilling parameters, shortening drilling cycles, and reducing costs. Existing approaches typically fall into two categories: (1) All-for-One, which uses data from previously drilled wells to predict ROP in a new well. While this approach captures overall trends, it often fails to reflect well-specific characteristics; and (2) Continuous Learning, which updates predictions in real time using the new well’s own data. Although more adaptive, this method suffers from delayed responses and instability when encountering sudden formation changes. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a pre-trained + fine-tuned model framework. The method first pre-trains a BPNN on multiple wells from the same block to learn general ROP patterns. It then applies a sliding-window fine-tuning strategy on data from the new well, updating only the parameters of a secondary fine-tuning model while keeping the pre-trained model frozen. This design explicitly separates inter-well invariant knowledge from intra-well specific knowledge, maintaining both stability and adaptability. Experiments on field data from Bohai Oilfield demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms both single-scenario approaches. Compared with All-for-One and Continuous Learning, it reduces root mean squared error by 34.3% and 49.6%, respectively, lowers mean absolute error by 45.9% and 24.6%, and achieves an $\\mathbf{R}^{2}$ of 0.88. Owing to its lightweight architecture and fast fine-tuning, the model is well suited to real-time applications under limited on-site computing resources, thereby supporting intelligent drilling parameter optimization."

    "abstract": "The proliferation of affordable Android-based IoT devices has led to their widespread integration into residential environments. However, Android Debug Bridge (ADB), the official developer tool that provides root-level access, is often misconfigured on low-end Android devices, with the port left open by default. This exposure enables remote compromise and turns devices into tools for cryptomining and botnet attacks, fueling large-scale malware campaigns. Despite years of widespread exploitation, there has been no systematic and quantitative understanding of how ADB-based worms exploit, propagate, and persist at scale. We present the first comprehensive study of ADB-targeting worms, analyzing over seven years of real-world data encompassing 1.7 million infected IPs and more than 6 billion compromise attempts. Our analysis uncovers three distinct propagation phases and shows that infections are disproportionately concentrated among residential devices. Through device firmware analysis, we reveal that ADB access is factory-enabled on several market-leading low-end Android TV boxes. We further show that infection patterns are tightly coupled with human activity cycles. To further explore the infection behavior quantitatively, we introduce a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based simulation framework which is built and validated from real-world data. The model reveals how synchronized user behavior accelerates propagation and shows that timely mitigation can significantly reduce infection scale."

Accurate and reliable detection methods are crucial for mitigating environmental damage. In this article, we focus on the use of advanced convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to detect oil spills in marine imagery. Various preprocessing techniques and model architectures, including U-Net with different encoders and attention mechanisms were evaluated on a standard dataset containing drone images categorized into background, water, oil, and other classes. Additionally, our approach incorporates a novel technique for accurate detection of look-alike oil spills with Squeeze-and-Excitation blocks, demonstrating superior performance in suppressing inherent noise in drone imagery. The proposed approach effectively addresses the greater complexity and variability of drone data when compared to conventional SAR data. Among the models tested, the SE-U-Net model achieved the best class-wise performance due to its enhanced feature extraction performance and the ability to capture channel-wise interdependencies. We also analyze the strengths and limitations of each convolutional approach, to aid the development of accurate and efficient image segmentation models for environmental monitoring."

    "abstract": "Existing arbitrary-scale super-resolution (ASSR) methods suffer from quadratic computational complexity w.r.t. image scale due to the reliance on multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) to query dense spatial coordinate matrices. The inefficiency becomes particularly pronounced when extending to high-dimensional imaging modalities. To address these limitations, we propose a novel functional tensor decomposition (FTD) framework that fundamentally reconfigures the computational paradigm for ASSR. Specifically, we propose 1) a separation mechanism that employs distinct MLPs to query separable spatial coordinate vectors, substantially reducing decoder MLP invocations, and 2) functional tensor Tucker or CP decompositions for efficient factor matrix integration. The FTD framework delivers three key advantages: 1) Superior scalability to high-dimensional imaging modalities, such as hyperspectral images (HSIs), by virtue of the FTD design; 2) Significantly enhanced inference speed across scales; 3) Faster convergence towards a desired training model. Extensive experiments validate FTD's exceptional performance in HSI joint spatial-spectral ASSR, achieving up to 90.04% reduction in inference time and substantial performance improvements. For conventional image ASSR, our method improves both inference speed and convergence efficiency, achieving up to 88.82% inference time reduction and superior few-shot generalization capabilities due to faster convergence."

    "abstract": "A harbour or port represents a strategically vital geographic asset, with far-reaching implications for the economic development and social infrastructure of a city or even an entire nation. However, port congestion has become a persistent and complex issue that not only slows down daily maritime operations but also diminishes the broader strategic value of ports—particularly their role in emergency response and urban resilience. Conventional governance approaches typically rely on standardized interventions, which often fail to address the systemic and structural root causes of port congestion. Therefore, this study adopts a systems thinking approach to explore the recurring behavioral patterns that underline port congestion. By utilizing system thinking approach and the causal loop diagrams (CLD), the study analyses the feedback mechanisms and systemic archetypes contributing to port congestion. The findings suggest that many traditional countermeasures merely mitigate surface-level symptoms and, in some cases, worsen congestion in the long-run."

This study adapts device-to-device (D2D) communication to the low-altitude environment, where UAVs act as flexible communication hubs, ensuring reliable data transmission in areas where traditional infrastructure is unavailable. The resource allocation challenges for D2D communication in low-altitude disaster response scenarios are addressed, where UAVs provide critical network coverage. To tackle these dynamic challenges, this paper proposes a Q-learning-based resource allocation method that operates in such complex environments. Under identical conditions compared with optimal methods, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method improves energy and spectral efficiency, achieving approximately 11%–15% enhancement in system throughput. These results demonstrate the viability of UAVs as mobile base stations for expanding communication coverage in low-altitude economies, and they emphasize the importance of efficient resource management for D2D communication in such settings."

This study presents a novel hybrid machine learning framework that combines a Modified Stacking Ensemble (MSE) with Quality-Aware Adaptive Sampling (QA-ADASYN) to enhance predictive performance and address class imbalance. The MSE integrates diverse base learners through a dynamically weighted meta-model informed by feature importance. At the same time, QA-ADASYN generates synthetic samples near decision boundaries of underrepresented classes, such as high-grade milk. To enhance model transparency and support explainable AI, we apply SHAP (SHapley Additive Explanations) to interpret feature contributions. The SHAP analysis confirms that features like pH and temperature are dominant predictors of milk quality. Furthermore, we conduct 5-fold cross-validation, yielding an average accuracy of 99.6% ± 0.05%, confirming the model's robustness and generalizability. Our framework achieves 100% classification accuracy on the validation set and 98.9% accuracy on an external noisy dataset, demonstrating both precision and resilience. This interpretable and scalable solution sets a new benchmark for intelligent dairy quality control, with strong potential for real-time deployment and sensor integration."

Holes were made in the fabricated composites using the parameters (abrasive jet pressure, standoff distance, and nozzle diameter) to evaluate the kerf angle (Ka). In this work, 3 machine learning methods, such as decision tree, random forest, and XG Boost algorithm used for predicting the kerf angle in the machined holes. The confusion matrix analysis revealed that all three algorithms demonstrated strong predictive capabilities, with XGBoost showing the highest consistency by correctly classifying most instances across all classes. Regression analysis showed that XGBoost achieved superior performance with the lowest MAE (0.00738) and MSE (0.00057). In contrast, the Decision Tree model achieved an R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>=1 compared to XGBoost.

From a classification perspective, XGBoost and Decision Tree both achieved balanced performance with precision, recall, and F1-scores of 0.80, while Random Forest demonstrated the highest precision (1.0) and accuracy (0.90), making it effective in distinguishing between kerf angle classes. However, the strong robustness and low error values achieved by XGBoost demonstrate that it delivers the most effective balance between predictive accuracy and reliability for kerf angle estimation. This enhanced modelling capability supports Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure by enabling advanced, data-driven process optimization, while also contributing to Responsible Consumption and Production through improved efficiency and reduced waste in machining operations."

TrustSciAgent structurally organizes the entire research process into pre-research, in-research, and post-research phases, ensuring that each stage strictly adheres to these principles. This design compels the agent to generate transparent, logically sound reasoning chains and deliver auditable scientific conclusions. Comprehensive experiments across four scientific domains and three representative language models demonstrate that TrustSciAgent consistently improves both the structural completeness and the correctness of reasoning outputs, outperforming standard LLM-based agents.

The method is suited for inspection reports with irregular handwriting and noisy layouts, where conventional OCR often fails. By combining structural cues and semantic context, the approach enhances text correction accuracy.

A PZT harvester was attached to the main strut of a 3D-printed scale landing gear model and subjected to DO-160-derived vibrational data to experimentally simulate in-flight conditions. The harvester demonstrated a resonant frequency of 203 Hz, producing a maximum power of 9.5 μW at an optimal resistance of 20 kΩ. Results indicate that landing gear placement yields higher normalised power density compared with previously studied locations such as the wing root and fuselage.

    "abstract": "Multi-Channel Fusion Attacks (MCFAs) boosts the effectiveness of side-channel cryptanalysis by combining information leakages from multiple channels such as power and electromagnetic (EM) leakages. However, current MFCAs require the same number of traces across the channels, which poses a critical constraint that does not necessarily hold in practical scenarios. For instance, acquiring contactless EM traces is considerably easier than obtaining power traces. Consequently, an attacker can collect many more EM traces, but a considerable portion of them must be discarded due to this constraint. To address the constraint of requiring equal numbers of traces across channels while fully utilizing the otherwise discarded EM traces, we propose a novel multi-channel fusion framework. This framework leverages a machine learning model to synthesize the missing power traces, thereby aligning the number of traces in the power and EM channels. As a result, it maximizes the utilization efficiency of the available traces. Specifically, we introduce GTL, a hybrid generative adversarial network that integrates Transformer and LSTM architectures for effective trace synthesis. We present the first MCFAs against the postquantum cryptographic scheme CRYSTALS-Dilithium. Experimental results show that, compared with existing MCFAs, our approach reduces the required number of traces by more than 50%."

Although the Integrity Measurement Architecture (IMA) checks load-time integrity, it is prone to kernel exploits. While AMD SEV-SNP’s VM Privilege Levels (VMPLs) offer hardware-enforced intra-CVM isolation, they remain underexploited for kernel protection. This paper presents VMPL-KMI, utilizing VMPLs to enforce both load-time measurement and runtime protection of LKMs. By maintaining MList in the most privileged VMPL0 and synchronizing integrity checks with memory protection, VMPL-KMI prevents tampering and eliminates Time-Of-Check-to-Time-Of-Use (TOCTTOU) vulnerabilities. To minimize the overhead, we introduce a service protocol based on the Secure VM Service Module (SVSM) standard, reducing verification to a single interaction. Experimental results demonstrate practical efficiency: 5–10% overhead for small modules (over 20% for larger ones) during loading and less than 5% during unloading."

    "abstract": "In recent years, high-frequency wireless power transfer (WPT), such as operating at 6.78 MHz (MHz), has attracted increasing attention due to its improved spatial freedom. In applications such as pipeline inspection robots and medical implants, the transmitting (Tx) coils are usually attached to curved surfaces, and the receiving device often undergoes multi-degree-of-freedom rotations during movement (i.e., positional and angular misalignment). Therefore, this article develops a staggered and overlapping curved Tx-coil array design to achieve a uniform magnetic field distribution in three-dimensional (3D) directions in cylindrical space. The staggered layout is periodic and spatially scalable, overcoming the spatial limitations of traditional designs; the overlapping of each individual curved Tx coil also suppresses the cross-coupling inside the coil array in the 3D direction. In addition, Tx input current phase modulation is applied to shape the magnetic field in the cylindrical space. Finally, the concept of the staggered curved coil array is implemented and verified in a 6.78 MHz WPT experimental system. The results show that the design greatly improves the spatial freedom of power transfer in 3D cylindrical space with a static and pre-optimized manner (i.e., no adaptation), especially showing high tolerance to rotations with position and angle misalignment. For instance, when charging a planar receiver with misaligned position and 20<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$^{\\circ }$</tex-math></inline-formula> titled angle, the coefficient of variation of the received output voltage is reduced to 6.5% over a 360<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$^{\\circ }$</tex-math></inline-formula> rotation."

Through simulations, we demonstrate that this method achieves superior energyâ“latency performance compared to traditional baselines, positioning it as a strong candidate for 6G networks."

    "abstract": "Protecting hardware devices from counterfeiting and attacks has led to the wide adoption of Physical Unclonable Function (PUF) as a hardware security primitive, which is used to generate unique circuit signatures. In this work, we proposed a Reversible-Logic (RL) system featuring a Ring Oscillator (RO) based PUF that enhances randomness, reliability, non-linearity, and resistance to machine-learning (ML), deep-learning (DL), and side channel attacks (SCA). The proposed design is implemented on an FPGA board and evaluated across different temperatures. Experimental results show that the proposed design achieves 49.70% uniformity, 49.99% uniqueness, and 50.90% bit aliasing at the room temperature. Also, Bit Error Rate (BER), Reliability, and Key error rate (KER) are calculated at various temperatures, and the significant results obtained are 0.002, 99.85%, and 0.046 at 40°C, respectively. In addition, the proposed RO-PUF successfully passes all 15 NIST randomness tests. Further ML and DL models were used to evaluate the modeling resistance, and the proposed design shows the best accuracy of 49.85%, which is close to a random guess, confirming the modeling resilience of our design. The proposed design was further evaluated under EM side channel analysis, demonstrating that it successfully conceals 96.85% information."

    "abstract": "This paper investigates speed control of an electric vehicle driven by a permanent magnet synchronous motor. Three widely used control strategies are examined and compared: a conventional proportional integral controller, a robust sliding mode controller and model predictive control. Simulation results indicate that SMC provides accurate tracking but generates noticeable high-frequency oscillations in the control signals. In contrast, MPC significantly reduces these oscillations thanks to its predictive action and explicit consideration of system constraints. The proposed MPC strategy is evaluated under several representative driving conditions, including vehicle start-up, constant-speed cruising, hill climbing, gradual braking, stop-and-go traffic, and rapid acceleration for overtaking. All scenarios are implemented in the MATLAB/Simulink environment using a detailed EV and PMSM model. The results demonstrate that MPC offers improved speed tracking, smoother torque and current responses, and better overall driving comfort compared with the PI and SMC approaches."

    "abstract": "Inter-FPGA communication bandwidth has become a limiting factor in scaling memory-intensive workloads on FPGA-based systems. While modern FPGAs integrate high- bandwidth memory (HBM) to increase local memory throughput, network interfaces often lag behind, creating an imbalance between computation and communication resources. Data compression is a technique to increase effective communication bandwidth by reducing the amount of data transferred, but existing solutions struggle to meet the performance and operation latency requirements of FPGA-based platforms. This paper presents a high- throughput lossy compression framework that enables sub-microsecond latency communication in FPGA clusters. The proposed design addresses the challenge of aligning variable-length compressed data with fixed-width network channels by using transpose circuits, memory-bank reordering, and word- wise operations. A run-length encoding scheme with bounded error is employed to compress floating-point and fixed-point data without relying on complex fine-grained bit-level manipulations, enabling low-latency and scalable implementation. The proposed architecture is implemented on a custom Stratix 10 MX2100 FPGA card equipped with eight 50 Gbps network ports and silicon photonics transceivers. The system achieves up to 757 Gbps of aggregate bandwidth per FPGA in collective communication operations. Compression and decompression are performed within 590 ns total latency, while maintaining the quality of results in a GradAllReduce workload for deep learning."

While the conventional T-method is effective for linear data analysis, it encounters challenges with angular data due to its inherent circularity, which can distort predictions when angles are treated as scalar values. To address this limitation, we propose a modified T-method that incorporates vector-based weighting and circular normalization, thereby preserving angular relationships more accurately. Simulation experiments were conducted to compare the original and improved methods, revealing significant improvements in estimation accuracy, particularly for the Tb-method variant. Additionally, the proposed method was applied to real-world wind direction data, successfully predicting wind directions using data from nearby observation points. In this practical application, the modified T-method outperformed not only the original versions but also circular multiple regression. These results suggest that the improved T-method offers a robust and accurate alternative for analyzing and predicting circular data, with practical implications for fields such as meteorology, oceanography, and other domains where directional data is prevalent."

    "abstract": "With the comprehensive transition of China’s energy policy from dual control on energy consumption to dual control on carbon emission, the establishment of a robust carbon emission statistical and accounting system has become an urgent priority. However, the current static method for calculating electric carbon factor, which is annual, homogenized, and outdated, fails to reflect the temporal variability and spatial disparities of carbon emissions. Furthermore, it does not account for the impacts of green electricity and green certificate transactions. To address these issues, this paper proposes a revised dynamic electric carbon factor calculation method that incorporates the effects of green electricity and green certificate transactions. First, the relationships between green certificates, green electricity, and carbon emission offsets are analyzed in detail. A more precise green certificate carbon emission offset model is developed based on the marginal carbon emission factor. Subsequently, a revised dynamic electric carbon factor calculation method is proposed, which accounts for the influence of trading behaviors, based on the principles of carbon responsibility allocation for transaction and non-transaction flows. Finally, a case study is conducted using the PJM-5 bus system to validate the rationality and effectiveness of the proposed method."

Existing fusion techniques based on Transformer often suffer from reduced accuracy and efficiency due to local perceptual limitations and cross-modal computational complexity. Recently, Mamba has proven effective in various uni-modal tasks due to its exceptional ability to model long-range dependency. However, the straightforward and effective cross-modal information flow and interaction based on Mamba remains underdeveloped in multi-modal fusion. In this paper, we propose a novel Holistic Cross-modal Fusion Mamba Network for multi-modal medical image fusion, namely <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">HCFMaNet</i>. HCFMaNet introduces a new local-aware Mamba which perceives local positional relationships while modeling long-range dependency, thereby capturing richer inter-modal local-global feature representations. Additionally, a novel holistic cross-modal fusion Mamba is designed for explicit cross-modal perception and interaction both in spatial and channel dimensions by cross-spatial interaction and the proposed channel exchange embedding mechanism. Extensive experiments across various medical fusion sub-tasks demonstrate the high accuracy (avg.+22.4%) and effectiveness (avg.+92.7%) of our proposed method. Furthermore, HCFMaNet can be applied to other image fusion tasks, such as multi-exposure and visual-infrared fusion, yielding precise fusion outcomes."

An HV transformer from an actual engineering project is selected as the study object, and a refined three-dimensional transformer-bushing finite element model, including the tank, bushings, and accessories, is established. Using ABAQUS, modal analysis and multi-groundmotion time-history analyses are carried out. The results show that the first five natural frequencies of the system fall within $5.32-10.06 \\mathrm{~Hz}$, which lies in the predominant frequency range of typical earthquake excitations, indicating a pronounced risk of dynamic amplification. Under the input of two recorded and two artificial ground motions ($\\mathrm{PGA}=0.2 \\mathrm{~g}$, with triaxial components in the ratio 1:0.85:0.65), the study focuses on the displacement and acceleration responses at the tops of the 220 kV and 110 kV bushings, as well as the stress response at the bushing bases. The maximum displacement and acceleration of the 220 kV bushing reach 21.97 mm and $8.82 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}$, respectively, and the maximum stress at its base is 6.27 MPa. Compared with the porcelain bushing’s flexural strength of 40 MPa, this corresponds to a safety factor of 6.38, which is significantly higher than the value of 2.0 recommended by the Chinese code GB 50260-2013, indicating that brittle failure of the bushing is not the controlling condition under design-level earthquakes. The findings provide useful reference for seismic design, vulnerability assessment, and retrofit optimization of high-voltage transformers."

Also, a high-order parameterized control barrier function is introduced, which can accommodate nonlinearly parameterized systems of arbitrary relative degrees. The proposed strategy permits removal of two common restrictions in traditional adaptive safety control, in which a priori bound of unknown parameters is usually required to be known, or initial parameter estimation error must be within a known compact set, and the parameterization is restricted to a linear parameterization. Moreover, the proposed strategy is extended to high relative degree multiple safety constraints. Finally, two examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design strategy."

To address this concern, this study presents a new method for controlling the inverter by developing a predictive disturbance suppression module and an adaptive stability margin regulator based on the traditional voltage-current dual-loop synchronous rotating frame (SRF) control algorithm. The new hybrid control core integrates model predictive control (MPC) with Lyapunov dynamic margin assessment and employs a multirate scheduling mechanism and a computational time for real-time control laws of less than ten microseconds implemented in VHDL to allow for the quick reconfiguration of poles and zeros in the time domain and the online re-identification of parameters. A novel event-triggered adaptive damping injection mechanism was also developed to reduce oscillations in weak grids and islanding events. Laboratory tests were performed using a 3 kW photovoltaic inverter system, and performance results indicated a reduction of 42.3% in overshoot compared to traditional Proportional Integral (PI) controllers following IEC 62116 test standards."

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training while preserving data privacy, but it is vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where malicious clients inject hidden triggers to manipulate model behavior. Existing defenses often rely on parameter inspection, which risks privacy leakage and may fail to detect stealthy attacks. In this work, we propose a novel defense method by inspecting sparsity-guided out-of-distribution model behavior, dubbed as ISGOOD, which is well-grounded in the principle \"You are what you do,\" focusing on model behavior rather than raw parameters to identify malicious clientsSpecifically, ISGOOD constructs adversarial out-of-distribution (OOD) test samples by perturbing K OOD data samples to target K classes via the aggregated model. It then applies N sparsity masks to each client model, capturing K×K×N-dimensional soft-max output features on the OOD samples. Next, an anomaly detection algorithm can identify clients with deviant behavioral patterns, which are excluded from aggregation. This approach avoids direct parameter inspection, preserving privacy while exposing inconsistent behavior of back-doored modelsExtensive experiments on four benchmark datasets MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and Tiny-Imagenet validate that ISGOOD can effectively defend against backdoor attacks by distinguishing malicious clients through their OOD behavior. It maintains high accuracy on legitimate tasks while robustly mitigating attacks, demonstrating superior privacy-preserving capabilities and generalizability across datasets. This work provides a new perspective for securing FL systems by leveraging behavioral signatures."

Traditional TLS traffic classification methods often suffer from performance degradation in complex and dynamic network environments due to their dependence on specific network conditions, limited exploitation of TCP protocol semantics, and insufficient robustness validation. To address these issues, we propose a TCP-awareness augmented TLS traffic classification approach based on hybrid deep learning. The method introduces three traffic augmentation algorithms—subsequence duplication, subsequence shifting, and packet size variation—that model realistic traffic variations induced by TCP mechanisms. A Traffic Invariant Extractor, built on BYOL self-supervised learning, is employed to capture stable representations from augmented variants and improve feature generalization across environments. Experimental results demonstrate consistent improvements: average accuracy gains of 5.51%–10.22% across different environments, with reductions in performance variance up to 79.2%. These findings highlight the importance of incorporating TCP semantics into encrypted traffic analysis and provide a practical direction for enhancing the robustness of TLS traffic classification in diverse deployment scenarios."

    "abstract": "Dynamic trust evaluation in online social networks is of great significance for applications such as recommendation systems, financial risk control, and e-commerce, but it remains a challenging research problem. Most existing methods are based on static network topologies or simple temporal modeling, making it difficult to effectively capture the dynamic evolution laws of trust relationships. To address this issue, this paper proposes a dynamic graph neural network-based trust evaluation model, TeGCN, for predicting dynamic trust relationships in social networks. TeGCN consists of a spatial aggregation unit, a gated temporal evolution unit, and a joint prediction unit. In the spatial aggregation unit, node spatial feature representations are generated through linear transformation after concatenating features of neighbor nodes and forward/backward edge attribute information via average aggregation. The gated temporal evolution unit employs a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to model the temporal evolution of trust relationships and introduces a dynamic weight adjustment mechanism to enhance feature extraction at key time steps. Finally, the joint prediction unit integrates spatio-temporal features, performs nonlinear mapping through a multi-layer perceptron (MLP), and outputs the probability distribution of node trust levels to achieve end-to-end dynamic trust prediction. Experiments based on two real dynamic trust network datasets, Bitcoin-Alpha and Bitcoin-OTC, verify the effectiveness of TeGCN. The results show that TeGCN significantly outperforms existing baseline models in key metrics such as F1-score, AUC, and ACC, especially in highly dynamic scenarios."

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) is designed as a decentralized, privacy-preserving machine learning paradigm that enables multiple clients to collaboratively train a model without sharing their data. In real-world scenarios, however, clients often have heterogeneous computational resources and hold non-independent and identically distributed data (non-IID), which poses significant challenges during training. Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) has emerged to address these issues by customizing models for each client based on their unique data distribution. Despite its potential, existing PFL approaches typically overlook the coexistence of model and data heterogeneity arising from clients with diverse computational capabilities. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel method, called Progressive Parameter Alignment (FedPPA), which progressively aligns the weights of common layers across clients with the global model’s weights. Our approach not only mitigates inconsistencies between global and local models during client updates, but also preserves client’s local knowledge, thereby enhancing personalization robustness in non-IID settings. To further enhance the global model performance while retaining strong personalization, we also integrate entropy-based weighted averaging into the FedPPA framework. Experiments on three image classification datasets, including MNIST, FMNIST, and CIFAR-10, demonstrate that FedPPA consistently outperforms existing FL algorithms, achieving superior performance in personalized adaptation."

Traditional monitoring methods, which rely on manual inspection and single-point sensors, suffer from response lag, insufficient coverage, and fragmented information. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an intelligent recognition method and system for power grid floods based on ground monitoring video. The system integrates computer vision, multi-source data fusion, and Geographic Information System (GIS) technologies. It utilizes a customized YOLO-based deep learning model to perform real-time identification of flood features such as accumulated water, submerged areas, and transmission tower bases from ground monitoring videos. Furthermore, the system fuses video data with meteorological rainfall data and GIS layers to construct a dynamic, unified spatio-temporal situational map. Experimental results and system deployment demonstrate that the proposed solution achieves high-precision flood recognition, supports historical backtracking, and automatically generates vectorized early warning information, thereby shifting power grid disaster prevention from passive response to active defense."

Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE), especially LWE-based schemes, enables such processing while preserving confidentiality. Decentralized computing offers scalable resources without requiring in-house servers, but it relies heavily on the confidentiality guarantees of underlying schemes. While many existing protocols successfully protect input privacy, function confidentiality remains a largely overlooked but crucial aspect of secure delegated computation.In this work, we present a novel Oblivious Universal Function (OUF) scheme that enables a client to outsource computation of an arbitrary function to an untrusted server while hiding both the input data and the function being applied. Our construction leverages LWE-based FHE and a virtual-tape evaluation model to support composable, non-interactive, and reusable function execution. Crucially, the server remains oblivious not only to the encrypted inputs but also to the structure, type, and identity of the function it is executing. OUF thus bridges the gap between theoretical privacy guarantees and practical secure computation in decentralized environments."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel approach for detecting the charged state of cables based on magnetic field measurements using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The core idea is to capture the magnetic field strength around cables, which exhibits distinct patterns when the cable is charged due to alternating current inducing a stable varying magnetic field, versus uncharged states where only ambient environmental fields are present. We collect real-world data using Hall-effect sensors positioned around power cables in a controlled laboratory environment to create timeseries magnetic field readings from multiple channels. Feature engineering extracts amplitude, frequency spectra, and statistical moments, fed into an LSTM model for binary classification. The model is trained with dropout for robustness and evaluated under varying environmental conditions. Experimental results show high accuracy of $95.5 \\%$ for LSTM, outperforming baselines like Random Forest $(92.5 \\%)$ and SVM $(91.0 \\%)$. ROC curves indicate an AUC of $\\mathbf{0. 9 8}$ for LSTM. Environmental interference analysis demonstrates resilience up to moderate levels of external magnetic disturbances. Ablation studies confirm the importance of full features and dropout. This method, inspired by recent advancements in electromagnetic sensing, offers a non-intrusive, real-time solution for cable state monitoring in power systems, enhancing safety and reliability. Future work could integrate additional sensor modalities for field deployment."

Therefore, the hardware development domain is adopting agile methodologies from software development, where they have proven beneficial. In this study, we examine the constraints on this adoption in the hardware domain, providing a basis for future support measures. We propose and discuss five constraints stemming directly from the physicality of products. These constraints are developed through the analysis of a generic development task to ensure objectivity, a quality that has been lacking in the fragmented research landscape until now. We argue that these immutable constraints must be orchestrated rather than overcome through naive methodology transfer, requiring organizations to adopt constraint-aware approaches that selectively adapt agile practices based on compatibility with physical realities."

However, the role of AI agents in managing hierarchical product structures and lifecycle transitions remains fragmented and underdeveloped. This scoping review examines how AI agents—from rule-based systems to semantic intelligence—support product structuring, configuration, and lifecycle decision-making. Using the PRISMA-ScR methodology, the study identifies thematic clusters in modular configuration, lifecycle-aware structuring, and commercial–technical alignment. While early-stage design shows progress, AI applications in maintenance, end-of-life, and adaptive reuse remain limited. AI architectures are often siloed, lacking integration across structural levels and real-time data. Explainability and governance are also insufficiently addressed. To bridge these gaps, the study proposes a conceptual framework for lifecycle-responsive, cross-level AI agents—laying a foundation for future work in circular strategies, adaptive reuse, and intelligent product portfolio management."

The tampered SIG fields cause frame discard or decoding errors, and disrupt channel access of neighboring devices. We also develop strategies that make SIGTAM robust to channel impairments and synchronization errors. SIGTAM operates stealthily, affecting <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\lt 20\\%$</tex-math></inline-formula> of the subcarriers for only 4 <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\mu$</tex-math></inline-formula>s.

    "abstract": "The Circular Electron Positron Collider (CEPC) represents a major international scientific project, with its detector magnet proposing the use of the Aluminum-stabilized Stacked REBCO Tapes Cable (ASTC) in its High-Temperature Superconducting (HTS) design. To ensure the long-term stable and safe operation of this magnet, a thorough investigation on the quench behavior of the ASTC is imperative. This paper presents a comprehensive three-dimensional quench simulation model for the ASTC, incorporating coupled electromagnetic-thermal analysis. The model is employed to simulate the global quench characteristics of the cable under liquid nitrogen immersion cooling, explicitly accounting for internal electrical contact resistance and thermal contact resistance. Key quench parameters, namely the Minimum Quench Energy (MQE) and Quench Propagation Velocity (QPV), are investigated under varying operational currents, with particular emphasis on performance under adiabatic conditions representing the worst-case scenario. Simulation results demonstrate the significant role of the aluminum stabilizer in current sharing and heat conduction, contributing to the cable's stability and recoverability. The study confirms that the ASTC exhibits robust operational stability, where local quenches are unlikely to propagate into global quench events under effective cooling, thereby validating its suitability for the CEPC detector magnet application. The developed multi physics model and simulation methodology provide a valuable framework for subsequent quench analysis of superconducting magnets."

    "abstract": "Multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA) aims to accurately predict the user's emotional tendency by integrating multimodal data such as text, audio and visual information posted by users. However, in most prior studies, the information differences between modalities are not fully considered as these modalities are treated equally. In fact, text modality usually contains more richer semantics to exhibit emotion, while audio and visual ones cover more redundant and even noisy information. Though some works have highlighted the key role of text modality, they still fail to fully utilize the non-text modalities, leading to sub-optimal performance for MSA. To this end, we propose a novel Text-centric Bidirectional Modality Enhancement Network (TB-MEN) in this paper, which recognizes the core role of text and fully exploits the audio and visual modalities at the same time. First, in light of the text features extracted by BERT and non-text features extracted by LSTM respectively, we develop a trimodal multi-scale bottleneck fusion (TMBF) module to capture semantically enhanced text features. Specifically, this is achieved by bottleneck fusion mechanism and transferring the audio and visual modalities to text one. Furthermore, for non-text modalities enhancement, a sparse subspace alignment strategy is employed in text-dominant subspace alignment (TDSA) module, which sparsely maps non-text features into the text subspace to aggregate semantic information. Experimental results show that on several public datasets, including CMU-MOSI, CMU-MOSEI and CH-SIMS, our model has achieved significant gains over the state-of-the-arts. For example, on the CMU-MOSI dataset, TB-MEN improves Acc-2, Acc-5, Acc-7, and F1 by 0.45<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\%$</tex-math></inline-formula>, 2.04<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\%$</tex-math></inline-formula>, 2.62<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\%$</tex-math></inline-formula>, and 0.4<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\%$</tex-math></inline-formula>, respectively, compared to the second-best one."

In order to break through the dual limitations of the lack of real-time performance of traditional physical models and the lack of interpretability of data-driven methods, this study proposes ' CogFiltrate ' -a dynamic decision-making framework based on human-machine collaborative cognition. The framework pioneered the intelligent operation and maintenance paradigm of deep integration of fuzzy reasoning and uncertainty analysis : by constructing a fuzzy evidence network to uniformly quantify the randomness and cognitive uncertainty factors; on this basis, a two-way confidence negotiation mechanism is developed to achieve collaborative optimization of artificial intelligence recommendations and artificial experience in dynamic risk scenarios. After the system is deployed on the full-scale filtering platform of the nuclear power plant, the emergency response efficiency is significantly improved, and the reliability of the framework is successfully verified under extreme disaster conditions. This study provides an example of combining theoretical innovation with engineering practice for the intelligent operation and maintenance of critical infrastructure, and opens up a new path for cognitive intelligence to drive industrial safety."

    "abstract": "Acoustic Holography is an emerging field where mid-air ultrasound is controlled and manipulated for novel and exciting applications. These range from mid-air haptics, volumetric displays, contactless fabrication, and even chemical and biomedical applications such as drug delivery. To develop these applications, a software framework to predict acoustic behaviour and simulating resulting effects, such as applied forces or scattering patterns is desirable. There have been various software libraries and platforms that attempt to fill this role, but there is yet to be a single piece of software that acts as a ‘full-stack’ solution. We define this full-stack as the process from abstraction to physicalisation starting with setup, modelling acoustic propagation, transducer phase retrieval, sound field analysis, and control of the acoustic holographic hardware itself. Existing methods fail to fulfil one or more of these categories. To address this, we present AcousTools, a Python-based acoustic holography library, designed to support the full suite of acoustic holographic applications and we show AcousTools’s ability to meet each step of the full-stack’s requirements. AcousTools has the potential to become the standard code library for acoustic holography, with the uniquely complete suite of features wrapped in a language that is known to be easy to use, AcousTools will increase the ability for researchers to develop novel applications as well as accurately review other’s work. The full-stack, aside from software, will also be useful for researchers – providing a way to view and compare methodologies by understanding where they fit into the stack."

To address this issue, this paper proposes a cross-layer attribution method. Specifically, at the physical layer, a comprehensive evaluation metric is proposed to accurately locate high-risk branches. At the cyber layer, a labeled subgraph isomorphism matching algorithm based on a traceability graph is developed to reconstruct attack paths from log data. To enable cross-layer attribution, a time-topology coupling mechanism is introduced, which can significantly enhance cyber-physical correlation and attribution efficiency. Simulations using a publicly available real-world dataset on the IEEE 39-bus system verify the effectiveness of the proposed method in cross-layer attack attribution."

Current diagnostic practices, which rely heavily on subjective assessments and patient self-reports, are often hindered by challenges such as under-reporting and the failure to detect early, subtle symptoms. Early detection of MDD is crucial and requires monitoring vital signs in daily living conditions. The electroencephalogram (EEG) is a valuable tool for monitoring brain activity, providing critical information on MDD and its underlying neurological mechanisms. While traditional EEG systems typically involve multiple channels for recording, making them impractical for home-based monitoring, wearable sensors can effectively capture single-channel EEG data. However, generating meaningful features from these data poses challenges due to the need for specialized domain knowledge and significant computational power, which can hinder real-time processing. To address these issues, our study focuses on developing a deep learning model for the binary classification of MDD using single-channel EEG data. We focused on specific channels from various brain regions such as central, frontal, occipital, temporal, and parietal. Our study found that the channels Fp1, F8 and Cz achieved an impressive accuracy of 90% when analyzed using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with leave-one-subject-out cross-validation on a public dataset. Our study highlights the potential of utilizing single-channel EEG data for reliable MDD diagnosis, providing a less intrusive and more convenient wearable solution for mental health assessment."

    "abstract": "The detection of offensive language in social media faces significant challenges due to its diverse and evolving expressions, making accurate identification remains critical for maintaining healthy online ecosystems. While few-shot learning with large language models (LLMs) has demonstrated potential in this domain, conventional static demonstration selection strategies often fail to adapt to the linguistic variability of offensive content, which ultimately limits model performance. To address this limitation, we propose LLMs with Dynamic Few-Shot (LDFS), a novel method that encodes the training set into dense vector representations, retrieves top-k nearest-neighbors for each sample, and constructs balanced demonstrations by strategically sampling from offensive and non-offensive classes. These demonstrations are integrated with the task description and output constraints to construct structured prompts that guide the LLMs to perform the classification. Comprehensive evaluations on the benchmark datasets COLDataset and CDial-Bias reveal that LDFS consistently outperforms conventional approaches. The method achieves superior performance compared to random 10-shot selection, with F1-score improvements reaching up to 14 percentage points. Notably, LDFS surpasses specialized fine-tuned models including COLDETECTOR by 6.82% and GLM2 P-Prompt by 17.47% in F1-score on the CDial-Bias dataset. These results demonstrate that dynamic, semantically-aware demonstration selection can effectively enhance the capability of LLMs to recognize offensive language across diverse contexts."

The ABS hovers at a specific position to provide communication services to user clusters, while the MR flies along a predefined trajectory to receive communication reflection signals for target sensing. By taking into account user communication and target sensing performance, as well as flight energy consumption of the MR, the system utility function is modeled as a weighted sum of the minimum average rate of user clusters, sensing channel gain, and flight energy consumption of the MR. The joint communication precoding design, ABS deployment, MR trajectory planning, and communication sensing scheduling problem is modeled as a constrained system utility function maximization problem. Given that the modeled optimization problem is a highly coupled and non-convex mixed-integer optimization problem, it is challenging to solve directly. To tackle this problem, we decompose the original problem into four subproblems and sequentially solve each subproblem using an alternating iteration algorithm. Specifically, for the communication precoding design subproblem, the zero-forcing algorithm is used to eliminate the interference among users and the original problem is transformed into a semi-definite programming problem. For the ABS deployment subproblem and the MR trajectory planning subproblem, the Taylor expansion and the successive convex approximation are employed and slack variables are introduced to convert the original problems into convex optimization problems. For the communication sensing scheduling subproblem, the variable relaxation method is adopted to relax the binary variables into continuous variables, and the optimization tool is used to obtain the solution. Then, two heuristic algorithms are proposed to restore the communication and sensing scheduling variables. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms is verified through simulations."

This paper investigates the resilience of QUIC to selective traffic manipulation attacks aimed at inflating network traffic, which can lead to increased operational costs for service providers and degraded user experiences.We present three distinct attacks designed to manipulate QUIC traffic by selectively dropping or manipulating packets. One attack can be executed by any middlebox in the network path between the client and the server, while the others require the attacker to have some previous control of QUIC components. Through experimental analysis, we evaluate the impact of these attacks on inflating the packet and data accounting. Our results show that attackers can effectively increase data traffic up to 50% of the original transmission size without altering the content of the QUIC communication. These findings highlight the potential for significant traffic inflation and offer insights into countermeasures that could mitigate the risks posed by these vulnerabilities."

    "abstract": "Unwrapping synthetic aperture radar interferograms with extensive low-coherence regions remains challenging, even when the deformation signal has a low gradient, such as that due to interseismic displacement. Here, we present a novel algorithm to unwrap low-gradient interferograms more efficiently and reliably using a semantic segmentation neural network. We first partition large-scale interferograms into overlapping patches and employ a trained Segformer network, making full use of spatial features, to identify decorrelated pixels while predicting the wrap count for coherent pixels. In a further step, we correct wrap counts or re-unwrap certain patches, based on a reliability metric. Finally, the patches are mosaicked to reconstruct the fully unwrapped interferogram by leveraging overlapping areas. The Segformer model is trained on over 20,000 simulated samples with varying decorrelation noise and more than 10,000 real-world samples from the COMET-LiCSAR portal. Synthetic experiments show that our approach significantly reduces the mean absolute error compared to the classical minimum cost flow method. Further validation on thousands of interferograms from the western Altyn Tagh Fault and the western Haiyuan Fault confirms its superior performance in isolated regions separated by decorrelated noise and its ability to suppress the wide-ranging propagation of unwrapping errors, with the proportion of unwrapping errors reduced by 28-83% for real interferograms. These results highlight the potential of our method to be used in large-scale automated processing of straining regions, such as the Alpine-Himalayan Belt."

A joint in-band full-duplex (IBFD) and physical layer security (PLS) communication scheme is proposed and demonstrated experimentally, where the self-interference cancellation (SIC) and cooperative-jamming cancellation (CJC) is realized simultaneously by using photonics method. For the SIC and CJC, the phase inversion is obtained by biasing the Mach–Zehnder modulators (MZMs) at the negative quadrature points, while the wide band amplitude and time delay are adjusted in optical domain. The performance of photonic-enabled system with RF propagation via the cable and the air are both carried out at the central frequency of 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz with the bandwidth of 50 MHz and 100 MHz, respectively. For the over-the-air communication, the SIC depth of 17.5 dB and CJC depth of 25.6 dB over 100 MHz bandwidth at the center frequency of 2.4 GHz are realized, and the signal of interest is recovered successfully in the joint IBFD and PLS communication scenario."

To address these challenges, this tutorial provides a systematic and comprehensive introduction to the principles, design, and applications of Large Artificial Intelligence Models (LAMs) and Agentic AI technologies in intelligent communication systems, aiming to offer researchers an integrated overview of cutting-edge methodologies and practical insights. First, the tutorial outlines the background of 6G communications and reviews the technological evolution from LAMs to Agentic AI.

A LAM-centric design paradigm tailored for communication systems is subsequently proposed, encompassing dataset construction, internal learning, and external learning approaches. Building upon this foundation, the tutorial develops an LAM-based Agentic AI system for intelligent communications, elaborating on its core components—including agents, world models, planners, knowledge bases, tools, and memory modules— as well as their interaction mechanisms. Finally, it provides an in-depth review of representative applications of LAMs and Agentic AI in communication scenarios, and summarizes the current research challenges and future directions, with the goal of fostering the development of efficient, secure, and sustainable next-generation intelligent communication systems."

The results reveal three user groups: Cluster 0 (Active Users), who use the system frequently and spend the most, mainly influenced by places like department stores and museums; Cluster 1 (Occasional Users), who utilize the service rarely and spend little, with low sensitivity to POIs; and Cluster 2 (Long Duration Users), who make fewer but longer trips and are most affected by being near night markets.

To address the issues of excessive inrush current or increased control complexity in existing soft-start strategies, this paper proposes an LLC-CLCF resonant converter with a small-capacitance CLC filter, replacing the conventional large capacitor filtering method. The LLC-CLCF resonant converter significantly reduces the inrush current and lowers waveform distortion. Experimental results show that the peak startup current of the LLC-CLCF resonant converter is reduced to 4.3 A, representing a 46% reduction compared to conventional LLC resonant converters. This provides an effective solution for the design of high-reliability LLC resonant converters."

RSSI pipelines that combine metaheuristics, multi-stage filtering, and LQI-aware MLE increase robustness in noisy indoor environments, 3D extensions, and single-anchor virtual-anchor tricks exist but need more real deployments. Hybrid meta-heuristics (FH-PSO, CS, CMA-ES), a modified differential evolution (MDE), and deep learning refinement of DV-Hop consistently improve localization error in simulations, but often at the cost of centralization, memory, or sensitivity to parameter settings. In general, metaheuristic hybrids perform best for medium-sized networks, and DNNs improve accuracy but raise practical deployment issues. Beyond algorithmic refinements, emerging paradigms such as federated learning for WSN localization represent promising but underexplored directions."

Using a dual-index framework, we evaluate inventor- and assignee-level vibrancy within the solid-state electrolyte (SSE) domain from 2002 to 2021, focusing on two leading firms: Samsung Electronics and Toyota Motor. By combining longitudinal patent analysis with 2-mode inventor–field network mapping, we examine temporal and structural alignment between individual and organizational innovation. Findings show that Samsung adopts a modular strategy, with vibrant inventors often leading before or during the firm’s vibrant periods in subfield-specific bursts. In contrast, Toyota maintains a stable core of vibrant inventors contributing across multiple subfields, reflecting an integrative and sustained R&D approach. These differing strategies demonstrate that vibrant inventors are not incidental but central to innovation persistence. The results underscore how talent deployment and inventive continuity shape long-term corporate R&D vibrancy, offering strategic insights for innovation management and policy."

    "abstract": "Efficient on-device execution of transformer-based models (TBMs) requires specialized hardware acceleration. Yet, stringent memory and power constraints hinder the deployment of TBMs on edge platforms, necessitating aggressively quantized models to maintain energy efficiency. FP8 data types (E5M2/E4M3) provide a compelling 8-bit quantization alternative to FP16/BF16/FP32, enabling more efficient MAC computations. However, most existing FP CIM accelerators rely on serialized pre-alignment, incurring significant accuracy degradation and energy overhead. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel FP8 CIM accelerator that integrates 1) bit-parallel, reconfigurable, Domino-logic-based FP8 multipliers with 3.2× improved energy-delay-product to support dual FP8 formats, 2) post-alignment, reconfigurable sign-group aggregation units to enable efficient and precision-preserving computing, and 3) a lossless mantissa mapping scheme to facilitate seamless higher/mixed-precision MAC operations. Fabricated in 40 nm CMOS, our test chip achieves macro-level energy efficiencies of 42.13 TFLOPS/W for E5M2 and 38.23 TFLOPS/W for E4M3, respectively. Moreover, it delivers a system energy efficiency of 9.78 TFLOPS/W and a system compute density of 0.047 TOPS/mm<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>, 4.3× and up to 1.42× higher, respectively compared to the state-of-the-art TBM-oriented CIM accelerator.

The proposed approach avoids linearizations typically used in TWLS-type solutions and instead employs the Earth model and the known altitude to locate the source. The proposed solution has three attractive aspects. It reduces computation by projecting the model equations to a lower-dimensional parameter space, improves accuracy through a sequential parameter update process, and increases numerical stability by forming a regression matrix without involving measurements. The constrained Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (CCRLB), formulated according to the WGS84 reference system, serves as a benchmark for evaluating the effectiveness of the proposed method. Simulations show the proposed method provides accurate position and velocity estimation of the moving source with higher computational efficiency than competing methods in challenging scenarios."

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) enables decentralized model training while preserving data privacy, but it remains susceptible to backdoor attacks, especially under dynamic client participation and non-IID data. Existing attacks, such as Distributed Backdoor Attack (DBA) and Shadow Attack, often struggle to balance stealthiness, robustness, and persistence. To address these challenges, we propose the Stealthy Associate Trigger Attack (SATA), which integrates four key techniques: trigger splitting, associative learning, L2-norm control, and progressive backdoor injection. Experimental results on CIFAR-10 using ResNet-18 demonstrate that SATA achieves a 99.26% Attack Success Rate (ASR) with only 10% malicious clients, while maintaining L2-norm deviations within 0.1 to evade detection. Moreover, SATA achieves an ASR-100 of 86.68%, indicating strong persistence. Additional evaluations on MNIST and under defense mechanisms like Multi-Krum and FoolsGold validate the generalizability and adaptability of our method. These findings highlight critical vulnerabilities in privacy-sensitive FL systems and call for the development of more effective defenses. Future work will explore extending SATA to text and audio domains and improving efficiency on edge devices."

In this paper, we propose an improved Dropping Meet-in-the-Middle (MitM) algorithm for LWE instances with sparse and small secrets. The core idea is to reduce the dimension of the MitM phase by pre-guessing τ components of the secret vector s, and to balance the additional guessing overhead against the reduction in the MitM phase, thereby achieving an overall optimization of computational cost. Experimental results show that our proposed method exhibits better performance compared with other attacks."

While quantization alters model parameters and their outputs, existing privacy analyses primarily focus on full-precision models, leaving a gap in understanding how bit-width reduction can affect privacy leakage. We present the first systematic study of the privacy–utility relationship in post-training quantization (PTQ), a versatile family of methods that can be applied to pretrained models without further training. Using membership inference attacks as our evaluation framework, we analyze three popular PTQ algorithms—AdaRound, BRECQ, and OBC—across multiple precision levels (4-bit, 2-bit, and 1.58-bit) on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet datasets. Our findings consistently show that low-precision PTQs can reduce privacy leakage. In particular, lower-precision models demonstrate up to an order of magnitude reduction in membership inference vulnerability compared to their full-precision counterparts, albeit at the cost of decreased utility. Additional ablation studies on the 1.58-bit quantization level show that quantizing only the last layer at higher precision enables fine-grained control over the privacy-utility trade-off. These results offer actionable insights for practitioners to balance efficiency, utility, and privacy protection in real-world deployments."

    "abstract": "The inherent unpredictability of abnormal events in real-world Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) presents significant challenges for model generalization. Early unsupervised methods aim to detect any anomalies as deviations from normal patterns, but they often equate rarity with abnormality, an assumption that leads to high false positives in open-world scenarios where uncommon behaviors are not necessarily abnormal. Current mainstream supervised approaches focus on memorizing discriminative features rather than learning the underlying pattern that governs normal and abnormal events. Although their performance on the seen anomalies is superior, their capability for robust open-set inference is still limited. Moreover, conventional closed-set evaluation benchmarks obscure this critical distinction by assuming identical anomaly types during training and testing. To address this limitation, this paper constructs the Real-world Supervised Open-set Benchmark (RSOB) built on a novel large-scale traffic abnormal event dataset with precise frame-level annotation, supporting evaluation across varying supervision granularities, from full to weak supervision settings. This benchmark is also the first to enable the real-world open-set evaluation constructed on the simulation of potential open-set scenarios in the application. Moreover, we further propose a human-prior-aware framework that learns domain-agnostic normality rules through a novel Human-Prior-Focused (HPF) feature space. This space is derived from a semantic-aware transformation on pre-trained feature space to effectively separate normal events while modeling generalizable human rules. Notably, the framework is architecture-agnostic and establishes the first unified solution applicable to both supervised and weakly supervised VAD paradigms. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our framework over traditional discriminative methods across our benchmark as well as the conventional benchmark Ubnormal. The code and dataset will be publicly available."

    "abstract": "In video-text cross-domain retrieval tasks, the generalization ability of the retrieval models is key to improving their performance and is crucial for enhancing their practical applicability. However, existing retrieval models exhibit significant deficiencies in cross-domain generalization. On one hand, models tend to overfit specific training domain data, resulting in poor cross-domain matching and significantly reduced retrieval accuracy when dealing with data from different, new, or mixed domains. On the other hand, although data augmentation is a vital strategy for enhancing model generalization, most existing methods focus on unimodal augmentation and fail to fully exploit the multimodal correlations between video and text. As a result, the augmented data lack semantic diversity, which further limits the model’s ability to understand and perform in complex cross-domain scenarios. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an innovative collaborative augmentation approach named MDA-MAA, which includes two core modules: the Masked Attention Augmentation (MAA) module and the Multimodal Diffusion Augmentation (MDA) module. The MAA module applies masking to the original video frame features and uses an attention mechanism to predict the masked features, effectively reducing overfitting to training data and enhancing model generalization. The MDA module generates subtitles from video frames and uses the LLaMA model to infer comprehensive video captions. These captions, combined with the original video frames, are integrated into a diffusion model for joint learning, ultimately generating semantically enriched augmented video frames. This process leverages the multimodal relationship between video and text to increase the diversity of the training data distribution. Experimental results demonstrate that this collaborative augmentation method significantly improves the performance of video-text cross-domain retrieval models, validating its effectiveness in enhancing model generalization."

    "abstract": "An online inductance correction strategy for slidingmode observer (SMO) based sensorless control of surfacemounted permanent magnet synchronous motors (SPMSMs) is presented. By analyzing the influence of parameter variation on back-EMF estimation using a complex-vector model, a small highfrequency voltage is injected on the d-axis and the induced highfrequency response in the estimated back-EMF is extracted by a second-order generalized integrator (SOGI) and a sliding window. The extracted amplitude is used as the error metric and an RMSProp-based adaptive gradient descent updates the SMO model inductance in real time. The method requires no explicit speed information, has low computational cost, and is validated experimentally."

    "abstract": "Backward-compatible training enables the deployment of advanced models without requiring updates to old gallery databases. However, existing methods, including old-prototype-based (i.e., those relying on prototypes from the old model) and instance-based approaches, often overlook the impact of the old model's quality. High-quality old models exhibit compact intra-class feature distributions, which facilitate effective alignment between old and new models across various methods. In contrast, low-quality old models produce dispersed features, making it difficult for old-prototype-based methods to extract sufficient information. Additionally, instance-based methods are overly restrictive, limiting the flexibility of new models. In this work, we propose SA-BCT, an extremely simple yet effective backward-compatible training method that offers a unified framework for accommodating old models of varying quality. SA-BCT employs a single loss function applied to both old and new features, self-adaptively adjusting the constraint space for new features based on the distribution of old features. Extensive experiments in diverse settings demonstrate the effectiveness of SA-BCT.

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of large language models, the fine-tuning of downstream tasks has become a key problem. As a new learning paradigm, prompt learning can greatly reduce the number of updated parameters and effectively reduce the communication cost in federated learning scenarios by freezing the pre-trained model and fine-tuning soft prompt parameters. However, for the federated prompt tuning, the local prompt usually contains the user's personal information, and the text input of the user are easily leaked through the aggregation directly on the server. Meanwhile, the soft prompt is vulnerable to poisoning attacks launched by malicious users (such as backdoor). For the above problems, this paper proposes a privacy-preserving federated prompt fine-tuning against poisoning attacks. Specifically, we use homomorphic encryption to ensure the confidentiality of local prompts, and aggregate prompts under ciphertext to generate global prompts. Secondly, the proposed mechanism of backdoor detection is used to judge whether the prompt contains backdoors to resist the malicious attacks in the form of ciphertext. Both local and global prompts are invisible to the server during the entire training process. Finally, theoretical analysis and experimental results show that the accuracy error between the plaintext domain and the ciphertext domain is controlled within 2%-5% under backdoor attack, which effectively enhances the robustness of the model."

    "abstract": "For large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, antenna selection (AS) schemes are usually used to reduce hardware cost and energy consumption, in which only the antennas with low correlation each other and high gain are activated. However, such existing AS schemes may not necessarily ensure the security of information transmission when eavesdroppers are involved as the channels between legitimate users and eavesdroppers may correlate each other due to the inadequate scattering conditions in the propagation. To this end, a novel AS and artificial noise (AN) injection strategy is proposed to enhance system security. Specifically, integrating the correlation between the paths of the legitimate user (LU) and the eavesdropper with channel gains, a comprehensive metric is defined, based on which the optimal antennas used to transmit signals are obtained. Then, based on a deep Q-network (DQN), the subspaces for precoding confidential messages and injecting AN are alternately optimized to maximize the system secrecy rate. Simulation results illustrate that the proposed scheme can obtain much higher secrecy rate compared to the existing ones."

    "abstract": "Compared with three-level inverters, four-level inverters employ bulkier dc-link capacitors to reduce the voltage fluctuation of each split capacitor. The existing schemes suppress the voltage fluctuation by increasing the switching time during a switching period, leading to lower efficiencies. Thus, this article proposes a hybrid discontinuous pulse-width modulation (HDPWM) scheme to reduce the dc-link capacitor voltage fluctuation and switching losses simultaneously. First, the subsector division and switching-state sequences are optimized, with each subsector containing a pair of redundant clamping modes. The voltage fluctuation of the middle capacitor is eliminated by considering voltage balancing constraints while calculating the vector dwelling time of each clamping mode. Then, the voltage fluctuation of the upper and lower capacitors is reduced by employing different clamping modes for different switching periods. As a result, all the split capacitor voltage fluctuations are reduced, and the switching state of one phase is clamped to lower the switching losses. Finally, a 6 kW three-phase four-level inverter prototype is built. Experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively suppress capacitor voltage fluctuations while a smaller dc-link capacitance is employed. Compared with existing capacitor voltage fluctuation suppression schemes, the proposed HDPWM scheme improves the efficiency by about 0.5%."

The HOT loss performs dual-level alignment: frame-level spatial features handle appearance variations, while video-level temporal features capture expression dynamics. SPT enables parameter-efficient adaptation by introducing learnable prompts to frozen backbone models, requiring less than 1% of total parameters. Experiments across challenging benchmarks demonstrate that HOT-SPT achieves superior performance in accuracy, robustness, and fairness compared to existing methods."

    "abstract": "Research knowledge graphs (RKGs) have emerged as essential technology for organizing scientific knowledge, but their success depends heavily on the quality of their underlying content. Knowledge curation is a critical task to ensure the quality of (research) knowledge graphs ((R)KGs), with human curation being the gold standard despite its time- and resourceintensive nature. Automated methods, while efficient, lack the precision of human expertise. Hybrid approaches, combining automated processes with human oversight, offer a promising solution to this challenge. Dashboards can act as supportive tools in hybrid curation approaches, offering real-time updates and visual overviews. This paper presents an action research study, conducted in collaboration with the Curation and Community Building (C&CB) team of the Open Research Knowledge Graph (ORKG), to explore the development of a dashboard, called SciKGDash, designed to support knowledge curation of the ORKG. SciKGDash serves as a minimum viable product (MVP) tailored to the needs of the C&CB team, with potential for adaptation to other (R)KGs. An experiment with 15 participants demonstrated the usability of SciKGDash, with successful completion of 4 out of 5 curation tasks in under 5 minutes. In addition, SciKGDash received a positive user experience rating (UEQ score of 1.93). While the tailored solution proved effective for the ORKG, the research also highlights limitations in applying specific quality metrics across diverse (R)KGs. Future work should focus on identifying common quality metrics and enhancing SciKGDash with user-friendly features for querying customized quality metrics. Overall, knowledge curation in RKGs remains an under-explored field, warranting further research."

    "abstract": "Human-AI collaborative rumor combating behavior refers to joint information-governance activities in which humans and artificial intelligence systems coordinate and complement each other to counter rumors and mitigate their negative impacts. Such decision-making is shaped not only by algorithmic performance and technical conditions but also by ethical norms and shared values. As a bidirectional ethical framework, human-AI interaction ethics comprises two dimensions: human ethics in human-AI interaction and AI ethics in AI-human interaction. Both dimensions critically influence collaborative rumor combating behavior. However, existing research on Human-AI collaborative rumorcombating behavior mainly focuses on specific stages of the rumor-combating process, such as rumor detection or verification, lacking systematic analysis and validated measurement scales. Moreover, prior research tends to overemphasize AI ethics in AI-human interaction while neglecting human ethics in human-AI interaction and their alignment effects on collaborative rumor combating behavior. This research adopts a dual-ethics perspective to explore the independent and joint effects of human and AI ethics on collaborative rumor combating behavior and to reveal their underlying mechanisms. The research aims to extend the theoretical boundary of human-AI collaboration and ethics research and offer practical insights for designing intelligent debunking systems and optimizing human-AI co-governance toward trustworthy and sustainable information governance."

The Universal Motor Controller (UMC100.3) represents a key enabler in this context by combining advanced motor protection, communication capabilities, and real-time condition monitoring. Beyond conventional motor control, the UMC100.3 integrates fault detection and diagnostic functionalities such as phase imbalance, overload, and abnormal thermal behavior, thereby enabling early failure analysis and prognostics in line with international condition monitoring standards. Its seamless integration into SCADA and IoT platforms supports risk-based maintenance strategies by transforming raw operational data into actionable insights for reliability improvement.This paper positions the UMC100.3 within the framework of reliability engineering, highlighting its contribution to lifetime optimization, productivity enhancement, and risk assessment in industrial environments. By leveraging condition-based monitoring and data-driven analytics, the controller not only reduces unplanned downtime but also enables predictive maintenance strategies aligned with Industry 4.0 paradigms. Furthermore, the UMC100.3 exemplifies how embedded intelligence in motor control devices can extend asset lifetimes, improve safety, and facilitate sustainable operation. The analysis demonstrates that such intelligent controllers play a pivotal role in bridging reliability engineering principles with real-world industrial applications, making them central to advancing reliability-driven system design and maintenance."

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) is a privacy-preserving machine learning technique that facilitates collaboration among participants across demographics. FL enables model sharing, while restricting the movement of data. Since FL provides participants with independence over their training data, it becomes susceptible to poisoning attacks. Such collaboration also propagates bias among the participants, even unintentionally, due to different data distribution or historical bias present in the data. This paper proposes an intentional fairness attack, where a client maliciously sends a biased model, by increasing the fairness loss while training, even considering homogeneous data distribution. The fairness loss is calculated by solving an optimization problem for fairness metrics such as demographic parity and equalized odds. The attack is insidious and hard to detect, as it maintains global accuracy even after increasing the bias. We evaluate our attack against the state-of-the-art Byzantine-robust and fairness-aware aggregation schemes over different datasets, in various settings. The empirical results demonstrate the attack efficacy by increasing the bias up to 90%, even in the presence of a single malicious client in the FL system."

To address this challenge, this study developed a joint UNet-NNI (nearest neighbor interpolation) inpainting method for deep-sea multibeam backscatter intensity images. First, a UNet-MCSA (multiscale channel spatial attention) model combining shortcut connections and the MCSA mechanism was developed and trained on backscatter data obtained from UK waters, with data from a Pacific deep-sea region used for validation. Then, a collaborative UNet-NNI framework was constructed by integrating histogram matching with NNI to improve clarity in large-gap regions. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed approach achieves higher structural fidelity and better intensity consistency than realized using classical interpolation and conventional deep learning methods, across both simulated and real data. The method effectively inpaints large-scale missing regions, and produces visually and physically consistent intensity images, thereby providing a practical deep–shallow hybrid paradigm for deep-sea multibeam backscatter inpainting."

Prophet demonstrated superior training performance (MAPE: 18.2%) by capturing Kuwait’s unique summer holiday effects through its additive decomposition framework. However, its test accuracy declined (MAPE: 31.9%), reflecting challenges in generalizing to abrupt trend shifts and limited data. Both models highlighted the dominance of unmodeled factors (78% variability unexplained by trend alone), emphasizing the need for larger datasets and hybrid approaches. While Prophet excels in handling complex seasonality, its sensitivity to data quality and volume underscores practical limitations."

    "abstract": "The neuro-fuzzy controller is a powerful tool for the speed control of squirrel cage induction motors. By combining the advantages of neural networks and fuzzy logic, this controller can effectively handle the nonlinear and uncertain nature of motor control systems. One of the key benefits of using a neuro-fuzzy controller for speed control is its ability to adapt and learn from the motor's behaviour in real-time. This allows for precise and robust control, even in the presence of disturbances and variations in the motor's parameters. The design and implementation of a neuro-fuzzy controller involves the use of a knowledge base, a fuzzy inference engine, and a learning algorithm. The knowledge base contains the linguistic rules that describe the relationship between the input and output variables, while the fuzzy inference engine processes these rules to generate the control actions. The learning algorithm enables the controller to adapt and improve its performance over time, making it particularly well-suited for applications where the motor's operating conditions frequently change. In educational contexts, studying and understanding the principles of neuro-fuzzy control for speed control of squirrel cage induction motors can provide valuable insights into the application of advanced control techniques in industrial automation and robotics. This knowledge can also be applied to various other fields where precise and dynamic control of motor systems is essential."

After a fault occurs, appropriate reconfiguration of the 6/5-leg converter enables continued operation with the 5 healthy legs. The control must be modified when switching from a 6-leg topology to a 5-leg topology using triacs and a specific PWM scheme. However, this topology can have faults in its switches.

However, this topology may have faults in its switches. The fault-tolerant 5-legconverter topology has a specific feature following the occurrence of a fault.

Specifically, a distributed observer is designed to estimate the attacked states online, and adaptive technology is utilized to compensate for the unknown dynamics and the impact of attacks. This method can still achieve the preset bipartite time-varying formation under continuous attacks and ensure that the observation error is uniformly bounded. The Lyapunov function is constructed via linear matrix inequalities, and the stability of the closed-loop system is strictly proven.

    "abstract": "The grounding resistance of lightning protection systems serves as a key parameter that mirrors the current dissipation efficiency within building structures. Despite technical guidelines discouraging testing right after rainfall, given precipitation’s effect on grounding resistance, the varied influence of rainfall on grounding resistance at different depths has not been thoroughly examined. This research explores how precipitation impacts grounding resistance at diverse burial depths through daily fixed-point measurements carried out between October 2021 and September 2022 at the Ziyang Meteorological Bureau site. By employing mathematical statistics alongside stepwise regression analysis, data from four test points with grounding electrode depths of $2.5 \\mathrm{~m}, 2.0 \\mathrm{~m}, 1.5 \\mathrm{~m}$, and 0.5 m were analyzed. Findings reveal that the monthly averages of grounding resistance and soil resistivity are inversely related to monthly rainfall. For deeper grounding electrodes $(\\geq 1.5 \\mathrm{~m})$, the decrease in grounding resistance rises linearly with rainfall up to $\\mathbf{2 5. 0 ~ m m}$, after which it levels off. Conversely, shallower electrodes ($\\boldsymbol{x} \\mathbf{0. 5 ~ m}$) display a more intricate reaction due to meteorological elements like sunlight, wind, and temperature, showing an initial rise in resistance reduction followed by a slow stabilization. A regression model was formulated to measure the connection between rainfall and grounding resistance reduction. These outcomes offer accurate technical backing for lightning protection device testing, risk evaluation, and engineering design."

    "abstract": "The notion of incremental stability provides a powerful tool for the analysis and design of nonlinear systems. This paper is concerned with establishing incremental stability properties for a class of <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">discontinuous</i> dynamical systems that are formed by the feedback interconnection of a linear time-invariant plant (possibly including linear control elements) and a <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">first-order projection-based element</i>. This class of control systems has received a lot of attention due to its abilities to overcome fundamental performance limitations of linear control and recent successes in industrial motion control. By deriving and exploiting dissipativity properties of the projection element's discontinuous vector field that hold only in certain subregions of its incremental input-output space, a tailored piecewise quadratic incremental Lyapunov function is constructed by appropriately “connecting” local incremental quadratic storage functions. Based on this result, conditions for guaranteeing incremental input-to-state stability of the considered class of discontinuous dynamical systems are formulated in the form of numerically tractable linear matrix inequalities. The benefits of these results are demonstrated through a numerical case-study showing “nonlinear” Bode-plots for accurate steady-state performance analysis."

We evaluate the feasibility of the InterPlanetary Archival Record Object (IPARO), a framework proposed to eliminate the dependency on local indexes in decentralized web archiving. IPARO addresses this limitation by embedding version-linked references directly into archival objects stored in IPFS and using the InterPlanetary Name System (IPNS) for discovery of the latest versions. This design enables traversal of a resource’s version history entirely within the decentralized network. In this paper, we simulate the construction and resolution of IPARO chains to assess their practicality for replaying archived Web content without centralized infrastructure. Our evaluation examines integrity and availability under various conditions. Results show that IPARO retains the benefits of distributed storage while eliminating reliance on local indexes, offering a scalable and robust model for decentralized preservation."

In a related study, a method using SVM that considers the difficulty of fingerings during performance was proposed. The estimation accuracy was better than the previous method. However, this method uses ground truth labels as input features. And this method did not consider the notes after the estimated notes, so unnatural finger movements were selected. In this study, we propose a method that uses the estimated data for the features. And we propose the method that combines the prediction results of SVM and dynamic programming to prevent the selection of unnatural finger movements. In addition to the conventional agreement rate, RMSE is employed to assess the naturalness of the predicted fingerings. The application of the proposed method to real data confirms that the agreement rate increases and the RMSE is halved compared to related work."

The strategy utilizes key node sequences and integrates the power information of the node itself and its neighbor nodes to construct a key-node-based fault load redistribution model. Simulation results show that the load redistribution strategy proposed in this study can effectively improve the invulnerability of common power grids."

    "abstract": "A combination of gold and bismuth is commonly used as absorber for X-ray transition-edge sensors, due to high atomic numbers and, consequently large cross sections, and to their complementary thermal properties. Since Au conductivity dominates, especially at cryogenic temperatures, electrodeposited bismuth films have been grown over sputtered gold, so that bismuth forms a bridge on the gold fingers and, therefore, the conductivity contribution from the underlying Au layer can be removed. Resistance as a function of the temperature has been investigated for pristine and annealed samples, both with and without a dc magnetic field. A general behavior has been observed, thus evidencing three different zones. At high temperatures a metal regime, described in terms of a Fermi liquid model, is identified. In an intermediate temperature region, a hysteretic and irreversible insulating-type resistance is observed. While, at low temperatures a resistance plateau appears. To better understand the electrical conduction properties, noise measurements have been also performed. Two possible models have been considered to interpret experimental data in the intermediate temperature region: Fluctuation-Induced Tunneling and Quantum Interference Effects. The analysis here reported gives indication on the granular structure of the investigated films, which could be represented as random networks of tunneling junctions, where the nodes are the conducting pathways connecting different junctions. In these regions, temperature-induced intergranular processes could be effectively detected giving additional information on the prediction of the ultimate energy resolving capabilities of detectors with bismuth absorbers."

Rather than relying solely on historical data prediction, we employ autoregressive (AR) and autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (ARCH) models to generate future time-series data and combine these with past observations to improve analytical accuracy. We then extract a set of statistical and temporal features from both volume and price, apply principal component analysis for dimensionality reduction, and enhance signal clarity. Finally, we perform density - based spatial clustering (DBSCAN) to categorize assets as safe or unsafe. Experiments using 2023 and Q1 2024 data demonstrate classification precision exceeding 97%, confirming the method’s robustness even with limited samples. By integrating well-established models in a novel workflow, our approach offers both high interpretability and operational feasibility for real-time risk monitoring. Future work will explore the incorporation of exogenous market signals and extension to multi-asset portfolios."

    "abstract": "Massive random access is a key challenge in massive machine-type communications (mMTC), which aims to support connectivity for a large number of devices. Most existing studies assume strict user synchronization; however, this assumption is often unrealistic in practical scenarios without base station coordination. To address the issue of random access in asynchronous scenarios, this paper proposes two innovative algorithms. First, we propose a detection algorithm based on generalized approximate message passing with the sum product algorithm (GAMP-SPA). By incorporating user delay characteristics into a factor graph model and performing iterative message updates, the algorithm progressively converges to the optimal posterior probability distribution, thereby enabling joint detection of user activity, delay, and transmitted data. Second, we propose AMP-Net, a model-driven approximate message passing network that integrates deep neural architectures with message passing principles to reduce reliance on prior knowledge of both channel state information (CSI) and user activity patterns. Simulation results demonstrate that the two proposed algorithms achieve superior performance in asynchronous scenarios, significantly outperforming traditional compressed sensing algorithms in non-coherent joint detection tasks."

This study presents a hybrid reliability assessment framework that integrates mechanism-based and data-driven approaches for online degradation evaluation. A representative degradation mode— impact fatigue—is investigated to demonstrate the method. The mechanistic component is formulated by using crack propagation theory and Miner’s cumulative damage rule; while the data-driven one employs a generalized power-law Wiener process with an additive nonlinear drift. Both sources of information are fused through an evolving unscented Kalman filter that performs optimal and unbiased online state estimation via prediction and observation updates. In the proposed framework, the Wiener process serves as the state equation, and the mechanistic model functions as the measurement equation. The reliability of impact fatigue is further evaluated by using the inverse Gaussian distribution, which is inherently associated with the Wiener process. Application to a thrust bearing in the main pump of a pressurized water reactor demonstrates the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method over existing ones."

    "abstract": "Phase-coded waveforms are widely used in multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) radar systems, but ideal orthogonal coding is difficult to realize in practice. Non-orthogonality among waveforms introduces phase distortion and signal-to-noise ratio loss, while Doppler sensitivity further degrades system performance due to modulation-induced mismatch. To address these issues, this paper develops a unified MIMO radar signal model under non-orthogonal phase coding and analyzes the effects of waveform non-orthogonality and Doppler modulation on matched filter outputs. A signal recovery network CANet, combining convolutional neural networks with an attention mechanism, is proposed to remove phase-coding modulation and restore the signal spectrum, thereby providing reliable time-frequency priors for subsequent filter design. To cope with errors in time–frequency estimation, resolution limitations, and complex multi-target scenarios, we further propose WUNet, a nonlinear filter that integrates wavelet-based feature fusion with a UNet architecture. WUNet exploits both time-frequency and phase-amplitude features in the encoder and enables effective waveform separation and accurate phase recovery in the decoder. Simulation results verify that the proposed approach significantly mitigates the adverse impact of waveform non-orthogonality and Doppler sensitivity on MIMO radar performance."

    "abstract": "The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and its follower GRACE-Follow On (GRACE-FO) act as a reliable tool to detect the Earth's surface mass change. However, its discontinuity between GRACE and GRACE-FO limits its applicability for long term analysis. Its coarse spatial resolution (∼300 km) of GRACE and GRACE-FO (GRACE/GFO) hampers detailed understanding of ice mass change response mechanisms to climate change at spatial scales below 200,000 km2. Additionally, researches in downscaling GRACE-derived ice mass change in the Greenland ice sheet (GrIS) remains limited. Based on the continuous reconstructed GRACE/GFO data, we firstly compared the performance of geographically weighted regression (GWR) and random forest (RF) to downscale GRACE/GFO from 0.25°×0.25° to 5 km×5 km at a spatial global scale (SGS) in GrIS. This study presents the first application of such high-resolution downscaling to the reconstructed GRACE/GFO results over the GrIS. Finally, the SGS-GWR outperformed SGS-RF in capturing reasonable and finer signals of ice mass change. And downscaled results from SGS-GWR fit well with original GRACE/GFO mascon solutions and other independent estimates, achieving mean correlation coefficients and mean root mean square error at 0.98/2.68 cm by considering the nonstationarity heterogeneity of variables. Based on the continuous and high-resolution ice mass change, glacier-scale analysis of climatic forcing mechanisms, such as Greenland Blocking through its modulation of runoff, snowfall, rainfall, and solid ice discharge in 2012 and 2019, represents a novel contribution."

    "abstract": "Existing on-link IPv6 address scanning technologies based on IPv6-only information rely on protocol features such as ICMPv6, MLD, and other protocol features to induce responses. However, these scanning packets are easily intercepted by the default security mechanisms of modern operating systems (OSs), leading to issues such as low OS coverage and incomplete IPv6 address scan results of alive nodes. On-link IPv6 address scanning technologies based on dual-stack correlation information overly rely on IPv4 networks, resulting in low IPv6 address scanning efficiency and inability to operate in IPv6-only networks. To this end, we propose an efficient IPv6 addresses scanning technology based on hostname correlation in IPv6-only network (HFinder6), which passively captures DHCPv6 Solicit messages sent by both currently alive and newly joined nodes, and constructs Router Advertisement messages of neighbor discovery protocol to trigger alive nodes to proactively send DHCPv6 Solicit messages, enabling the rapid acquisition of hostname information for on-link nodes. Subsequently, the IPv6 address information is queried in parallel using the mDNS protocol and LLMNR protocol, thereby achieving efficient scanning of IPv6 addresses for alive nodes in IPv6-only network. A typical IPv6-only and dual-stack network environment was established, comprising 14 versions of OSs such as Windows and Linux. HFinder6 was tested in this environment and compared with 4 IPv6 address scanning scripts based on IPv6-only information from the Nmap tool and 3 IPv6 address scanning tools based on dual-stack correlation information (e.g., LinkScan6, LLMNR6, and FScan6). Experimental results show that HFinder6 can discover 31 IPv6 addresses across 12 OS versions in an average of just 10.19 seconds within IPv6-only network. In terms of OS coverage and IPv6 address scanning completeness, HFinder6 performs on par with FScan6 and outperforms 6 other scripts and tools, successfully identifies at more 9 additional OS versions and scans 27 more IPv6 addresses, thereby enhancing the completeness of IPv6 address scanning by up to 7.76 times. Moreover, in terms of IPv6 address scanning efficiency, HFinder6 can identify 2.23 more IPv6 addresses per second, outperforming 7 other scripts and tools."

Primarily, this study aims to implement and assess ML frameworks to build models capable of accurately predicting fuel consumption during the two-impulse non-coplanar orbital transfer of a geostationary spacecraft from low earth circular orbit. The dataset has been meticulously collected from the mission planning tool STK (System Tool Kit), capturing a diverse range of mission parameters and providing high-quality training samples for machine learning. After generating the dataset, four ML techniques, such as Random Forest (RF), Decision Trees (DTs), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), as well as simple Artificial Neural Network (ANN) have been applied to accurately estimate this critical metric of interest (fuel consumption). The results clearly demonstrate that these techniques excel in providing rapid and accurate estimations and also have illustrated splendid results with high evaluation metrics, including minimum RMSE and greater correlation coefficients (R2). Comparative analysis has been conducted to evaluate the predictability of these models. It is noteworthy that ANN exhibits superior performance compared to other selected ML models."

Lead to subsea cables having strong distributed-parameter characteristics. Subsea power systems generate complex electromagnetic transient processes under operating conditions such as power-on and power-off, as well as the load off-grid and grid-connected, highly prone to overvoltage phenomena, which pose potential threats to the safe operation of subsea electrical equipment. To elucidate the underlying mechanisms, the distributed parameter model and transient characterization of long-distance subsea power systems are investigated in this study. First, a distributed parameter model of the subsea power network is established based on the structural attributes of long-distance subsea cables. Second, to reduce computational complexity, the method of characteristics is employed to solve the distributed parameter model, transforming the partial differential equations into ordinary differential equations propagated along characteristic lines, thereby enabling efficient extraction of the system’s voltage and current transient responses. Finally, a case study based on an actual subsea oilfield power system is conducted; the simulation successfully reproduces a field-recorded overvoltage fault, demonstrating that the proposed distributed parameter model and solution approach possess high engineering applicability and predictive accuracy. The distributed parameter model and method of characteristics solution developed in this paper effectively disclose the transient mechanisms of long-distance subsea power systems, furnishing a reliable technical reference for the engineering design of power supply infrastructures in subsea oil and gas fields."

This transformation is particularly relevant for screwing processes, one of the most critical joining methods in manufacturing. While statistical process control has dominated quality assurance for decades, increasing customization, complex error patterns, and growing data volumes push traditional approaches beyond their limits. Machine learning-based anomaly detection offers transformative potential extending far beyond binary good/bad classification, enabling process optimization, predictive maintenance, and adaptive control.

    "abstract": "Under harsh operating conditions, electric machines are typically equipped with robust but low-precision position sensors. However, such sensors may lead to significant velocity quantization noise while operating in the low-velocity regime, creating an inherent trade-off between control bandwidth and velocity jitters. To address this challenge, this paper proposes an active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) strategy based on a time-event hybrid driven extended state observer (TEHESO). The proposed observer performs correction only when the position sensor is updated, while maintaining a low-noise prediction mode at other times. Simulation results verify the improved performance of the proposed method in low-velocity regions while also confirming its feasibility across the entire velocity range."

    "abstract": "A simple, wideband double-layer dielectric transmitarray (DTA) is proposed and systematically investigated. The unit cell comprises two stacked rectangular dielectric blocks with variable dimensions. Both transmission and resonance behaviors of the unit cell are analyzed. It is found that the phase-variation range increases monotonically with frequency. Weak transmissions can be observed at the lower and upper gain edge of the DTA, which is attributed to small phase-variation range of non-resonance mode, as well as the energy confinement of the resonance modes, respectively. It is favorable that the lower and upper gain edge can be adjusted independently, which greatly facilitates the wideband DTA design. A deep learning framework of both forward and inverse neural networks is used for fast unit-cell dimension prediction, and genetic algorithm is subsequently applied to optimize the multi-frequency reference phases. A double-layer 20× 20 DTA is designed and fabricated using ceramic-based 3-D printing technology. The measured peak gain is 24 dBi at 33GHz with aperture efficiency of 46%. As compared to the reported wideband DTAs, wider 1-dB and 3-dB gain bandwidths of 34.8% and 42.6% are obtained, respectively."

With advancements in satellite miniaturization and launch technologies, mega-constellations have become a growing trend. The increasing number of satellites in constellations presents challenges for interference analysis. This paper proposes a novel interference analysis method based on time-elevation interference spectrum. The proposed method can provide a more comprehensive analysis for NGSO mega-constellations by considering the aggregated dynamic interference under the time-elevation domain. The interference characteristics under different orbital inclination, orbital plane numbers, orbital height, and ground station latitude are analyzed. Furthermore, the probability distributions of interference are derived based on the joint distribution of satellites and ground stations. The outage probabilities and throughput are also analyzed to measure the system’s availability. Through the validation of STK and the Monte Carlo method, our method has high accuracy."

    "abstract": "Internet of Things (IoT) health monitoring devices allow the collection of data while performing various daily physical activities. These devices are not only affordable but also capable of collecting a wide variety of data, such as physiological data and environmental information. In the case of IoT healthcare systems, it is important to know which activity is performed to determine if there is any abnormality in a person’s physical behaviour during the activity, which may ultimately provide an indication of the person’s health condition. Human Activity Recognition (HAR) methods can be used to recognise activities. HAR is a field of identifying and categorising activities using Artificial Intelligence (AI), which uses raw data collected from different devices equipped with sensors such as cameras, accelerometers, gyroscopes, etc. The unique patterns and characteristics exhibited in human physical behaviours, such as gait, enable the identification of individuals with the use of a technology known as behavioural biometrics. This paper presents and evaluates HAR and user detection models, which serve as the foundation for constructing a trust model. The HAR binary classification proposed method achieved an accuracy of 97.5%, a precision of 97.7%, a recall of 97.5% and an F1 score of 97.6%. Additionally, the user detection model achieved an accuracy and a recall of 82.1% a precision of 91.6% and an F1 score of 85.7%. We then detail the methodology for calculating and updating trust scores over time and defining trust levels in the IoT system. Once trust is established, the system can provide reliable information regarding the individual’s health condition."

This paper introduces a novel permissioned blockchain transaction system specifically designed to address these challenges. Our design guarantees complete anonymity for sender and receiver identities as well as transaction amounts. Additionally, we implement a streamlined, non-interactive audit mechanism that allows authorized entities to inspect transactions without participant involvement. A key innovation is certifier-aided balance reconciliation, which significantly enhances transaction efficiency, usability, and scalability by eliminating the need for direct communication between participants. Through a formal security proof within the universal composable framework, we demonstrate the robust ability of the system to reconcile privacy requirements with compliance obligations."

    "abstract": "Land Cover (LC) classification remains challenging, even with advanced machine learning (ML) techniques. Pixel-wise Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are currently widely used for image classification. However, CNNs outputs often suffer from blurry boundaries and poorly segmented shapes. Hence, ad-hoc post-processing may be required to reduce over-smoothing. Conversely, it adds complexity to the classification process. Fortunately, generic foundation models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM), trained on large datasets, have become available. In this study, we propose a novel approach that combines outputs from locally trained CNN models and from the SAM model. We tested the approach on a mosaic of Sentinel-2 (S-2) images with a 10 m resolution, covering four neighboring first-level administrative units in Czechia. S-2 mosaic was classified according to the Land Use, Land-use Change, and Forestry (LULUCF) nomenclature using CNNs. Separately, this mosaic was segmented by SAM. The SAM output segments were assigned the dominant LC class from the CNN classification. The annotated segments were then overlaid on the original CNN classification to address over-smoothing. This approach resulted in an approximate two-percent improvement in overall accuracy (OA) and significantly enhancing the boundary delineation of LC objects in classification outputs, in terms of F1, precision, and recall. The reported two-percent improvement is meaningful because it was achieved on top of an already strong baseline (86.87 % overall accuracy), making further gains inherently difficult. LULUCF information is critical for monitoring compliance with the Paris Agreement. So, the ability to segment S-2 images into objects that align with LULUCF nomenclature could support future annual LULUCF reporting to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change."

    "abstract": "Self-supervised learning (SSL) offers a promising solution to reduce reliance on labeled data. Among SSL approaches, Masked Image Modeling (MIM) has demonstrated significant potential in remote sensing applications such as scene classification and semantic segmentation, owing to its ability to capture pixel-level details. However, existing MIM frameworks, originally designed for natural images, struggle to adapt to the spectral-spatial characteristics of multi-spectral satellite imagery. While recent studies have introduced spectral-enhanced MIM SSL methods, most rely on band-group embedding, which imposes constraints on band utilization flexibility in downstream fine-tuning tasks and limits the granularity of spectral feature learning. To address these challenges, this study proposes Band-Independent Masked Image Modeling (BIMIM) with Transformer, a novel self-supervised learning framework specifically designed for multi-spectral satellite imagery. BIMIM not only enables finer band-specific spectral feature extraction, allowing for more effective capture of subtle spectral variations, but also introduces spatially random masking at the single-band level, facilitating more efficient inter-band feature learning. Extensive experiments on publicly available remote sensing datasets demonstrate that BIMIM achieves state-of-the-art performance in downstream tasks such as scene classification and semantic segmentation. This study provides a new perspective on SSL for multi-spectral remote sensing, paving the way for more effective spectral-spatial feature extraction and adaptation in self-supervised learning frameworks."

To address this limitation, this study proposes a novel SC anomaly detection method that integrates SC simulation and machine learning techniques. Through evaluation using a hypothetical scenario, the proposed method was shown to effectively identify SC anomalies, and parameters influencing performance were examined. These findings suggest that further refinement of the proposed approach may enhance anomaly detection in more complex and dynamic supply chain environments."

    "abstract": "Smart grids, as critical national infrastructure, require robust cybersecurity. However, traditional anomaly detection methods face inherent challenges: the scarcity of labeled attack samples due to power grid traffic characteristics, which results in highly imbalanced datasets. To overcome these limitations, this paper introduces ProfilE, a novel self-supervised anomaly detection model. The framework consists of three core modules: an encoder module is responsible for fusing historical, topological, and statistical features to generate multi-dimensional feature embeddings; a self-supervised module generates corrupted samples to mitigate the reliance on labeled data; and a Profile Module utilizes these embeddings to learn and construct a communication relationship profile that characterizes normal network behavior. By using the reconstruction error from the profile module for anomaly detection, ProfilE fundamentally eliminates reliance on labeled data. Experimental evaluations on the CICModbus2023 and CICIDS2017 datasets demonstrate that ProfilE performs better than existing baseline methods in imbalanced smart grid environments. Notably, in scenarios with scarce attack samples, its Macro F1 outperforms baselines, fully validating its effectiveness and robustness in real-world power grid settings."

    "abstract": "Database systems are extensively used to store critical data across various domains. However, the frequency of abnormal database access behaviors, such as database intrusion by internal and external attacks, continues to rise. Internal masqueraders often have greater organizational knowledge, making it easier to mimic employee behavior effectively. In contrast, external masqueraders may behave differently due to their lack of familiarity with the organization. Current approaches lack the granularity needed to detect anomalies at the operational level, frequently misclassifying entire sequences of operations as anomalies, even though most operations are likely to represent normal behavior. On the other hand, some anomalous behaviors often resemble normal activities, making them difficult for existing detection methods to identify. This paper introduces a two-tiered anomaly detection approach for Structured Query Language (SQL) using the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model, specifically DistilBERT, a more efficient, pre-trained version. Our method combines both unsupervised and supervised machine learning techniques to accurately identify anomalous activities while minimizing the need for data labeling. First, the unsupervised method uses ensemble anomaly detectors that flag embedding vectors distant from learned normal patterns of typical user behavior across the database (out-of-scope queries). Second, the supervised method uses fine-tuned transformer-based models to detect internal attacks with high precision (in-scope queries), using role-labeled classification, even on limited labeled SQL data. Our findings make a significant contribution by providing an effective solution for safeguarding critical database systems from sophisticated threats."

    "abstract": "With the dramatic increase in the number of low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites, satellite handover strategies have become a research hot topic. However, most existing schemes largely ignore the problem of users’ personalized needs. To address this issue, we propose a handover scheme that combines user dynamic demands with multi-agent reinforcement learning. Specifically, we first construct a user dynamic preference matrix to extract user preference factors. Then, we use the entropy method combined with confidence intervals to dynamically calculate the attribute weights that satellites provide to users. This approach effectively eliminates the uncertainty of weight allocation and the influence of subjective assignment. By weighted fusion of user preferences and attribute weights, we establish a multi-attribute optimization model. Additionally, we design a distributed multi-agent QMIX (Q-mixing) reinforcement learning framework. In this framework, each user is regarded as a separate agent. The multi-attribute optimization model is used as the reward function for reinforcement learning, and collaborative optimization of handover strategies is achieved through asynchronous learning and a global reward mechanism. Simulation results show that our scheme achieves user satisfaction exceeding 60% for approximately 80% of users. It also provides higher signal quality and lower delay, while avoiding unnecessary handovers."

A “multi-buyer-multi-seller” OESS architecture is constructed, in which the PV-rich oilfield new energy microgrids (ONMs, Oilfield New Energy Microgrids) act as leaders and the PV-deficient ONMs act as followers. Through price and energy interactions between the upper and lower layers, the green power penetration rate is improved while minimizing the overall power supply cost.

However, oblivious transfer (OT) and fully homomorphic encryption (FHE)-based offline OLE generation are expensive, and the online computational complexity is super-linear and still a heavy burden for large-scale sets. In this paper, we propose VCR, an efficient PSI protocol from vector OLE (VOLE) with the offline-online paradigm. Concretely, we first propose the batched short VOLE protocol to reduce offline overhead for generating VOLE tuples. Then, we design a batched private membership test protocol from pre-computed VOLE to accelerate the online computation. Experiments demonstrate that VCR outperforms prior art. Compared to state-of-the-art work, we reduce the total communication costs (resp. running time) by 341× and 9.1× (resp. 6.5× and 2.5×) on average for OT and FHE-based protocols."

In high-density traffic environments, Road Side Units (RSUs) often suffer from heavy loads, which limits their responsiveness and accuracy in attack detection. To address this issue, this paper proposes a UAV-assisted intelligent multi-attack detection model. By introducing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as mobile auxiliary nodes, the model dynamically offloads traffic monitoring and data processing tasks from RSUs, thereby alleviating resource bottlenecks. Building on this, a hybrid detection architecture is designed that combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Deep Q-Networks (DQN). The CNN is employed to extract spatiotemporal traffic features, including vehicle port traffic density, node forwarding rate distributions, and identity activity levels, while convolutional filters capture potential abnormal patterns. The DQN further optimizes attack detection through Q-learning-based decision making. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches in detecting diverse types of attack, significantly improving detection accuracy and reducing response latency."

    "abstract": "The escalating allocation of European cohesion funds to small-scale projects exposes a critical methodological gap: existing evaluation frameworks are often too complex or resource-intensive for their effective assessment. This paper proposes an integrated socio-economic evaluation framework that combines design evaluation, economic analysis, and risk management into an accessible Excel<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">©</sup>-based platform tool. Designed for simplicity and adaptability, the tool enables diverse technical analyses without requiring advanced computational resources. The methodology synthesizes these elements into a single tool, deliberately prioritizing practical applicability without sacrificing analytical rigor. The design phase incorporates participatory approaches, developed through stakeholder consultations and theory-of-change workshops, to ensure alignment with local priorities and enhance usability for non-technical users. The economic analysis allows for assessing financial viability. It facilitates robust financial viability assessments and incorporates risk management features that utilize qualitative matrices and scenario modelling to address challenges and uncertainties such as climate variability and market volatility. A case study in Northern Portugal, focusing on vineyard restructuring, demonstrates the tool’s capacity to support decision-making processes, which illustrates the tool's capacity to support transparent decision-making, evaluate trade-offs, and prioritize interventions. The key contribution of this research is a validated framework that democratizes sophisticated analysis for resource-constrained settings. It has a clear theoretical implication for participatory evaluation models and practical implications for policymakers and managing authorities, highlighting its scalability and potential for integration into regional cohesion policy. The study also discusses limitations and pathways for future adaptation to other socio-economic contexts."

This paper proposes an innovative hairpin winding that splits two top conductors into four flat strands.

In conventional delivery models, vehicle speed is often constrained by urban speed regulations and the difficulty of locating available parking spaces. Unlike previous studies that focus on trucks collaborating with a single type of auxiliary vehicle, this paper explores a multivehicle approach by integrating a truck with two distinct types of delivery vehicles—a drone and a robot—and determining the most suitable deployment scenario for each. To address this problem, a heuristic algorithm is proposed to solve the Multiple Area and Multiple Vehicle Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP-MAMV). Experimental results show that deploying robots for deliveries in high-density urban areas can significantly enhance efficiency, while in lower- density regions, drones outperform robots in executing last- mile deliveries."

While UAV and UGV each offer strengths in coverage and mobility, relying on a single platform often leads to incomplete and inefficient map generation. This study proposes a cooperative path planning framework that integrates UAV and UGV to optimize exploration efficiency and maximize spatial coverage. The proposed method considers the complementary sensing and mobility characteristics of each platform to enhance data collection efficiency while ensuring comprehensive site coverage. Compared to the conventional operator-guided approach, the proposed method achieved a 20% reduction in total exploration distance and a 35% reduction in exploration time. Despite a 23% decrease in point density, the resulting point cloud successfully preserved critical structural and ground-level details with sufficient accuracy. This research presents a practical and scalable approach to data acquisition for digital twin construction in large-scale and complex construction sites."

    "abstract": "Computing-in-memory (CIM) macros based on static random access memory (SRAM) are meant to increase capacity while improving energy efficiency and reducing computing latency. However, traditional analog designs still face several key challenges, including long computing latency from separated computing phases, negative voltage fluctuations from massive parallel computing, and low bitcell density from additional transistors and capacitors for multiplication. On the other hand, only time-aligned inputs are supported in the works. To overcome the above challenges, this work proposes a buffer-free 7T-SRAM charge-domain CIM macro. It has four key features: 1) a compact 7T SRAM bitcell structure for high-energy efficiency; 2) a configurable input unit to support different sizes of input activations; 3) a time-row division (RD) strategy to support real-time processing and alleviate negative voltage fluctuations; and 4) a merging timing to conceal the input phase for high throughput. The fabricated 512-Kb SRAM-CIM macro in 40 nm achieves 79.3–290.4 Tops/W at 4-bit precision."

    "abstract": "In this paper, we study the challenging task of Few-Shot Video Domain Adaptation (FSVDA). The multimodal nature of videos introduces unique challenges, necessitating the simultaneous consideration of both domain alignment and modality collaboration in a few-shot scenario, which is ignored in previous literature. We observe that, under the influence of domain shift, the generalization performance on the target domain of each individual modality, as well as that of fused multimodal features, is constrained. Because each modality is comprised of coupled features with multiple components that exhibit different domain shifts. This variability increases the complexity of domain adaptation, thereby reducing the effectiveness of multimodal feature integration. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel framework of Modality-Collaborative Low Rank Decomposers (MC-LRD) to decompose modality-unique and modality-shared features with different domain shift levels from each modality that are more friendly for domain alignment. The MC-LRD comprises multiple decomposers for each modality and Multimodal Decomposition Routers (MDR). Each decomposer has progressively shared parameters across different modalities. The MDR is leveraged to selectively activate the decomposers to produce modality-unique and modality-shared features. To ensure efficient decomposition, we apply orthogonal decorrelation constraints separately to decomposers and sub routers, enhancing their diversity. Furthermore, we propose a cross-domain activation consistency loss to guarantee that target and source samples of the same category exhibit consistent activation preferences of the decomposers, thereby facilitating domain alignment. Extensive experimental results on three public benchmarks demonstrate that our model achieves significant improvements over existing methods."

To address this challenge, this article proposes a comprehensive mathematical formulation for the O2O-SMD problem. This formulation integrates complex operational requirements, such as dish variety, pricing, nutritional balance, and profitability, into a unified optimization problem with well-defined objective and constraints. To efficiently solve the O2O-SMD problem, we propose a tensor-based ant colony optimization (TACO) algorithm. Distinct from traditional ant colony optimization (ACO) variants, the core of TACO lies in reformulating the fundamental ACO operations into a tensor computational structure, enabling parallel optimization over O2O-SMD tasks at the algorithmic level. Furthermore, a dedicated local search strategy is integrated to refine solutions and accelerate convergence of the algorithm. The performance of TACO is evaluated on real-world restaurant data and benchmark instances. The experimental results show that TACO significantly outperforms a wide range of comparison algorithms in terms of solution quality, scalability, and computational efficiency, confirming its effectiveness and practical value for real-world O2O-SMD problems."

A significant challenge to classification performance arises from previously unknown attack traffic within traffic classification systems. In this paper, we propose a novel Network Flow Detection via Traffic Relationship Graphs with statistical feature embedding (NFD-TRG), which can address this challenge by combining the accurate characterization of data features and the utilization of graph neural networks. The proposed detection model can identify intrusive data traffic and accurately distinguish the categories of attack traffic flows. This method introduces a traffic relationship graph to represent the relationships between all traffic flows and designs an attack traffic detection method based on this graph representation using graph neural networks. Experimental validation of real-world traffic data confirms the effectiveness of the proposed approach. When real-time traffic detection with minimal data volume is needed, this approach exhibits shorter running time and superior classification performance compared to other state-of-the-art methods. NFD-TRG can achieve millisecond-level detection in real network flow data validation, and the detection accuracy for single-category attacks can reach 98.56%, 99.92%, and 98.89% in the CICDDOS-2019, MQTT, and CICIoT2023 datasets."

Experiments on real geographic coordinate data compare Graph Convolutional Network and Graph Attention Network feature extractors with respect to coverage rate, normalized delay, and energy cost. The SAC-Transformer achieves an average coverage of 99.8%, improving over SAC-GAT, SAC, and SAC-GCN by 5.83%, 14.45%, and 15.64%, respectively. Its average delay is reduced by 39.43%, 47.80%, and 32.56% relative to SAC-GAT, SAC, and SAC-GCN, respectively.

By distinguishing node types (e.g., contractors, investors) and tie strengths (e.g., strong vs. weak collaboration), the analysis uncovers statistically significant triadic motifs that reveal structural dominance and evolutionary features. Using a longitudinal, <bold xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">multi</b>-project dataset (2014–2021) and degree-preserving randomized network benchmarks, the study ensures robust identification of overrepresented local structures. Key findings show that (1) in terms of heterogeneous-node local relationship patterns, construction contractors emerge as dominant players, with fully connected triads and structural hole triads wherein dyads are different types of organizations identified as motifs; (2) concerning heterogeneous-edge patterns, even though weak-tie subgraphs form the basic path of the networks, stable strong-tie subgraphs, representing collaboration alliances, become increasingly prevalent among organizations. This study contributes in three key ways. First, it advances project network analysis by shifting the analytical lens from macro-level structures to micro-relational patterns, enabling the identification of recurrent subgraph configurations among PPP actors. Second, it operationalizes colored motif detection to empirically capture both node- and edge-level heterogeneity in PPP networks. Third, it offers new theoretical and practical insights into the evolution of collaboration structures, showing how motifs such as structural holes reflect underlying governance logics."

It innovatively utilizes existing sensor data as conditional input to generate cross-physical quantity data, which both alleviates the data scarcity problem and preserves the natural correlations between different data types. For privacy protection, FCG combines the Memory-Augmented Autoencoder with a federated learning framework, achieving distributed collaborative training where 'models move instead of data,' while simultaneously meeting the requirements of continuous verification under the zero-trust security model. Extensive experiments on authoritative datasets demonstrate that FCG significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of false alarm rate and authentication accuracy.

    "abstract": "Low utilization of monthly parking subscriptions among urban residents poses a significant challenge in urban parking revenue management. This issue not only results in substantial waste of parking space resources but also leads to considerable potential revenue loss for parking lot operators. To address these challenges, we propose a novel monthcard-sharing service aimed at enhancing parking space utilization and increasing operator revenue. Under this service, multiple users with non-overlapping parking hours are allowed to share a single monthly parking subscription, enjoying discounted prices compared to individual subscriptions. We formulate the problem as a mixed-integer programming model based on users’parking behaviors (i.e., parking patterns), with the objective of maximizing the total revenue of the parking lot operator. The model captures two key decision types: (i) parking product design, and (ii) user sharing and product selection. A series of numerical experiments based on real-world datasets from a parking company demonstrate that the monthcard-sharing service improves resource utilization by up to 60% and increases total revenue by 40% compared to the existing strategy."

It consists of a two-step procedure: clean the User-Permission Assignment matrix (UPA) using a clustering and statistical analysis, then build an RBAC state using a regular role mining algorithm.The proposed approach yields an average of 90% in privilege creep detection accuracy and over 95% privilege creep correction, evaluated on synthetically made datasets.

    "abstract": "Homomorphic encryption (HE) is one of the leading cryptographic approaches for enabling secure outsourced computation. In untrusted computational environments, HE serves as a crucial tool for preserving data privacy. However, performing complex operations such as matrix multiplication in deep learning inference under HE remains a significant challenge.In this paper, we propose two enhancements to the state-of-the-art ciphertext matrix multiplication scheme based on bicyclic encoding. Firstly, we introduce the Seg-Hoisting algorithm, which enables simultaneous rotation of multiple ciphertexts while significantly reducing the key size. Secondly, we apply the lazy reduction strategy during ciphertext multiplication, where modulus reduction operations are deferred until after multiple multiplications are completed, thereby reducing the number of modulus reduction operations. Furthermore, we generalize existing schemes to enhance their applicability across diverse matrix dimensions and application scenarios. Through comprehensive experimental evaluation, we demonstrate that our proposed improvements yield a significant performance gain, achieving speedups ranging from 2.7× to 4.6× compared to the existing approach."

    "abstract": "Supply chain risks (SCR) are major impediments in the pharmaceutical sector that have negative impacts on operational effectiveness, financial performance, and customer satisfaction. The significance of supply chain risk management (SCRM) in mitigating the negative impacts of SCR and improving organisational effectiveness is widely accepted. Though its crucial role is undisputed, its moderating effect on the relationship between SCR and organisational performance has not been widely researched in the pharmaceutical business in general and in the context of Ghana. With this study, these gaps are bridged through an empirical investigation of those interactions. Data collection involved 250 pharmaceutical supply professionals in Ghana. Measures for SCR, SCRM, and firm performance were adapted from validated scales. Organisational performance was assessed through key performance indicators that included perfect order rate, supply chain cost ratio, order fill rate, order-to-cash cycle time, and inventory-to-sales ratio. The analysis indicates that SCR has a significant impact on reducing organisational performance, highlighting the devastating impacts of supply disruptions in supply chains. Moreover, SCRM has a significant moderating effect on the negative relationship between SCR and organisational performance. Organisations that embraced extensive SCRM best practices proved able to restore performance levels to high levels. The study concludes that SCRM is a key driver for resilience and efficiency in pharmaceutical supply chains. Additionally, investments in risk prevention and capacity building for improved effectiveness of SCRM in resource-constrained environments in Ghana are recommended."

The simulated curve shows good consistency with measured data, while models neglecting frequency dependence, long-distance mutual inductance, or capacitance have larger deviations. Simulations of three typical faults: inter-turn short circuits induce mid-to-high frequency resonance shifts, false peaks, and symmetric characteristics; radial deformation causes slight mid-to-high frequency shifts; inter-cake spacing changes affect the 200-500 kHz range. The model lacks iron core magnetization consideration, losing the first pair of resonance peaks/valleys. It provides a more accurate simulation tool for FRA-based fault diagnosis."

LLMs exhibit strong contextual reasoning and adaptability, making them well suited to extracting software mentions from heterogeneous academic texts. In this paper, we evaluate several LLM-based approaches using three gold-standard corpora, comparing prompting strategies and configurations against established baselines. Our contributions are threefold: (1) we provide the first systematic evaluation of LLMs for software mention extraction, (2) we analyse their strengths and weaknesses relative to prior techniques, and (3) we discuss implications for reproducibility and open science. Results show that LLMs significantly improve extraction accuracy and adaptability, advancing efforts to integrate software into the scholarly record."

While these forums regularly come under the focus of criminal prosecution, often leading to platform shutdowns and the conviction of operators, successors emerge quickly. In this paper, we present a study of the underground forum BreachForums. BreachForums served as the successor to the popular RaidForums, survived several forum takedowns, and remained operational until June 2025. We perform the first public analysis of the leaked BreachForums database from 2022, and enrich our results with scraped data from the latest successor. This enables us to conduct a longitudinal study on the factors contributing to the forum’s resilience.We find that the operational security of forum users, particularly Key Users selling products and services, is generally strong, making their identification challenging. However, some users involved in data leak exchanges exhibit weak operational security, which may potentially allow law enforcement to track them. Moreover, our analysis reveals that takedown efforts have a limited impact on the availability of illegal data, as externally hosted leaks remain accessible and get reposted on successor platforms. We argue that law enforcement’s current focus on arresting forum operators seems insufficient, as new platforms continue to emerge."

    "abstract": "Time series anomaly detection holds significant importance in fields such as industrial systems and network security. However, multivariate time series often exhibit complex dependencies and multi-scale patterns, posing challenges for high-precision anomaly detection. Simultaneously, practical deployment in edge industrial systems demands models that are efficient and lightweight. Existing deep learning models suffer from large parameter sizes and prolonged training times, making them difficult to meet these requirements. To address this, this paper proposes a lightweight anomaly detection model featuring a dual-branch design. By integrating edge convolution, dilated convolution, and a single-layer Informer, we construct an efficient lightweight detection model. Experiments conducted on six benchmark datasets (MSL, SMD, SWaT, WADI, etc.) demonstrate that compared to baseline experiments, our method achieves an average F1-score improvement of 10.4%. Furthermore, it outperforms the state-of-the-art lightweight network DTAAD by an average of 2% in F1-score. Compared to the baseline models, our method reduces the average training and inference time by over 90%. It also achieves a 16% reduction in training time compared to the lightweight model TranAD. The proposed method provides a novel and efficient solution for anomaly detection in industrial scenarios, enabling accurate detection of anomalies on resource-constrained industrial edge systems or endpoints."

While traditional ELK stacks facilitate centralized log storage and retrieval, they exhibit significant bottlenecks in complex causal reasoning and dynamic format adaptation. To address these limitations, this paper proposes an intelligent log knowledge base construction method based on a \"data classification-hierarchization-graphization\" pipeline. Specifically, we design an ELK-Neo4j streaming fusion architecture, a dynamic ontology-driven semantic enhancement mechanism, and a sensitivity-aware hierarchical graph governance model. The system achieves millisecond-level bidirectional synchronization between Elasticsearch and Neo4j through Kafka Connect. Incorporated with template drift detection and relationship weight learning, it enables online ontology evolution and adaptive expansion. For compliance, sensitive fields are identified via regular expressions and NLP, while RBAC+ABAC mechanisms are introduced to achieve triple-level access control. Experiments on HDFS, BGL, and custom security log datasets show that our method significantly outperforms static ontology and batch processing schemes in template extraction F1-score, field recall, graph query latency, synchronization delay, and root cause localization efficiency. The proposed framework can be widely applied in finance, healthcare, and cloud-native scenarios, effectively improving fault diagnosis efficiency and data governance accuracy."

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a privacy-preserving alternative to traditional machine learning, enabling collaborative model training without centralizing users’ data. While this decentralized approach enhances privacy, it introduces new trust assumptions. Specifically, that users honestly participate in the protocol. Simultaneously, the growing emphasis on fairness in machine learning has led to the development of fairness-aware FL schemes, which aim to ensure equitable model performance across diverse user groups. However, existing solutions for fair FL schemes rely on users truthfully reporting fairness-related metrics. This trust assumption opens the door to malicious behavior: users may manipulate these statistics to influence the global model, degrading its fairness, and/or its overall accuracy. Current frameworks lack mechanisms to detect or prevent such adversarial manipulation. This paper addresses this critical gap through two main contributions. First, as an example to illustrate our point, we empirically demonstrate the vulnerability of a representative fairness-aware FL framework to targeted attacks that exploit unverified fairness computations. Second, and most importantly, we propose a novel scheme (that can be integrated into existing fair FL schemes) that augments fairness-aware FL with verifiability. Our solution enables the detection of dishonest participants without compromising user privacy, thus strengthening the robustness of fairness-aware FL schemes."

Dissimilar flows can be distinguished with a small number of packets, while similar flows require more packets. The existing early classification methods use the same number of packets to classify all flows, which leads to many flows cannot be classified early. In this paper, we propose a method to classify TLS flows by concatenation of multiple models. For flows that fail to be classified, a larger number of packets are used to classify them in the subsequent models in turn until they are successfully classified. Compared with existing methods that rely on unstable features such as time series, the proposed method can accurately classify flows by features that are easy to extract and maintain stable values. Experiments show that the proposed framework has the highest classification efficiency and accuracy compared with three baseline methods, including a state-of-the-art early classification method."

However, systematic detection of IDOR in the wild, especially within hospital mini-programs, remains underexplored due to restricted server access and stringent ethical regulations. To address this challenge, we propose a black–box detection framework designed for hospital mini-programs operating in sensitive data environments. Our framework introduces a novel token–substitution probing strategy that adheres to ethical standards and pioneers the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated IDOR vulnerability detection in API endpoints, enabling token field identification, request classification and differential response analysis. We evaluated the framework on 80 real-world mini-programs and identified 114 vulnerable endpoints across 38 applications. Among these, 55 involved sensitive data disclosure, and 34 enabled unauthorized execution of sensitive operations. All findings were responsibly disclosed to the CNVD, and 15 cases have been officially confirmed."

    "abstract": "Cyber insider threats represent one of the most complex and insidious challenges to modern cybersecurity, as they originate from legitimate users whose behaviors may turn malicious over time. Traditional approaches often fail due to their reliance on static risk indicators, necessitating dynamic modeling of human behavior to capture evolving risks. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for detecting insider threats by continuously and dynamically inferring personality-based risk indicators from employees’ writing data using a publicly accessible large language model (Meta AI’s Llama-3.2). These indicators are modeled as time series and processed through AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models to forecast behavioral deviations. Predicted anomalies are subsequently classified using a hybrid ensemble combining Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Random Forest (RF) to distinguish benign variations from genuine insider threats. Our framework identifies behavioral anomalies, provides interpretable detection windows, and achieves the following results on CMU-CERT datasets (r4.2/r5.2): recall (90.0%/86.0%), precision (92.6%/87.7%), ROC-AUC (94.7%/92.6%), MSE (0.231/0.304), MTTD (21.3 days/31.72 days) and a median latency under 230 ms for real-time operation. These results demonstrate significant improvements over baseline static approaches in both detection accuracy and temporal prediction capability. This work advances human-centric and proactive insider threat detection by integrating personality-based risk indicators with predictive modeling, providing a scalable and interpretable solution for real-time dynamic risk assessment in enterprise environments."

It provides the basis for measuring and improving environment-related performance. This paper introduces a practical, three-phase framework for integrating KPIs into manufacturing systems that supports the CE and maintains economic viability.

However, the complexity and exertion of malware reverse engineering, particularly for ransomware, have posed significant challenges to experts in the field. In response, this study explores the feasibility of incorporating deep learning techniques to assist the ransomware reverse engineering (RE). To tackle specific challenges of encryption loop recognition, our approach employs two learning strategies. Firstly, we develop code-obfuscation-resilient and encryption-algorithm-agnostic features, including K-complexity and operations that yield equiprobable outputs. Secondly, we carefully select a neural network architecture capable of extracting informative features. The evaluation of our toolchain shows that our toolchain achieves an accuracy of 99% on the test set. Our method exhibits strong generalization capabilities, as it successfully handled common code obfuscation schemes, proprietary and unknown ciphers. When applied to real-world ransomware samples such as WannaCry, Conti, Lockbit, and TeslaCryt, our toolchain effectively identified 205 encryption loops with a low false positive rate of 6.8%. These findings validate the effectiveness of our approach in automatically recognizing encryption code during ransomware reverse engineering."

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL), as an emerging distributed machine learning paradigm, aims to achieve collaborative training of a global model without sharing clients’ local data, thereby addressing user privacy and data silo issues. However, due to the distributed architecture of FL and the invisibility of local training, it is highly susceptible to poisoning attacks. While numerous poisoning defense methods have been proposed, they often suffer from limited defense effectiveness and overly strong security assumptions. To address this problem, we propose FedTPD, a dual gradient evaluation-based defense method against poisoning attacks in FL. Specifically, we first design an adaptive representative gradient selection mechanism, which involves adaptively clustering local gradients and selecting representative gradients from different clusters. Secondly, we propose a client-assisted model evaluation mechanism, wherein a reliable client is selected as an evaluator to assess the representative gradients from various clusters. Finally, we develop a bias-corrected model aggregation mechanism that aggregates the local gradients of each cluster based on the trust scores of their representative gradients, thereby reducing the impact of poisoning attacks on the global model. Experimental results on three typical datasets demonstrate that the proposed FedTPD can effectively resist various poisoning attacks. In particular, compared with state-of-the-art methods, the global model’s maximum and average accuracies on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets are improved by 2.79%–28.15% and 0.79%–31.34%, and 3.48%–22.18% and 2.56%–22.06%, respectively."

    "abstract": "Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) reports provide valuable insights into cyber threats. However, manually constructing attack graphs from the unstructured CTI reports requires significant human effort. With the development of Large Language Models (LLMs), researchers have begun to harness LLMs for attack graph construction from CTI reports. Nevertheless, existing works mainly focus on describing abstract and high-level attack behaviors through these graphs, which cannot be used as query graphs for threat detection based on graph matching, as provenance graphs are at the system level. Moreover, these works do not consider modeling cross-host attack behaviors. To address these problems, we propose a novel method for automatically constructing attack graphs from CTI reports. We utilize prompt engineering, and leverage the in-context learning ability of LLMs to generate attack graphs. In this method, we first restructure the CTI report by grouping continuous sentences with the same tactics, and then use multiple LLMs to extract entities and relations. Finally, we use an LLM to integrate all the results. We also design a cross-host threat detection algorithm using the generated attack graphs. The evaluation results show that our method constructs attack graphs with an average conversion rate of 72.4%. It also achieves nearly 94.8% precision and 96.5% recall for IoC and relation extraction compared with manually labeled results."

Field-based observations are limited in space and time, making it challenging to track seasonal and internal changes. This study presents an innovative hybrid probabilistic framework for assessing soil salinity using multi-source satellite and climate data. A quasi-temporal dataset for 2020 to 2025 was created from Sentinel-2 surface reflectance, ERA5-Land hydroclimatic variables, terrain features, and distance to water. A physically interpretable feature set was developed using spectral indices, soil moisture gradients, aridity indicators, water balance metrics, and combined spectral and climatic interactions. Soil conditions were classified into three regimes (NORMA, SALINE, SAND) using a unified decision scheme based on NDVI, NDMI, and BSI. The hybrid model estimates the probability of transitions between soil regimes across years and regions. Its performance was tested using stratified and group cross-validation, temporal hold-out (2020 to 2023 for training and 2024 to 2025 for testing), and strict external validation based on independent AOI sites. The model achieved stable results with an Accuracy of about 0.97, Macro-F1 of about 0.97, and ROC AUC above 0.97. The proposed approach provides an AI-driven, interpretable, and scalable solution for monitoring soil salinity and supporting land and water management."

    "abstract": "The advent of quantum computing poses a threat to the security of traditional encryption algorithms. This has motivated the development of post-quantum cryptography (PQC). In 2024, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) standardized several PQC algorithms, marking an important milestone in the transition toward quantum-resistant security. Blockchain systems fundamentally rely on cryptographic primitives to guarantee data integrity and transaction authenticity. However, widely used algorithms such as ECDSA, employed in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other networks, are vulnerable to quantum attacks. Although adopting PQC is essential for long-term security, its computational overhead in blockchain environments remains largely unexplored. In this work, we propose a methodology for benchmarking both PQC and traditional cryptographic algorithms in blockchain contexts. We measure signature generation and verification times across diverse computational environments and simulate their impact at scale. Our evaluation focuses on PQC digital signature schemes (ML-DSA, Dilithium, Falcon, Mayo, SLH-DSA, SPHINCS+, and Cross) across security levels 1 to 5, comparing them to ECDSA, the current standard in Bitcoin and Ethereum. Our results indicate that PQC algorithms introduce only minor performance overhead at security level 1, while in some scenarios they significantly outperform ECDSA at higher security levels. For instance, ML-DSA achieves a verification time of 0.14 ms on an ARM-based laptop at level 5, compared to 0.88 ms for ECDSA. We also provide an open-source implementation to ensure reproducibility and to encourage further research."

This study aims to design and implement a monocular vision measurement device to address the technical challenges of achieving real-time and accurate target recognition and measurement in resourceconstrained environments, thereby meeting the application requirements for low power consumption and strong environmental adaptability in industrial settings. This research utilizes the STM32F103C8T6 microcontroller as the core controller to construct a hardware platform comprising a machine vision module, a power supply current measurement circuit, and a 7-inch serial HMI display. Based on the principle of monocular vision ranging and incorporating a digital recognition algorithm, the system calculates the target’s distance and geometric dimensions. Furthermore, the device integrates a current measurement circuit for real-time power consumption monitoring and delivers the visual output of measurement results via the serial display. Test results demonstrate that the device can effectively identify specific targets, achieving an average error rate of less than 5% for both distance and side length measurements, while maintaining overall power consumption at a low level. This validates the feasibility and reliability of the device design.

While DRL excels in high-dimensional state spaces and long-term planning, unexpected safety violations pose catastrophic risks. This work introduces a novel safety-aware DRL framework that integrates formal reachability analysis into the training pipeline. Our approach features two innovations: 1) a pre-trained reachability analysis module quantifying runtime safety risks through reachable state set computation, and 2) dynamic safety constraints enabling real-time policy adaptation. By embedding safety verification into the optimization loop, our method systematically balances exploration efficiency with risk mitigation. Empirical validation in autonomous driving scenarios demonstrates superior safety performance compared to conventional DRL methods, achieving significant collision avoidance while maintaining competitive efficiency. This framework bridges formal verification and DRL, providing a safety-aware solution for safety-critical systems. Future work will focus on computational efficiency optimization in dense obstacle environments."

We trained and tested various detection tools against different types of adversarial attack that have been developed in recent years. Previous studies have used the equal error rate to evaluate the effectiveness of a given attack. As it is important to determine whether an attack is effective at tricking the detector into classifying spoofs as bona-fide or vice versa, we used various evaluation metrics to perform a more in-depth analysis. We investigated three adversarial attacks: FGSM, PGDL2 and Malafide. Furthermore, we created an adaptive version of Malafide with filter sizes that change depending on the success of a given attack. The detection models used were LCNN, SpecRNet, RawNet3 and an SSL-based detector consisting of a combination of Wav2Vec2 and AASIST. This selection provides a broad range of detector structures. All detectors were affected by FGSM and PGDL2 in the white box setting; LCNN and SpecRNet the most. Malafide led to a deterioration in white and black box settings, fooling LCNN and SpecRNet into classifying spoofs as bona-fide. Conversely, RawNet3 and Wav2Vec2+AASIST were tricked by Malafide into classifying bona-fide samples as spoofs, resulting in a high number of false alarms while still correctly identifying spoofs. Both models were affected by the filter size; higher-quality degradation in the samples led to worse results, with Wav2Vec2+AASIST being more affected than RawNet3. Through adaptive adversarial training, the detectors partially improved their performance while maintaining their performance on the original data."

This method utilizes SOGIs as harmonic observers to real-time extract real periodic harmonic components from the motor current feedback, which are injected into the FORC as input, thereby decoupling harmonic suppression from fundamental control and eliminating transient interference at the source. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed strategy effectively maintains the superior steady-state accuracy of conventional FORC while significantly enhancing the system’s dynamic response speed and harmonic suppression stability."

However, the allocation ratio of these factors in the cost function is a crucial link that determines the quality of the path. Existing attribute weight allocation methods mainly rely on subjective assignment, and the cost function takes into account relatively few attribute factors. Therefore, this paper first identifies typical samples for attribute decision-making based on prior environmental information, then establishes a preferenceoriented attribute decision table, and performs operations such as positive transformation and dimensionless processing on the decision table. To avoid contradictions in attribute decisionmaking caused by subjective factors, a consistency check is conducted on the dominance relation decision system. Based on the upper and lower approximation sets, the importance among attribute subsets is determined, and finally, a set of attribute weights with different attribute preferences is obtained. The attribute weights (with specific preferences) determined by the dominance relation rough set are combined with the ant colony algorithm to conduct 3D path planning simulations, which verify the effectiveness of this attribute weight determination method."

Existing stateful defenses primarily detect such attacks by analyzing query similarities or distribution anomalies. However, these methods are less effective in the malware domain, where discrete feature spaces and strict functional constraints combine with their reliance on only a single similarity or distribution metric, making it difficult to capture the varied patterns of query-based attacks. In this paper, we introduce MalShield, a stateful defense model that monitors the query stream through an adaptive sliding window, which adjusts its span according to the incoming query rate to preserve relevant context and enable real-time computation of multiple anomaly indicators. We design multiple complementary anomaly indicators, such as similarity decay and feature growth, to capture both temporal patterns and deviations in feature space, enabling more sensitive detection of query attacks. The K-of-N voting rule alerts only when enough indicators agree, cutting false positives and adapting to varied query attacks, thus providing robust, interpretable defense without changing the classifier. Experiments on Androzoo and Drebin datasets, against eight black-box query attacks, show MalShield achieves more than 96% reduction in evasion rates, surpassing existing stateful defenses and at best outperforms existing defense models by 100%."

    "abstract": "Metal Additive Manufacturing is increasingly used in heavy industry for fabricating large-scale structural components by sequentially layering metal material based on digital 3D models. However, deviations in process parameters can cause significant material and operational losses. To address these challenges, a two-stage additive manufacturing strategy is proposed, integrating an initial standardized production phase followed by targeted customizations using Wire Arc Additive Manufacturing, specifically Tungsten Inert Gas welding. Despite WAAM’s advantages like stable arcs and high thermal efficiency, real-time melt depth control is complicated by arc illumination, electromagnetic interference, and elevated temperatures. This paper introduces a digital twin framework integrating geometric reconstruction via Neural Radiance Fields with analytical temperature-field modeling, enabling accurate melt pool depth prediction and immediate process parameter adjustments. Experimental evaluations yielded a NeRF reconstruction SSIM of 93.80% and a PSNR of 36.09 dB, achieving 95.31% accuracy in weld penetration prediction during welding process. The developed approach presents a rapid, precise, and cost-effective solution, significantly enhancing the manufacturing adaptability and quality assurance of large-scale structural components in heavy industry applications."

    "abstract": "Traditional bounded-based security models are difficult to cope with the challenges brought by dynamic cloud, microservices, and remote working environments. Although Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) emphasizes \"never trust, always verify\", existing Policy Enforcement Point (PEP) deployments usually lack defense in depth and real-time health status assessment. To overcome these shortcomings, we propose RecZTA, a reputation-driven dual-layer PEP architecture under a unified control plane. The first layer is the service proxy, which is responsible for filtering and forwarding the initial traffic. The second layer is the resource access gateway, which is responsible for secondary security verification and service access authorization. RecZTA uses a multi-dimensional reputation model to realize real-time monitoring of service agents and rapid intrusion perception. Simulation results show that RecZTA can detect agent intrusion earlier than the existing zero trust models (device gateway model, resource portal model and enclave model), while maintaining low latency and low resource consumption, which verifies the feasibility and robustness of RecZTA in complex environments."

    "abstract": "For parallel converters, circulating currents can be generally classified into high-frequency and low-frequency components. High-frequency circulating current (HFCC) are mainly attributed to carrier asynchronization, while lowfrequency circulating current (LFCC) typically results from zerosequence voltage mismatches between converters. This paper proposes a collaborative control strategy aimed at suppressing both HFCC and LFCC. Initially, the underlying mechanism of HFCC due to carrier asynchrony is analyzed in detail. Building on this understanding, a method is introduced, which uses the HFCC information to dynamically adjust the carrier frequency, eliminating phase discrepancies and realize carrier synchronization. For the suppression of LFCC, this method involves adjusting the dwell time of zero vectors to minimize the zero-sequence voltage difference among parallel converters. Ultimately, both compensators are integrated into a unified collaborative control framework. The experimental results obtained from relevant tests confirm that the proposed method can effectively reduce both HFCC and LFCC and improve the overall operation efficiency of the system."

    "abstract": "Metal particle contamination is a critical factor killing the security of DC insulation system. The movement process of metal particle becomes complicated under DC voltages due to the existence of accumulated charges on insulator surface. In order to obtain the correlation between the surface charges and metal particle behavior, a metal particle movement simulation model is established. The metal particle lifting voltage is both measured experimentally and calculated by simulation, and the little difference demonstrates the effectiveness of the simulation model. Then the effects of surface charges on a truncated insulation with different polarities on the metal particle motion characteristics are investigated. The influence mechanism of surface charges on particle movement is revealed. The results show that the homo-charges increase the electric field near the grounded electrode. After colliding with electrode near high-field region, metal particle carries more charges, leading to a reduction in the lifting voltage. However, when the amounts of homo-charges reach a certain level, metal particle tends to move towards the insulator. Conversely, hetero-charges increase the particle lifting voltage and enable it to move away from the insulator. Besides, the electrode roughness changes the random reflection angle of the metal particle after colliding, making the motion characteristics of metal particle more complicated. We hope this study could deepen the understandings of interaction between surface charges and metal particle movement."

However, challenges remain in achieving sensors that balance high sensitivity, mechanical flexibility, and durability under dynamic deformations and environmental stressors like washing and humidity. Existing materials often suffer from limitations in conductivity, mechanical flexibility, and long-term stability. This study introduces a novel hybrid composite sensor composed of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and nickel (Ni) coatings on spandex-cotton (CoSP) yarn, encapsulated in polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). The synergistic combination of rGO and Ni significantly enhances the sensor’s mechanical strength, electrical conductivity, and strain sensitivity. The PDMS coating further ensures long-term durability, protecting the conductive network from oxidation and degradation. The rGO–Ni–CoSP/PDMS composite exhibits a tensile strength of 534 MPa and an elongation at break of 595%. The sensor shows excellent piezoresistive behavior with a gauge factor of -6.11 at 100% strain and maintains over 90% of its initial conductivity after 50 wash cycles. Additionally, the sensor demonstrates stable, repeatable resistance changes after 15,000 stretching cycles, with negligible hysteresis, confirming its high reliability and durability. This research presents a significant advancement in wearable strain sensors, offering a robust, sensitive, and environmentally stable solution. The sensor’s ability to monitor physiological activities such as respiration, pulse, and muscle movements highlights its potential for applications in healthcare, wearable robotics, and personalized health monitoring. Additionally, a mathematical model was established and experimentally validated, providing predictive insight into the strain-dependent resistance behavior of the hybrid yarn sensor."

To answer these questions, we examine the evolution of SameSite in some popular websites. Our observations reveal inconsistent default policies across browsers that lead to divergent behavior. In addition, we demonstrate that relying solely on SameSite is insufficient to defend against CSRF attacks, while using the anti-CSRF token introduces a 300% overhead. We also clarify the scope against XS-Leaks. To assess developer awareness, we surveyed 92 website developers and found significant knowledge gaps in SameSite configuration. Therefore, we propose a unified guideline for developers, offering context-aware security recommendations by mapping cookie categories to specific website functionalities. We validate the guideline through experiments on real-world websites, a custom-built test site, and developer interviews. Results demonstrate improvements in both security and efficiency."

To address this issue, we introduce ReviewGuard, an automated system for detecting and categorizing deficient reviews through a four-stage LLM-driven framework: data collection from ICLR and NeurIPS on OpenReview, GPT-4.1 annotation with human validation, synthetic data augmentation yielding $\\mathbf{6, 6 3 4}$ papers with 24,657 real and 46,438 synthetic reviews, and fine-tuning of encoderbased models and open-source LLMs. Feature analysis reveals that deficient reviews exhibit lower rating scores, higher self-reported confidence, reduced structural complexity, and more negative sentiment than sufficient reviews. AI-generated text detection shows dramatic increases in AI-authored reviews since ChatGPT’s emergence. Mixed training with synthetic and real data substantially improves detection performance-for example, Qwen 3-8B achieves recall of 0.6653 and F1 of 0.7073, up from 0.5499 and 0.5606 respectively.

To address the issue of ignoring power flow constraints in energy storage configurations, which leads to unreasonable site selection and capacity allocation, this paper develops an optimized microgrid model that couples photovoltaic generation, gas turbine power generation, and hydrogen energy storage systems (electrolyzers/hydrogen storage tanks/fuel cells). The model aims to minimize the annual total operating cost while considering both economic and operational constraints, and utilizes Second-Order Cone Relaxation (SOCR) techniques to solve the nonlinear power flow problem. The performance of three configuration schemes is compared based on a modified IEEE-33 node system. The results show that, under the optimal configuration, line losses are reduced by 3.46% and 2.55% compared to the traditional schemes, and the voltage fluctuation range is decreased by 6.23% and 4.76%. These improvements occur with almost no change in operating costs, significantly enhancing the power quality. The findings verify the effectiveness of the PV-gas turbine-hydrogen energy storage coupled system in improving the economic efficiency and stability of distribution network operations."

    "abstract": "Deep learning libraries such as PyTorch and TensorFlow are essential for building security-critical downstream deep learning applications. Bugs in these libraries compromise their correctness, robustness, and security, thereby undermining the reliability of downstream applications. Unfortunately, effectively detecting bugs in deep learning library remains challenging, as existing approaches often fail to generate effective test cases due to their inability to synthesize complex input constraints that govern deep learning library functions.In this paper, we present DeepLancet, the first approach for effectively detecting deep learning library bugs by leveraging large language models (LLMs) to systematically parse documentation and thereby assist in the generation of high-quality test cases. Our key observation is that mainstream deep learning libraries typically provide comprehensive and well-structured documentation, which contains detailed descriptions of input constraints that we can effectively synthesize and leverage to generate syntactically valid and semantically correct test cases. Specifically, we first synthesize function constraint descriptions from the documentation by leveraging LLMs. We then generate rigorous constraints which are leveraged to generate test cases through an attribution-based approach in Python. Finally, we employ a differential testing approach on CPU and GPU to detect bugs. We build a software prototype for DeepLancet, and our evaluation results demonstrate that DeepLancet is effective in uncovering previously unknown real-world bugs: it successfully uncovers 20 bugs in the latest release of PyTorch, including 7 previously unknown ones. Moreover, we compare DeepLancet with DocTer, a state-of-the-art technique that also leverages documentation for constraint extraction, and the results indicate that DeepLancet can extract more comprehensive constraints, thereby uncovering 3 more bugs that were missed by DocTer."

Existing hierarchical detection frameworks remain constrained by error propagation, weak cross-layer information sharing, and limited discriminative power for highly similar architectures. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-feature adaptive hierarchical framework for fine-grained attribution of AI-generated images. The framework first unifies complementary representations from frequency, noise, color, and semantic domains through a multi-feature extraction module, providing richer cues beyond conventional designs. We then introduces adaptive mechanisms—including dynamic decisionmaking, confidence-weighted fusion, and dual-path classification—that mitigate cascading errors and enable flexible dependency control across layers. Extensive experiments on a large-scale dataset validate the effectiveness of our approach, showing clear improvements over conventional methods and state-of-the-art detectors, particularly in distinguishing confusable GAN variants such as ProGAN, StyleGAN, and StyleGAN2. These results demonstrate the robustness and scalability of the proposed design for reliable AIGC detection and model attribution."

Our approach adapts the State Space Model (SSM) in Mamba to support three-dimensional CT volumes, establishing an effective 3D perception backbone for the UNet architecture. In addition, we incorporate Morphology-Aware Spatial-Channel Attention (MASCA) blocks into the skip connections, where Morphology-Enhanced Spatial Convolution (MESC) augments spatial representations while Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) highlights channel- wise features. This integration effectively leverages the shape-awareness provided by morphological operations, thus improving boundary precision. To further refine segmentation, we introduce a Morphology-Enhanced Decision (MED) layer that sharpens contour boundaries and performs voxel-level classification with high precision. Extensive experiments on SegTHOR and BTCV datasets demonstrate that MEM-UNet surpasses state-of-the-art models, achieving Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) scores of 87.42% and 74.86% for multi-organ segmentation, and 78.94% and 67.70% for esophagus segmentation, respectively.

However, when facing deepfake videos with different compression rates, the effectiveness of certain detection methods will significantly decrease, and they may even be unable to detect compressed videos. To address this challenge, we introduce a new detection mechanism: landmarks inference mechanism. Based on this, we propose a simple and efficient model LDInfer for inferring landmarks to achieve deepfake video detection. Our method utilizes the inference between facial landmarks and their preceding and succeeding frames to improve detection accuracy, which remains effective even in compressed deepfake videos. This method first infers landmarks and verifies their authenticity using the correlation between landmarks in the previous and subsequent frames. Even if the video is compressed, the correlation between facial landmarks in the preceding and following frames remains high. Comparative experiments show that our method outperforms existing methods at various compression rates."

The scalability and adaptability features of cloud computing are efficiently enable resource utilization and continuous data exchange in dynamic and heterogeneous environments. However, the increasing demand for cloud services has raised the energy consumption of cloud data centers, which has a critical environmental impact. Therefore, sustainable resource management tactics have become crucial in today's world. Dynamic Virtual Machine (VM) consolidation is one of the major tactics for sustainable resource management in the green cloud computing environment. Herein, a novel dynamic Energy-Aware Cosine Similarity Learning Network (ECSLN) is proposed to predict the overutilized host. Further, an Impact Factor-Based VM Selection (IFBVMS) method is proposed to select VMs for migration, and an ECSLN-Packed Placement method for VM placement into hosts. The main aim of the proposed VM consolidation is to maximize energy efficiency while preserving compliance with Service Level Agreements (SLAs) for sustainable environments. The experimental evaluation using real-world traces like PlanetLab, Bitbrains, and Alibaba Cluster 2020 workload validates that the proposed VM consolidation methods significantly reduce energy consumption and SLA violation compared to the existing methods for sustainable environments. The evaluation shows that the proposed ECSLN-based consolidation framework enables green cloud infrastructure by intelligently balancing energy consumption, SLA violation, and performance of cloud data centers."

    "abstract": "Magnetoelectric composites can be an attractive solution for wireless power transfer when a combination of small size and low frequency are desired. In this work, we develop an analytical model that accounts for mechanical dynamics, magneto-mechanical coupling, and electromechanical coupling. We validate this model experimentally using a 5-layer, self-biased, ME composite. The model effectively predicts the radiated magnetic field around the magnetoelectric antenna. This model is a valuable tool in the development of a full magnetoelectric wireless power transfer or communication link."

    "abstract": "In modern electronic warfare environments, resource allocation can improve the tracking accuracy and anti-interception capability of radar networks. The main challenge is to coordinate the transmit power of each radar to reduce the Posterior Cramér-Rao lower bound (PCRLB) while ensuring low interception. The problem is difficult to solve due to the non-convex nature of the low interception constraint. Existing methods are mainly divided into heuristic methods and convex relaxation methods (CRM), but they are computationally expensive or have large relaxation losses. We note that real sphere manifolds naturally satisfy the transmit power constraint and the dwell time constraint, while the exact penalty term is suitable for handling the low intercept constraint. Using these properties, we propose an exact penalty manifold optimization (EPMO) framework for power and dwell time allocation. First, the exact penalty term is introduced and the real sphere product manifold (RSPM) is constructed to transform the original problem into an unconstrained problem. Then, we derive a parallel limited Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (PL-BFGS) algorithm to solve the problem. Compared with existing methods, this method has the following advantages: i) the tracking accuracy is improved by 6% compared to SPG; ii) the computation time is reduced by an order of magnitude compared to PSO and by about 40% compared to SPG."

    "abstract": "Radio Access Network (RAN) slicing enables multiple logical networks to exist on top of the same physical infrastructure by allocating resources to distinct service groups, where radio resource scheduling plays a key role in ensuring compliance with slice-specific Service-Level Agreements (SLAs). Existing configuration-based or intent-driven Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches usually rely on static mappings and SLA conversions. The current literature does not integrate natural language understanding with coordinated decision-making. To address these limitations, we propose an Agentic AI framework for 6G RAN slicing, driven by a super agent built using Hierarchical Decision Mamba (HDM) controllers and a Large Language Model (LLM). The super agent interprets operator intents and translates them into actionable goals using the LLM, which are used by HDM to coordinate inter-slice, intra-slice, and self-healing agents. Compared to transformer-based and reward-driven baselines, the proposed Agentic AI framework demonstrates consistent improvements across key performance indicators, including higher throughput, improved cell-edge performance, and reduced latency across different slices."

Additionally, the underdeveloped Australian manufacturing industry requires investing in efficient (Quality Management, QM), innovative (Industry 4.0, I4.0), and sustainable (Industrial Decarbonisation, ID) practices to advance organisational maturity. This study builds on a preliminary investigation of 49 capabilities and examines their relationship with specific practices in the QM-I4.0-ID sphere. It further develops an empirical case study through structured interviews with experts from diverse Australian manufacturing industries to validate the model, highlighting the critical enablers in operational performance and carbon reduction strategies. Findings indicate that QM practices are well established in Australian manufacturing, yet with an intermediate expertise level. Some I4.0 technologies (e.g. additive manufacturing) are occasionally implemented and while there is awareness of the need for ID strategies, these are often perceived as driven by governmental pressures. Finally, it proposes a maturity matrix with 11 dimensions and 3 levels to support decision-makers into the adoption of advanced quality and digital strategies towards decarbonisation."

In this article, a novel parallel-actuation dual-stage nanopositioning strategy (PDNS) is proposed to enhance the high-speed tracking performance by avoiding the inherent issues of series-actuation and improving the current parallel-actuation schemes. First, the issues of current dual-stage nanopositioning schemes in high-speed tracking are analyzed, followed by the conceptual presentation of PDNS. Next, for implementation of PDNS, the mechanical design and modeling of a nanopositioner are demonstrated. To achieve high-speed tracking controls, a complementary filter-based dual-stage controller is developed. Then, the designed parameters are simultaneously optimized by a new integrated mechanical-control codesign method, considering the mechanical and control specifications together. Finally, a series of experiments have been successfully conducted to validate the effectiveness of proposed PDNS. The results indicate that the lumped mass and interference behavior in dual-stage system have been decoupled by 99.09% and 99.33%, respectively. Furthermore, the proposed method improves the tracking accuracy of triangular trajectories by 27.96% at 5 Hz and 42.47% at 100 Hz, compared to series-actuation scheme. All the results uniformly confirm that the proposed PDNS has effectively enhanced the high-speed tracking performance of dual-stage nanopositioning system."

    "abstract": "Drag reduction is of significant interest in the design of marine vehicles. Viscoelastic boundary materials and compliant surfaces, such as those found in dolphin skin, have the potential to reduce frictional drag by delaying the transition from laminar to turbulent flow and minimizing turbulence. To investigate the effect of boundary modulation on turbulence, we developed and tested a novel device that generates wave-like deformations on a flow boundary. This device, enabled by a 5×5 voice coil motor array, was embedded in the wall of a flow channel and overlaid with a flexible membrane in direct contact with the water. The boundary displacement was quantified using a computer vision approach. The deformable membrane system was tested across a range of flow tank speeds and boundary actuation patterns, and the impact on near-boundary velocity was assessed. The resulting data indicate that boundary actuation alters the boundary layer velocity and turbulent stresses both under the region of actuation and in its wake. The effect was most pronounced in regions with boundary layer coherent structures, and certain actuation parameters were consistent with a reduction in frictional drag. A numerical model of the flow tank showed a 10% reduction in average shear stress over the actuated boundary and one actuation wave period, supporting the laboratory experiments and corroborating the findings. This work supports efforts to develop dolphin-inspired methods to reduce near-boundary turbulence and drag, which, if successfully applied in a natural environment, can lead to more energy-efficient platforms and underwater vehicles."

    "abstract": "While generative models for tabular data offer strong capabilities in data synthesis, they also raise serious privacy concerns. Property Proportion Inference Attacks (PPIAs) pose a critical threat by aiming to infer the distribution of sensitive attributes in the training data. Existing approaches often struggle with low efficiency and limited adaptability in high-dimensional tabular settings.In this paper, we propose PPIA-MTL, a novel attack framework based on Multi-Task Learning (MTL) that enables efficient parallel inference of multiple attributes, significantly reducing computational cost. We further extend the framework to support continuous attributes and introduce a unified evaluation metric, CACRS (Continuous Attribute Comprehensive Reasoning Score), which comprehensively assesses inference performance from the perspectives of distributional consistency, numerical error, and more.Experiments on real-world datasets show that PPIA-MTL achieves a minimum MAE of 1.55% on binary attributes and improves inference accuracy for continuous attributes by up to 15.5 over existing methods. As the number of inference tasks increases, training cost is reduced by more than 10×. Finally, we apply PPIA-MTL as a privacy auditing tool and find that some diffusion models exhibit lower inference risk while maintaining high utility, demonstrating promising potential for balancing privacy and utility under the Group-Level Statistical Privacy Risk (GSPR)."

While the transformer-based models offer a strong performance, the concerns about their environmental impact are growing. Before deploying such services, it is essential to evaluate alternative implementation strategies and select the most efficient in terms of both performance and environmental impact. In this study, we propose a practical methodology for assessing the carbon footprint of AI-driven services, which we apply to the specific task of citation verification. We compare two NLP approaches: (1) Fine-tuning a pretrained model for binary classification, and (2) using pretrained sentence embeddings with cosine similarity. Based on real energy measurements from multiple transformerbased models, we estimate both operational energy usage (OPEX) and hardware manufacturing emissions (CAPEX) across key lifecycle stages. We also project long-term impact under realistic deployment scenarios, including shared high-memory servers and lightweight local setups. Our results indicate that although both NLP strategies lead to similar emission levels over time, infrastructure decisions such as hardware configuration and resource reuse still have a major influence. This work offers a replicable framework to support more sustainable integration of AI technologies in DL."

The paper investigates e-tailers' strategic selections between third-party collaboration and vertical integration. By the analyses of game models, the paper obtains three key findings: firstly, compared with outsourcing logistics to third-party provider, self-operated integration logistics can provide consumers with better service and put pressure on the competitors; secondly, both service competition and price competition jointly determine e-tailers' profit and service level. Finally, each e-tailer will implement a self-operated integration logistics strategy in the equilibrium."

Existing detection systems often rely on node-level or graph-level anomaly scoring, making it difficult to capture fine-grained abnormal interactions. This paper proposes EdgeTrace, a context-aware framework for APT detection and traceback based on anomalous edge modeling. The method constructs provenance graphs from audit logs and employs a masked graph autoencoder to learn contextual semantics without requiring attack labels. Suspicious interactions are identified through reconstruction loss and further processed via semantic clustering and causal path inference to reconstruct attack chains. EdgeTrace consists of four key modules: provenance graph modeling, contextual representation learning, semantic deviation inference, and causal path reconstruction. Experiments on open-source datasets including StreamSpot and DARPA Engagement 3 demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches in key metrics such as F1score, AUC, and attack path coverage, showing strong potential for host-level threat detection and interpretable analysis."

Unsubtle treatment on these factors usually lead to high latency, reduced throughput, and inefficient path selection. To address these challenges, we propose several innovations to enhance routing strategy performance. We propose an advanced caching strategy, featuring a lightweight routing cache and a cache preheating module, which can reduce lookup latency and streamline data retrieval. Additionally, we propose a path validation method to ensure the accuracy of routing paths and enable batch query support to handle multiple routing requests simultaneously. For more efficient pathfinding, we propose a algorithm for multi-hop path lookup and success rate tracking, which allows for flexible path selection and real-time monitoring on lookup performance in complex network structures. Furthermore, we propose a queueing model that treats each satellite as a service station, improving congestion management and optimizing traffic flow. By extensively comparing our approach with existing routing strategies, we demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed strategies and validate their effectiveness in dynamic network environments."

    "abstract": "Jamming attacks present a significant security threat to wireless networks by exploiting the open wireless medium, causing not only a denial-of-service, but also overloading the network and interfering with signals. The jamming attack can enable more sophisticated disruptions, such as protocol-aware and learning-based jamming, where adversaries transmit selectively upon detecting legitimate network activity, and this selective transmission conserves attacker resources and complicates detection. Channel hopping is widely adopted as a mitigation strategy, allowing networks to move away from interfered channels dynamically. However, recent studies have demonstrated that intelligent jammers, such as the Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB)-based attack, can effectively learn and predict channel hopping patterns, thereby continuously jamming communications and severely degrading network performance. Designing robust countermeasures against such intelligent jamming remains an open and critical challenge. In this paper, we analyze a kind of MAB-based attack methodology and propose two refined variants employing online and offline paradigms. To counteract these advanced threats, we introduce three defense strategies: (i) speeding up, which modifies the frequency of channel-hopping decisions to avoid the jammer’s attack, (ii) deploying a helper node, diversify the communication patterns to affect the attacker’s learning process, and (iii) employing a mirror Multi-Armed Bandit (mirror MAB) approach to predict and bypass channels of highest jamming probability. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed defenses, significantly mitigating MAB-based attacks. Specifically, our strategies achieve a PDR exceeding 90% under persistent attack conditions, while effectively preserving robust and dynamic channel hopping behaviors."

The main objective of this research is to apply Markov chains as a mathematical model that reduces the error in the projection of the supply of agroecological products that typically use linear models. From this, we also seek to know the current offer in the quantity of these products.

    "abstract": "Landslides are among the most frequent and destructive geological hazards worldwide. Accurate and timely detection of landslide-affected areas from high-resolution unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery is essential for disaster mitigation, emergency response, and post-event evaluation. Accurate landslide detection using high-resolution UAV imagery is crucial for disaster prevention and emergency response. However, complex terrain conditions, such as indistinct boundaries, scale variation and background interference from exposed rocks or shadows, make it difficult to extract reliable semantic features and achieve robust segmentation results. To address these challenges, we propose WSDLNet (Wavelet-guided Semantic Decoupling for Landslide Detection), a novel semantic segmentation framework that integrates wavelet-domain decomposition, hierarchical attention, and spatial-frequency decoupling. By leveraging frequency-aware encoding, adaptive multi-scale representation, and refined spatial attention, WSDLNet enhances feature discrimination in both spectral and spatial domains, enabling robust identification of landslide regions under diverse geological conditions. Extensive experiments on four practical UAV landslide datasets demonstrate that WSDLNet achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of segmentation accuracy, boundary refinement, and generalization capability under diverse terrain and lighting conditions, offering a practical solution for intelligent landslide detection and risk assessment."

    "abstract": "For quantized deep neural networks widely deployed on hardware-accelerated platforms, bit-flip attacks (BFAs) have become a serious security threat because they can cripple or hijack model inference by modifying only a few bits. To this end, we propose KHAD (K-Hop and Activation-aware Defense), a unified, minimally intrusive defense framework that fuses k-hop propagation with activation statistics to precisely assess neuronal criticality and adaptively partitions neurons into three categories, to which it applies lightweight strategies: elastic boundary rectification, soft limiting with least significant bit masking, and range tightening with orthogonal diffusion, respectively. We conduct performance experiments across datasets of different scales and multiple models. The results show that, while exerting only a very small impact on clean accuracy (e.g., a decrease of 1.73% for ResNet-32 on CIFAR-100), KHAD exhibits strong defensive capability. Under untargeted attacks, it increases the minimum number of bit flips required to break the model by 5.6× to 14.3×; under targeted attacks, it effectively reduces the attack success rate (ASR) to 1.40%–15.60%. Moreover, the method can be fully deployed at model export time, yielding extremely low runtime overhead across CNN and Transformer architectures. These results indicate that, compared with global redundancy-based defenses, KHAD combines structural propagation properties with data-driven activity to precisely identify and block a small number of high-leverage propagation paths, trading a slight cost for substantial robustness gains."

    "source": "IEEE",
    "abstract": "Stealthy Bit-Flip Attacks, which manipulate DNN predictions by altering a few hardware-level weights, pose a severe threat to safety-critical applications. To address this threat, we propose the Dual-Mask Dynamic Defense (DMDD), whose core idea is to proactively and dynamically disrupt the static paths that attackers construct by exploiting model redundancy at inference time. DMDD’s defense is accomplished by two synergistic online mechanisms: 1) At the intermediate layers, Dual-mask Dynamic Neuron Pruning (DDNP) first employs an \"Efficiency Mask\" to prune task-irrelevant redundant neurons for efficiency gains, and then uses a \"Security Mask\" to sever potential attack paths by monitoring statistical anomalies in neuron behavior. 2) At the final layer, Dynamic Connection Purification (DCP) is activated to perform semantic-level filtering. To ensure the model can tolerate this online restructuring and the effects of residual attack paths, we also designed a complementary offline Pruning-aware Robustness Training (PART) strategy to enhance the model’s pruning tolerance and enforce larger inter-class distances. Unlike traditional defenses, DMDD transforms defense overhead into performance gains, achieving security enhancement with \"negative computational overhead.\" Experiments show that DMDD can suppress the Attack Success Rate (ASR) of mainstream attacks like TBFA and TA-LBF from nearly 100% to below 15%, while simultaneously reducing the model’s computational load (FLOPs) by 26%-42%, providing an efficient and practical solution for secure DNN deployment in resource-constrained scenarios."

    "abstract": "Recently, low-altitude wireless networks (LAWNs) have emerged as a critical backbone for supporting the low-altitude economy, particularly with the densification of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and high-altitude platforms (HAPs). To meet growing data demands, some LAWN deployments incorporate free-space optical (FSO) links, which offer exceptional bandwidth and beam directivity. However, without strong security measures in place, both conventional radio frequency channels and FSO beams remain vulnerable to interception and spoofing, and FSO in particular can suffer from turbulence, misalignment, and weather-related attenuation. To address these challenges in the quantum era, a quantum-secure architecture called <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Quantum Skyshield</i> is proposed to enable reliable communication between the base transceiver station (BTS) and LAWN. The proposed design integrates BB84 quantum key distribution (QKD) with post-quantum authentication mechanisms. Simulation results confirm the reliable generation of a 128-bit symmetric key when the quantum bit error rate (QBER) remains below the threshold of 11%. Authentication is enforced using Lamport one-time signatures and hash-based message authentication codes (HMAC) to ensure message integrity. A Grover-inspired threat detection mechanism identifies anomalies with up to 89% probability in a single iteration, enabling real-time trust evaluation. Lastly, future research challenges have also been identified and discussed to guide further development in this area."

While this approach is still in its early stages compared to the standard method, several studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of topological tools, specifically using absolute and relative persistent homology, in this context. In this work, we introduce a novel method that employs periodic boundary persistent homology. By outlining the similarities and differences with existing techniques and providing multiple examples that illustrate the properties of our method, we aim to enhance the understanding of topology-based time series analysis and contribute to the advancement of mathematical information processing research."

It has been suggested in the literature that parameter optimization using Taguchi Methods can result in the best performance of AM. We argue that TM implementation is easier in cost leader (CL) strategy firms and more difficult in firms with a differentiation strategy. As the number of possibilities in CAPP (computer-aided process planning) is higher in AM (especially for big jobs where AM and subtractive manufacturing are used), there is enormous scope for continuous improvements."

The method first employs Pearson correlation analysis to identify key features strongly correlated with electricity demand from multiple data sources. Subsequently, principal component analysis (PCA) is applied to reduce the dimensionality of the selected features, eliminating multicollinearity. Finally, a long short-term memory (LSTM) network model is constructed for electricity forecasting. Experimental results demonstrate high prediction accuracy on the test dataset, validating the effectiveness of multi-source feature selection in enhancing electricity forecasting performance. This approach provides a reliable technical means for refined management and decision support in power enterprises."

Validated through a functional prototype, our results demonstrate that while the blockchain layer introduces higher latency than REST baselines, the performance trade-offs are fully compatible with asynchronous synchronization requirements. Furthermore, the event-driven ledger model improves bandwidth efficiency by approximately 55 times compared to traditional redundant full-dump exchanges. More importantly, the proposed architecture establishes a foundational governance layer that enables passive auditability and forensic readiness, transitioning spectrum management from a legacy trust-based model to a verifiable, proof-based cryptographic environment."

    "abstract": "Currently, deep learning models are easily exposed to data leakage risks. As a distributed model, Split Learning thus emerged as a solution to address this issue. The model is splitted to avoid data uploading to the server and reduce computing requirements while ensuring data privacy and security. However, the transmission of data between clients and server creates a potential vulnerability. In particular, model is vulnerable to intellectual property (IP) infringement such as piracy. Alarmingly, a dedicated copyright protection framework tailored for Split Learning models is still lacking. To this end, we propose the first copyright protection scheme for Split Learning model, leveraging fingerprint to ensure effective and robust copyright protection. The proposed method first generates a set of specifically designed adversarial examples. Then, we select those examples that would induce misclassifications to form the fingerprint set. These adversarial examples are embedded as fingerprints into the model during the training process. Exhaustive experiments highlight the effectiveness of the scheme. This is demonstrated by a remarkable fingerprint verification success rate (FVSR) of 100% on MNIST, 98% on CIFAR-10, and 100% on ImageNet, respectively. Meanwhile, the model’s accuracy only decreases slightly, indicating that the embedded fingerprints do not compromise model performance. Even under label inference attack, our approach consistently achieves a high fingerprint verification success rate that ensures robust verification."

We present SSChecker, a detection system that combines cross-layer probing with a classification model inspired by Information Bottleneck Theory to address the data sparsity issue inherent in active probing. Our experiments on real-world datasets show that SSChecker outperforms existing methods, including leading industrial detection engines. Our findings demonstrate that current probe-resistant strategies of stealth services remain insufficient. To strengthen privacy protection, we further propose mitigation strategies that help stealth services enhance their ability."

While traditional single-region approaches are constrained by limited local data, cross-regional forecasting leverages larger datasets to achieve higher accuracy. Federated learning (FL) emerges as a promising solution, enabling cross-regional collaboration. However, existing FL-based approaches struggle with model, system, and statistical heterogeneity, along with security vulnerabilities. To address these issues, this paper proposes a robustness-enhanced personalized federated learning framework that integrates knowledge distillation for cross-regional load forecasting. Proxy models are utilized to enable secure knowledge transfer while preserving local model adaptability, thereby resolving model heterogeneity. Perturbed Gradient Descent (PGD) mitigates statistical heterogeneity, and a dynamic exit mechanism reduces computational costs by allowing clients to exit early upon meeting accuracy thresholds, addressing system heterogeneity. Case studies on open-access energy dataset from six European countries show that the proposed method outperforms conventional FL models, personalized FL methods, and traditional robust aggregation schemes in terms of accuracy, robustness, and model resilience."

In the proposed system, a digitally modulated RF subcarrier (e.g., 16QAM on 7-GHz subcarrier) drives an intensity modulator to imprint data onto one of two optical carriers, while the relative optical phase between the lasers is independently adjusted to tune the phase of the THz carrier generated by photomixing, thus separating the modulation and beam-steering controls. Experimental results confirmed high-order data transmission of up to 32QAM at a maximum baud rate of 600 MBaud and accurate THz beam steering of up to 20° at the 300 GHz THz carrier. Furthermore, during beam steering with a 100-MBaud 16QAM signal, no constellation distortion was observed, confirming simultaneous data modulation and beam control. These results indicate that the proposed analog RoF approach enables high-order wireless data transmission and stable THz beam control."

Are they stating facts with confidence, hedging their assertions, or simply reporting others’ views? Such subjective stances, encoded through subtle linguistic markers, are pervasive in scholarly writing yet remain largely overlooked in computational approaches that reduce claims to objective facts. In this work, we present a stance-aware framework that models scientific claims as dual-layered structures comprising factual elements (entities, events, and relations) and stance markers (that express epistemic, evaluative, and interpersonal positioning). To scale annotation, we design an LLM-assisted pipeline combining model rationales with expert adjudication, yielding Fact-Stance-9K: 9,196 claims from 537 biomedical papers, annotated for fine-grained structure with 72% inter-LLM agreement.

    "abstract": "The increasing convergence of quantum computing (QC) and advanced robotic control is giving rise to a new class of intelligent automation systems. Utilizing quantum-inspired computational principles, contemporary robotic platforms demonstrate greater optimization efficiency, superior perceptual processing, and improved decision-making performance. This survey outlines the principal quantum-oriented control methodologies utilized in robotics, with particular emphasis on approaches that incorporate Quantum Neural Networks (QNN), Quantum Machine Learning (QML), and Quantum-behaved Particle Swarm Optimization (QPSO). The investigation systematically reviews recent advances in quantum-assisted adaptive control, trajectory planning, and optimization frameworks, spotlighting their contributions to improved robustness, precision, and energy efficiency. By analyzing research in quantum reinforcement learning, distributed Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computing, and hybrid quantum-classical approaches, this review clarifies how quantum principles are transforming both theoretical and practical aspects of robotic control. Likewise, several real-world implementations ranging from industrial manipulators to autonomous and cognitive robotic systems demonstrate the growing feasibility of quantum-enhanced decision-making. The review concludes that while remarkable progress has been made in quantum-inspired control for robotics, most existing studies remain constrained to simulations with restricted experimental validation on physical platforms. Addressing this gap will be essential in future research to transition from theoretical and simulated models toward hardware-level implementations, enabling the realization of scalable, fault-tolerant quantum control architectures."

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first MMIF approach to explicitly disentangle style and content representations across modalities for image fusion. C<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>MFuse introduces a content-preserving style normalization mechanism that suppresses modality-specific variations while maintaining the underlying scene structure. The normalized features are then progressively aggregated to enhance fine-grained details and improve content completeness. In light of the lack of ground truth and the inherent ambiguity of the fused distribution, we further align the fused representation with a well-defined source modality, thereby enhancing semantic consistency and reducing distributional uncertainty. Additionally, we introduce an adaptive consistency loss with learnable transformation, which provides dynamic, modality-aware supervision by enforcing global consistency across heterogeneous inputs. Extensive experiments on five datasets across three representative MMIF tasks demonstrate that C<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>MFuse achieves efficient and high-quality fusion, surpasses existing methods, and generalizes effectively to downstream visual applications."

    "abstract": "The integrity and traceability of digital photographic evidence represent a critical factor during forensic investigations, especially when this evidence undergoes technical transformations, such as cropping or resolution enhancement. Ensuring that these modifications remain transparent, verifiable, and attributable is essential to maintaining the value of the evidence during an investigation. To meet these requirements, existing systems typically rely on blockchain-based implementations within permissioned networks or provide only limited support for image transformations. As a result, they often lack the flexibility and transparency required for open or decentralized forensic scenarios. In this paper, we propose an endorsement-based image forensics system that leverages public blockchain to record the lifecycle and verify the authenticity of images. Our system employs hybrid encryption to provide confidentiality of uploaded images while simultaneously ensuring that they remain auditable and non-repudiable. The system supports different trust models and enables users to assess the trustworthiness of an image’s provenance data directly and indirectly. Direct trust is achieved by validating an image transformation through reproducible functions or zero-knowledge proofs; indirect trust is enabled through publicly recorded endorsements. Our design achieves low gas costs and provides confidentiality, verifiability, and traceability guarantees, improving upon previous approaches without relying on permissioned infrastructures."

    "abstract": "Cybersecurity analysts face an escalating threat landscape where zero-day malware families emerge daily, requiring automated detection systems that can identify previously unseen threats while maintaining low false positive rates in operational environments. Existing malware detection systems excel at classifying known families but struggle with novel variants, often treating novelty detection as a separate post-processing step that leads to excessive false alarms and missed threats.We present CentroidEmbed, a unified framework that integrates prototype learning directly within graph neural networks for robust malware family detection and zero-day threat identification. Our approach addresses critical operational challenges by jointly optimizing for both accurate classification of known malware families and reliable detection of novel threats within a single model architecture. The system introduces three key security-focused innovations: (1) learnable malware family centroids that adapt to evolving threat patterns through gradient-based refinement, (2) a specialized cosine-based triplet center loss that creates distinct behavioral signatures for each family while maintaining separation from potential novel threats, and (3) a parallel novelty detection component that identifies suspicious samples without requiring prior knowledge of specific attack vectors.Evaluated on real-world malware datasets using temporally realistic chronological splits that simulate operational deployment scenarios, CentroidEmbed demonstrates substantial improvements over existing security-focused detection methods. On the BODMAS corpus containing over 57,000 malware samples across 500+ families, our approach achieves 77.2% precision and 55.6% recall for novel family detection, significantly reducing false alarms while maintaining high detection rates for zero-day threats. These results demonstrate that integrating prototype learning within neural architectures creates more operationally viable detection systems compared to conventional classification approaches with post-hoc anomaly detection, providing security analysts with a practical tool for identifying emerging threats in dynamic cyber environments."

This paper presents an implementation and evaluation of a Home Assistant–based smart home system, deployed on a Raspberry Pi 400 and extended with ESP32 microcontrollers, voltage and current sensors, relays, and environmental monitoring devices. The platform integrates heterogeneous hardware via ESPHome and communicates over Wi-Fi, while also connecting to external services such as Forecast.Solar for renewable energy data.

    "abstract": "The rapid growth of distributed service infrastructures has promoted container-based deployment as a lightweight and flexible approach for large-scale service delivery. To enhance the trustworthiness of service deployment, blockchain has been incorporated into container networks as a decentralized trust layer. However, most existing blockchain solutions still rely on coarse-grained trust models that neither capture the evolution of node or layer credibility nor incorporate the layered structure of container images into deployment decisions, which may lead to services being deployed on low-reputation nodes and to the propagation of untrusted layers across the network. To address these limitations, this paper proposes ReTainer, a reputation-aware containerized service deployment framework in blockchain networks. We formulate the deployment problem as a joint optimization and decompose it into a linear-programming request routing subproblem and a service orchestration subproblem, which simultaneously covers service deployment, layer precaching, and layer re-scheduling. A hierarchical trust model captures the temporal evolution of node-level and layer-level credibility, and the resulting reputation priorities are used to select the top-k trustworthy layers for pre-caching. We then formulate the service activation and layer re-scheduling as a submodular optimization problem over a p-extendible system. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that ReTainer improves utility by up to 13.56% and reduces startup latency by 43.31% compared with existing deployment schemes."

The present study seeks to elucidate the progression of CCUS development and investigate prospective research to facilitate CCUS deployment in Indonesia. A literature survey was conducted. A bibliometric analysis comparing Indonesia’s CCUS literature and global CCUS literature was deployed. Findings reveal the presence of literature gaps concerning technology (capture, utilization), supply chain (transportation), environmental evaluation, and regulatory/policy framework. Future study is therefore recommended on the previously indicated topics, in addition to finance strategies and the application of machine learning to enhance the scalability of CCUS."

In this framework, fuzzy inference systems operate as logic-based structures that rely on linguistic rules to map input variables to corresponding outputs. The evaluation conducted on real measurements obtained from the PV panels of a large-scale solar power plant confirms the relevance of the proposed monitoring approach. These measurements were also used to determine the system’s primary power, voltage, and current characteristics under both normal and faulty operating conditions."

First, the topology of the quadratic Boost converter is reconstructed, where the dual switches are clamped by a passive clamping branch composed of diodes and capacitors. This clamping branch effectively suppresses the voltage spikes across the switches. Then, the converter is combined with switched capacitors, which not only further increases the voltage gain but also reduces the voltage stress on the diodes. Finally, a 250 W prototype is developed to verify the correctness of the theoretical analysis and the feasibility of the proposed converter."

The breakdown field strength, relative dielectric constant, ultra-low frequency dielectric loss, and elongation at break of the aged samples were measured. The research results show that as the aging process continues, the breakdown field strength of the insulation layer decreases continuously, showing a trend of rapid decrease at first and then a slower decrease; the dielectric constant changes little before and after, with strong fluctuation; the elongation at break shows a trend of slow decrease at first and then a sharp decrease; ultra-low frequency dielectric loss is the most sensitive to cable aging, increasing rapidly with the aggravation of aging, and can reliably reflect the aging degree of the cable. This can provide a reference for technicians engaged in the assessment of cable operation conditions and aging degrees."

First, data is collected via IoT sensors and digital twins or simulation tools. This data trains a binary classification machine learning (ML) model to predict system success or failure. In the second stage, a predictive model forecasts future operating conditions, which are evaluated by the ML model to determine the system’s operational state. Two predictive methods are implemented: Vector Autoregression (VAR) for linear dynamics and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for non-linear behavior. The framework is validated on a cryogenic heat exchanger, critical equipment in natural gas liquefaction. Results show both models enable early failure detection and reduce cumulative downtime. However, LSTM incurs higher computational time due to its complexity, while VAR offers faster performance. These results illustrate key trade-offs between predictive accuracy and efficiency in maintenance planning."

However, unlocking this potential requires a unified framework that can simultaneously handle coupled bimanual coordination, versatile physical interaction, and safety. We introduce Passive Model Predictive Cooperative Interaction Control (P-MPCIC), a framework that co-optimizes task performance and interaction safety under a formal passivity guarantee. P-MPCIC integrates model predictive control for the bimanual subsystem within a whole-body architecture and uses a coupling matrix to enforce synchronization objectives across relative motion and force distribution. For interaction prediction, the framework incorporates a composite robot-environment model that combines parallel and series impedance dynamics, yielding a linear state-space predictor. Passivity is enforced as a constraint on the energy balance at the interaction port, preventing destabilizing energy generation from the controller. We verify the framework’s core principles through planar simulations and demonstrate its practical effectiveness on a 7-DoF dual-arm humanoid."

    "abstract": "With a high proportion of new energy sources integrated into the power system, system inertia decreases, making frequency stability issues increasingly prominent. Traditional purely model-driven frequency response analysis methods are limited by model accuracy and parameter precision, whereas purely data-driven methods rely on large amounts of labeled data and lack physical interpretability. To address this, this paper proposes a model-data fusion-driven frequency response analysis method. This method first uses a simplified physical model for initial frequency response prediction, providing high-confidence physical constraints and initial states for subsequent data analysis. On this basis, a data-driven model is introduced, using the residual from the initial prediction of the previous stage as the learning target to achieve precise compensation for unmodeled dynamics and uncertainties in the physical model. Simulation results on the New England 10-machine 39-bus system show that the proposed fusion method significantly improves the prediction accuracy of the frequency nadir, steady-state frequency, and dynamic trajectories compared to using either a pure physical model or a pure data-driven model alone, combining both physical transparency and adaptive capability."

Previous work on coherent equalization has typically assumed that the system parameters are known without uncertainty. In this work, we address the problem of coherent passive equalization with uncertainty in the Hamiltonian. Utilizing an S-procedure method, we remodel the passive quantum system with uncertainty as a scaled closed-loop state-space representation with parameter dependencies. We then propose a two-disk synthesis approach for coherent passive equalizers. Numerical examples based on a single optical cavity system and on two-cavity systems with beam splitters demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed two-disk synthesis method for coherent equalization of passive quantum systems."

The proposed hybrid architecture synergistically integrates a solid-state Marx generator with a step-up pulse transformer, creating a compact and component-efficient power electronics platform. Key innovations include an inductor-based charging scheme that halves the semiconductor switch count and a multi-faceted passive protection strategy that not only leverages the transformer's volt-second limit to suppress long-pulse faults but also architecturally precludes catastrophic DC shoot-through failures. The prototype delivers a flexible output of 0-±11 kV and 100–500 ns pulses with a 500 kHz burst frequency, achieving an electrical efficiency of 94.85% on resistive loads. Crucially, the generator's robustness was validated through <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">in vivo</i> and <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">ex vivo</i> experiments. The results demonstrated that the nsPG maintained exceptional waveform fidelity despite a drastic 80.27% impedance collapse in the potato model (from 2.488 kΩ to 491.0 Ω at 10 kHz) and a 6.17% real-time dynamic reduction in the mouse model (from 412.0 Ω to 386.6 Ω over the initial ten pulses). This work demonstrates a robust and safe power electronics solution for a broad class of complex, low-impedance loads, positioning it as a key enabling technology for a challenging class of emerging industrial and scientific applications."

    "abstract": "There exists a significant lack of diversity based on skin tone representation in medical imaging, which contributes to delayed cancer diagnoses and poor outcomes for skin cancers in people of color. Current diagnostic systems predominantly feature lighter skin tones, which hinders accurate pathology identification on darker skin. Neural style transfer has emerged as a promising technique to address this data imbalance by artificially expanding the diversity of skin tone representations in medical image datasets. However, existing methods often disrupt critical diagnostic features through artifacts or structural deformations. To address this problem, we present a branched convolutional vision transformer (B-CvT) encoder coupled with a convolutional transformer decoder to enable precise skin tone transfer. The architecture preserves pathological content by employing dedicated encoder branches to disentangle style (skin tone) from content (lesion morphology), reinforced by a Wasserstein distance-based similarity loss that enforces clean feature separation in latent space. Quantitative evaluation demonstrates superior performance, surpassing state-of-the-art style transfer methods with the best Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS) of 0.320 and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) of 0.803. When used as a data augmentation technique, the proposed method improves the fairness of the model in cancer diagnostics by reducing the Equalized Odds between different skin tones by 0.09 without compromising overall accuracy. This provides a high-fidelity image synthesis tool and a method for developing more equitable AI diagnostic models, addressing a critical gap in dermatological representation by preserving the core pathological content essential for downstream diagnostic tasks."

Furthermore, the trained weights can be easily reused, enabling organizations to perform such analyses at low cost and with minimal effort."

    "abstract": "Recent years have seen the rapid development of smartphone cameras, enabling high-quality capture of on-screen content and facilitating widespread unauthorized duplication of digital content. While screen-captured images are ubiquitous in daily sharing and commercial activities, the lack of robust copyright protection mechanisms for this specific scenario remains a critical challenge. The copyrights of image creators cannot be effectively safeguarded. Traditional robust watermarking approaches, which primarily focus on digital noise, often fail to resist the unique distortions during the screen-shooting process, such as luminance distortion, perspective distortion, and moiré distortion. To address this challenge, we propose a flow-based screen-shooting robust watermarking framework, whose architecture is comprised of a flow-based watermark network and an invertible denoising network. Additionally, we constructed a screen-shooting noise image dataset and constructed an invertible noise simulation network to model the screen-shooting noise. The network achieves invertible noise modeling through a bidirectional process. The forward process simulates the noise, and the backward process removes the noise. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to existing robust watermarking methods, our method achieves superior robustness against screen-shooting noise. The invertible noise simulation network exhibits excellent denoising capabilities, and the average PSNR of the watermarked images is up to 39 dB, the watermark information extraction accuracy is up to 98%, ensuring both high imperceptibility and robustness."

    "abstract": "Advanced Persistent Threats(APTs) are targeted, stealthy, and highly sophisticated cyberattacks posing serious risks to critical infrastructure and sensitive data. In recent years, researchers increasingly focus on constructing provenance graphs from system logs to represent information flows, aiming to detect APTs through such semantically rich structured data. Although provenance graph-based APT detection techniques have shown effectiveness, they still suffer from several limitations: First, most of these methods require real-world APT data and prior expert knowledge; Second, they generally focusing on fine-grained local information while neglecting global information, resulting in in-sufficient extraction of rich contextual information and thus high false positive rates; Third, their detection performance degrades against evasion strategies, indicating insufficient robustness.To address these problems, this paper proposes Advanced Persistent Threat Detection via Graph Contrastive Masked Autoencoder (APT-GCM), a self-supervised learning-based detection model. APT-GCM leverages a graph contrastive masked autoencoder to learn node representations from benign provenance graphs, transforming malicious nodes detection into an outlier detection problem. It integrates the advantages of masked graph autoencoder and graph contrastive learning for extracting both local and global graph information through a dual-branch structure, learning deep implicit features of provenance graph nodes. Additionally, a uniformity loss is introduced to optimize the embedding distribution and improve discriminability. To further improve robustness, a complementary view augmentation module is incorporated, which constructs a complementary view of the masked view and performs feature alignment of masked nodes, strengthening the model’s ability to extract stable semantic information from diverse perspectives and thus improving its robustness against evasion attacks. We evaluate APT-GCM on three sub-datasets from the widely used DARPA E3 dataset, and experimental results demonstrate that APT-GCM outperforms state-of-the-art detection methods."

Thus, the purpose of this paper is to investigate the factors influencing consumer attitudes towards circular fashion, specifically second-hand shopping, fashion rentals, and garment repairs. Employing a survey, we study the impact of factors such as quality, brand reputation, price, and sustainability on consumers' choices. Results show that consumers place a high premium on quality, often prioritizing it over the brand. Interestingly, hygiene, quality and price stand out as crucial considerations for engaging in secondhand and rental markets. On the other hand, price of the repair, quality and original value are the key drivers for repairing fashion items. Thus, we provide insights for businesses looking to embrace circular economy models."

We introduce a literature-driven framework that discovers datasets from citation contexts in scientific papers, enabling retrieval grounded in actual research use rather than metadata availability. Our approach combines large-scale citation-context extraction, schema-guided dataset recognition with Large Language Models, and provenance-preserving entity resolution. We evaluate the system on eight survey-derived computer science queries and find that it achieves substantially higher recall than Google Dataset Search and DataCite Commons, with normalized recall ranging from an average of 47.47% to a highest value of 81.82%. Beyond recovering gold-standard datasets, the method also surfaces additional datasets not documented in the surveys. Expert assessments across all six top-level Fields of Science indicate that a substantial portion of the additional datasets are considered useful, and some are regarded as novel for the specific topics chosen by the experts. These findings establish citationcontext mining as an effective and generalizable paradigm for dataset discovery, particularly in settings where datasets lack sufficient or reliable metadata.

Next, a Priority-Aware State Encoder (PASE) is constructed, using a graph neural network to model the dynamic relationships between workpieces and equipment, and integrating workpiece urgency, equipment failure probability, and processing delay information to form a highdimensional state representation. Finally, a Multi-Head Action Selection Network (MH-ASN) is introduced, decoupling dispatching and sequencing decisions to achieve more fine-grained and interpretable scheduling control. Experimental results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms traditional heuristic algorithms and existing reinforcement learning-based scheduling models across multiple dynamic job shop benchmark scenarios."

Multimodal perception is achieved by deploying magnetic sensing components and layered data acquisition terminals. Hardware synchronization and software collaboration address spatiotemporal synchronization issues. A weighted fusion model is then used to fuse multimodal data from substation digital pressure plates. The YOLOv3 object detection model is used, and the Darknet53 backbone network is used to extract features from the fused data. Mish activation functions are used to improve performance, and a decoding formula is used to calculate bounding box coordinates to locate the substation digital pressure plate area. The located pressure plate area data and state labels are fed into the AI large model for training. Parameters are optimized using a loss function. Finally, the substation digital pressure plate state is identified based on multiple feature results and confidence thresholds. Experimental results show that this method successfully identifies pressure plates in different states. Under normal lighting conditions, this method achieved recall rates of $96.5 \\%, 95.8 \\%$, and 94.2% for pressure plates in active, passive, and maintenance states, respectively. In a confusion matrix comparison, 312 active states were correctly identified, exceeding the comparison method.

    "abstract": "Graph-based clustering has been extensively explored and applied due to its exceptional performance. However, most existing methods operate directly in the original high-dimensional space, where complex nonlinear structures and redundant noisy features often obscure the intrinsic data distribution. Consequently, constructing a reliable similarity graph in such a space is inherently challenging, as uncertainty and noise can significantly degrade clustering performance. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel graph-based clustering method, Weighted Subspace Graph Learning (WSGL). Specifically, WSGL leverages kernel principal component analysis (Kernel PCA) to construct multiple kernel-based subspaces, effectively capturing nonlinear structures while reducing redundancy and noise. This strategy enhances subspace features from different perspectives, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the data distribution. Next, WSGL learns pairwise relationships across these subspaces, fully exploiting their complementary information to mitigate the limitations of relying on a single original space for capturing the global data structure. Furthermore, to ensure that the learned similarity graph preserves the same number of connected components as the ground-truth clusters, we impose a low-rank constraint on the graph structure. Additionally, considering the varying quality of different subspaces, WSGL introduces a dynamic weighting mechanism that adaptively assigns weights to subspaces based on their contribution to clustering performance, allowing high-quality subspaces to play a more dominant role in the final clustering results. Extensive experiments on multiple high-dimensional datasets demonstrate that WSGL surpasses state-of-the-art methods, validating its effectiveness and superiority in complex clustering tasks."

    "abstract": "Taking ecological sustainability into account when developing new products is not only demanded by society but has also recently been legally anchored by the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive. To comply with the newly formulated laws and regulations, it is essential to take them into account during product development. Decisions made in the early stages of product development have the greatest influence on sustainability impacts of a product. At the same time, while trying to realize the product idea, knowledge about the effects on ecological sustainability of the decisions for or against technical solution alternatives is minimal. Wrong decisions cannot be changed at all or only at great cost. This paper presents a method to perform an initial narrowing of possible solution alternatives for a new product under high uncertainty. The aim is to focus on and develop only those solutions that are most promising based on individually selected sustainability goals. To this end, this article develops a method that combines scenario techniques and robust decision-making approaches to narrow down the solution space in a timely manner with minimal effort."

    "abstract": "While differential privacy (DP) has been widely adopted to strengthen privacy guarantees in federated graph learning (FGL), its application often incurs a significant accuracy-privacy trade-off. To address this limitation, we propose PrivFGL, a framework that enhances the utility performance of differentially private FGL by mitigating noise-induced heterogeneity. Through empirical analysis, we demonstrate that the accuracy degradation in existing DP-FGL frameworks stems from amplified client heterogeneity caused by randomized perturbations during training. PrivFGL mitigates this issue via Personalized Data Transformation (PDT), which adaptively aligns the feature distributions of perturbed graph data across clien. In PrivFGL, each client utilizes a local PDT module during training to process its perturbed data. Extensive experiments on two widely-used datasets, in comparison with one heterogeneity solution method, verify the effectiveness of our method in addressing the heterogeneity problem."

    "abstract": "In critical IoT environments, such as smart homes and industrial systems, effective Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are essential for ensuring security. However, developing robust IDS solutions remains a significant challenge. Traditional machine learning-based IDS models typically require large datasets, but data sharing is often limited due to privacy and security concerns. Federated Learning (FL) presents a promising alternative by enabling collaborative model training without sharing raw data. Despite its advantages, FL still faces key challenges, such as data heterogeneity (non-IID data) and high energy and computation costs, particularly for resource-constrained IoT devices. To address these issues, this paper proposes OptiFLIDS, a novel approach that applies pruning techniques during local training to reduce model complexity and energy consumption. It also incorporates a customized aggregation method to better handle pruned models that differ due to non-IID data distributions. Experiments conducted on three recent IoT IDS datasets, TON_IoT, X-IIoTID, and IDS-IoT2024, demonstrate that OptiFLIDS maintains strong detection performance while improving energy efficiency, making it well-suited for deployment in real-world IoT environments."

    "abstract": "Radio Frequency (RF) plasma technology is established as the cornerstone of semiconductor manufacturing processes. However, matching networks with exceptionally high response speeds and precision are necessitated owing to the dynamic variations of the plasma load impedance. With the continuous downscaling of semiconductor process nodes, the matching speed requirements have escalated significantly; consequently, traditional mechanical Vacuum Variable Capacitors (VVCs), characterized by response times in the range of seconds, are rendered inadequate for tracking rapid impedance changes. These limitations are found to seriously compromise the stability and yield of advanced manufacturing processes. In this paper, an Electronic Variable Capacitor (EVC) based on back-to-back SiC MOSFETs is proposed to substitute traditional mechanical matching components. Bidirectional control of the 400 kHz RF signal is achieved by this topology through the alternating operation of body diodes and conducting channels. It is confirmed via ADS simulations that the proposed circuit responds to PWM signals within microseconds, thereby effectively eliminating the latency associated with mechanical matchers. Matching time and system costs are significantly reduced while reliability is improved; these enhancements are identified as critical for ensuring consistency in nanoscale semiconductor manufacturing."

Since 2018, Crossref releases monthly dumps of its database amounting to 64 TB in JSON format. Recent integrity issues warrant a complete audit with longitudinal analysis of the Crossref archives. However, auditing is challenging due to the evolving nature of these massive metadata. We introduce an approach to store the complete archives that tracks the history of modifications efficiently. The longitudinal screening of the metadata is illustrated with two indicators designed to detect potential misconducts. We discovered and report two such anomalies involving suspect authors/publishers seemingly gaming citation metrics as well as a previously documented case of fraud involving a journal and its authors. The code is released for reproducibility and to encourage other researchers and Crossref to perform further analyses."

    "abstract": "We present a unified large language model (LLM) framework for multi-task optical link management, in which a single fine-tuned LLM jointly performs five optical link management tasks: quality-of-transmission (QoT) estimation, QoT forecasting, anomaly detection, anomaly classification, and launch-power optimization. Using structured natural-language prompts, the model ingests multimodal telemetry—including physical-layer measurements, state-of-polarization traces, historical QoT statistics, and configuration parameters—collected from a single looped-back connectivity service on a long-haul C+L-band experimental link. The LLM achieves a QoT prediction RMSE of ≈0.016 dB, near-perfect anomaly detection, and up to 96% anomaly-classification accuracy when guided by prompt-embedded semantic rules, while providing launch-power optimization with ≈0.2 dBm RMSE. By unifying multiple tasks within a single inference pipeline, the framework eliminates the need for task-specific ML models and reduces operational overhead. Although the evaluation focuses on single-channel, single-service link operation, the results highlight the potential of structured prompting and lightweight fine-tuning to support future extensions toward multi-channel and network-wide management."

    "abstract": "This research reports a potential quasi-distributed thermal mapping optical sensing system for extreme temperatures, leveraging femtosecond (fs) laser inscribed single-mode fiber Bragg gratings (FBGs) and a waveguide within coreless, highly multimode optical fiber, resulting in a single-mode structure. Unlike doped single-mode fibers, coreless fibers composed of silica rods prevent issues associated with dopant migration and ensure data accuracy. The strategic placement of point-by-point FBGs in a cascaded formation on the fs-laser inscribed waveguide facilitates localized multipoint sensing. The long-term stability of the proposed waveguide-assisted FBG system was assessed over 24 hours at elevated temperatures (1000°C), showing no hysteresis during heating and cooling cycles. This approach promotes the use of single-mode waveguide-assisted cascaded FBG systems in extreme temperature environments. The point-by-point FBG writing technique via fs-laser enables rapid inscription compared to the conventional line-by-line method, providing fine control over the grating configuration and ensuring fast bulk production. The proposed device offers comprehensive temperature monitoring suitable for challenging multipoint sensing applications, such as industrial processes operating in extreme conditions."

    "abstract": "With the growing integration of wind energy into modern power systems, its inherent uncertainty and intermittency present significant challenges to electricity market operations. This paper proposes a two-stage electricity market optimization model that coordinates multiple flexibility resources, including energy storage systems (ESS), demand response (DR), and fast-ramping thermal units, to address these challenges. The model introduces a day-ahead and real-time coordinated decision framework. In the day-ahead stage, unit commitment, ESS baseline operation, and DR baseline load are optimized. In the real-time stage, actual wind power deviations are addressed through dynamic adjustments of flexibility resources. A distributionally robust optimization (DRO) approach is employed, using fuzzy sets to model wind power forecast errors, balancing robustness and economic efficiency. The model features finegrained constraints on ESS operation, DR response characteristics, and unit ramping rates, and includes a coordinated clearing mechanism to leverage resource complementarity. Simulation results on a modified IEEE 30-bus system demonstrate the model’s effectiveness: total system cost is reduced by up to 18.6%, wind curtailment by 41.3%, and price volatility by 36.5%. The proposed model offers a robust and efficient decision-support tool for electricity markets with high renewable penetration."

    "abstract": "In the development process, utilizing the existing functions and interfaces of third-party libraries can significantly reduce development time and resources. However, the introduction of third-party libraries also brings security risks. These libraries may contain defects or vulnerabilities and can even conceal malicious code. Introducing vulnerable third-party libraries can compromise the security of the entire software system. Although existing solutions can provide sandbox environments for libraries, they require extensive modifications to the source code to implement isolation. Furthermore, current sandboxes cannot support the simultaneous isolation of multiple libraries, including memory and privilege isolation. To address these issues, we propose MLSBOX, the first automated sandboxing framework designed to provide fine-grained isolation for multiple untrusted third-party libraries. This sandbox leverages Attribute Program Dependence Graph (APDG) analysis to identify data dependencies from different libraries. It automatically modifies the program at the compiler level to partition the program into multiple independent isolation domains, enforcing memory and privilege isolation for each domain to enhance overall program security. We have successfully implemented a prototype of MLSBOX on LLVM and conducted rigorous functional and performance evaluations on third-party libraries such as OpenSSL and Zlib. MLSBOX provides the most fine-grained memory and permission isolation currently available. In terms of runtime efficiency, MLSBOX incurs an average overhead of 2.50%. For isolating multi-threaded programs, such as a program with 8 threads, MLSBOX incurs a minimal runtime overhead of just 0.80%, significantly lower than that of the current state-of-the-art solution, Cali (365.70%)."

The coordinated operation of sources, grids, loads and storage is becoming increasingly crucial for ensuring the stability of the power system and improving energy utilization efficiency. This paper focuses on the optimization scheduling analysis of single battery storage and the mixed storage scheme combining compressed air and battery storage in the power system. The system is modeled and solved through mixed integer linear programming. A detailed analysis of the electricity cost data of the two storage schemes within $\\mathbf{2 4}$ hours reveals their cost fluctuation patterns and differences. The study finds that the mixed storage has an advantage in average cost control, thanks to its technical complementarity and better scheduling strategies, which can better cope with complex and variable system operation conditions, reduce energy costs, and achieve better peak shaving and valley filling effects. This research provides important references for the scientific selection and efficient scheduling of energy storage schemes in the power system, and helps the energy system develop towards a green, economic and reliable direction."

    "abstract": "The need for automatic ontology modeling has become particularly significant in the era of Web 3.0, where ontologies serve as the structural metadata backbone. Despite their importance, certain domains such as environmental studies, though common—have been neglected and lack formal ontologies. To address this, the proposed model leverages auxiliary knowledge from Web 3.0, beginning with seed term pool generation from datasets and their classification using a Bi-LSTM model. Following this, the AdaBoost classifier is employed for dataset classification, while Pearson’s correlation coefficient aids in feature extraction through federation between two classifiers, enabling sedated learning. The integration of Google’s Knowledge Graph Search API further enhances the model by incorporating additional information, thereby strengthening its knowledge infrastructure. To ensure semantic accuracy, Morista’s Overlap Index is applied for semantics-oriented relevance computations, supporting reasoning through semantic similarity measures. Additionally, the Imperialist Competitive Algorithm is adopted as a metaheuristic optimization strategy. The use of YAGO along with Google’s Knowledge Graph API enriches the model with dense auxiliary knowledge, ultimately leading to high precision, and reliable estimation of F-measure with the lowest False Discovery Rate (FDR). In summary, the proposed framework named Ontology Synthesis using Semi-Automatic Semantic AI (OSSS) represents a state-of-the-art model for automatic ontology generation, specifically tailored for the domain of environmental journalism."

This work presents FaultSpy, the first systematic framework for evaluating SPDM against Fault Injection Attacks (FIAs) and their combination with other prominent attack vectors, such as Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) attacks. Leveraging the fault injection simulation tool, FaultFinder, with our custom SPDM-specific hooks, we uncover nine concrete vulnerabilities spanning both threat models. These include bypassing mutual authentication, suppressing signature generation and verification, downgrading negotiated capabilities, skipping mandatory protocol steps, manipulating key update behavior, transmitting messages intended to be encrypted in plaintext, and extracting session keys. We further validate the feasibility of these attacks through practical voltage glitching experiments on an RP2350 microcontroller. Our findings demonstrate that FIAs-whether in isolation or combined with other attacks-significantly expand the SPDM attack surface, highlighting the need for robust implementation-level countermeasures."

    "abstract": "Event-based vision has drawn increasing attention owing to its distinctive properties, including ultra-high temporal resolution and extreme dynamic range. Recent works have introduced it to video super-resolution (VSR) to enhance flow estimation and temporal alignment. In contrast, this paper shifts the focus of event signals from motion refinement to texture enhancement in VSR. We propose EvTexture++, the first event-driven framework dedicated to texture enhancement in VSR. It leverages high-frequency spatiotemporal details from events to improve texture recovery. EvTexture++ incorporates a customized texture enhancement branch, along with an iterative texture enhancement module that progressively exploits high-temporal-resolution event information for texture restoration. This enables gradual refinement of texture regions across iterations, yielding more accurate and detailed high-resolution outputs. Besides intra-frame texture recovery, large motions could degrade inter-frame temporal consistency, particularly in texture regions, leading to texture flickering. To mitigate this, we further exploit the continuous-time motion cues of events to enhance temporal consistency, introducing a temporal texture alignment module that estimates event-guided texture-aware flow for precise inter-frame texture alignment. Moreover, EvTexture++ is designed as a plug-and-play tool to flexibly boost the performance of existing VSR models. Experiments on five datasets demonstrate that EvTexture++ achieves state-of-the-art performance. When integrated into recent VSR models, it yields significant improvements, with gains of up to 1.55 dB in PSNR on the texture-rich Vid4 dataset."

The proposed GBL framework integrates three interactive game modes: teaching mode, where students learn through guided tutorials; exploration mode, which allows students to design and solve their own problems; and competition mode, enabling student groups to create and challenge each other with customized problems. Through these modes, the GBL framework aims to foster active participation, critical thinking, and collaborative learning. To evaluate the effectiveness of the developed OR game, a pilot study was conducted with a group of students. The results indicate that students exhibited greater motivation and a better grasp of optimization concepts compared to traditional teaching methods."

    "abstract": "This article presents a physics-based Verilog-A model for simulating random telegraph signal (RTS) noise in single-photon avalanche diodes (SPADs), particularly near breakdown voltage. The model captures both transient waveforms and statistical features of RTS noise, overcoming limitations of conventional circuit-level approaches. Implemented in Cadence Spectre, the model is validated against experimental data, showing excellent agreement in RTS amplitude and hold-time distributions. We analyze how RTS noise characteristics vary with bias voltage and temperature. Results indicate that the on-state probability increases with bias voltage, but decreases with temperature, reflecting the trap-assisted nature of RTS behavior. The model also reveals underlying probabilistic switching mechanisms and accurately captures frequency-domain characteristics of RTS noise, which are critical for evaluating its impact on SPAD performance. This work enables predictive, noise-aware SPAD and circuit co-design by offering a compact, simulator-compatible model and providing a valuable tool for advancing high-performance photon-counting systems."

    "abstract": "Advanced persistent threats (APTs) have become a major network threat due to their persistence, complexity, and multi-stage nature. Existing APT detection methods based on provenance graphs have been proven to be effective. However, most studies based on provenance graphs are limited to single event detection, and rely on rule design and prior knowledge, making it difficult to effectively extract contextual information hidden in the graph. To address these issues, this paper innovatively proposes an APT detection model based on self-supervised contrastive learning, APT-SSC. First, the model uses an improved GraphSage(Graph Sample and Aggregate) encoder combined with a multi-head attention mechanism to learn the embedding representation of nodes; then, through context-based (local-global) contrastive learning, the robustness and context-awareness of node embeddings are effectively enhanced; finally, the optimized node embeddings are used as the input of the classification detection model to achieve node-level anomaly detection and tactics detection. Experiments are carried out on two public datasets, CICAPT-IIoT2024 (containing a variety of complex tactics) dataset and DAPRA TC-E3 dataset. The experimental results show that APT-SSC improves F1-Scores by 5% and 7% in anomaly detection and tactic detection experiments, respectively. APT-SSC has been proven to be significantly superior to existing methods in APT detection and can also effectively identify APT tactics."

    "abstract": "Encryption algorithms are usually applied to images in cloud environment to protect privacy, which will make image retrieval difficult. Existing encrypted image retrieval schemes mainly follow the two-step strategy, which firstly extract features from encrypted images and then use these features to conduct retrieval. However, the feature extraction procedure brings additional computational expense, and the extracted feature will result in privacy leakage. In this paper, we propose a new encrypted image retrieval scheme in end-to-end manner. End-to-end means we combine the feature extraction process and the retrieval process, which can reduce computational complexity. Specifically, images are encrypted by DC coefficients encryption, AC coefficients permutation and block permutation. After encryption, the encrypted images can be directly input into our retrieval model, which is based on Vision Transformer (Vit), without any process to conduct retrieval. What’s more, we propose a new type of data augmentation method named random block selection transformation (RST), which is compatible with the Vit backbone and can improve the model performance. Experiment result shows that our scheme can achieve superior retrieval accuracy than other state-to-the-art encrypted image retrieval schemes, while relatively high security can be retained."

    "abstract": "The increasing complexity of modern automotive wire harnesses, combined with the demand for cost-efficient automation, necessitates the development of reliable robotic connector-insertion solutions. Conventional connector designs exhibit that small gripping surfaces lead to positioning inaccuracies and insertion failures, as slippage at forces below 20 N has been observed, which is insufficient to reliably activate their locking mechanisms. To address these limitations, this paper introduces a novel connector–gripper design, proposed as the first potential open standard, in combination with a force-controlled insertion strategy that enhances precision and robustness in automated wire harness assembly. The design was subjected to mechanical stress tests, which demonstrated that the novel design withstood axial forces up to 150 N without mechanical failure, thus significantly surpassing the performance of conventional connectors. Furthermore, an automated insertion trial using a blind search algorithm demonstrated 100% reliability within ±3 mm translational and ±4° angular tolerances. The findings of this study indicate that the proposed approach offers a scalable and standardized solution for the automated handling and mating of connectors."

    "abstract": "Adversarial purification has emerged as a critical defense mechanism against various adversarial attacks on deep neural networks, however, such category of diffusion-based purification in the pixel space confronts two challenges while applying into today’s large vision transformers: i) the distributional divergence between adversarial and clean examples in high-dimensional image manifold; and ii) the prohibitive computational cost while processing high-resolution images. To address the predicament, we in this paper focus on the transformer-based visual encoders commonly employed in large Vision-Language Models (VLMs), and propose a novel Latent Diffusion-based Purification (LDP) mechanism through leveraging the latent space to pave the gap between adversarial distribution and clean distribution. Resorting to projecting adversarial input into a low-dimensional latent representation, our proposed LDP not only suppresses the off-manifold perturbations to achieve accelerated denoising, but also preserves critical semantic features by aligning input with the priori high-quality visual representations. Multi-facet experiments over both proactive robustness enhancement and post-attack purification demonstrate that our LDP has a superior performance in terms of effectiveness and efficiency."

While prior work has often relied on controlled user studies, this study investigates device-dependent mental effort using the Reading in the Wild dataset collected with Project Aria. We analyze eye tracking data during reading tasks on four commonly used digital devices: laptops, tablets, mobile phones, and wall-mounted screens, using fixation duration as the key eye-tracking measure to understand mental effort. Our results indicate that device type significantly shapes mental effort: wall-mounted screens elicited the longest fixations, laptops showed intermediate values, and handheld devices exhibited the lowest and most comparable levels of effort. These findings highlight how ergonomic differences such as viewing distance and display size influence visual processing and mental efforts during digital reading. Our work advances the understanding of device-specific mental effort and offers insights for designing digital reading environments that emphasize usability."

    "abstract": "Tor is one of the most widely adopted anonymity networks, yet its anonymity can be undermined by adversaries through flow correlation attacks. Current mainstream technologies focus on exploiting the sequence characteristics of packet lengths and timestamps to execute attacks. However, the padding mechanism of the Tor network and time delays caused by multi-hop relays obscure these single-modal features. Additionally, the diversity of network services and the randomness of user behavior result in sparse packet distributions, which impact model training and inference. In this paper, we propose SSRCorr, a novel self-supervised learning framework for flow correlation attacks, incorporating the Flow Feature Aggregation (FFA) module and Global-Local Fusion (GLoF) Encoder to address these challenges. Firstly, we construct a Byte-based Traffic Aggregation Matrix (BTAM) by integrating time and length sequences and applying two data augmentation methods tailored for Tor flow correlation, thereby reducing the impact of Tor network noise on attack effectiveness. Secondly, we employ GLoF to extract features from the output by FFA and fuse the global context information of the traffic, thus mitigating the impact of low-information traffic on model performance. Experiments show that SSRCorr achieves a TPR of 96%, surpassing other methods, and maintains robust performance under temporal drift and obfuscation, supporting future research on countering anonymity system defenses."

    "abstract": "The proliferation of advanced generative AI models creates an urgent need for robust AI-generated text detection systems, particularly in high-stakes domains such as news media and academic publishing. Existing approaches face significant limitations: traditional linguistic methods fail against sophisticated Transformer-generated text, large-scale deep learning models require prohibitive computational resources, and most systems neglect the complementary nature of semantic understanding and linguistic pattern recognition. To address these challenges, we propose EffLingSem (Efficient Linguistic-Semantic fusion), a parameter-efficient hierarchical framework that systematically integrates semantic embeddings with explicit linguistic features for AI-generated text detection. Our approach employs a dual-stream architecture combining Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B for semantic feature extraction with a 15-dimensional linguistic feature set encompassing lexical diversity, syntactic complexity, and stylistic patterns. The features are fused through a learnable hierarchical attention mechanism that adaptively balances modality contributions based on domain characteristics. Extensive experiments on DAGPap22 and our newly constructed NewsSciGen dataset demonstrate that EffLingSem consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving F1 scores of 88.34% on scientific texts and 87.23% on news articles, representing substantial improvements of 2.89% and 3.56% respectively over the strongest baseline. Comprehensive ablation studies validate the necessity of each component, with removing linguistic or semantic branches causing 3.67-4.78% and 6.89-7.56% F1 drops respectively, confirming their complementary roles. The hierarchical attention mechanism provides an additional 2.56-3.11% improvement over a baseline using simple feature concatenation. The framework accomplishes these gains using only 1.2M trainable parameters—over 1,400× fewer than competing methods—while providing interpretable feature contributions that offer actionable insights into AI-generated content characteristics. Our work bridges the gap between detection performance and computational efficiency, offering a practical solution for real-world deployment in resource-constrained environments."

Traditional decision-making models, such as Expected Utility Theory and Net Present Value, assume rational behavior and stable preferences but often fail to reflect real-world complexity. This study applies Guo’s Dynamic Focus Programming (DFP), a decision-support framework designed to address sequential decision problems in uncertain environments. The DFP framework focuses on minimizing downside risk through the pessimistic evaluation function (ψ-), which enables developers to make decisions that prioritize risk mitigation and the avoidance of significant losses. This approach contrasts with traditional models by identifying robust decision paths that remain viable even under adverse market conditions. Using a vertically phased, mixed-use real estate project in Beirut, Lebanon, the study demonstrates how DFP can guide developers in selecting strategies that reduce financial exposure, particularly in the face of a market downturn. The results highlight that, under the pessimistic evaluation system, low-end residential units in high demand consistently outperform luxury configurations, showcasing the resilience of affordable housing in uncertain conditions. The findings suggest that DFP provides a more effective tool for real estate developers, offering a clear, risk-conscious decision-making framework that helps navigate market volatility and minimize financial losses."

    "abstract": "Meteorological images typically contain sensitive and critical information, demanding effective security mechanisms to prevent unauthorized copying and distribution. Digital watermarking, a widely adopted protection technique, imperceptibly embeds user identity information into images to enable subsequent traceability. However, existing methods fail to consider the impact of watermark embedding on critical meteorological features, as well as the limitations of high computational overhead and low embedding efficiency in multi-user distribution scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a watermarking framework tailored for the secure distribution of meteorological images. Specifically, we first design a content-adaptive region selection scheme that avoids embedding watermarks in critical meteorological regions such as cloud features. We then develop a two-stage decoupled embedding strategy to enhance distribution efficiency, where the preprocessing stage performs region selection and frequency transformation, while the distribution stage reuses these cached results to rapidly generate user-specific watermarked copies. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our framework effectively avoids critical regions in meteorological images and maintains high visual quality (average PSNR of 38.10 dB and SSIM of 0.9815) while achieving better extraction accuracy under various attacks. Furthermore, the two-stage decoupled embedding strategy reduces server response latency by over 60.8% in concurrent distribution scenarios."

In this paper, we propose an efficient dehazing method based on gradient line prior. By associating image gradients in atmospheric scattering model, we obtain a stable and simple prior, termed the gradient line prior (GLP), that is, in the corresponding hazy images normalized by atmospheric light, there is a linear relationship between the reciprocal of the gradients distributed across different regions of the hazy image plane and the corresponding ratio of pixel intensity to the gradient. For accurate estimation of the transmission map, its refinement is realized through the analysis of the distribution characteristics of pixels in three channels. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to different dehazing methods, our approach exhibits good detail enhancement and color restoration performance.

However, the existing MPC for SDI uses only one of the basic voltage vectors throughout the control period, which increases the dc-port power ripple and reduces current quality. To address this issue, the candidate voltage vectors are extended from 27 to 117 based on unevenly distributed basic voltage vectors, which reduces the dc-port power ripple and improves power quality due to extra control degree of freedom being provided. To reduce the computational burden caused by extended voltage vectors under unbalanced port voltages, the space vector diagram is divided into asymmetrical quadrangle sub-sectors, where the candidate voltage vectors required to be iterated are reduced by 82%. On this basis, an MPC based on discrete space vector modulation (SVM) is proposed for the SDI, enabling simultaneous grid current tracking and flexible power regulation. The comprehensive comparison experimental tests are conducted to verify the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed MPC based on discrete SVM."

Firstly, fuzzy logic systems are employed to approximate the unknown nonlinear functions. Secondly, a state observer is designed for the unmeasurable states, while a fault detection mechanism is established to detect the occurrence of faults, and a fault compensation term is constructed to counteract their effects. Then, an asymmetric tangent-type Barrier Lyapunov Function (ATBLF) is introduced to handle the output constraints. Concurrently, an auxiliary function is incorporated into the virtual control signals to compensate for the coupling terms arising from the BLF. Finally, by combining backstepping techniques with a fuzzy adaptive update mechanism, a novel control strategy is designed. The Dynamic Surface Control (DSC) technique is utilized to avoid the “explosion of complexity” problem. Based on the fractional-order Lyapunov stability theory, it is proven that all signals in the closed-loop system are semiglobally uniformly ultimately bounded, and the output of the system can be constrained within the given bounds."

COSI’s primary science goals include precisely mapping positron annihilation and nuclear line emissions in the Milky Way galaxy through Compton imaging. This relies on our ability to maintain COSI’s spectral performance over its mission lifetime. Changes in the detectors’ gain characteristics over time will result in inaccurate measurement of astrophysical gamma-ray energies. Moreover, observations from past MeV telescopes and proton-beam experiments have shown that radiation damage in space causes photopeak shifts and spectral line broadening. These necessitate a plan for regular, in-orbit spectral calibration. In this study, we demonstrate a method to monitor and recalibrate the COSI detectors using background line emissions produced by the space radiation environment. We employ Monte Carlo simulations of particle background and show that strong background lines arise from nuclear excitation of COSI’s detectors (germanium) and cryostat (aluminum) materials. These span COSI’s entire bandwidth for single-site interactions and can be used to monitor the effects of radiation damage and gain shifts every 12 hours at the full instrument level and every 16 days at the individual detector level. Methods developed by Pike et al. [1, 2] to correct the effects of hole trapping and gain characteristics can then be applied to recover the original spectral performance. These results inform COSI’s telemetry requirements for calibration and housekeeping data, and rule out the need for an onboard radioactive calibration source, which would have increased the complexity of the spacecraft."

Unlike traditional reinforcement learning, which relies on neural networks for policy approximation, QPL utilizes a Variational Quantum Circuit (VQC) as the parameterized policy model. The VQC is tailored for the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum era, featuring a low-depth and low-width design with alternating variational entanglement and embedding sub-layers. The loss function and gradient calculations are derived using action re-parameterization. Case studies indicate that QPL achieves faster convergence and competitive optimization performance compared to classical algorithms while using only 1.6% of the number of trainable parameters. To highlight the expressivity advantage, VQCs are further compared with classical neural networks through a harmonic-regression benchmark and the downstream ESS arbitrage task. Experiments on IBM quantum hardware confirm QPL’s resilience to gate errors and qubit decoherence, and additional analyses demonstrate its superior training stability and efficiency."

The core methodology involves collecting multi-channel magnetic field data from sensors positioned near the cable, where charged cables exhibit alternating magnetic fields due to current flow, while uncharged ones show primarily background noise. We employ a hybrid architecture combining 1D Convolutional Neural Networks (1D-CNN) for local feature extraction and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) networks for capturing temporal dependencies, augmented with an attention mechanism to focus on critical signal segments. Simulated datasets, generated based on electromagnetic principles, consist of 10000 samples with sequence lengths of 1024 across three channels, ensuring manageable size and realistic noise inclusion. Experimental evaluations demonstrate superior performance, achieving an accuracy of 97.60%, precision of 95.41%, recall of 98.13%, F1score of 96.47%, and AUC of 98.63%. Ablation studies confirm the efficacy of each component, with the full model outperforming baselines like SVM (accuracy $\\mathbf{9 2. 2 8 \\%}$). Noise robustness tests show graceful degradation, maintaining over 86% accuracy at higher noise levels. The ROC curve highlights the model’s discriminative power, and the loss curve indicates efficient convergence within 20 epochs. This non-contact method offers real-time, reliable detection for power systems, enhancing safety and maintenance efficiency in scenarios like underground cables or high-voltage lines. Future extensions could integrate real-world data for broader applicability."

To this end, several static and dynamic bias conditions under TID were studied to reproduce the actual operating conditions of the components within the converter. These scenarios highlight an unexpected behavior: the threshold voltage (V<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">TH</sub>) shift as a function of TID is smaller for the SiC MOSFET under high gate bias than under low gate bias.

Finally, the impact of TID on the operation of the DC/DC Buck converter is assessed. The results show that TID alters the dynamic parameters of the MOSFETs and leads to instability in the converter’s output voltage (V<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">OUT</sub>).

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of multimodal machine learning, data security has become a critical bottleneck constraining multimodal artificial intelligence advancement. Multimodal unlearnable examples, as an emerging data protection paradigm, prevent unauthorized model training by disrupting cross-modal semantic consistency through adversarial perturbations and trigger identifiers. However, existing multimodal protection mechanisms suffer from significant robustness deficiencies and security vulnerabilities. This paper conducts a systematic security evaluation of multimodal unlearnable examples and proposes a Cross-Modal Collaborative Recovery (CMCR) attack framework. CMCR integrates Joint Conditional Diffusion Purification for image denoising, Adaptive Text Purification for trigger removal, and Visual Cross-modal BART for cross-modal reconstruction. Experiments demonstrate that CMCR successfully restores image-text retrieval performance to levels approaching clean data across different model architectures, achieving an average recovery rate of 89.0%. Our results reveal that current multimodal unlearnable examples have security vulnerabilities and insufficient robustness against coordinated cross-modal attacks."

Traditional grounding wire installation requires maintenance personnel to manually operate an insulated lever, mechanically rotating it to secure the conductor end of the grounding wire to the equipment conductor. This method is not only labor-intensive and inefficient, but also poses significant risks when working at heights or in confined spaces. To address these issues, this paper proposes a grounding wire insulated operating lever design that enables electrically operated installation and removal without modifying existing insulated levers. A multi-objective optimization method based on the NSGA-III algorithm is employed to improve its overall performance. This design ensures connection reliability while reducing the labor intensity of maintenance personnel and saving on equipment modification and usage costs, providing an effective solution for improving the performance of substation grounding wire installation and removal tools."

    "abstract": "Medical image translation plays a crucial role in assisting clinical diagnosis by enabling cross-modal synthesis (e.g., Computed Tomography to Magnetic Resonance Imaging) and super-resolution, effectively addressing clinical challenges such as radiation exposure, prolonged scan times, and allergic reactions to contrast agents. However, existing approaches primarily focus on developing specialized models for specific tasks, limiting their adaptability across different applications. Developing a general model capable of handling arbitrary medical image translation tasks not only enhances cross-domain generalization but also aligns with the broader trend of artificial intelligence evolving from specialized to general-purpose solutions. Achieving such one-for-all model, however, presents three key challenges: (1) varying task complexity, (2) modality discrepancies, and (3) structural variations across anatomical regions within the same modality. To tackle the first challenge, we utilize an advanced diffusion-based training paradigm to endow the denoising model with extensive pattern coverage capabilities, thereby handling tasks of varying difficulty levels. Subsequently, a General Diffusion Transformer incorporating a Fuzzy Mixture-of-Experts (FMoE) module and an Entropy-guided Attention Soft Prompt (EASP) module is proposed. The FMoE module, equipped with nonlinear modeling capabilities, is designed to address modality discrepancies, while the EASP module is employed to enhance the model's perception of structural variations in images. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model in the arbitrary medical image translation task."

Although PMSMs are known for their high efficiency and robustness, they remain vulnerable to both electrical and mechanical faults, with bearing failures being among the most common. Spectral analysis offers an effective approach for detecting these faults by identifying characteristic frequencies that depend on bearing geometry and rotational speed. Because PMSMs operate at a constant rotational frequency, identifying these fault-related signatures is simpler than in induction motors. This study applies spectral analysis to the diagnosis of bearing faults, with particular attention given to outer ring faults. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method provides accurate and effective detection of bearing failures in PMSMs."

    "abstract": "Semi-active friction dampers (SAFDs), which can adaptively adjust the friction force, function as flexible semi-active control systems for the seismic protection of structures, including buildings exposed to strong ground accelerations. The effectiveness of SAFDs in dissipating seismic energy is highly dependent on the control strategy used to adjust the friction force of dampers. Due to the highly nonlinear and complex nature of buildings equipped with SAFDs, achieving optimal control is challenging and requires advanced adaptive control techniques. In this paper, we propose an intelligent control method based on deep reinforcement learning for the seismic control of buildings with SAFDs. We examine the potential of SAFDs to improve the seismic response of multi-story buildings and present a numerical case study to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed intelligent method. In this case study, the performance of the proposed intelligent control method is compared with two optimization methods and a reference controller: (i) friction dampers (FDs) using a constant friction force that is calibrated using a heuristic approach, (ii) FDs whose friction force is optimized through a Genetic Algorithm (GA), and (iii) SAFDs employing a rule-based approach for adaptive friction force adjustment. It was observed that the proposed DRL approach outperformed the alternatives, for example, achieving up to 63.7 % improvement over the rule-based controller. The core contribution of this study is the formulation of an MDP and reward-design framework that enables DRL to perform real-time friction control in SAFDs integrated into multi-story buildings."

This study addresses the supplier selection and order allocation problem for post-disruption scenarios by developing a mixed integer-linear programming model for epidemic disruptions. The proposed model of this study minimizes the loss of resilience in the presence of supplier fortification for multiple manufacturers, considering a mixed nature of recovery profiles to deal with disruptions. Further, the results are validated on small and medium dataset instances inspired by the Indian automotive supply chain scenario."

    "abstract": "Federated learning is a distributed learning framework with privacy protection; however, data heterogeneity poses significant challenges for federated training. Due to heterogeneous data, client models tend to overfit their local datasets during local training, leading to client drift. Variance reduction-based methods are currently the most popular solutions for addressing client drift; however, their performance deteriorates significantly under low client participation rates. We analyze the limitations of existing variance reduction techniques and attribute them to control variate drift and imbalanced global correction. To address these issues and further constrain client drift, we propose an easy-realization yet effective solution: Federated Proportional Variance Reduction (FedPVR). Specifically, we scale both client gradients and client control variates by a factor that is matched to the client participation rate. This can be viewed as replacing the outdated gradient information associated with each client in the global control variate with their most recent gradients, thereby deriving a closer overall update direction. This approach helps mitigate both client drift and the additional variance introduced by the staleness of control variates. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach under partial client participation. Specifically, under limited client involvement, our method achieves an average accuracy improvement of 2–3% compared to baseline methods and further accelerates the convergence rate."

    "abstract": "ABE as a powerful tool for secure fine-grained access control, has been widely adopted in data-sharing scenarios such as cloud computing. However, most existing traceable and revocable ABE schemes are constructed using bilinear pairings and are thus vulnerable to quantum attacks. Although lattice-based ABE schemes provide post-quantum security, they often lack critical features such as traitor tracing and timely revocation, which may lead to key abuse problem. Some revocable lattice-based schemes are unable to identify the source of leaked keys, while existing traceable and revocable lattice-based schemes also fail to resist collusion attacks between revoked and un-revoked users. In addition, the exposure of attribute values in access policies poses serious privacy risks. To solve the above issues, this paper proposes a traceable and revocable KP-ABE scheme based on RLWE assumption. The proposed scheme embeds the user identity into the key through a white-box tracing mechanism, enabling the system to detect and revoke malicious users in case of key leakage. It also protects attribute privacy by hiding attribute values in the access policy and resists collusion attacks by embedding random parameters in the key. Theoretical analysis and experimental evaluation results show that the proposed scheme ensures security and privacy while maintaining high computational efficiency and is suitable for post-quantum secure data sharing environments."

Our design targets unattended devices like smart gateways or industrial Internet of Things (IoT) nodes, enabling maintainable and owner-controlled deployments.A key contribution is a scalable rollback protection mechanism based on TPM extend-indexes and Enhanced Authorization (EA), which avoids per-device policies and vendor lock-in. Combined with secure storage and remote attestation, our system protects application data against offline access, rollback, and replay attacks.We evaluated our prototype on real hardware, showing moderate performance overheads and strong security properties.

By scanning electrical secondary drawings (including terminal block diagrams, schematic diagrams, and file information), OCR technology extracts critical data such as cable numbers, circuit numbers, core function descriptions, and terminal cabinet connections. These data are then integrated with logical model specifications to automatically generate interface (interface), connection point (point), core, and cable elements in the Substation Physical Description (SPD). The developed front-end and back-end separated logical model generation system achieved $95.1 \\%, 95.6 \\%, 91.8 \\%$, and $89.6 \\%$ conversion rates for interface, point, core, and cable respectively, with an overall success rate exceeding 90%. Verification through actual engineering drawings demonstrates that this method effectively reduces design workload and supports substation digitalization.

To enhance the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) while preserving the transient characteristics of PD pulses, this paper proposes a hybrid adaptive wavelet-threshold denoising method. Based on discrete wavelet multi-scale decomposition, the method first estimates noise at each scale using median absolute deviation combined with standard-deviation constraints, and introduces the proportion of detail-signal energy to construct an energy-guided adaptive threshold. A hybrid threshold function is then employed, which approximately preserves large-amplitude coefficients in a hard-threshold manner while applying piecewise shrinkage to small-amplitude coefficients, thereby achieving differentiated suppression of the PD pulse main lobe and highfrequency noise components. Finally, the denoised PD signal is obtained through wavelet reconstruction. Simulation results demonstrate that, compared with traditional hard and soft thresholding methods, the proposed approach provides superior overall performance in terms of SNR improvement, amplitude preservation, and waveform smoothness."

    "abstract": "Since Differential Evolution (DE) is sensitive to strategy choice, most existing variants pursue performance through adaptive mechanisms or intricate designs. While these approaches focus on adjusting strategies over time, the structural benefits that static strategy diversity may bring remain largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we study the impact of individual-level strategy diversity on DE’s search dynamics and performance, and introduce iStratDE (DE with individual-level strategies), a minimalist variant that assigns mutation and crossover strategies independently to each individual at initialization and keeps them fixed throughout the evolutionary process. By injecting diversity at the individual level without adaptation or feedback, iStratDE cultivates persistent behavioral heterogeneity that is especially effective with large populations. Moreover, its communication-free construction possesses intrinsic concurrency, thereby enabling efficient parallel execution and straightforward scaling for GPU computing. We further provide a convergence analysis of iStratDE under standard reachability assumptions, which establishes the almost-sure convergence of the best-so-far fitness. Extensive experiments on the CEC2022 benchmark suite and robotic control tasks demonstrate that iStratDE matches or surpasses established adaptive DE variants. These results highlight individual-level strategy assignment as a straightforward yet effective mechanism for enhancing DE’s performance.

When a system fault leads to frequency instability, it is of great significance to implement emergency control measures to restore frequency stability. Therefore, an artificial - intelligence - based frequency emergency control approach for power systems, which is founded on knowledge - embedded deep reinforcement learning, is proposed. Initially, the frequency emergency control problem is transformed into a Markov model. A simulation system is employed as the reinforcement learning environment, and a deep reinforcement learning agent is constructed based on the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm. Moreover, theoretical knowledge is utilized to guide the optimization of the action space, and both high - frequency generator tripping and low - frequency load shedding scenarios are comprehensively taken into account. Finally, control effectiveness tests are carried out on the IEEE 39 system. Experimental results indicate that the deep reinforcement learning agent can offer effective frequency emergency control strategies to safeguard system frequency security. Additionally, the knowledge - embedding method enhances the stability of model training, thereby significantly improving the agent’s strategy learning efficiency and decision - making quality."

    "abstract": "Under the background of rigid mid- to long-term planning and the uncertainty of day-ahead generation, renewable energy clusters (RECs) tend to suffer from enlarged forecast deviations and constrained profits in multi-timescale electricity markets. To address this challenge, this paper develops a dayahead game-theoretic pricing strategy for renewable energy clusters considering mid- to long-term and day-ahead forecast deviations. First, a mid- to long-term monthly centralized bidding model is established to capture the scheduling commitments. Then, to handle day-ahead forecast deviations, a cluster agent is introduced, and a day-ahead deviation model is constructed. Based on this, a collaborative control mechanism between the agent and the clusters is proposed to realize the day-ahead gamebased pricing strategy considering forecast deviations. Finally, the simulation results show that, while satisfying the current deviation assessment constraints, the proposed strategy can reduce the total deviation settlement cost and improve the overall profits of the participating clusters, thereby validating the economic efficiency and practical feasibility of the proposed model."

Firstly, by analyzing the time-frequency characteristics of zero-sequence current, Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) is utilized to obtain multi-level detail signals. Seven statistical features, including amplitude, mean, and energy entropy, are calculated to construct a multi-dimensional feature fusion matrix, thereby enhancing the representation capability of faint fault features. Secondly, the SVM algorithm is introduced to resolve the poor reliability of traditional datadriven algorithms under imbalanced sample conditions, leveraging its characteristic where the classification hyperplane is determined by support vectors. Finally, the effectiveness and robustness of the high-impedance fault identification model were validated in a $\\mathbf{1 0 ~ k V}$ distribution network simulation model."

The proposed framework adopts a hierarchical architecture: at the top level, the VLM interprets natural language instructions and visual image to generate task plans; at the middle level, an online RL module refines manipulation policies and ensures adaptive decision-making under environmental uncertainty; and at the bottom level, compliant control based on trajectory planning and impedance regulation enables safe and robust execution. In the feedback, YOLOv5 is used to detect the object, GraspNet is used to obtain the optimal grasp pose, and CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training) is used to judge whether task is completed. Simulations and real-world experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The dual-arm robot successfully performed various cooperative tasks such as grasping, bottle-cap unscrewing, water pouring, and box carrying, achieving an increase in the task success rate from 43% to 100% with online adaptive learning and training. These results demonstrate that the proposed framework effectively bridges high-level reasoning with low-level control, providing a scalable solution for future applications in service robotics, industrial automation, and human-robot collaboration."

To measure the timeliness of the SAT process, we define a novel metric called Age of Correct Sensing (AoCS). To enhance the system's AoCS, we propose a pipelined SAT ISAC (P-SAT ISAC) paradigm, where the MBS simultaneously transmits individual beams to perform sensing and communication. We derive the mathematical expression of the probability of detection (PD), the probability of false alarm (PFA), and the probability of communication outage (PCO), based on which, the AoCS of the P-SAT ISAC is quantified. Furthermore, we formulate an expected AoCS minimization problem by optimizing the power splitting factor for sensing and communication to explore the achievable lower bound of AoCS. Then, the minimum expected AoCS is found by developing a linear search based algorithm. Simulation results validate the theoretical analysis on PD, PFA, and PCO, and also show the impact of system parameters on them, as well as the minimum achievable expected AoCS. Compared with the existing alternating SAT ISAC (A-SAT ISAC), our proposed P-SAT ISAC achieves an average reduction in expected AoCS of 38.97%, demonstrating the efficiency of the proposed pipelined sensing and communication paradigm in improving system timeliness."

The eigenvalue vector (EV) derived from the covariance matrix (CM) of in phase and quadrature (IQ) signals provides a compact yet discriminative statistical representation of signal characteristics. Motivated by this property, we first propose an EV-based SNR estimation method that leverages eigenvalue representations as compact network inputs, effectively reducing feature dimensionality and improving estimation robustness and accuracy under low-SNR conditions. Building upon this foundation, we further propose an IQ-EVNet framework, which directly learns eigenvalue representations from IQ sequences and performs SNR estimation based on the learned features. This design enables end-to-end SNR estimation without explicit CM construction or eigenvalue computation. This design preserves the discriminative capacity of EV features while significantly improving inference efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed IQ EVNet achieves notably higher estimation accuracy than IQ based methods and approaches the performance of the EV-based method, offering an excellent trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency."

    "abstract": "Automatic prompt optimization has recently emerged as a strategy for improving the quality of prompts used in Large Language Models (LLMs), with the goal of generating more accurate and useful responses. However, most prior work focuses on direct prompt refinement or model finetuning, overlooking the potential of leveraging LLMs’ inherent reasoning capability to learn from contrasting examples. In this paper, we present Contrastive Reasoning Prompt Optimization (CRPO), a novel framework that formulates prompt optimization as a retrieval-augmented reasoning process. Our approach retrieves top- k reference prompt-response pairs from the HelpSteer2 dataset, an open-source collection where each response is annotated for helpfulness, correctness, coherence, complexity, and verbosity, and constructs two complementary optimization paradigms: (1) tiered contrastive reasoning, where the LLM compares high-, medium-, and low-quality exemplars (both prompts and responses) to refine its own generation through reflective reasoning, and (2) multi-metric contrastive reasoning, where the LLM analyzes the best exemplars along each evaluation dimension and integrates their strengths into an optimized prompt. By explicitly contrasting high- and lowquality exemplars, CRPO enables the model to deduce why certain prompts succeed while others fail, thereby achieving more robust and interpretable optimization. Experimental results on the HelpSteer2 benchmark demonstrate that CRPO significantly outperforms baselines. Our findings highlight the promise of contrastive, retrieval-augmented reasoning for advancing automatic prompt optimization.<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sup><sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sup>Code is Available at: https://github.com/GitLeo1/CRPO"

As a kind of rotating component, flywheel is the key factor that restricts the life of satellite in orbit. Aiming at the typical anomaly mode of slow increase of in-orbit current of flywheel bearings, a highly sensitive near-real-time accurate monitoring method for the slow increase trend of flywheel bearing current in orbit is proposed, and a flywheel bearing health model based on “speed-current” is established by distributed linear fitting of satellite flywheel speed and bearing current in orbit, and the health model of flywheel bearings is established by distributed linear fitting of satellite flywheel speed and in-orbit telemetry, and it is continuously iteratively updated with the accumulation of telemetry data to solve the problem of highly sensitive real-time assessment of the health state of flywheel bearings and accurate prediction of trends. Simulation shows that compared with the traditional interpretation monitoring method based on telemetry threshold, the abnormal trend of the flywheel can be found within 20 minutes, and the timeliness of anomaly detection is shortened from tens of days to tens of minutes in traditional engineering applications based on the upper and lower limit threshold monitoring methods. This method has been widely used in the long-term monitoring of the flywheel health status of a series of satellites such as TJS, which is conducive to adopting fault plans in advance for non-inductive disposal and ensuring the stability of satellite attitude, which has practical engineering significance."

Besides, we use self-consistency check mechanism to mitigate the hallucination problem. After completing the recognition of privacy information, we perform anonymization operations.

This paper proposes a novel approach for microgrid load forecasting and optimization scheduling based on deep learning with multi- source data fusion. By leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNN) combined with long short-term memory (LSTM) models, the framework processes diverse data inputs including renewable energy production, weather conditions, and historical load patterns to achieve high-accuracy predictions. A particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is employed for scheduling, minimizing operational costs while ensuring grid stability. The methodology incorporates a modified CNN-LSTM architecture with dropout regularization to prevent overfitting, trained on a simulated dataset mimicking real-world microgrid scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance over traditional baselines like ARIMA, with mean absolute error (MAE) reduced by approximately 57% and root mean square error (RMSE) by 57%. Ablation studies confirm the efficacy of key components, while sensitivity analyses highlight parameter impacts. This work contributes to energy management by providing a scalable, robust solution for microgrids, addressing uncertainties from renewables and promoting efficient resource allocation. Future extensions may include real-time adaptive learning and integration with edge computing for enhanced deployment in practical settings."

We calculated an F1-score of 90%+ for the text generated entirely by AI, depending on the LLM used. We found that AI-generated texts, independent of LLM, can be identified through a high kuperman age, i.e. high word complexity, whereby human-written texts are written with higher lexical variation and richness.

    "abstract": "Platforms often provide not only distribution channels for manufacturers and charge commissions, but also engage in direct sales—a phenomenon known as platform encroachment. This trend raises critical questions: why do platforms encroach? In what way do they encroach? What is the impact on the performance of supply chain? To investigate these issues, this paper considers two distinct encroachment strategies: one is strategy D (dual-channel), where the platform retains agent selling while introducing reselling; the other is strategy R (reselling only), where the platform abandons agent selling channel and only implements reselling. By comparing these strategies with a no-encroachment benchmark, our analyses yield several key insights. First, when commission rate is higher, platforms prefer the dual-channel strategy (strategy D). Conversely, under low commission rate, platforms tend to abandon agent selling and only implement reselling (strategy R). The last interesting conclusion is that, in scenarios characterized by high platform reputation and low commission rate, encroachment through Strategy R does not undermine the manufacturer’s profitability; instead, it creates a win-win situation for both players."

Existing tools such as dnstt, TUNS, and iodine, were evaluated and compared through benchmarks using synthetic data. The results indicate that performance can be significantly improved by employing a dynamically adjusting mechanism that adapts the timing between requests based on real-time server-side feedback. This approach achieves better jitter and latency metrics, particularly in bidirectional and high-throughput scenarios. While the current solution uses a static adjustment strategy, the findings indicate that this mechanism is well-suited for further integration with intelligent systems capable of traffic pattern recognition and adaptive control.

    "abstract": "Detecting low-contrast surface defects on highly textured metal components continues to be a key and challenging focus area in automated industrial quality control. Traditional techniques such as classic Anisotropic Diffusion (AD) are hin- dered by the need for time-consuming manual optimization of the gradient threshold parameter (K), which can change due to item surface texture. This paper presents a new Adaptive Anisotropic Diffusion (AAD) algorithm which utilizes a dynamic Z-score computation, in conjunction with, and measurement of the local diffusion coefficient. Z-scores effectively measures the statistical significance of local gradient magnitudes, simplifying the performance of the algorithm and decoupling the algorithm from human performance. Using a dataset of 24 unique and challenging textured metal surfaces, there was a 70% reduction in parameter optimization trials with the proposed method, leading to an overall execution time improvement of as much as 71% when using static-parameters AD. While AAD showed an increase in time per individual diffusion iteration (23% increase) in comparison to static parameters due to the statistical overhead, the reduction in time in the critical parameter optimization trials proved AAD’s performance as a robust and reliable high data processing solution for Industrial quality control applications."

    "abstract": "With the widespread use of Internet in daily life, the scale of network traffic has shown an explosive growth trend. However, malicious activities such as cyberattacks have a severe impact on cybersecurity. An effective countermeasure is to detect abnormal traffic from large-scale network traffic to maintain cybersecurity, but traditional abnormal traffic detection methods are unable to effectively handle current complex and diverse network traffic. The development of artificial intelligence has provided an effective solution, but its performance is influenced by the quality of extracted features. To accurately detect abnormal traffic, this paper proposes a feature extraction method called AD-CAE for network traffic based on a symmetric deep convolutional autoencoder. Firstly, raw network traffic is preprocessed by z-score normalization to transform into the format that can be easily handled by ADCAE model. Then, the multilayer convolution of ADCAE is used to hierarchically extract the features, and the step-size compression strategy of spatial dimension is used to preserve the spatial structure information as well as enlarge the sensory field. Finally, a convolutional block attention module (CBAM) is added at the end of encoder to highlight the key features by learning channel weights through global pooling and fully connected layers. Experimental results on two widely used network traffic datasets show that the features extracted by ADCAE achieve better performance on three detection models."

    "abstract": "Some advanced methods have leveraged the zero-shot recognition capability of the contrastive language–image pretraining (CLIP) model and adapted it to weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS), achieving promising performance. However, they primarily use CLIP as an auxiliary feature extractor, leaving the fundamental limitations of class activation mapping unresolved, particularly in preserving fine-grained object boundaries and achieving precise pixelwise localization under sparse supervision. To address these challenges, this article proposes a novel end-to-end WSSS framework WTCLIP, which aims to fully exploit the potential of CLIP for weakly supervised segmentation tasks. Different from traditional methods that use CLIP only as a static feature extractor, we innovatively introduce a learnable wavelet transform decoder to enhance the information extraction capability and significantly improve the model's perception of object boundaries. We dynamically adjust the weight distribution ratio of the CLIP feature layer, capture multiscale edge information, and make full use of the time–frequency localization characteristics of the wavelet transform to significantly improve the quality of pseudolabels and achieve more accurate semantic segmentation. Experimental results show that our method significantly improves the performance of the WSSS task on two public benchmark datasets, notably by <bold xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">4.0%</b> over the state-of-the-art methods, especially in capturing weakly annotated object boundary details."

    "abstract": "Generative diffusion models (GDMs) have recently shown great success in synthesizing multimedia signals with high perceptual quality enabling highly efficient semantic communications in future wireless networks. In this paper, we develop an intent-aware generative semantic multicasting framework utilizing pre-trained diffusion models. In the proposed framework, the transmitter decomposes the source signal to multiple semantic classes based on the multi-user intent, i.e. each user is assumed to be interested in details of only a subset of the semantic classes. To better utilize the wireless resources, the transmitter sends to each user only its intended classes, and multicasts a highly compressed semantic map to all users over shared wireless resources that allows them to locally synthesize the other classes, i.e. non-intended classes, utilizing pre-trained diffusion models. The signal retrieved at each user is thereby partially reconstructed and partially synthesized utilizing the received semantic map. We design a communication/computation-aware scheme for per-class adaptation of the communication parameters, such as the transmission power and compression rate to minimize the total latency of retrieving signals at multiple receivers, tailored to the prevailing channel conditions as well as the users' reconstruction/synthesis distortion/perception requirements. The simulation results demonstrate significantly reduced per-user latency compared with non-generative and intent-unaware multicasting benchmarks while maintaining high perceptual quality of the signals retrieved at the users. For a typical setup of multicasting street scene images to 10 users, our proposed framework achieves a <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$15.4\\%$</tex-math></inline-formula> reduction in per-user latency at a fixed power budget, or equivalently <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$50\\%$</tex-math></inline-formula> reduction in the transmission power required to achieve a fixed per-user latency, compared with non-generative multicasting."

    "abstract": "Vendor alias attribution is a critical but under-explored challenge in cyber-threat intelligence. Hackers frequently operate under multiple aliases across marketplaces to evade detection, manipulate reputation systems, or rebrand after scams—complicating efforts to track activity, analyze behavior, or disrupt operations. Progress is hindered by the absence of labeled ground truth across markets and the reliance of prior work on single-signal heuristics, manually constructed alias pairs, or limited-scale evaluation. In this paper, we propose a fully automated framework for cross-market alias matching using recent Tor marketplace data focused on criminal hacking. Our two-phase approach trains supervised models on labeled vendor data from one market and applies them to listings from unseen markets. To evaluate predictions, we introduce the Oracle, a multi-signal mechanism that triangulates evidence from usernames, image similarity, and textual signature patterns. This evaluation layer—ranging from single-signal to composite triplets—enables high-confidence alias confirmation and is assessed through a manual audit that estimates the Confirmed Positive Ratio (CPR) across tiers. As part of this audit, we present case studies that demonstrate how reliance on single signals—such as usernames—can lead to false matches. Our framework achieves 0.68 F1-score in alias prediction across 25 markets, yielding a performance gain of up to 61% over the most competitive baseline. By combining cross-market modeling with automated multi-signal validation, our approach strengthens cyber defense through trustworthy forensics for alias attribution."

Differential privacy (DP) has been adopted to mitigate such leakages efficiently, yet existing DP-enhanced schemes are limited to single-user settings, lacking support for multi-user data sharing under diverse privacy needs. In such settings, distinct encryption keys and heterogeneous privacy levels raise two critical challenges: (i) leakage amplification, a prevalent yet under-explored threat where adversaries infer keywords from low-privacy data and link them to high-privacy data in cross-user retrieval; and (ii) inefficient privilege management, where cross-user search requires cumbersome key transmissions and frequent updates due to changing privileges. To bridge these challenges, we propose DPE-MUSE, a DP-Enhanced Multi-User Searchable Encryption scheme that achieves secure mutual retrieval while hiding access and size patterns. At its core is an adaptive keyword-level budget allocation strategy that derives budgets from data distributions and mitigates cross-user inference. A unified key management strategy further eliminates direct key sharing and streamlines privilege updates. Experiments on the Enron dataset show that DPE-MUSE achieves high recall (98.96%) under strict privacy requirements with relative low overhead, requiring only 58.951 ms for budget computation on a dataset of size 2<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">14</sup>."

First, a hybrid coupler is designed, with CPT serving as the main energy transfer channel. By reusing the compensation inductor as the coupler of IPT, the integration level of the system is improved. Then, a frequency-variable reconfiguration strategy with single-switch control is introduced to enable constant current (CC) and constant voltage (CV) output modes.

Experimental results demonstrate that the system delivers 218.8 W with 86.38% efficiency in CC mode at 750 kHz and 216.6 W with 81.39% efficiency in CV mode at 778 kHz.

Current network architectures often lead to resource fragmentation and performance bottlenecks because routing decisions are decoupled from the dynamic, intrinsic processing loads of network nodes. This fundamental disconnect creates inefficiencies and security risks that undermine the entire CPN substrate. To address this, we introduce GAT-GRPO, a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) framework designed for the fine-grained Joint Routing and in-Network Processing Placement (JR-PP) task. GAT-GRPO features a novel dual-path Graph Attention Network (GAT) that explicitly models the distinct heterogeneity of link states and nodal capacity. To master the complex combinatorial action space, we are the first to leverage Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)—a stable, critic-free algorithm—for network resource orchestration. Extensive evaluations show GAT-GRPO boosts network revenue by 3.7%-5.3% over latest baselines. Mininet emulations further validate its superiority, with a 6.7% reduction in peak queue length and a 6% decrease in peak link utilization against the latest DRL agent. Our work delivers a practical, high-performance solution for foundational resource orchestration in CPNs, enabling a more intelligent and resilient networking substrate for higher-level services."

To address this issue, this paper proposes a switching control strategy based on predictive model. The switching system consists of the faulty heat exchanger (FHE) and the CHE. Using the model predictive control (MPC) approach, the predictive model calculates the optimal control inputs for the CHE, reducing the temperature jump to just $1.4^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$-a substantial improvement over the $52^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ observed with manual adjustment.

Conventional modulation strategies for CHB inverters face challenges in simultaneously achieving optimal output voltage harmonic characteristics and active power balancing among cascaded units. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel power-balancing modulation strategy based on carrier cycle adjustment for nine-level CHB inverters with full modulation ratio range. The proposed method extends conventional Phase Disposition (PD) modulation by synchronously rearranging the carriers above and below the time axis, thereby creating a new carrier period cycle that can improve the output of internal power units. Within this framework, duty cycle expressions for each cascaded unit are derived, and the corresponding fundamental voltage components are analytically obtained. The analysis demonstrates that the proposed strategy achieves effective power balancing across all cascaded units within a single fundamental cycle. Finally, both simulation and experimental results confirm the effectiveness and practicality of the method."

Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated remarkable performance in the field of multi-view synthesis. Although some 3D Gaussian-based methods have proposed frameworks for single tasks, they lack effective capabilities for generalizable multi-task solutions. Therefore, we propose SE-GS, a joint optimization framework that combines a sensor enhancement network with 3D Gaussian parameters. Our innovations include: We introduce a self-supervised learning module that can achieve adaptive task optimization. We propose a perception enhancement module based on frequency-domain transformations to adaptively acquire pixel masks for degraded interference. We propose a coarse-to-fine feature optimization method based on geometry-optical flow to reduce the model size, thereby improving training speed and eliminating artifacts. We propose a joint optimization loss module that includes multi-view consistency loss and structural similarity loss to achieve rendering optimization.Our method can adapt to multi-task constraints and demonstrate good generalizability. It avoids the view separation caused by decoupled training and reconstruction, which significantly reduces reconstruction artifacts caused by sensor degradation. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple datasets demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance in rendering and real-time metrics compared to state-of-the-art methods."

This study uses one year of high-frequency SCADA data to investigate the thermal sensitivity of a 2 MW wind turbine. By accounting for air density effects and deviations from expected performance, the analysis evaluates how temperature variations influence power generation. Even under favorable wind conditions, the results indicate measurable power losses during hotter periods, suggesting that thermal stress contributes to efficiency reduction and irregular turbine operation. These findings highlight the importance of considering thermal effects when evaluating turbine performance and developing operational strategies in extreme environments."

    "abstract": "Winding deformation is an important contributor to power transformer faults and forced outages. Effective and mature online detection methods are still lacking. The online frequency response analysis (FRA) method is a promising candidate for further development. A major obstacle in online FRA is the strong interference posed by the high-amplitude power-frequency load current (hundreds of amperes) to the extremely weak FRA test signal at the sub-milliampere level. This paper proposes a single-coil, three-phase parallel-connected sensing system, which employs three identical coil-type current sensors. Its capability to suppress power-frequency interference while measuring high-frequency signals has been theoretically analyzed and experimentally validated. An online measurement system based on it was applicated on an operating 110 kV power transformer. Field measurements verified that the proposed single-coil sensing system suppresses power-frequency interference by a factor of 100. Furthermore, the new frequency response functions derived from the online current signals exhibited resonance features closely aligned with the conventional offline FRA method, confirming the method's stability and suitability for diagnosing winding deformation in in-service power transformers."

    "abstract": "We address joint capacity planning and day-ahead dispatch for a multi-microgrid system under renewable and load uncertainty. A two-stage robust co-optimization is formulated as a mixed-integer linear program: the master minimizes annualized investment plus an upper bound on operating cost, and the subproblem selects adversarial wind/ $\\mathbf{P V}$ and load from interval sets to maximize cost. The model enforces mutual exclusivity of grid buy/sell and battery charge/discharge, intertemporal SOC balance constraints with bounds and initialization, grid-exchange caps, and device limits. An iterative scenario-cut loop tightens the lower bound and closes the LB-UB gap. Implemented in MATLAB/YALMIP with Gurobi as the MILP solver, the framework is evaluated on a 24 -hour, fourmicrogrid dataset. Experiments report convergence diagnostics, zero violations of exclusivity/SOC constraints across adversarial scenarios, the resulting capacity mix and cost decomposition, and sensitivities to uncertainty widths and price perturbations. Results yield feasible, economical schedules with a small primaldual gap and a stable capacity plan, reducing the under sizing risk inherent in deterministic planning while remaining computationally tractable and reproducible."

Manual extraction is slow and labor-intensive, while traditional Optical Character Recognition (OCR) techniques often struggle with complex layouts and overlapping symbols, resulting in unstructured outputs. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel hybrid deep learning framework for structured information extraction by integrating an Oriented Bounding Box (OBB) detection model with a transformer-based document parsing model (Donut). An in-house annotated dataset is used to train YOLOv11 for detecting nine key categories: Geometric Dimensioning and Tolerancing (GD&T), General Tolerances, Measures, Materials, Notes, Radii, Surface Roughness, Threads, and Title Blocks. Detected OBBs are cropped into images and labeled to fine-tune Donut for structured JSON output. Fine-tuning strategies include a single model trained across all categories and category-specific models. Results show that the single model consistently outperforms category-specific ones across all evaluation metrics, achieving higher precision (94.77% for GD&T), recall (100% for most categories), and F1 score (97.3%), while reducing hallucinations (5.23%). The proposed framework improves accuracy, reduces manual effort, and supports scalable deployment in precision-driven industries."

The emergence of adversarial training poses a critical challenge: attackers now leverage publicly available WF defenses to create augmented training data. This data augmentation strategy, as demonstrated in S&P’23, dramatically strengthens attack models’ robustness. Consequently, many existing defenses have become ineffective against these enhanced adversaries. We propose FRONT-R and its combination with TrafficSliver, called FRONT-RS, to counter this threat through two key innovations:(1) disrupting trace patterns by injecting randomized dummy packets at feature-rich front segments instead of fixed single-packet insertion, and (2) trace splitting through multi-path routing. In adversarial training environments, FRONT-R demonstrates superior performance over FRONT with 10% accuracy reduction in closed world and lower F1 in open world settings. When synergized with TrafficSliver, the layered approach achieves over 20% accuracy reduction compared to standalone methods while maintaining equivalent data overhead."

    "abstract": "This study addresses the problem of fault diagnosis and fault-tolerant control in gas turbine systems, with a focus on sensor faults in the combustion chamber. In the first phase, a data-driven fault diagnosis framework is proposed using sensor datasets combined with wavelet decomposition for feature extraction. The decomposed signals capture both time and frequency-domain characteristics, enhancing fault sensitivity. These features are then classified using a Random Forest (RF) classifier, which is benchmarked against Support Vector Regression (SVR) and other traditional machine learning methods. Experimental results demonstrate that the RF-based model achieves superior accuracy and robustness in identifying temperature sensor faults under varying operational conditions.In the second phase, a fault-tolerant control strategy is developed to ensure continued safe operation despite detected faults. The control system employs a switched control structure, where a classical state feedback controller is used under fault-free conditions, and a robust controller is activated in the presence of faults. The switching mechanism is governed by a Bernoulli distribution-based probabilistic model, which captures the intermittent nature of sensor faults. The robust controller is implemented as a cascade state-feedback controller, specifically designed for the combustion chamber dynamics. Simulation results confirm that the proposed approach effectively stabilizes the system and maintains performance despite sensor degradations, offering a reliable solution for modern gas turbine control under uncertainty."

The proposed method continuously monitors feature statistics and computes drift magnitudes between consecutive data windows to identify relevant and evolving attributes. Features with significant drift are retained for model updates, while irrelevant ones are discarded, thereby enhancing computational efficiency. The retained features are incrementally trained using an AdaBoost–Hoeffding Tree ensemble, allowing continuous adaptation without retraining from scratch.

However, their widespread use also exposes them to various security threats. A flaw in protocol implementation can be exploited to compromise system security, leading to severe disruptions or unauthorized access. Fuzzing has become a widely used technique for protocol vulnerability detection. However, the existing protocol fuzzing approaches often lack effective guidance strategies for exploring the complex protocol state space, which leads to limited coverage and suboptimal testing efficiency.In this paper, we propose BayesFuzz, a Bayesian-guided greybox fuzzing approach for stateful protocols. It maintains a probability table to record the probability of sending different messages and triggering different state transitions in the current state. This table is updated via Bayesian inference based on feedback from each fuzzing iteration. Accordingly, BayesFuzz is able to select the optimal message for the current state during test case generation, thereby improving fuzzing efficiency in complex stateful protocols. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of BayesFuzz. Compared with state-of-the-art fuzzers BooFuzz and AFLNET, BayesFuzz increases branch coverage by averagely 23.18% and 45.3% within 24 hours. Furthermore, it successfully discovered an unknown vulnerability in the MQTT protocol implementation."

However, these approaches exhibit significant limitations in parameter adjustment: they heavily rely on expert knowledge, are prone to human errors, and incur substantial economic costs. To address these challenges, this study proposes an asynchronous dual-level optimization framework for control system performance enhancement. In this architecture, the inner layer employs conventional control optimization techniques to tune system parameters, while the outer layer integrates machine learning to analyze optimization trajectories and estimate process states in real-time. Specifically, a random forest algorithm dynamically adjusts optimization parameters to achieve concurrent improvements in both economic performance and operational efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate that automated parameter tuning significantly improves the optimization efficiency of steam generators while simultaneously enhancing economic performance."

    "abstract": "Shoplifting is a growing operational and economic challenge for retailers, with incidents rising and losses increasing despite extensive video surveillance. Continuous human monitoring is infeasible, motivating automated, privacy-preserving, and resource-aware detection solutions. In this paper, we cast shoplifting detection as a pose-based, unsupervised video anomaly detection problem and introduce a periodic adaptation framework designed for on-site Internet of Things (IoT) deployment. Our approach enables edge devices in smart retail environments to adapt from streaming, unlabeled data, supporting scalable and low-latency anomaly detection across distributed camera networks. To support reproducibility, we introduce <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">RetailS</i><sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sup>, a new large-scale real-world shoplifting dataset collected from a retail store under multi-day, multi-camera conditions, capturing unbiased shoplifting behavior in realistic IoT settings.

However, their practical operation is constrained by uncertainties and variations in user loads. This paper addresses uncertainties in wind power output and the indirect carbon emission intensity of the grid within PIES, while incorporating user-side demand response. A bi-level optimization model is constructed: the upper level is a two-stage distributionally robust optimization model for PIES, and the lower level is a user demand response model. The model is transformed into a solvable single-level mixed-integer linear programming problem using the column-and-constraint generation (C&CG) algorithm and Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. Case study results demonstrate that the proposed method enhances economic efficiency while ensuring system robustness, effectively balancing renewable energy integration, carbon emission, and economic operation."

This paper proposes a reactive power compensation control method that considering the impedance variation of overhead ground wires during the ice-melting process, addressing the need for matching the AC ice-melting current with the line icing conditions. The method utilizes feedback control of reactive power compensation capacitor switching based on the impedance variation of the ground wire during ice-melting, to achieve the desired matching and adjustment of the AC ice-melting current. A theoretical model is first established to describe the impact of ground wire temperature and sag variation on impedance, then dynamic impedance-based reactive power compensation capacity and matching methods are derived considering the ground wire temperature rise constraints. A simulation model of aluminum-clad steel strand and composite optical cable ground wire, combined with actual capacitor switching of the compensation device, is used to calculate the reactive power compensation capacity and control strategy during the ice-melting process, validating the effectiveness of theoretical model. The designed method achieves high control accuracy, providing a more flexible and adjustable current feedback control solution for overhead ground wire AC ice-melting."

This requires a more sophisticated and holistic approach, i.e., a systems thinking approach. This method aims to account for this impact and addresses the complexity of contemporary skills forecasting. A multi-layer approach commences with a bibliometric analysis, illustrating the technological evolution of skills according to a sector-specific search and a multi-country analysis. The results illustrate an increase in publications corresponding to technological advancements in each sector. The impact of specific technological advancements, such as artificial intelligence, has a significant impact on skills research. This analysis compares skills associated with healthcare jobs advertised on job sites in South Africa and the USA. A network illustration tool offers a novel approach to job requirements per country. Analysis using the job descriptions allows further insights into the requirements of jobs in the healthcare field. The level of technological integration of South Africa is less well developed than in the USA. The novelty of this study lies in the systems thinking approach to skills forecasting by combining two sources of data and multiple layers of analysis."

    "abstract": "Image steganography faces inherent trade-offs among embedding capacity, undetectability, and visual fidelity. To address this, we propose iSME, a novel GAN framework for image steganography with a Median-Enhanced Channel-Spatial (MECS) attention mechanism. The MECS module integrates channel attention and multi-scale spatial attention, enhancing feature representation while reducing embedding-induced distortion. The framework includes a generator (for embedding), an extractor (for recovery), and a discriminator based on XuNet, trained with the Wasserstein GAN objective for stability. Experiments on COCO and DIV2K datasets show that iSME outperforms SOTA methods (such as HiDDeN, SteganoGAN, CHAT-GAN) across 1–5 bits per pixel (BPP). Notably, at 5 BPP, it achieves PSNR of 41.93 (COCO) and 45.52 (DIV2K), with high SSIM and extraction accuracy (>91%), and stego images are nearly imperceptible. Ablation studies validate the critical role of MECS. This work provides a promising approach for high-capacity, secure, and high-fidelity image steganography."

Container - based shipping remains a cornerstone of global trade, where maximizing stowage density directly reduces cost and carbon emissions. This study addresses a three - dimensional container loading problem by extending the Sub-Volume Based Simulated Annealing Algorithm (SVBSA) method to allow full XYZ - axis rotation of rectangular parallelepiped. We introduce a metaheuristic that considers six possible directional degrees of freedom in addition to the stability of the load. Finally, benchmark experiments show that loading efficiency can be improved by strategically introducing 3D rotation by limiting the timing at which it is allowed, rather than always allowing it, and by introducing it in a strategic manner."

Nine senior experts provided pairwise judgements that satisfied the AHP consistency threshold. The aggregated weights indicate that Technology is the dominant pillar, followed by People and Process. At a sub-factor level, knowledge & skills, cybersecurity, and technical performance of digital twin (DT) components emerge as top priorities. A five-scenario sensitivity analysis posited a 20% variation in the Technology weight, while redistributing the residual to People and Process. All technology-centric sub-factors remained within the top five, and no process-centric sub-factor rose above fifth place, indicating that the priority structure is robust to moderate weight changes. The results provide an evidence-based roadmap for staged DT roll-out, highlight the need for strong cybersecurity and workforce up-skilling, and furnish researchers with a validated PPT hierarchy for future comparative studies."

Current research urgently needs to break through the performance bottlenecks of lightweight models to achieve efficient deployment. This paper analyzes the performance of LLMs of different scales in content moderation tasks and investigates the fine-tuning methods for small LLMs under the conditions of scarce training data and high privacy requirements. This paper proposes a rule-constrained method for regulating Chinese text content. By drawing on the multi-stage training process of the DeepSeek-R1 model and the concept of Agent technology, it adopts a multi-role collaboration framework to generate domain-specific sample data based on rules, and establishes an end-to-end construction process for fine-tuning datasets oriented to the Chinese content moderation domain. Fine-tuning small LLMs using the generated sample data effectively transfers the capabilities of large LLMs to small LLMs. Sufficient experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed method: it increases the accuracy of the DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B model by 48.1% while reducing its miss rate by 33.56%; it improves the accuracy of the Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct model by 29.07% and decreases its miss rate by 32.87%."

These artifacts generate heterogeneous metadata features, which are distributed across various repositories. In addition, large language models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools and are now being extensively adopted to facilitate a wide range of tasks across domains, ranging from information extraction to knowledge graphs. Nevertheless, numerous open questions persist regarding their adoption in diversified research disciplines, especially concerning their accuracy, robustness, biases, and societal impact when applied in the context of research metadata, scholarly information extraction, and open science.

This study addresses this gap through a systematic literature review of LMD research published between 2019 and 2025, following the PRISMA framework. Out of 162 screened publications, 33 were analyzed using bibliometric mapping in R and methodological clustering in Python. The analysis identifies four methodological streams: optimization and mathematical modeling, simulation and heuristics, multi-criteria and learning models, and literature-based analytical studies. Beyond classification, the study highlights critical gaps, including the limited integration of behavioral factors, financial trade-offs, and policy implications.

The assessment used validated criteria across technical, economic, environmental, and application-specific domains. The study presents three methodologies enhancing decision-making processes. A reciprocal-based fusion algorithm maintaining decision consistency while managing uncertainty, and a Methodology Dependency Analysis quantifying ranking sensitivity across MCDM approaches. Finally, a dual-phase sensitivity framework combining MDA with Monte Carlo simulations. Results indicate significant prioritization shifts, with efficiency dominating AHP (weight = 0.33) while FAHP yields equitable distribution, elevating environmental considerations (weight = 0.12). Ranking divergences revealed inverse correlation (r = -0.76), where orange peel extract led in AHP (0.243) and FAHP favoured cassava peel extract (0.18).

    "abstract": "Dance is an art form that conveys a wide range of emotions through the fusion of visual movement and music. Yet emotional expression in dance is inherently ambiguous: the emotions intended by the dancer do not always match those perceived by the audience. Although this ambiguity can hinder accurate transmission, it also offers creative opportunities for interpretive flexibility and diversity. This study explores whether such ambiguity can be harnessed by introducing olfactory stimuli alongside conventional audiovisual cues to modulate the audience’s emotional perception. We conducted a user study with a wearable aroma display that emits scents synchronized with the dance music. Twenty-five participants watched seven dance videos and rated the degree to which each conveyed Joy, Anger, Sadness, and Pleasure on a 7-point Likert scale under five conditions: one no-scent control condition and four scented conditions (Orange, Peppermint, Lavender, and Banana). The results showed that scent significantly alters the emotions perceived in the dances, and that the direction and magnitude of this effect depend on the specific dance–scent pairing. Notably, even for the same dance, different scents elicited different emotional impressions; conversely, the emotional impact of a given scent varied across dances. These findings establish scent as a novel modality for shaping the emotional perception of dance."

    "abstract": "The rapid growth of the Muslim population has significantly increased the demand for halal products for food security and services across various sectors. However, challenges such as cross-contamination and halal certification fraud continue to undermine the integrity of the halal food supply chain. In response, Halal Food Tracer, a web-based information system, was developed to facilitate the exchange of information about halal products and ensure halal compliance across the supply chain. This study evaluates the system's usability in supporting its adoption by Muslim communities. Data was collected through user testing and questionnaires based on the ISO/IEC 25023 model and processed using multiple linear regression techniques. The analysis revealed a user satisfaction score of 3.61 out of 5.00. The study found that User Interface Aesthetics, Accessibility, and User Error Protection were the most influential factors on user satisfaction, with regression coefficients of 0.316, 0.293, and 0.150, respectively."

    "abstract": "This study explores the application of machine learning (ML) techniques for fault diagnosis in high-voltage direct current (HVDC) systems, with a focus on generalization to previously unseen fault conditions. A line-commutated converter (LCC) HVDC system was modeled in MATLAB/Simulink to simulate a variety of fault scenarios, from which statistical features were extracted. Seven ML models—logistic regression, support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), decision tree, random forest, gradient boosting, and multi-layer perceptron (MLP)—were assessed. Two evaluation protocols were applied: a conventional random data split and a more rigorous generalization test involving unseen fault resistances. Results show that random forest, gradient boosting, and MLP achieved the most robust performance, with random forest delivering the highest accuracy under generalization. The findings underscore the necessity of incorporating generalization testing to ensure reliable and, real-world-applicable HVDC fault diagnosis."

    "abstract": "Thanks to the advent and rapid development of fog computing, the smart grid has made great progress. In fog-based smart grid, the fog node can maintain and handle the data for the smart meter which is resource-constraint, thus improving the performance. However, the security of the data (especially for malicious data reservation) is the primary concern of the smart meter. To resist the malicious outsourced data reservation in fog-based smart grid, we propose a provable deletion method in this article. In our method, we first improve the Merkle hash tree and design a novel tree named Merkle position index hash tree (MPIHT). For maintaining the same number of data blocks, MPIHT can reduce the height of the tree since it is able to store plenty of data blocks in every leaf. At the same time, the number of data blocks in every leaf would be changeably, thus supporting data deletion operation. Subsequently, we use MPIHT to propose a secure and provable deletion method for outsourced data. Our method can guarantee data integrity and achieve provable data deletion, requiring neither a trusted third party nor any complex calculations or protocols. Moreover, we demonstrate the security analysis to formally prove that our method can meet the expected requirements. Finally, we also implement our method to assess the performance. The assessment results disclose the efficiency advantages of our method over some existing methods."

Timely and precise identification is crucial for effective intervention and enhanced patient outcomes. Throughout the past few years, deep learning (DL) has become known for a transformative approach in medical image analysis, delivering superior performance relative to traditional machine learning (ML) methods by independently recognising complex, distinguishing features from imaging data. This research presents a comparative analysis of various sophisticated DL architectures, including ResNet, Xception, Inception, and MobileNet, for the automated diagnosis and classification of lung illnesses using medical imaging modalities like as chest X-rays. A big open-access dataset is utilised by applying enhancement and preliminary processing techniques together to boost generalisability and robustness. Essential performance indicators like as F1-score, sensitivity, and accuracy are used to assess the models. The findings highlight the merits and limitations of each architecture and provide insights into their suitability for real clinical applications. This comparative investigation improves computer-aided diagnostic systems and supports progress in creating robust, interpretable, and clinically relevant AI techniques for pneumonia detection."

By optimizing the wake-up frequency for checking signals from the base unit, standby power consumption was maintained at an ultra-low 65 μW. Operational testing of the prototype system were conducted at a hydroelectric power plant, and it was found to be able to supply sufficient power for more than one month when using any of the EHs as a power source: thermoelectric, magnetic field, or window-side solar cell.

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of Artificial Intelligence, fake data are being generated and circulated on an unprecedented scale. While such data may be entertaining in some contexts, data collectors are generally reluctant to accept them due to concerns about service quality and security risks. A central challenge, therefore, is how to incentivise contributors to provide authentic data. Existing research has mainly focused on regulating the use of fake data, with limited attention to designing mechanisms that motivate contributors to share real data. In this paper, we propose a pricing strategy with an embedded incentive mechanism that ensures contributors obtain higher financial benefits from sharing real data rather than fake data. We formulate the problem as a Stackelberg game, where the data collector acts as the leader and contributors are the followers. To enhance reliability, we integrate a peer-review method to help verify data authenticity, which in turn informs the incentive-compatible pricing design. We establish the existence and uniqueness of the equilibrium solution, and further conduct numerical simulations to demonstrate the equilibrium-seeking process and the influence of key parameters."

    "abstract": "Effective integration of security controls is essential to safeguard organizational assets and ensure security compliance and operational resilience. In particular, organizations having DevOps often face critical challenges in the practical implementation and governance of these controls, which can significantly compromise their ability to maintain a robust security posture. In response to these challenges, a governance framework was developed to systematically address critical gaps; and guide security practitioners in integrating security controls throughout the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). Verifying this framework is critical to ensure its applicability and alignment with security requirements in dynamic IT environments. To achieve this, empirical validation and structured sessions were conducted with subject matter experts (SMEs) and experienced security practitioners. The sessions used real-world use cases and evaluation techniques to elicit feedback on the reliability, adaptability, and general effectiveness of the framework. This study outlines the results of the validation process and identifies potential enhancements to consider before the framework is deployed. The findings indicated that the framework is well-structured and aligned with industry best practices and security standards, such as NIST SP <sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sup> and ISO 27001 <sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>. In addition, all participants affirmed the comprehensiveness, traceability, and readiness of the framework for automation. It can be used effectively as a practical guide for managing security controls in both traditional and agile development environments. Ultimately, the insights gained from the feedback guided a series of refinements to improve the usability of the framework and ensure better alignment with the operational contexts of the real world."

    "abstract": "The core challenge in location privacy protection for location-based services (LBS) remains balancing location privacy and data utility. Differential privacy, backed by mathematical proofs, offers an effective framework for location protection. However, existing extended differential privacy methods for this purpose have some limitations. On one hand, most such methods focus on Euclidean spaces, making them ill-suited for road network-based LBS. They fail to align with road network contexts, potentially disrupting path planning, and often introduce excessive noise that inflates distance loss and degrades service quality. On the other hand, location semantics, a critical component of data utility, are frequently overlooked. Their degradation directly undermines utility. To address these issues, this paper introduces Semantic-Graph-Indistinguishability (SEM-G-IND) within the differential privacy paradigm, aiming to enhance location protection under road network and semantic constraints. First, a POI-based location semantic hash is designed to quantify location semantics. Then, integrating semantic distance and shortest path distance, a novel graph-based metric, Semantic-Graph-Distance (SGD), is proposed to measure inter-location distances. Finally, based on SGD, we propose a semantic penalty-based differential privacy (SPDP) location protection mechanism under road networks that satisfies ϵ-SEM-G-IND. We validated on real-world datasets that the SPDP mechanism effectively reduces the semantic loss of locations while ensuring minimal path distance loss, and it is feasible in terms of time overhead."

    "abstract": "Large-scale, dynamic multi-objective optimization problems (LSDMOPs) extend traditional DMOPs into high-dimensional decision spaces, reflecting the growing complexity of real-world dynamic systems. However, the effectiveness of existing dynamic multi-objective evolutionary algorithms is severely limited for LSDMOPs, due to inadequate training data, predictions in unknown environments, and large-scale dynamic search spaces. To address these challenges, we propose a diffusion learning-based evolutionary framework, inspired by the intrinsic analogy between iterative evolution of optimization search and stepwise denoising of diffusion model. Firstly, a new training paradigm is designed to treat evolutionary trajectories of population across environments as a learnable supervised source, thereby constructing rich training data to learn the changing patterns of optimal regions in dynamic fitness landscapes. Secondly, we introduce a trajectory alignment loss which encourages the stepwise denoising process to conform to the true population evolutionary behaviors in terms of spatial exploration, convergence trends, and boundary adaptation. Thirdly, a conditional diffusion model-based evolutionary strategy is proposed, which can gradually control denoising direction and intensity using predefined conditions, thereby generating optimization paths from noise toward Pareto-optimal solutions in a new environment. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art designs on a typical dynamic multi-objective test suite and real-world large-scale dynamic scenarios."

Firstly, an improved PSO algorithm incorporating dynamic inertia weight, adaptive learning factors, and differential evolution mutation operations is designed. Combined with a non-uniform time interpolation strategy, it performs trajectory planning aimed at minimizing end-point vibration. To counteract external disturbances, a composite controller integrating a nonlinear disturbance observer (NDO) and sliding mode control (SMC) is developed to achieve real-time disturbance estimation and compensation. MATLAB simulation results demonstrate that: compared with standard PSO and other algorithms, the trajectory planned by the improved PSO algorithm significantly suppresses residual end-point vibration, accelerates convergence speed, and effectively restrains modal vibrations; the designed NDO-SMC controller enables both rotary and telescopic joints to track desired trajectories rapidly and without overshoot, while the NDO accurately estimated disturbances with minimal error. This study provides an effective integrated solution for highprecision, low-vibration control of hybrid-structure flexible manipulators."

Then, employing an integrated analytical framework that combines the Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) and Interpretive Structural Modelling (ISM) methodologies, this study can identify the structural relationship between 14 drivers. The most pivotal driver is the level of trust in the security and effectiveness of digital technology, as well as the expected long-term strategic benefits. Other essential drivers include technical readiness for digitalization, the digital competencies of human resources, and the willingness of all parties in MSMEs to actively engage in the digitalization process. This comprehensive analysis highlights the interrelationships between these drivers and provides insights into proposed strategy recommendations that promote digital adoption in the MSMEs sector."

Conventional threshold-based alarms typically react only after a fault occurs, limiting opportunities for preventive maintenance. This paper proposes a rule-based fault detection framework driven by SCADA data, combining reference modeling, wind-speed clustering, and decision-tree logic to enhance interpretability and diagnostic precision. The method establishes reference profiles for power, rotational speed, temperature, and pitch angle across different aerodynamic operating zones, derived from manufacturer specifications. Deviations from these references are converted into severity indices that highlight abnormal behavior. Applied to a Siemens Gamesa G97 2 MW turbine, the framework detected consistent deviations in key parameters shortly before the built-in alarms were triggered. Future work will focus on integrating data-driven approaches to further improve predictive accuracy and adaptability."

Moreover, they often neglect the individual preferences of users for different keywords. To overcome these limitations, we propose SSKQ-UP, a novel and efficient privacy-preserving spatial keyword query scheme that supports personalized ranking. The index structure of SSKQ-UP is an R-tree based on Geohash code, called HR-tree. The internal nodes of HR-tree store Geohash codes to achieve rapid spatial pruning. The leaf nodes store the Geohash code of the spatial objects and the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) vectors, facilitating filtering based on the spatial range and keywords. Users can submit queries with weight vectors to reflect their keyword preferences. The cloud computes cosine similarity between the query weight vector and the TF-IDF vectors of candidate objects to identify the top-k most relevant results. To ensure privacy, both index and query vectors are encrypted using an Enhanced Asymmetric Scalar Product Encryption (EASPE) algorithm. Security analysis confirms that the proposed scheme is IND-CPA secure. Extensive experiments validate the practicality and efficiency of our scheme, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing methods."

Based on the convergence criterion for calculating the variation interval of the inherent characteristics, the interval parameters with large uncertainty are adaptively divided into several sub intervals, and the inherent characteristics at the characteristic intersection of the sub intervals are calculated and the high-precision variation interval is obtained.

    "abstract": "Cross-chain auction is a promising paradigm for enabling on-chain price discovery across blockchain systems. While existing bridge solutions can functionally support cross-chain auctions, their deployment across heterogeneous blockchains remains challenging. In addition, conventional hash time-lock contracts (HTLCs) inherently predetermine the receiver, making them incompatible with the flexible recipient assignment required in auction settings. In this paper, we propose recipient-agnostic hash locks (RAHL), a new primitive that extends the HTLC framework to support dynamic recipient selection. By leveraging adaptor signatures and the UTXO model, we construct mutually exclusive pre-payments that allow multiple potential receivers to participate, while ensuring that only one is ultimately finalized. Furthermore, we embed adaptor signatures with polynomial commitments such that the secret revealed during settlement encodes recipient information, thereby enabling recipient-agnostic functionality. We formally model RAHL under a rational cross-chain communication (CCC) setting, and prove that it satisfies effectiveness and atomicity, while providing resilience against front-running and temporary censorship attacks. Experimental results demonstrate that RAHL primitive supports auctions between Bitcoin and Ethereum, reducing cross-chain settlement overhead by 33% compared to representative light-client approaches."

Firstly, the Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) algorithm was used to decompose the original temperature series into multiple modal components. Subsequently, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) were employed to extract spatial features of each component, which were input into Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to capture temporal dependencies. Finally, the predicted results of each component were aggregated and reconstructed to obtain the final temperature prediction. The prediction accuracy was evaluated using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and the coefficient of determination ($\\mathbf{R}^{\\mathbf{2}}$). The results show that the VMD-CNN-LSTM combined model offers high prediction accuracy, strong robustness, and excellent noise resistance. Compared to the CNN-LSTM model, the MAE and RMSE were decreased by $48 \\%$ and $45 \\%$, respectively, and the $\\mathbf{R}^{\\mathbf{2}}$ value was closer to 1.0. This method demonstrates significant practical value for temperature control and safe operation in shale oil stations, providing theoretical support for their optimization."

The results showed that customization reduced the total visit count and cognitive load, increased the attention; body movement increased the total visit duration and total visit count, improved experience scores, and enhanced anthropomorphic performance; high-risk scenarios increased average pupil diameter. There was an interaction effect with body movement and disease scenario; anti-customization in high-risk scenarios triggered an alert reaction; disease scenarios significantly affects doctor-patient trust and cognitive experience; users demand more professionalism from the virtual doctor in high-risk scenarios. The findings provide practical implications for designing user-friendly AI-driven virtual doctor consultations."

    "abstract": "The rise of synthetic media has blurred the boundary between reality and fabrication under the evolving power of artificial intelligence, fueling an infodemic that erodes public trust in cyberspace. For digital imagery, a multitude of editing applications further complicates the forensic analysis, including semantic edits that alter content, photometric adjustments that recalibrate colour characteristics, and geometric projections that reshape viewpoints. Collectively, these transformations manipulate and control perceptual interpretation of digital imagery. This susceptibility calls for forensic enquiry into reconstructing the chain of events, thereby revealing deeper evidential insight into the presence or absence of criminal intent. This study seeks to address an inverse problem of tracing the underlying generation chain that gives rise to the observed synthetic media. A tell-tale watermarking system is developed for explanatory reasoning over the nature and extent of transformations across the lifecycle of synthetic media. Tell-tale watermarks are tailored to different classes of transformations, responding in a manner that is neither strictly robust nor fragile but instead interpretable. These watermarks function as reference clues that evolve under the same transformation dynamics as the carrier media, leaving interpretable traces when subjected to transformations. Explanatory reasoning is then performed to infer the most plausible account across the combinatorial parameter space of composite transformations. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the validity of tell-tale watermarking with respect to fidelity, synchronicity and traceability."

On Ethereum, users can repurpose the transaction input data field to embed natural-language messages, commonly known as Input Data Messages (IDMs). However, as IDMs gain wider adoption, there has been a growing volume of toxic content on-chain. This trend is concerning, as Ethereum provides no protocol-level support for content moderation.We propose two moderation frameworks for Ethereum IDMs: (i) BUILDERMOD, where builders perform semantic checks during block construction; and (ii) USERMOD, where users proactively obtain moderation proofs from external classifiers and embed them in transactions. Our evaluation reveals that BUILDERMOD incurs high block-time overhead, which limits its practicality. In contrast, USERMOD enables lower-latency validation and scales more effectively, making it a more practical approach in moderation-aware Ethereum environments.Our study lays the groundwork for protocol-level content governance in decentralized systems, and we hope it contributes to the development of a decentralized communication environment that is safe, trustworthy, and socially responsible."

    "abstract": "For Underwater Internet of Things (UIoT) applications, the accurate and efficient estimation of the direction of arrival (DOA) is fundamental to technologies such as node localization and autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) node cooperative communication. However, the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and limited energy in underwater environments pose severe challenges to DOA estimation. Furthermore, existing methods typically require a large number of snapshots. To address these issues, this paper proposes the use of an adaptive wavelet denoising model to enhance the quality of underwater acoustic signals. Subsequently, a dual-branch space-time state space network (ST-SSNet) is proposed. This network consists of a time feature extraction branch (TFEB) and a space feature extraction branch (SFEB). The time branch incorporates gating units and time mixing functions into the state space model (SSM) within the Mamba framework to extract temporal features. The spatial branch uses one-dimensional convolutions in different directions and the convolutional block attention module (CBAM) to extract spatial features. Extensive simulation and sea trial experiments demonstrate that ST-SSNet outperforms other deep learning methods in various scenarios, while having lower computational complexity than other methods. Compared to ResNet18, the accuracy improves by 2.14%, and RMSE is reduced by 43.4%."

    "abstract": "Fetal movement (FM) patterns serve as crucial biomarkers of fetal health. However, the reliance on intermittent, in-clinic ultrasound assessments has restricted our ability to track the longitudinal progression of FM patterns. Although wearable FM monitors could address this gap, the interpretation and standardization of wearable sensor-detected FM patterns have been severely complicated by the lack of commercial solutions and inconsistencies in sensor types, algorithmic settings, and validation protocols across different studies. This study presents a comparative analysis of in-home monitored longitudinal FM patterns concurrently captured by the three most prevalent wearable sensing modalities: accelerometer, acoustic sensor, and piezoelectric sensor. Additionally, we propose a novel algorithm to automatically separate fetal hiccups, which can confound the interpretation of FM patterns. Five pregnant women participated in this study, providing 31 hours of longitudinal in-home FM recordings between 25–38 weeks of gestation. The results demonstrated significant differences (p < 0.05) in FM patterns across sensor types for most biophysical properties, except for the incident rate (FMs/hour), suggesting that the incidence rate may serve as a relatively robust metric across sensor types. The proposed hiccup detection algorithm demonstrated strong agreement with maternally detected fetal hiccups (<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">F<sub>1</sub></i> score ranging from 0.5–0.8 across sensor types) and the resulting hiccup rates (0.1–0.19 bouts/hour across sensor types) aligned well with the established literature (0.17–0.2 bouts/hour), validating the algorithm. These findings underscore the feasibility of our wearable system for longitudinal, in-home FM monitoring and lay the groundwork for standardizing FM assessment."

However, physical air data sensors are susceptible to failure due to environmental disturbances, especially in ultralight manned aircraft where hardware redundancy is often impractical due to strict size, weight, and power constraints. Although model-based synthetic air data systems (SADS) have been proposed to reduce sensor reliance, they require precise aerodynamic coefficients and are sensitive to modeling errors. To address these limitations, this study proposes a lightweight, data-driven SADS framework based on a hybrid deep learning model that combines temporal and trend-based features. An unscented Kalman filter (UKF) is applied as a post-processing step to enhance robustness against noise and anomalous inputs. The system is trained and validated on real-world flight data and demonstrates improved accuracy and stability over conventional deep learning baselines. These results suggest that the proposed method offers a robust and complementary alternative to model-based SADS, particularly in resource-constrained flight environments."

As circuits scale and constraints tighten, static recipes struggle to balance area, power, and delay while keeping iteration time acceptable. This paper proposes a reinforcement-learning (RL) logic synthesis framework that treats key synthesis steps as decision nodes in a Markov decision process. A deep Q-network (DQN) agent observes netlist/state features and selects transformations such as balance, rewrite, refactor, resub, and $d c 2$. A composite reward turns area, power, delay, and runtime into a single signal. Integrated into a standard Yosys → ABC flow, the agent learns flow policies that adapt to circuit structure. On ISCAS’89, the framework reduces average area by 15.6%, power by 12.8%, delay by 9.2%, and synthesis iteration time by 30.7% over strong baselines. Results show that learning-based flow control can deliver stable multi-objective gains with modest engineering effort."

    "abstract": "The human centered paradigm of the Industry 5.0 framework has boosted the demand of wearable sensing technologies able to monitor operators’ health, safety, and well-being. Among the most suitable physiological signals, Electrodermal Activity (EDA) and Sweat Rate (SR) stand up as suitable candidates for detecting conditions of stress, fatigue, and workload in occupational contexts. Despite sensing approaches for both EDA and SR have been widely investigated from both research and application perspectives, a limited comprehensive classification and analysis in terms of design, characterization protocols and performances can be highlighted. This systematic review aims to fill this gap analyzing the last decade of literature concerning the use of EDA and SR as tools to monitor operators. The analysis performed spans across applications, sensing technologies, testing protocols, signal processing, as well as multimodal integration. Each of these classes is deeply analyzed in order to compare information regarding both commercial devices and custom-built solutions, with particular attention to novel approaches exploiting flexible electronics, advanced materials, and microfluidics. Results obtained showed promising adoption in sectors such as construction, agriculture, manufacturing, and office work, with persistent challenges in terms of heterogeneous testing protocols, lack of standardized metrics for reliability and usability, motion artifacts, comfort, battery life, and user compliance. One of the major trends is represented by integration of EDA/SR with other biosignals—such as HRV, EEG, and skin temperature—enabling more robust and accurate detection of stress and emotional states through multimodal approaches. The discussion and conclusion of this review outlines current advances and identifies future directions to guide the development of user-centric, multimodal monitoring systems for occupational health."

A simulator that replicates the scheduling semantics of the target platform is implemented, enabling precise analysis and validation of a given schedule plan. The scheduling problem is formulated as a bilevel optimization solved via soft-computing techniques, while a complementary mixed-integer linear programming formulation provides performance bounds. The approach is validated on an industrial satellite case study, demonstrating a significant reduction in preemptions and improved timing consistency compared to manually engineered schedules."

Conventional periodic maintenance often results in excessive interventions or unexpected failures, both of which reduce system availability and increase costs. This paper proposes an optimization framework for wind farm maintenance scheduling based on a Genetic Algorithm (GA). The model minimizes the overall maintenance cost by jointly considering repair operations and downtime losses under reliability constraints. A simulation study of a 10-turbine wind farm over a 12-month horizon shows that the GA-based approach reduces total cost by nearly 30% compared with fixed-interval strategies. These results underline the potential of heuristic optimization in improving both the economic and operational performance of wind energy systems."

Engineers make decisions at each stage to select chip control conditions that ultimately produce a superior final outcome, Y. However, relying solely on engineers’ experience at each decision-making stage to achieve the best final performance is challenging to assess comprehensively based on data. This study extracts a decision-making regime that can guarantee the highest performance from the initial decision stage by leveraging backward Q-learning when multiple decision-making stages are involved. By incorporating IPTW, regret, and blip fitting methods, the enhanced reinforcement learning algorithm addresses challenges such as high dimensionality and model fitting difficulties in panel non-randomized sequential data. In various simulation environments, the estimates demonstrated robustness and the potential to extend to different regression models and feature variables using intuitive concepts. Ultimately, the algorithm successfully selects control conditions that enhance the predictability of the final Y value with shorter fitting times, achieving higher improvements than previously possible."

    "abstract": "With the rapid advancement of cloud computing technologies, microservice architectures have emerged as the de facto standard for modern software systems. However, their highly dynamic and complex nature poses significant challenges for anomaly detection. Although recent diffusion-based models have demonstrated promising capabilities in modeling multi-variate time series, they often overlook the inherent multi-scale spatiotemporal correlations present in microservice systems. This oversight limits their capacity to fully capture system-wide behaviors, thereby constraining detection performance. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework for anomaly detection based on imputed diffusion models, termed Multi-Scale Graph Imputed Diffusion Model. Building upon the imputation–reconstruction paradigm of standard ImDiffusion, our approach introduces a multi-scale spatiotemporal correlation module that is seamlessly integrated into the denoising network. This module employs parallel multi-scale graph convolutions and temporal convolutions to explicitly capture inter-service spatial dependencies from the microservice dependency graph and multi-granular temporal dynamics from service metric time series. By conditioning the diffusion process on richer spatiotemporal contexts, MSG-ImDiffusion enhances the model’s sensitivity to anomalies that deviate from expected temporal and spatial patterns. Extensive experiments conducted on the open-source HipsterShop microservice benchmark demonstrate that our proposed model significantly outperforms existing baselines, including ImDiffusion, in terms of both detection accuracy and F1-score. These results validate the effectiveness of incorporating multi-scale spatiotemporal information into diffusion-based anomaly detection frameworks for microservice systems."

To fill this gap, this study introduces a novel application of ISM, a methodology to identify, analyze, and hierarchically structure these obstacles. The model’s structural input was derived from a two-round Delphi process involving 12 purposively selected experts, chosen for their extensive experience in logistics, production, and trade policy. Initial findings, enhanced by a MICMAC analysis, identify rising raw material costs, strict environmental regulations, inefficient domestic logistics, and evolving international trade policies as key bottlenecks with high driving power. ISM framework provides a structured understanding of their systemic impact. The result offer actionable insights for industry players and guide policymakers in prioritizing targeted strategies to enhance the resilience and global competitiveness of Indonesia’s pulp and paper sector."

Extreme value statistics are used to model infrequent extreme events that may cause major disasters. The primary objective is often to estimate the return level, and the analysis is performed using extreme value data such as block maximum data. Exceptionally large values among these extremes can be regarded as outliers. These outliers can significantly influence the estimated distribution, leading to substantial deviations in return level estimations. In Japan, the observation period for precipitation data is approximately 150 years, and the estimation results should not vary significantly depending on whether an outlier falls within the observed period. We focus on estimation based on γ-divergence—a robust estimation technique—and investigate its applicability and effectiveness in the estimation of the GEV distribution."

Their frequency response is related to the wind power output and the frequency regulation parameters. This paper proposes an optimization method for wind power frequency regulation parameters based on frequency response collaborative regulation. Under the optimal power flow framework, the frequency dynamic response and stability constraints of both synchronous generators and wind turbine units are integrated. By optimizing the frequency regulation parameters and unit output, the framework minimizes both the operating cost and the frequency regulation reserve cost. The differential algebraic equation is used to describe the relationship between wind power and frequency, and the dynamic power flow is introduced to describe the changes in node power and voltage after disturbances. The 3machine, 9-node simulation of the Western Systems Coordinating Council (WSCC) demonstrates that this method can effectively coordinate the response of frequency regulation resources. It maximizes the potential of wind power for frequency regulation, suppresses frequency drops, reduces the burden on synchronous machines, and lowers the risk of frequency instability."

Meanwhile, the energy storage efficiency of Lithium-ion batteries is high, but Lithium-ion batteries have problems such as range and safety, so the estimation of SOH of Lithium-ion batteries becomes an extremely important task. To enhance SOH estimation accuracy, this paper constructs a battery SOH estimation model based on an LSTM neural network optimized by PSO, utilizing health features extracted from the NASA dataset as training inputs. Test results demonstrate that the estimation error of this method remains within $3.5 \\%$, significantly improving SOH prediction accuracy."

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of V2X and autonomous driving technologies, the security and stability of platoons based on Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) have become a critical research focus. However, these systems remain vulnerable when facing sophisticated attacks. In this study, we propose a Game Theory-based attack framework that introduces a Ghost Vehicle capable of executing three distinct attack modes, Leader Attack, Mid-Platoon Attack, and Follower Attack. Experimental results demonstrate that our attack effectively destabilizes the platoon during Leader Attack and Mid-Platoon Attack, while seamlessly integrating as a normal member during the Follower Attack. Unlike prior sensor-spoofing attacks that rely on hardware-intensive methods, the behavior of the Ghost Vehicle is dynamically controlled using Mode Predictive Control (MPC) and Finite State Machine (FSM), ensuring high efficiency with a maximum computation time of 40 seconds, which represents an average across multiple runs. Our attack modes are validated in a highway scenario, demonstrating the high effectiveness with low computational cost."

Thus, this study aims to propose a novel method for setting improvement targets within the DEA-R framework. Grounded in the target-setting principles of conventional DEA, the proposed method determines improvement targets in DEA-R through convex combinations of efficient decision-making units. Consequently, this enables the provision of specific input and output improvement targets within DEA-R, similar to those in conventional DEA. Furthermore, the method offers a significant computational advantage, requiring only the solution of a system of linear equations."

    "abstract": "In crowdsensing services, traditional trust evaluation methods struggle to assess user reliability when historical user records are lacking. Moreover, trust evaluation only infers reliability indirectly and fails to prevent collusive deception by malicious users. To address these issues, this paper proposes a trust-based data quality assessment mechanism. This mechanism models trust evaluation as a social exchange process between the platform and users, encompassing historical contributions, privacy utility, and data similarity-mitigating the cold-start problem to a certain extent. It employs local differential privacy to protect user data privacy while quantifying data similarity, balancing privacy protection levels with trust evaluation accuracy. Additionally, the mechanism integrates the Mann-Whitney U statistical method to test data consistency among users and applies locality-sensitive hashing to enhance testing efficiency. This filters out false user data and improves the accuracy of sensing task outcomes. Finally, theoretical analysis and experimental validation demonstrate that the proposed scheme is feasible and effective in executing sensing tasks, with the ability to effectively filter false data collusively uploaded by malicious users."

However, as UAV deployments increase, the scarcity of spectrum resources has emerged as a critical bottleneck that severely limits the quality of service in LAIN. While Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown promise in optimizing spectrum sharing and improving spectral efficiency of UAVs, existing RL-based methods suffer from high training costs and require extensive interactions with the environment to converge to near-optimal solutions. To address these challenges, we propose a novel model-based RL framework for dynamic spectrum sharing of UAVs in LAIN. Our approach employs a world model to learn compact state representations and reconstruct environment dynamics, significantly enhancing the sample efficiency in complex scenarios. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our approach drastically reduces the number of environmental interactions required for UAVs to achieve near-optimal spectrum allocations, lowering training costs while maintaining high performance."

    "abstract": "Underwater mine detection using side scan sonar is of paramount importance to the safety of ships and submarines. Traditional 2-D mine detection algorithms are computationally intensive and induce substantial latency. Real-time operation of mine detection algorithms is essential, especially for underwater vehicles with limited computational capacity. To address this, we propose ping based convolutional neural network (PingCNN), a novel approach leveraging raw 1-D sonar pings, yet not explored in literature. We hypothesize that the characteristics of reflected pings are distinctive to the objects being scanned, thus employing a time series deep learning approach to advance underwater mine detection. PingCNN articulates mine detection as a detection-by-classification problem in a 1-D signal domain. In addition, we propose a novel likelihood-based sensitivity enhancer module, built with statistical and signal processing techniques, to mitigate false negatives. We have thoroughly validated the proposed approach using a custom data set recorded under different scenarios. Validation on a custom data set shows PingCNN performs comparably with 2-D methods, with minimal latency and computational requirements. In summary, PingCNN offers a low-latency, computationally efficient solution suitable for resource-constrained underwater vehicles."

A dynamic trust evaluation model combining static attributes and historical interaction data is designed to ensure that only users who pass trust assessments are granted access. An interaction trust computation method incorporating direct trust, indirect trust, and a time-decay factor is introduced, along with a sliding window algorithm for dynamic threshold updates, enhancing responsiveness to changes in device behavior. A machine-learning-based continuous behavior monitoring mechanism is implemented to perform real-time modeling and detection of performance, traffic, and access patterns, improving anomaly identification and rapid response. The prototype system was validated through multi-device collaborative interaction simulations, demonstrating significant advantages in traffic anomaly detection and communication security over existing approaches."

    "abstract": "Remote attestation is a cornerstone of Trusted Computing, ensuring the integrity and trustworthiness of devices in diverse environments, ranging from resource-constrained IoT nodes to cloud-based virtual machines (VMs). The two predominant attestation technologies, the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) and the Device Identifier Composition Engine (DICE), provide strong security guarantees but often rely on stateful challenge-response models. These models introduce scalability challenges, particularly in large-scale Internet of Things (IoT) and smart metering deployments.This paper presents a powerful stateless post-quantum remote attestation approach for IoT devices, leveraging authenticated and encrypted (AEAD) challenges within TPM and DICE-based attestation. The stateless approach effectively limits replay attacks to a short validity window, even in environments where IoT devices lack real-time clocks, and enables robust integrity and trust verification across dynamic network topologies, by avoiding the downsides of other freshness concepts for remote attestation.Furthermore, this paper presents a performance evaluation of suitable post-quantum cryptography (PQC) algorithms across five heterogeneous hardware platforms, ranging from high-end laptops to constrained IoT devices, to present a recommendation to the reader, thereby illustrating the continued utility of remote attestation on IoT devices in the future.Our findings suggest that stateless post-quantum remote attestation can enhance security and scalability in IoT environments, by reducing overhead from storage of nonces making it a compelling alternative to traditional challenge-response models."

    "abstract": "Degradation modeling plays a critical role in reliability analysis and prognostics for engineered systems operating under varying environmental conditions. Many real-world degradation processes exhibit a two-phase behavior characterized by an initial slow deterioration followed by accelerated decline, where the change point often depends on the applied stress. To address this phenomenon, We propose a stress-aware Gaussian process regression (GPR) framework for modeling two-phase degradation processes commonly observed in accelerated degradation testing (ADT). The model incorporates a piecewise mean function with a stress-dependent change point to capture early-stage decline and post-knee accelerated degradation. A composite covariance structure is adopted to jointly model temporal dynamics and stress-level correlations. To assess the model’s performance, we generate simulated degradation data that mimic lithium-ion battery aging under various temperature stresses. The results demonstrate the model’s extrapolated ability to accurately predict degradation behavior at unseen stress levels. These results highlight the potential of stress-aware GPR models in reliability applications requiring cross-stress prediction and early failure detection."

    "abstract": "Haze often degrades remote sensing (RS) imagery, reducing contrast and obscuring structural details, which undermines the accuracy of downstream vision tasks. While recent one-shot dehazing methods offer improved generalization by training on a single image, they suffer from prohibitively slow convergence due to unstable optimization from random initialization. To address this, we propose a dark channel prior (DCP)-guided one-shot dehazing framework that integrates a non-trainable DCP module with a redegradation haze imaging model for self-supervised optimization. The key idea is to use the DCP module to provide stable initial estimates of the atmospheric light and transmission map, while two UNet-based subnetworks refine the dehazed image and transmission map under redegradation-based physical consistency constraints. An adaptive warm-up strategy is further introduced to prioritize DCP-regularized learning in the early stage and then gradually transition to full joint optimization as the network predictions stabilize. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world RS datasets show that, although our method does not achieve the highest Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) compared with fully supervised Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based models trained on large paired datasets, it attains competitive Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) and clearly better perceptual quality among one-shot and prior-based baselines, while significantly reducing training iterations compared with existing one-shot methods.Moreover, evaluations on a road extraction task demonstrate that the dehazed outputs notably enhance segmentation accuracy and robustness, confirming the practical value of the proposed framework for high-level RS vision applications where paired training data and long per-image optimization are impractical."

    "abstract": "Large transformer-based models have achieved remarkable performance in natural language processing and related fields, yet they pose significant privacy risks when handling sensitive data. Fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) offers a natural solution for private transformer inference: the client encrypts the input data, the server performs inference directly on ciphertexts, and the results remain encrypted until decrypted by the key holder. However, FHE struggles to efficiently support non-linear activation functions, and encrypted inference often incurs substantial performance overhead and degrades model accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose Hamster, an FHE-based private transformer inference system that protects both client and server privacy. Our contributions are twofold. First, Hamster introduces a comprehensive set of more efficient approximations for the costly nonlinear functions in transformer models, significantly reducing the performance overhead of homomorphic evaluation. Second, unlike some existing works that only support a limited set of nonlinear components, Hamster implements a complete end-to-end evaluation pipeline for private transformer inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate Hamster achieves an average inference time of approximately 12 minutes per token, with minimal loss in model accuracy. This performance outperforms BumbleBee (NDSS 2025) by 2.2× and NEXUS (NDSS 2025) by 1.2×, highlighting the effectiveness and practicality of our system."

To this end, we devise a perceptual map to highlight areas sensitive to human eyes, guided by instance-aware refinement, which refines the protection intensity accordingly. We also introduce a difficulty-aware protection by predicting how difficult the artwork is to protect and dynamically adjusting the intensity based on this. Lastly, we integrate a perceptual constraints bank to further improve the imperceptibility. Results show that our method substantially elevates the quality of the protected image without compromising on protection efficacy."

Whilst having wide applicability, WSNs are plagued by critical constraints on energy resources, network lifetime, and scalability. Traditional deterministic and accurate optimization methods are generally unable to handle these concerns due to the NP-hard nature of related problems such as clustering, routing, and node deployment. Metaheuristic algorithms are now a good alternative, offering near-optimal solutions at reasonable computational cost. Among these, bio-inspired metaheuristics such as Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), and Genetic Algorithms (GA) have garnered significant attention because they are capable of mimicking natural processes and responding to dynamic systems. This work aims to provide a comprehensive overview of metaheuristic approaches for WSN optimization and provides their applications in clustering, routing, energy management, localization, and coverage. It also emphasizes the comparative analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of such algorithms and their performance."

The analysis of performance indices (MSE, RMSE, MAE, R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>) shows that PSO-based optimization of ANFIS improves prediction quality compared with a standard ANFIS: for P2, MSE decreases from 0.0725 to 0.0648; for TNH, from 0.0035 to 0.0034; for TNL, from 0.5303 to 0.4908; and for T7, from 3.46×10⁻<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">9</sup> to 1.10×10⁻<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">10</sup>. The coefficient of determination R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> also increases for P2 (0.9311 to 0.9385), TNH (0.7493 to 0.7594), and TNL (0.8461 to 0.8576). In addition, lower RMSE values and reduced standard deviations over five-fold cross-validation for all outputs indicate that the proposed hybrid ANFIS–PSO scheme provides a robust and accurate representation of gas turbine dynamics."

Rising levels of pollution caused by rapid industrialization, vehicular emissions, and urban development have made air quality assessment a critical scientific and policy concern. In this work, we examine how deep learning techniques can be applied for accurate air quality level classification using image data caputured in various cities . Specifically, We conduct a performance comparison between two leading convolutional neural networks, MobileNetV2 and ResNet152V2. While both achieved notable improvements over traditional methods, MobileNetV2 proved to be the most effective, offering the highest classification accuracy along with better computational efficiency. Its lightweight architecture makes it well-suited for deployment in environments with limited resources and real-time processing requirements. The findings highlight the efficiency of deep learning in advancing air quality monitoring and suggest future improvements through hybrid models such as Inception-ResNet to enhance predictive capability and generalization across diverse environments."

However, automatically generating valid and semantically consistent STIX objects remains challenging. Large language models (LLMs) often succeed at extracting low-level indicators but struggle with higher-level abstractions, leading to missing fields, invalid properties, and structurally inconsistent outputs. To address these issues, we propose a methodology that integrates instruction fine-tuning with a novel evaluation framework. Specifically, we fine-tune LLMs using curated text–STIX pairs and domain-specific instructions to internalize schema alignment and reduce hallucinations. We further introduce the Object and Properties Similarity Evaluation (OPSE), which measures both structural validity and semantic fidelity of generated STIX objects against expert ground truth. Experimental results show that our fine-tuned model substantially improves object coverage, property completeness, and structural accuracy compared with baseline prompting and existing STIX generation tools."

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into software development workflows to accelerate code generation, but often produce insecure and uncontrollable code due to vulnerable training data and unconstrained decoding strategies. This poses severe risks in security-critical systems, where post-generation vulnerability detection and manual remediation incur significant overhead. While constrained decoding offers a practical mitigation strategy, existing methods suffer from degraded trustworthiness, constraint conflicts, and high latency—especially when enforcing multiple concurrent security constraints.We propose SCodeGen, a real-time constrained decoding framework designed to enforce fine-grained security controls during LLM code generation. To improve trustworthiness and controllability, SCodeGen introduces (1) a matching-length-aware logit modulation strategy that enhances trustworthiness and controllability without semantic disruption, and (2) a two-stage low-latency decoding architecture, which compiles constraint phrases into a runtime-enforceable constraint automaton (RCA) with precomputed logit bias vectors for efficient online decoding. Extensive evaluations on CodeGuard+ show that SCodeGen significantly improves secure pass rates under both single and multi-constraint settings, while maintaining latency comparable to unconstrained decoding. This work demonstrates a practical and scalable solution toward trustworthy LLM-assisted software development under security constraints."

This research presents a novel hybrid diagnostic system based on transfer learning-based deep feature extraction and ensemble machine learning classification for partial shading (PS) and short-circuit (S-C) detection in PV arrays. Features are extracted from infrared thermography (IRT) images with three state-of-the-art pre-trained CNN architectures (ResNet50, MobileNetV2, and VGG16); then, the feature vector dimensionality is decreased by principal component analysis (PCA) technique and classified by XGBoost and SVM classifiers. Extensive experimental evaluation on a database of 2,249 thermal images reveals that the MobileNetV2-SVM combination performs the best with 97.56% classification accuracy, surpassing other model combinations. The proposed method enables real-time, non-invasive, and very reliable fault detection that can aid predictive maintenance actions that minimize downtime, decrease operational costs, and enhance energy yield in commercial and utility-scale PV power plants."

    "abstract": "Dynamic Searchable Symmetric Encryption (DSSE) schemes typically permit certain predefined leakages at runtime to ensure efficiency, such as the response/update volume and the response file volume. Query Recovery Attacks (QRAs) exploit such leakages, combined with auxiliary knowledge, to recover the user’s query contents. Powerful QRAs typically rely on the ground-truth knowledge of the dataset or queries. While QRA based on the weaker statistical knowledge, termed statistics-based QRA, is also possible, it yields lower accuracy and consequently is not considered a significant threat. In this work, we revisit statistics-based QRAs within the DSSE context and introduce a unified probabilistic optimization attack model. Building on this model, toward volumetric leakages, we develop Two-Stage Decode Attacks (TSDAs), which formulate the QRA as a Conditional Random Field (CRF) decoding problem and solve it through a two-stage optimization process. TSDAs not only generalize the state-of-the-art counterpart (i.e., LVIA, Xu et al., CCS 2023), but also significantly outperform it, even under more realistic and constrained leakage assumptions. Against traditional DSSE schemes lacking protection on response volume leakages, our attack achieves nearly 100% query recovery accuracy on the Lucene dataset under the same evaluation settings as Xu et al. In contrast, LVIA achieves only 77% accuracy. Even when applied to ShieldDB (Vo et al., TKDE 2023), which incorporates response volume obfuscation, our method maintains an accuracy at 50%, whereas LVIA drops sharply to just 0.2%. Our findings suggest that statistics-based QRAs pose a serious threat to DSSE schemes."

    "abstract": "With growing awareness of user privacy and the widespread adoption of encryption tools such as SSL/TLS, VPN, and Tor, traditional traffic classification methods based on port analysis and deep packet inspection (DPI) have become increasingly ineffective. While conventional machine learning approaches can classify traffic using flow statistical features, they remain limited by their dependence on manual feature engineering and poor generalization capability. Deep learning techniques overcome these constraints by automatically extracting features and enabling early traffic classification. However, existing deep learning solutions still exhibit notable shortcomings: most rely exclusively on either flow-level or packet-level features, neglecting the complementary information present in the other dimension; furthermore, packet-level methods often mix header and payload data, risking violation of user privacy. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel encrypted traffic classification method that effectively integrates both flow-level and packet-level features without relying on payload content. By introducing new techniques for feature extraction and fusion at both levels, our approach captures complex nonlinear relationships among features. Extensive evaluation on four public datasets demonstrates that the proposed method achieves high accuracy and significantly outperforms single-modal models."

The system achieves a key feature extraction error of $\\lt 1 \\mathrm{~ms}$ for fault record graphs by constructing a unified representation model for multi-source data and an “OCR+CNN” dual-channel image parsing algorithm; suppresses model hallucinations and ensures the logical consistency of reports by relying on a domain knowledge-enhanced RAG-LLM collaborative framework; and completes the full-process automation from fault data collection and information retrieval to report generation by combining a multi-level retrieval strategy and standardized templates. Experimental verification shows that the system can improve the fault report generation efficiency to the minute-level, outperforming traditional manual methods in data fusion accuracy, image recognition accuracy, and language logic. It successfully realizes the transformation of fault reports from “manual experience” to “intelligent generation”, providing highly reliable intelligent support for power grid dispatching and operation inspection."

We incorporate LLM-derived embeddings into several baseline models and evaluate performance on two datasets: the public MIMIC-III and a real-world inpatient dataset from Ditmanson Medical Foundation Chia-Yi Christian Hospital in Taiwan. Experimental results show consistent performance gains across models when LLM-based text representations are used, with some models achieving results comparable to or better than using medical codes alone. Our findings demonstrate that LLM-enhanced representations offer a scalable and model-agnostic approach for leveraging unstructured data in clinical decision support."

One such strategy for the logistics sector is the integration of autonomous vehicles into the delivery cycle, as their per-mile transportation costs are far lower than those of trucks, which are the conventional delivery mode. In the traditional contexts of the vehicle-routing problem (VRP), collaborative delivery has been the subject of much research over the years. In this research, we propose an investigation into the integration of autonomous truck (AT) and electric tricycle (ET) delivery into an inventory routing problem (IRP), a more complex and realistic operations model. We first give a formulation of the inventory routing problem with autonomous truck and electric tricycle (IRP-ATET) using mixed integer-linear programming, and then we suggest an exact solution method. We addressed the robust IRP using the heuristic bees algorithm (BA) to address this issue. Lastly, a numerical instance is given to show that the approach is feasible."

    "abstract": "The fault recording data serves as the core data source for the intelligent diagnosis of transformer faults. Its quality directly determines the accuracy of the diagnosis results. However, in actual engineering scenarios, the recording data is prone to be interfered by random noise, high-order harmonic components, and DC bias, which masks the characteristic signals containing winding fault information. As a result, the fault features are extracted with distortion and the calculation of key parameters becomes inaccurate. To address this issue, this paper proposes a set of targeted preprocessing procedures for transformer fault recording data. These procedures consist of three key steps: the parsing of COMTRADE format files to standardize the restoration of the recording data, multi-scale denoising based on wavelet transform can precisely separate the signal from random noise, and Butterworth band-pass filtering can effectively suppress the influence of DC components and high-order harmonics. To verify the effectiveness of this preprocessing procedure, transformer fault recording simulation data with 5% Gaussian white noise and 10% third harmonic components were constructed for testing. The results show that the edge spurs of the Lissajous characteristic graph have been effectively eliminated, restored to a regular elliptical shape, and the calculation accuracy of the characteristic parameters (long axis, short axis, inclination angle, etc.) has significantly improved. The data quality has been effectively enhanced. This preprocessing method provides high-quality data input for the subsequent extraction of winding fault features and intelligent diagnosis algorithms based on the Lissajous graph method, significantly reducing the risk of diagnostic errors and having strong practical engineering value."

    "abstract": "Federated learning allows multiple clients to locally train on private datasets, followed by the central server aggregating these parameters to form a global model. This process maintains the privacy of client data while enabling the global model to learn from diverse data distributions, thus enhancing its generalization capability. However, it cannot be ensured that all clients participating in the federated aggregation process are fully trustworthy. Some clients might maliciously alter the parameters they upload to the central server, embedding backdoors into the global model. This causes the model to behave in ways dictated by attackers for specific inputs. Existing backdoor defense mechanisms primarily operate on the central server side, attempting to eliminate malicious clients by analyzing parameter characteristics or behaviors, or by pruning or distilling the aggregated model. In this paper, we first reveal the impact of backdoor attacks on neural networks at the neuron level and analyze the parameter changes during backdoor training from the attacker’s perspective. Building on this analysis, we propose a neural network honeypot mechanism. This approach initially uses parameter perturbation and masking for adversarial training to identify fundamental malicious neurons. These neurons are then processed to lure attackers into traps, thereby enhancing the accuracy of malicious neuron identification. We conducted extensive experiments under different adversarial settings and assumptions, demonstrating that our backdoor defense approach consistently surpasses current state-of-the-art baseline methods."

    "abstract": "In recent years, with the increasing prevalence of online group chat applications, malicious information has been more easily disseminated on the internet. Asymmetric group message franking (AGMF) allows users to report received malicious messages to moderators, achieving content moderation in large-scale online end-to-end messaging systems. However, the state-of-the-art construction is built upon traditional public key cryptosystems, resulting in the complex certificate management problem. This paper systematically explores identity-based AGMF (IB-AGMF) to resolve this issue. Specifically, we first introduce a novel primitive called hash proof system-based anonymous identity-based key encapsulation mechanism supporting sigma protocol (HPS-AIB-KEM<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Σ</sup>) and present a practical construction based on DBDH assumption. After formalizing the concept and security notions of IB-AGMF, we propose the generic construction of IB-AGMF based on HPS-AIB-KEM<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Σ</sup> and non-interactive zero knowledge proof system. Finally, we conduct comprehensive performance evaluations and comparisons to demonstrate the feasibility of IB-AGMF in group communication scenarios."

    "abstract": "In a globalized world with increasing demands for low costs, high quality, and short lead times, the pressure on employees continues to rise. Combined with a shortage of skilled workers and demographic changes in many industrialized countries, this creates a heightened risk of human errors. To achieve long-term error reduction, mitigating the factors contributing to such errors is essential. This requires the careful selection of preventive measures. Selecting the most suitable measures, in turn, benefits from understanding their impact on error-influencing factors. To support practitioners in this process, a Delphi study was conducted with twelve experts from the manufacturing industry. This article presents the results and includes a 19 × 19 Domain Mapping Matrix that links 19 preventive measure sub-categories to 19 error-influencing factor sub-categories."

    "abstract": "This paper studies the problem of payload protection for a target spacecraft in counter-reconnaissance. The target spacecraft aims to avoid having its critical payloads captured within the imaging areas of reconnaissance spacecraft, while minimizing fuel consumption and service disruption, as well as preventing hazards such as collisions and direct solar illumination of sensors. In this complex confrontation between reconnaissance and counter-reconnaissance, the outcome is highly sensitive to both parties' strategies. Therefore we propose an adaptive non- zero-sum game-based strategy by leveraging information asymmetry, opponent strategy inference and imaging conditions. To further achieve online decision-making, we perform a situation-based real-time optimization of the value functions during strategy computation, significantly reducing the computational load without compromising global game performance. Simulation results validate that this strategy provides effective payload protection at a low cost, even when confronted with high-threat adversarial situations, and exhibits a certain level of robustness and adaptability to scenario uncertainties."

    "abstract": "To address the cooperative guidance problem for autonomous aerial vehicle (AAV) formation with false-data injection and only the leader equipped with a seeker, a hybrid algorithm is developed to estimate the line-of-sight (LOS) angles between AAVs and the target by integrating Tiny Long Short-Term Memory (TLSTM) and Kalman Filter (KF). A cooperative guidance method with the leader-first follower (LFF) configuration is proposed to achieve simultaneous attacks on a maneuvering target within a prescribed time by regulating the contraction rate of the formation. First, the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm is employed to optimize the parameters of the KF, while the TLSTM model is integrated for updating the observation for the optimized KF. The KF extracts local features of the angular data to smooth the angle predictions from the TLSTM. Subsequently, a prescribed-time guidance law is developed for the leader in the LOS direction. To ensure rapid convergence of follower AAVs, a prescribed performance control method is adopted to adjust the contraction rate of the formation. Finally, rigorous theoretical demonstration and numerical simulations validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach."

A 6cm-diameter spherical soil moisture sensor incorporates three orthogonal coil windings to reduce its orientation sensitivity and ensure sufficient inductive coupling to an above-ground system. The above-ground system employs a two-coil configuration (one for stimulation and one for detection). Each coil exhibits 20cm-radius with one turn. The two-coil configuration is highly critical for suppressing interference coupled from the stimulation coil to the detection coil by electronically controlling the loss in each coil loop under each corresponding operation. The two-phase Q-switching architecture enables a substantially increased telemetry distance. The prototype system demonstrates precision sensor’s resonant frequency detection achieving a measurement accuracy with an error less than 0.2% across an extended telemetry distance of 35cm."

    "abstract": "Privacy remains one of the central challenges to data sharing under contemporary data protection regulations. To mitigate privacy risks, real datasets are either sanitized using anonymization techniques such as generalization or suppression, or replaced with artificially generated synthetic data. The European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) defines a singling-out attack as the ability to isolate specific records and identify an individual based on the content of a released dataset. Data controllers must ensure that published data does not allow singling out. However, this concept was originally designed for anonymized datasets, where a singled-out record corresponds to a real individual. In contrast, synthetic datasets contain artificially generated records, which may or may not represent or coincide with real individuals. This distinction raises questions about the applicability and effectiveness of singling-out attacks on synthetic data. To assess the effectiveness of singling-out attacks, we evaluated the attack on synthetic data generated by three well-known generative models (CTGAN, PATEGAN, and TabDDPM) across four real-world datasets. Our study reveals inherent limitations of conventional singling-out attacks when applied to synthetic data. As the GDPR’s privacy risk framework was originally developed with anonymized data in mind rather than synthetic data, there is a critical need for further research to establish robust evaluation frameworks and metrics specifically designed to assess the privacy risks associated with synthetic data."

This refinement makes the summaries suitable for direct use as CTI or simplifies the task for security professionals to analyze relevant information. CTIGEN involves defining and extracting CTI-specific named entities, using them to fine-tune the summarization process, and creating a dataset named text-to-CTI to evaluate CTIGEN. Experimental results showed a 4.35% improvement on CNN/DailyMail dataset and a 11.96% improvement on text-to-CTI dataset, and the CTI entity coverage rate improved by 19.39% compared to the traditional pre-trained language models, confirming the model’s capability to produce concise, accurate, and CTI-oriented summaries, thereby contributing to improved efficiency in CTI generation."

    "abstract": "Intrusion detection based on Federated Learning has been proven to be an effective method to address security risks in the Internet of Things (IoT). However, it faces challenges in dealing with non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data and poisoning attacks in IoT. To address these challenges, we propose an IDS approach named Clustering and Defending Against Poisoning Attacks (CDPA). Through clustering, CDPA not only alleviates the challenges of non-IID data, but also reframes the defense against poisoning attacks as one under nearly IID conditions. CDPA uses a novel federated clustering method to ensure that malicious clients are grouped without leaking additional information, and it adaptively selects the number of clusters. Moreover, CDPA proposes a novel federated aggregation algorithm specifically designed to address the previously overlooked challenge of high malicious client ratios within clusters - a vulnerability particularly exacerbated in cluster-based training scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CDPA can effectively handle non-IID data and defend against poisoning attacks, achieving a performance gain of approximately 20% over the baseline."

    "abstract": "Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) introduces a novel paradigm in privacy-preserving computation, but operating on encrypted data imposes significant challenges, elevating data transmission, memory access demands, and programming complexity. Consequently, developing an efficient and usable system becomes vital. Conventional FHE accelerators often prioritize computational performance, typically assuming abundant encrypted data resides in accelerator memory. However, this perspective frequently overlooks the inefficiencies of the PCIe bus and main memory, alongside the complexities of optimizing for dedicated hardware in real-world deployments. This paper proposes Hypnos, a hardware/software co-design framework for memory-efficient homomorphic processing. The Hypnos framework pairs a novel processing unit architecture with a dedicated Hypnos Compiler. In architecture, the heterogeneous processing unit based on homomorphic encryption paging memory management system to reduce memory fragmentation and optimize the PCIe traffic. In software, the Hypnos compiler which is able to automatically translate high-level FHE schemes into optimized hardware commands. It schedules the data placement in cooperation with our memory management system to effectively harness the performance of hardware. This co-design of hardware and compiler not only reduces memory access and execution time but also lowers the complexity of deploying FHE applications. Finally, We implement Hypnos on the QianKun FPGA Card and highlight the following results: (1) outperforms SOTA ASIC and FPGA solutions in data-intensive applications by up to 2.75× and 4.72×; (2) the communication overhead is reduced by 4.85× compared to traditional architectures; (3) up to 30.1× and 20.7× energy efficiency improvement compared to ASIC-based ARK and FPGA-based Poseidon for ResNet-20 respectively."

By customizing the AME process parameters and curing sequences, we successfully fabricated high-resistance traces with variations in the plane width of the Conductive Ink (CI) and margins of the uncured Dielectric Ink (DI). These adjustments resulted in sheet resistance ranging from 0.372 to 1.044 Ω/□ at the room temperature, compared to only 0.013–0.033 Ω/□ with the standard printing workflow. This enabled the demonstration of tunability in the temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR), spanning a range of 429-1301 ppm/°C for printed temperature sensors."

Experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of inlet flow rate $\\left(0.5-1.25 \\mathrm{~m}^{3} / \\mathrm{h}\\right)$ and overflow split ratio $(9.75 \\%-23.5 \\%)$ on the separation efficiency and pressure drop. The results show that the separation efficiency increases significantly with both flow rate and split ratio, with more pronounced improvements under high-flow conditions. The pressure drop rises linearly with increasing flow rate, but can be partially mitigated by operating at higher split ratios. Compared with a single BCCH, the series system enhances separation performance through a multi-stage separation mechanism, achieving comparable or superior separation efficiency at relatively lower split ratios while providing greater operational flexibility. This study offers experimental evidence for optimizing operating parameters and supporting the engineering application of curved hydrocyclone series systems."

    "abstract": "To meet stringent requirements of high throughput in the 6G era, semantic communication (SC), a revolutionary framework that transmits semantic information rather than the original data, is expected to be a promising solution. However, existing SC frameworks struggle to accommodate data with new semantic features effectively and ensure minimal data processing latency. This is because achieving strong adaptability necessitates large-scale foundation models, such as large language models with robust semantic understanding, whereas low latency demands small models with simple structures. To address this issue, we propose a feature-foundation model evolution framework toward large model-empowered low-latency SC. In this framework, small-scale feature models and large-scale foundation models are deployed at edge nodes and cloud servers, respectively. The feature models perform real-time semantic encoding and decoding, and they evolve with the aid of foundation models when data with new semantic features occur, thus assuring low latency and high generalization ability simultaneously. We detail the architecture of the proposed collaborative framework and the related evolution protocol. Moreover, a case study on image transmission is presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Furthermore, we summarize and discuss several future research directions based on the collaborative framework."

Yet, existing computer vision technologies, limited by data scarcity and complex environments, fail to meet the precise safety monitoring needs in metallurgical maintenance scenarios. To address these challenges, this study first establishes the Metallurgical Equipment Maintenance Safety Image-Text Dataset, filling the data gap in this field. Subsequently, this study proposes the MEMSHIC-BLIP2 model, a Bootstrapping Language-Image Pretraining-based model for safety hazard identification and captioning, which incorporates a multilevel instruction-guided template with Q-Former domain adaptation. MEMSHIC-BLIP2 can significantly improve hazard identification accuracy and descriptive standardization while demonstrating transferability to high-risk industries such as chemical and energy sectors."

This work is a policy-oriented discussion with resource implications on two training schemes that contribute to addressing the skills gap in solar energy education. Short-term related training programs in solar engineering, such as those offered by universities, polytechnics, and vocational training centers, offer immediate technical skills but lack depth. Blended training, which emphasizes practical experience and project-based learning, has successfully produced skilled artisans with holistic knowledge in traditional engineering disciplines. However, this blended training system is yet to be adapted for training solar engineering professionals in polytechnics and vocational training centers. This has exposed critical gaps in training frameworks and the adaptability required to prepare workers for the renewable energy transition. Addressing these gaps through flexible learning paths, strong academic-industry partnerships, modern curricula, and coordinated resource mobilization could improve training outcomes and contribute to a more skilled and sustainable workforce."

    "abstract": "Thick metal barriers pose a fundamental challenge to internal wireless monitoring due to their electromagnetic shielding properties, rendering traditional radio frequency (RF) communications ineffective. Acoustic communication offers a promising alternative that is also inherently secure against remote eavesdropping. However, the solid medium itself, when acting as a communication channel, exhibits complex characteristics of high loss and severe dispersion, which severely constrains reliability. This paper aims to solve this core problem by designing and implementing a novel intra-solid acoustic communication system. The core of our approach lies in proposing and validating a robust physical layer communication paradigm for the reliable propagation of acoustic signals in such an extreme channel environment. This paradigm, by encoding and spreading signal energy across a wide frequency band, is designed to fundamentally combat the severe attenuation and frequency-selective fading introduced by the channel. We build a complete system prototype and validate the effectiveness of this paradigm through a series of experiments in a real-world solid metal environment. The experimental results demonstrate that our system can successfully establish reliable communication links through thick metal barriers, providing a validated and feasible solution for the deployment of wireless sensor networks in extremely shielded environments."

While their initial symptoms are often subtle, prolonged progression can induce severe secondary damages such as rotor grounding, exacerbating equipment deterioration. To address the challenges of high-cost physical fault replication and scarce experimental data, we developed a finite-element model based on operational power plant units. This model enables simulation of winding shortcircuit faults and facilitates fault characterization through radial search-coil monitoring. To overcome the limited sensitivity of search-coil signals during symmetrical short-circuits, we propose a CNN-based regression method that predicts healthy operational baselines. Comparative analysis between predicted and measured waveforms enables precise fault detection and localization. The algorithm’s diagnostic accuracy has been rigorously validated through comprehensive simulation studies. Furthermore, magnetic asymmetry analysis derived from the predicted curves provides critical indicators for early-stage and symmetrical fault identification, offering vital support for operational safety maintenance."

    "abstract": "OTFS faces inter-symbol interference (ISI) due to delay and/or Doppler spreads, which requires compensation with an equalizer. In addition, in multiple access scenarios where users traverse distinct channels, OTFS also encounters multi-user interference (MUI). Hence, MUI is more challenging to mitigate than intra-user ISI and becomes more severe in high-mobility scenarios, where OTFS is typically deployed. This paper proposes a novel method called pre-equalized multi-user OTFS (PreEQ-MU-OTFS), which applies pre-equalization at the transmitter, using linear precoders for each user to fundamentally mitigate MUI. Specifically, the precoder is derived by initializing with the modified Wiener filter and employing a single step of iterative minimization. Additionally, the receiver in this method requires only per-user scaling, instead of full equalization. By leveraging the property of OTFS whereby fast-varying channels exhibit nearly time-invariant characteristics in the delay-Doppler (DD) domain, PreEQ-MU-OTFS performs effectively in high-mobility channels. The proposed method demonstrates superior bit error rate (BER) performance compared to conventional post-equalization receivers such as minimum mean square error (MMSE), MMSE-successive interference cancellation (MMSE-SIC), message passing (MP), and maximum-ratio combining (MRC) receivers. This method is validated in realistic channel scenarios with moving reflectors and practical channel aging levels."

Usually, polymeric materials (typically polyethylene) are used as dielectric materials. Standard testing procedures integrate extrapolations using the analytical ageing laws mostly related to thermal and voltage ageing to investigate the impact of thermal stress and excessive temperature on lifetime of the cable insulation. Superconducting (SC) cables are cooled and maintained at a cryogenic temperature, below 77 K. In such conditions, one can expect different ageing mechanisms to be dominant rather than thermal ageing, and consequently ageing laws might be different that will impact standard type tests. To perceive the ageing law and guide the future process of manufacturing, and developing techniques for prognostic health management of SC cables as well as to predict when maintenance might be needed, ASG superconductors, University of Glasgow (UofG) and École supérieure de physique et de chimie industrielles de la ville de Paris (ESPCI) are involved in work packages related to the ageing mechanisms affecting both insulation materials and SC wires within the framework of CABLEGNOSIS project. This article presents insights on the ageing mechanisms at cryogenic temperature, an innovative prediction methodology based artificial intelligence and strategies to accelerate the ageing and acquire accurate physical information up to breakdown."

    "abstract": "Dynamic wireless charging (DWC) offers a promising solution to alleviate range anxiety of electric vehicle (EV) users. To address the limited flexibility of traditional DWC systems that rely on fixed power connections, this paper proposes a two-stage robust optimization (RO) framework for the co-planning of dynamic wireless charging lanes (DWCLs) and remote-controlled switches (RCSs). The framework explicitly models the interdependencies among DWCLs, RCSs, and power buses in an electrified transportation network. Two types of uncertainty are considered: (i) decision-dependent uncertainty, which reflects the induced effects of DWCL deployment on travelers’ stochastic path choices, and (ii) decision-independent uncertainty, arising from fluctuations in traffic demand and renewable energy generation. Decision-dependent uncertainty and decision-independent uncertainty are modeled using a random utility framework and bounded uncertainty sets, respectively. To ensure both operational feasibility and economic efficiency under uncertainty, a coordinated traffic–power flow model is integrated into the planning process. The resulting problem is reformulated as a two-stage RO model with mixed-integer recourse via linearization and convex relaxation. To solve it efficiently, an inexact nested column-and-constraint generation algorithm with sequential bound tightening is developed. Case studies demonstrate that the proposed approach effectively reduces system costs and enhances computational efficiency. Moreover, neglecting either decision-dependent uncertainty or decision-independent uncertainty can lead to significant network congestion."

Ranflood is a ransomware attack mitigation tool that confuses and overwhelms attackers by flooding the system with decoy files, thereby slowing down the attack and providing a critical window for intervention. In this paper, we extend the coverage provided by Ranflood with a new, advanced flooding strategy based on Shamir’s Secret Sharing (SSS) to counteract both crypto-and exfiltration ransomware. Our SSS-based strategy confounds ransomware by generating many shards from each user’s file, which we tune for high resilience when contrasting crypto-ransomware (so that the user can regain access to lost data from a few shards) and secrecy against exfiltration (so that the attacker needs many shards to recover the victim’s data). We explore the theoretical and practical challenges of applying SSS in this context, present the design and implementation details of our flooder, and empirically evaluate and profile its performance."

Small to Medium Manufacturing Enterprises (SMMEs), in particular, have been dependent on manual manufacturing due to the nature of their size and financial constraints. Manual manufacturing methods deployments have favoured SMMEs owing to their low-cost tasks and ease of changing the processes and systems. However, its deployment has been challenged by factors such as slow processing, longer production lead-time, production planning and execution errors, limited flexibility and scalability, miss-shipping of products ordered by the customers, product shipment delay, inefficient order fulfilment, inefficient inventory control which result into holding of stockout, difficulty to adapt to new market conditions and demands, operational inefficiency and high labour cost. Hence, this study discusses in detail the negative impacts of the usage of manual manufacturing methods on SMMEs, with a focal point on manual production and supply chain processes, and their impacts on the throughput and operational efficiency of SMMEs. Part of the conclusions generated from the study emphasized the need to shift away from traditional/manual manufacturing methods to cost-effective smart manufacturing methods."

In this study, the effect of adjacent channel interference (ACI) from unlicensed devices into 5G new radio (NR) vehicle-to-everything (V2X) devices was investigated at the link and system level simulations. After conducting link level analysis, a downtown congested traffic scenario with 330 vehicles was considered at the system level. An unlicensed device was assumed to operate using either IEEE 802.11ac or 802.11ax standard. At the link level, only the ACI from a U-NII-4 device degrades the performance of 5G NR V2X devices. At the system level, the ACI from U-NII-4 device with 90% duty cycle degrades the performance by 2.5 dB while for all other cases, a single unlicensed device does not affect the 5G NR V2X performance because it is obscured by the interference from the other 5G NR V2X devices using the same subchannels."

    "abstract": "Data-parallel ray tracing is a crucial technique for rendering large-scale scenes that exceed the memory capacity of a single compute node. It partitions scene data across multiple nodes and accesses remote data through inter-node communication. However, the resulting communication overhead remains a significant bottleneck for practical performance. Existing approaches mitigate this bottleneck by enhancing data locality through dynamic scheduling during rendering, typically employing spatial partitioning to enable access prediction. Although effective in some scenarios, these methods incur significant redundancy in base geometry when applied to large-scale instanced scenes. In this paper, we introduce the first object-space-based dynamic scheduling algorithm, which uses object groups as the scheduling units to eliminate redundant storage of base data in instanced scenes. Additionally, we propose two data access frequency prediction methods to guide asynchronous data prefetching, enhancing rendering efficiency. Compared to the state-of-the-art method, our approach achieves an average rendering speedup of 77.6%, with a maximum improvement of up to 146.1%, while incurring only a 5% increase in scene memory consumption."

The proposed topology offers 100% dc-link voltage utilization, supports midpoint clamping for possible three-phase extension, and achieves up to 33% lower maximum semiconductor voltage stress and 66% lower passive component voltage stress relative to the output voltage. Detailed comparisons with recent 13-level switched-capacitor inverter topologies highlight its advantages in voltage gain, device stress, and suitability for aerospace HFAC systems. Analytical design procedures for the switched-capacitor network and soft-charging inductors are provided. A 500 W prototype is implemented and evaluated for fundamental frequencies from 400 Hz to 1 kHz under dynamic loading, modulation index variation, and input voltage step changes. The prototype demonstrates peak efficiency of 97.08% in both simulation and experiment, along with stable operation across the tested conditions. These results confirm the proposed converter's potential for lightweight, high-efficiency, and high-frequency AC power conversion in aircraft electrification."

    "abstract": "Anomaly detection is an imperative but challenging task in intelligent surveillance due to the scarcity and irregularity. Most existing unsupervised methods mainly detect anomalies through frame prediction, but their discriminative distance is limited. Meanwhile, some issues such as lack of semantic correlation and less attention to inter-frame relations are also existed, which are important to anomaly detection. To solve these issues, a multi-perceptual framework (MPFork) using textual and visual information is proposed, which combines the ideas of fusion prediction, semantic perception, and temporal discrimination. Specifically, features fusion prediction module is devised to concentrate on representing the normality and repressing anomalies by fusing heterogeneous features. Meanwhile, an image-text semantic perception module is proposed for semantic consistency by correlating the visual with textual features, where the local and global inferences are adopted to perceive local anomalies, simultaneously measuring the belongingness of each object in global frame. Moreover, a temporal attention discrimination module is developed to capture the inter-frame relations and identify pseudo-abnormal sequences from normal ones in temporal direction. Extensive experiments show the proposed MPFork outshines most of state-of-the-art methods, which indicates the efficacy of our MPFork for anomaly detection."

However, manually linking CVEs to their corresponding TTPs is a challenging and time-consuming task, and the high volume of new vulnerabilities published annually makes automated support desirable.This paper introduces Triage, a two-pronged automated approach that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to map CVEs to relevant techniques from the Att&ck knowledge base. We first prompt an LLM with instructions based on MITRE’s CVE Mapping Methodology to predict an initial list of techniques. This list is then combined with the results from a second LLM-based module that uses in-context learning to map a CVE to relevant techniques. This hybrid approach strategically combines rule-based reasoning with data-driven inference. Our evaluation reveals that in-context learning outperforms the individual mapping methods, and the hybrid approach improves recall of exploitation techniques. We also find that GPT-4o-mini performs better than Llama3.3-70B on this task. Overall, our results show that LLMs can be used to automatically predict the impact of cybersecurity vulnerabilities and Triage makes the process of mapping CVEs to Att&ck more efficient."

Privacy-preserving data mining has become an urgent issue to address. In response, many methods for hiding association rules have emerged. In this paper, we propose an association rule hiding method based on an evolutionary algorithm, EAAIS4ARH, to eliminate or mask sensitive association rules that may reveal personal privacy or trade secrets. In EAAIS4ARH, we design an advanced initial solution generation mechanism that can significantly improve the quality of the initial solution and lay a solid foundation for the subsequent optimization process. This mechanism can also be used in other heuristic algorithm-based association rule hiding methods to improve solution quality. We introduce a unique evolutionary framework that categorizes each generation of solutions into three classes based on their performance: optimal, ordinary, and inferior. This mechanism not only promotes solution optimization, but also effectively avoids the problem of premature convergence to the local optimal solution. EAAIS4ARH also exhibits a high degree of flexibility, generating solutions that cover the spectrum from robust solutions with a zero hiding failure rate to compromise strategies that moderately sacrifice the hiding rate in exchange for a more efficient data utility, satisfying the needs of different users.Experimental results under different types of databases show that EAAIS4ARH excels in both side-effect control and data utility."

However, under the noise interference, the RMSE of estimation error between the estimated value and the true value of the motor speed by the Luenberger Observer is about $0.8258 \\mathrm{rad} / \\mathrm{s}$, and the RMSE of estimation error of the Kalman Filter is about $0.1973 \\mathrm{rad} / \\mathrm{s}$. The RMSE value of the error is reduced by 4.2 times. The output of Kalman Filter is smoother and more stable, and the dynamic tracking accuracy is higher.

Although numerous cross-chain protocols—such as atomic swaps, sidechains, and relay-based mechanisms—have been introduced to address this issue, they often face significant challenges related to privacy, security, and decentralization. In this paper, we propose a novel cross-chain protocol that enhances traditional hash-locking mechanisms by integrating zero-knowledge proofs and chameleon hash functions. Our approach ensures strong path confidentiality, such that reconstructing the payment path is computationally infeasible under the discrete logarithm assumption, even in partially compromised networks. Additionally, we introduce a multi-path atomic swap framework that supports concurrent routing and preserves transactional autonomy, enabling users to flexibly select preferred payment paths. We evaluate the performance through theoretical analysis and simulation. Comparative results demonstrate that our solution achieves secure atomicity with minimal trust assumptions and improved latency compared to existing methods."

The PT-ES problem has been studied by Yilmaz and Krstic in 2023 using chirpy probing and time-varying gains that grow unbounded. To alleviate the gain singularity, in this paper we present an alternative approach, employing delays with <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">bounded time-periodic</i> gains, for achieving prescribed-time convergence to the extremum.

At its core, PIM systems implement computing primitives such as logic operations and multiply-accumulate acceleration through compute-in-memory, near-memory processing, or hybrid designs. The role of memory cells varies widely across technologies, acting as inputs, outputs, or analog accumulators through bit-lines and sense amplifiers. This diversity creates trade-offs in precision, bandwidth, latency, and programmability, making it difficult to build a unified understanding on the progress of the field. In this survey, we organize recent advances of PIM into three areas. First, we discuss the progress on the architectural optimizations of PIM and its integration with both DRAM and emerging non-volatile memories. Second, we examine how PIM is being used to accelerate key computing domains, including generative AI workloads and high-performance kernels, along with new approaches. Third, we highlight the growing adoption of PIM in computational sciences, where it is being applied to solve interdisciplinary problems such as genome analysis, mRNA quantification, mass spectrometry, quantum circuit simulation, wave modeling, and secure computation. Finally, we synthesize the major challenges that continue to slow PIM adoption, including manufacturing constraints, power delivery, thermal reliability, data consistency, runtime and memory-management coordination, and the difficulty of building portable software abstractions without sacrificing commercial viability. This work provides an updated, structured perspective on PIM’s potential across computing and computational sciences and the barriers that must be solved for it to reach its full impact."

However, traditional accurate power simulation requires time-consuming back-end processing and simulation steps, which significantly impede design optimization. To address this, we propose ATLAS, which can predict the ultimate time-based layout power for any new design in the gate-level netlist. In addition, we extend ATLAS to support power prediction using only RTL-stage toggle information, further increasing its applicability and efficiency. To the best of our knowledge, ATLAS is the first work that supports both time-based power simulation and general cross-design power modeling. It achieves such general time-based power modeling by proposing a new pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm customized for circuit power. Targeting golden per-cycle layout power from commercial tools, our ATLAS achieves the average mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of only 5.41%, 3.79%, and 7.51% for the clock tree, register, and combinational power groups, respectively, without any layout information. Overall, the average MAPE for the total power of the entire design is 3.05%, and the inference speed of a workload is significantly faster than the standard flow of commercial tools. Furthermore, ATLAS can bypass the time-consuming signal propagation process, and when using only RTL-stage toggle information, achieves a total power MAPE as low as 5.00%."

Exploiting this vulnerability, adversarial FDIAs have been designed to evade DNN-based detection. In this paper, we propose a black-box adversarial false data injection attack leveraging autoencoders. The attack uses an autoencoder to learn the underlying physical model of grid data without prior knowledge of the network topology or detection mechanisms. This is jointly optimized with a surrogate model to generate adversarial perturbations. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed attack successfully evades both conventional bad data detectors and DNN-based detectors, achieving high success rates in black-box settings. This vulnerability poses a significant security threat to smart grids."

To address these challenges, we propose Decoupled-Curriculum Adversarial Robustness Learning, a two-stage framework. The Initial Representation and Balancing stage employs inter-class margin adjustment via LDAM with a Deferred Re-weighting schedule to build balanced, transferable representations. The Adaptive Correctness-Aware Robustness Learning stage adapts the per-class PGD perturbation budget using class-wise correctness signals and optimizes a balanced loss that combines mean, medium-class protection, and tail-class reinforcement components, aligning robust learning across head, medium, and tail classes. Experiments on standard long-tailed benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our approach, yielding consistent improvements in both natural and robust performance."

Those in the Repeated Exposure condition played one VR game (either a puzzle game or a climbing game) on three separate days followed by a different VR game (a survival game) on the fourth day. Those in the Single Exposure condition played the survival game once. The three games all differed in several ways, including environment and task, whereas the puzzle and survival games shared a similar joystick locomotion interface that differed from the locomotion interface in the climbing game. Results indicate that cybersickness on Day 4 of the Repeated Exposure condition was significantly lower than that in the Single Exposure condition, regardless of which game was experienced on Days 1-3. The practical implication of this finding is that CARE that occurs in one VR context can generalize to a novel context with a distinct environment, task, and locomotion interface. Results are considered in the context of multiple theoretical explanations for CARE, including sensory rearrangement and habituation. These results support systematic exposure as an approach to reducing cybersickness."

    "abstract": "This article takes up for discussion the distributed secure state estimation issue for a specific category of nonlinear systems with random measurement delays and being subject to random deception attacks. To prolong the signal transmission distance, the amplify-and-forward (AF) relays are incorporated. A distinctive recursive state estimation algorithm is formulated, adopting a pattern reminiscent of a Kalman-type filter. Firstly, an upper bound matrix (UBM) for the estimation error (EE) variance is calculated. Then the estimator gain matrices are obtained by minimizing the calculated UBM. Subsequently, the impact of the transmission energies from sensors and relays on estimation performance is analyzed. Finally, the proposed estimation algorithm is confirmed through a simulation example, demonstrating its effectiveness."

    "abstract": "People have a hard time using cloud computing because of rules concerning privacy and security in fields like healthcare and banking. Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) lets computers work with encrypted data, but it puts a lot of burden on them. This paper introduces SMMHE (Secure Matrix Multiplication with FHE), a novel element-wise approach that enhances SIMD parallelism in contemporary FHE frameworks to mitigate costly rotation operations. SMMHE is 3.98× faster than the most common FHE-based multiplication techniques, according to thorough testing. This big speedup, which cuts the difference in performance between encrypted and plaintext computation by a lot, makes it much easier to use privacy-preserving cloud applications in real life, like classifying medical images. For encrypted MNIST classification, the amortized duration of 26 ms per image is an excellent example of this."

    "abstract": "The security of Internet of Things (IoT) edge networks is often compromised by static schedules, infrequent credential renewal, and cryptographic mechanisms that operate independently of network reconfiguration. Existing approaches rarely integrate session-awareness, adaptive clustering, Quality of Service (QoS) control, and trust-based routing with coordinated cryptographic adaptation, leaving IoT deployments vulnerable to evolving threats. To address this gap, we propose SecuRecNet-IoT, a session-aware and reconfigurable security framework that couples event-triggered AES-128 key rotation with cluster reconfiguration. In a 61-node Contiki-NG testbed, 402 key rotations across 57 adaptation events were performed, sustaining forward secrecy with only 3.2% security overhead. The framework combines Balanced Iterative Reducing and Clustering using Hierarchies (BIRCH) with Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) to optimise trust propagation and resource efficiency, while autonomously renewing credentials based on key aging and validity. By embedding cryptographic agility directly into the reconfiguration process. Evaluation shows that our work improves secure session concurrency, reduces latency, increases throughput, and lowers energy use, all while preserving baseline QoS and performance. These findings highlight SecuRecNet-IoT as a practical, scalable solution for next-generation IoT edge deployments requiring both strong security and high efficiency."

    "abstract": "The mining sector faces persistent funding challenges due to high risk, low liquidity, and limited transparency. Traditional financing methods are costly, slow, and inaccessible for small or early-stage ventures. This paper presents a platform Asteroid X, a blockchain-based Decentralized Finance (DeFi) platform tailored to these challenges. Asteroid X has an architecture that combines semi-centralized governance model to ensure rigorous projects on boarding and legal compliance – with fully on chain settlement mechanisms to facilitate transparent, secure, and efficient capital flows. Built on the ERC-1155 multi-token standard, Asteroid X tokenizes real-world mining rights and supports fractional ownership through a modular smart contract framework. Its layered architecture includes an API gateway, decentralized marketplace, and oracle integration to bridge off-chain geological data. Asteroid X is validated through test deployments on HashKey Chain and Ethereum Sepolia. Comparative analysis against traditional exchanges, such as the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX), highlights significant gains in cost efficiency, transaction speed, and investor inclusivity. The results substantiate the applicability and transformative potential of blockchain-driven DeFi frameworks within capital-intensive industries such as mining, offering enhanced security, transparency, and inclusivity."

    "abstract": "Group buying is widely used by enterprises. However, for competing retailers in B2B settings, it yields new challenges: comparison with individual purchasing, is it always beneficial to the retailers who have competitive relationship? how to engage into group buying, and how the competition intensity and bargaining power affect group buying? The paper considers a supply chain consists of one manufacturer and two competing retailers, in which the weaker retailer has no bargaining power and acts as the Stackelberg follower with the manufacturer, and the stronger retailer has relative bargaining power with the manufacturer. The paper studies group buying by investigation of two types of group buying mechanism: equal price mechanism and fixed price mechanism. The analyses show new insights as follows: For the weaker retailer it always prefers group buying. However, for the stronger retailer, it prefers group buying of fixed price while its bargaining power exceeds a certain threshold, or it prefers group buying of equal price under a relatively low bargaining power with a very high competition intensify. Otherwise, it will choose individual purchasing and refuse group buying."

    "abstract": "Under China’s dual-carbon targets and the agenda of high-quality power grid development, investment decisions for transmission and transformation projects need to jointly account for life-cycle costs and carbon emissions. In practice, however, scheme comparison still emphasizes upfront construction costs and a narrow set of technical indicators, while operation and maintenance costs, energy loss costs, and carbon costs over the life cycle are often underrepresented. This study analyzes the cost and carbon-emission components of transmission and transformation projects across the planning and design, construction, operation and maintenance, and end-of-life phases, and develops a multidimensional evaluation index system covering technical and safety performance, economic and life-cycle cost performance, environmental and carbon performance, and social and comprehensive benefits. Indicator weights are derived using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), and the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) is applied to evaluate and rank three alternative schemes for a 220 kV transmission and transformation project. The results show that, after incorporating loss-related costs and carbon costs into the lifecycle cost assessment, a scheme with slightly higher initial investment achieves better performance in both life-cycle economic efficiency and environmental impact, and becomes the overall preferred option. The proposed AHP-TOPSIS-based “lifecycle + carbon” multi-criteria evaluation framework provides a concise and practical decision-support tool for investment scheme selection in transmission and transformation projects."

Horizontal partitioning is a key optimization technique used to address this issue. However, identifying the optimal partitioning scheme is an NP-hard problem due to the vast solution space. While metaheuristics like NSGA-II have been applied, their effectiveness is often limited by static parameters. This paper proposes a novel hybrid approach that integrates machine learning with metaheuristics to enhance horizontal partitioning. By using ML to generate high-quality initial solutions and dynamically adjust genetic algorithm parameters, the method improves both convergence speed and solution quality. Experimental results demonstrate that this ML-guided metaheuristic approach significantly enhances query performance and overall system efficiency."

    "abstract": "Sucker rod pump fault diagnosis faces several challenges, including the reliance of supervised learning on highquality labeled data, data imbalance, and limited model interpretability. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel fault diagnosis framework that integrates unsupervised learning with counterfactual explanations. The framework first employs a Transformer-based autoencoder to learn the normal operational patterns of the equipment from unlabeled data. Subsequently, a Gaussian Mixture Model is applied for probabilistic modeling in the latent feature space to quantify anomaly risk. The key component of this framework is the introduction of a generative model-based counterfactual explanation mechanism, which generates “minimal-change” to identify key factors causing anomalies and guide repairs, thereby addressing the “black box” problem of deep learning models. Experimental results on a real-world dataset from a shale oil field show that the proposed unsupervised model demonstrates superior performance compared to supervised benchmarks across key evaluation metrics. This performance, achieved without relying on fault labels, validates the method’s effectiveness for interpretable and data-efficient predictive maintenance in practical industrial environments."
