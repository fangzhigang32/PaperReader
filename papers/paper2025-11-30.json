    "abstract": "Against the backdrop of smart education, family education has long been confronted with the “isolation predicament\" of fragmented home-school resources, obstacles to data intercommunication, and weakened emotional connection. This study takes digital transformation as the entry point, constructs a “data symbiosis\" theoretical framework, and explores the path of paradigm innovation for family education to move from isolation to collaboration. The research proposes a “data-emotion\" dual-cycle paradigm, indicatively builds a digital transformation maturity model consisting of three stages: “connection\", “collaboration\", and “symbiosis\", and designs a resource allocation mechanism based on dynamic digital credentials. Theoretically, it breaks through the paradox of technology empowerment, and practically provides a replaceable data governance solution for the new infrastructure of education. It offers theoretical and practical paradigms for resolving the home-school collaboration predicament and achieving inclusive education, and provides theoretical basis and policy references for promoting systematic changes in family education."

    "url": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3764206.3764348",
    "source": "ACM",
    "abstract": "This study addresses critical limitations in traditional vocational education assessment systems by integrating value-added assessment theory with artificial intelligence (AI) to develop a Two-Orientation Four-Dimensional (TOFD) evaluation model. Targeting environmental monitoring courses in higher vocational education, the proposed system overcomes fragmented evaluation dimensions, static monitoring, and delayed feedback inherent in conventional methods. The TOFD framework employs AI-driven analytics to track longitudinal student growth across four dimensions: knowledge acquisition, technical skills, professional literacy, and career development. Leveraging multi-source data from academic platforms, simulations, and industry partnerships, the model enables real-time competency profiling and dynamic feedback. A study with 97 students showed the value-added group outperformed the traditional-evaluation group, with ​12.59% rise in vocational skill certification rates; 11.14% higher competition awards; and 10.92% improved employer satisfaction. The process-oriented metrics demonstrated a 29.18% relative value-added rate in final project scores compared to initial benchmarks for individual cases, while the class-wide average reached 26.27%.Results validate the system's efficacy in bridging skill gaps, enhancing self-efficacy, and aligning vocational training with industry needs. The study establishes a replicable AI-powered assessment paradigm that shifts vocational education evaluation from terminal certification to competency development, offering actionable insights for curriculum reform and digital transformation in technical education."

The model constructs a multi-source behavioral feature space from course evaluations, grade data, and interest questionnaires to cluster student preferences, and generates a heterogeneous student-course bipartite graph for label-based recommendation propagation. Experimental evaluations were conducted on a three-year dataset simulating a real university course selection system, comprising 6,200 students and over 450 courses. Results demonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms traditional collaborative filtering, matrix factorization, and graph convolutional methods across Precision@10, NDCG@10, and system responsiveness. Ablation studies further confirm the independent contributions of dynamic clustering and propagation mechanisms. The proposed method exhibits high scalability, adaptability, and interpretability, providing an effective solution for building feedback-driven and behavior-aware educational recommendation systems."

    "abstract": "Social media platforms are frequently targeted by entities engaging in automated or coordinated behavior, aiming to manipulate public opinion or conduct information operations without revealing their synthetic or managed nature. Research on detecting such actors faces the challenge of developing scalable, versatile methods that allow for consistent comparisons across diverse datasets. The challenge is even made more pressing by evidence of these actors on platforms beyond the extensively studied X (formerly Twitter), as well as the emergence of new platforms. We fill this gap by introducing a novel compression-based detection methodology, in addition to a new sparse method for network reconstruction that scales linearly under reasonable parameter choice. Being independent of the social media platform and the behavioral trace under study, our approach marks a departure from traditional methods that rely on multiple criteria or measures to assess user similarity. We evaluate our technique on multiple benchmark and real-world datasets, including widely known datasets related to political campaigns and emerging misinformation scenarios. We show that our approach provides a flexible unsupervised framework that effectively identifies both automated and coordinated activities across various behavioral traces, ensuring broad applicability."

    "abstract": "Flow theory emphasizes learners’ optimal psychological state during task engagement, which plays a crucial role in promoting performance and satisfaction in foreign language learning. This study constructed two Back Propagation (BP) neural network prediction models to investigate Chinese English-as-a-foreign-language (EFL) learners’ flow experience and the consequences in the context of intercultural English teaching. Based on a theoretical framework integrating flow antecedents, flow experience, and flow consequences, data were collected from 456 non-English major college students through structured questionnaires and writing tasks. The first BP neural network model was trained to predict flow experience from seven variables of flow antecedents, while the second model was developed to predict five learning outcome variables—knowledge, skill, attitude, satisfaction, and achievement—based on learners’ flow experience. The Levenberg–Marquardt (LM) algorithm was applied to ensure high training efficiency and prediction accuracy. Results showed strong correlations between flow antecedents and flow experience, as well as between flow experience and flow consequences. Both models demonstrated good predictive performance, with regression coefficients above 0.82 in training and testing phases. Although certain individual prediction errors were noted, most deviations remained within acceptable ranges. This two-stage modeling approach enhances interpretability, improves generalization, and provides valuable guidance for optimizing intercultural English instruction through flow-based educational design."

Confronted with information overload and stagnant knowledge updates, AI technologies—including natural language processing (NLP), knowledge graphs, and federated learning—enable semantic comprehension, dynamic knowledge discovery, and secure cross-institutional collaboration. Transformer-based models (e.g., BERT, GPT-4) enhance precision by interpreting contextual semantics, while recommendation systems personalize literature delivery through user behavior analysis. AI also safeguards integrity via plagiarism detection and blockchain-based data provenance. Challenges persist, such as terminological diversity and overreliance on AI tools, necessitating domain-specific model refinement, explainable AI frameworks, and hybrid pedagogy blending AI assistance with critical thinking training. Ethical risks are mitigated through federated learning with differential privacy and three-tier oversight. Future directions emphasize specialty-specific AI models, immersive Extended Reality (XR) learning environments, and global collaboration via initiatives like the ``Digital Silk Road\" for standardized data sharing. By integrating technological innovation with interdisciplinary education, AI empowers researchers to navigate evolving medical frontiers, fostering data-knowledge dual-driven talent aligned with precision medicine and smart healthcare paradigms."

    "abstract": "In complex cooperative tasks, Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) faces the dual challenges of an exponentially growing joint action space and the constraints of partial observability. While the Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution (CTDE) paradigm is widely adopted, it often leads to homogeneous policies that lack the necessary specialization for complex teamwork. While role-based methods encourage specialization, they often lack mechanisms for inter-agent interaction. Consequently, the lack of rich information for role assignment means their roles may be assigned ineffectively, hindering the convergence of the team policy to its optimum. To address this critical gap, we propose ROIS, a novel framework that enhances multi-agent collaboration by grounding dynamic role assignments in a context-time-aware information sharing mechanism. Our key insight is to leverage a dedicated information sharing module that captures multi-step temporal context, providing each agent with richer, tailored feedback from its teammates. This mechanism directly addresses the lack of inter-agent interaction, leading to more accurate and effective role assignments. This results in a more coherent task division, which guides specialized policies toward the optimal joint policy and drastically reduces ineffective exploration. We conduct extensive experiments on the demanding StarCraft II, SMACv2, and Multi-agent Particle Environment benchmarks. The results demonstrate that ROIS consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming a wide range of advanced baselines, particularly in scenarios requiring deep coordination and policy adaptation. Finally, comprehensive ablation studies confirm the essential contribution of each component to the framework’s success."

    "abstract": "Face recognition systems offer a range of applications that enhance security, efficiency, and personalization, e.g., access control, identity verification, personalized services, etc. Mainstream facial recognition systems employ the Edge-Cloud architecture to protect user privacy by storing facial feature data instead of original facial images. However, recently emerging reconstruction attacks based on deep learning can recover the visual information of original facial images from facial features, resulting in face privacy disclosure. Existing anti-reconstruction approaches either compromise facial recognition accuracy or fail to meet real-time requirements. In this paper, we propose a practical privacy-preserving approach based on adversarial perturbations against reconstruction attacks. By incorporating subtle adversarial interference into facial features, the mapping relationship from facial features to original facial images is disrupted, and the baseline reconstruction networks cannot recover the original face image. We conducted experiments on two facial recognition models, Facenet and Arcface, both widely deployed in practical scenarios. The results show that the face recognition accuracy sacrifice of less than 1% can significantly reduce the quality of the reconstructed image. In terms of efficiency, the average time to generate an adversarial facial feature is less than 10 ms, meeting the real-time requirements of facial recognition."

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of modern educational technology, how to deeply integrate the cultivation and assessment of teaching skills of teacher trainees with artificial intelligence technology has become an important issue in the field of education. Traditional assessment methods mainly consist of manual observation and subjective evaluation, but these evaluation methods have problems such as inefficiency and susceptibility to personal bias, which lead to unfair and inaccurate assessment results. To solve these problems, this paper designs and realizes an intelligent assessment and training system for teacher training skills based on AIGC technology. The system is capable of receiving and analyzing the lecture videos of teacher trainees, and extracting feature data including voice, body, expression, dress, PPT and other dimensions from the videos for comprehensive scoring, with the aim of providing teacher trainees with comprehensive, objective, and efficient assessment results and personalized training suggestions, and assisting in the enhancement of teacher trainees' teaching skills."

    "abstract": "Data-oriented Thinking is a core disciplinary thinking skill in computer networking Laboratory courses, and its cultivation strategy emphasizes transfer and application. Industry and enterprises urgently require talents equipped with Data-oriented Thinking, which drives the progression of Laboratory instruction from basic verification to practical application. This study adopts a ``verification–transfer” strategy, structuring each Laboratory as a progression from basic verification tasks to transfer-oriented application tasks. Following the Data-oriented Thinking process—task execution, data collection, data analysis, intelligent data interpretation, and principle verification—ChatGPT is employed to design verification tasks as well as practical or contextual application tasks, while AI teaching assistants assist in data interpretation. Cognitive load is regulated at the preparation, implementation, and summary stages of each Laboratory. Practical results indicate that students report high levels of satisfaction with the Data-oriented Thinking methodology, cognitive load regulation, and the support functions provided by the AI teaching assistant. A K-means clustering analysis of 97 questionnaire responses identifies three student profiles: higher-order thinking-oriented, AI-supported, and passive task-completing types. Targeted instructional optimization strategies are proposed for each profile."

Aiming at the limitations of existing recommendation algorithms in dealing with large-scale data and complex user needs, this paper proposes a deep learning model that integrates long short-term memory network (LSTM) and double-layer attention mechanism. The model takes into account the long-term and short-term preferences of students, and provides more accurate personalized recommendation by learning students' historical behavior and current situation. The experimental results show that the algorithm proposed in this paper is superior to the traditional User-CF method in the key indicators of NDCG, MSE, precision and recall, which verifies its effectiveness and superiority in the personalized recommendation of aesthetic education courses."

    "abstract": "More than 2,000 years ago, classical Chinese educators put forward the concept of ``teaching students according to their aptitude\", but this idea has gradually given way to a system of ``formalism\" and ``bureaucracy\" during historical development. With the development of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC), this is finally changing. However, the dependence on the network environment has brought about many hidden dangers such as network information interference and privacy data protection. To practice the concept of ``teaching students according to their aptitude\" put forward by educators in the classical Chinese era, we have designed a series of software CLAP (Chat Local and Persistent) based on AIGC technology and using large language models. On the other hand, the software can also help learners transfer their own conversational context, allowing them to ``personalize learning\" according to their situation. Of course, this software is still in the early stages of development, and its current functions are limited to scenarios based on generalized language learning, including programming language learning and foreign language learning. Future research may consider further focusing on multimodal support and complex discipline support."

    "abstract": "In the era of digital transformation of education, smart classrooms are innovating the educational model by seamlessly integrating information technology with teaching space. However, the current data resources are often fragmented, resulting in storage isolation, analysis lag and application inefficiency. These problems hinder the intelligent development of key areas such as teaching quality evaluation and equipment maintenance optimization. To address these challenges, this study proposes a five-layer smart classroom data resource architecture covering data acquisition, storage, management, analysis, and application. Through multi-source perception technology, teaching equipment, student behavior, environmental parameters and network interaction data are integrated, and a hierarchical and classified storage mechanism and data quality management system are constructed. The LSTM neural network model is used to mine the long-term dependencies of time series data. The architecture is helpful to the dynamic optimization of teaching decision, the active warning of equipment failure and the intelligent recommendation of environmental regulation, and provides a comprehensive solution to achieve the precision of education process and the scientific management of teaching."
