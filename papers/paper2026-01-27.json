    "abstract": "Segmentation of the pubic symphysis and fetal head (PSFH) is a critical procedure in intrapartum monitoring and is essential for evaluating labor progression and identifying potential delivery complications. However, achieving accurate segmentation remains a significant challenge due to class imbalance, ambiguous boundaries, and noise interference in ultrasound images, compounded by the scarcity of high-quality annotated data. Current research on PSFH segmentation predominantly relies on CNN and Transformer architectures, leaving the potential of more powerful models underexplored. In this work, we propose a Dual-Student and Teacher framework combining CNN and SAM (DSTCS), which integrates the Segment Anything Model (SAM) into a dual student-teacher architecture. A cooperative learning mechanism between the CNN and SAM branches significantly improves segmentation accuracy. The proposed scheme also incorporates a specialized data augmentation strategy optimized for boundary processing and a novel loss function. Extensive experiments on the MICCAI 2023 and 2024 PSFH segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that our method exhibits superior robustness and significantly outperforms existing techniques, providing a reliable segmentation tool for clinical practice."

For this last purpose, we report an improved measurement of the $2\\,^3{S}_1 \\to 2\\,^1{S}_0$ transition frequency in $^4$He with 48 Hz uncertainty (0.25 ppt), using a Bose-Einstein condensed sample confined in a magic-wavelength optical dipole trap. A systematic Doppler shift from condensate motion is suppressed by time-resolved ion detection, and the transition frequency is calibrated via a White Rabbit link to a remote active hydrogen maser clock. Combined with previous $^3$He measurements and improved theory, we obtain the most precise determination to date of the charge-radius difference between the alpha and helion particles of $r_{h}^2 -r_α^2$ of $1.0676(10)\\text{fm}^2$. This is consistent with other recent determinations and confirms that the current discrepancy between QED theory and experimentally observed ionization energies of excited states in helium is not apparent in the isotope shift."

Existing research primarily focuses on pedestrian-AV interactions, with limited attention given to other road users, such as cyclists and drivers of manually driven vehicles. So far, no studies have compared the effects of eHMIs across these three road user roles. Therefore, we conducted a within-subjects virtual reality experiment (N=40), evaluating the subjective and objective impact of an eHMI communicating the AV's intention to pedestrians, cyclists, and drivers under various levels of distraction (no distraction, visual noise, interference). eHMIs positively influenced safety perceptions, trust, perceived usefulness, and mental demand across all roles. While distraction and road user roles showed significant main effects, interaction effects were only observed in perceived usability. Thus, a unified eHMI design is effective, facilitating the standardization and broader adoption of eHMIs in diverse traffic."

    "abstract": "The automation of analog integrated circuit (IC) design remains a longstanding challenge, primarily due to the intricate interdependencies among physical layout, parasitic effects, and circuit-level performance. These interactions impose complex constraints that are difficult to accurately capture and optimize using conventional design methodologies. Although recent advances in machine learning (ML) have shown promise in automating specific stages of the analog design flow, the development of holistic, end-to-end frameworks that integrate these stages and iteratively refine layouts using post-layout, parasitic-aware performance feedback is still in its early stages. Furthermore, progress in this direction is hindered by the limited availability of open, high-quality datasets tailored to the analog domain, restricting both the benchmarking and the generalizability of ML-based techniques. To address these limitations, we present OSIRIS, a scalable dataset generation pipeline for analog IC design. OSIRIS systematically explores the design space of analog circuits while producing comprehensive performance metrics and metadata, thereby enabling ML-driven research in electronic design automation (EDA). In addition, we release a dataset consisting of 87,100 circuit variations generated with OSIRIS, accompanied by a reinforcement learning (RL)-based baseline method that exploits OSIRIS for analog design optimization."

    "abstract": "Current and upcoming large-scale structure surveys are pushing toward increasingly wide angular coverage, where wide-angle effects (arising from the varying line of sight across the curved sky) become critical for accurate modeling of the three-dimensional galaxy power spectrum. At the same time, these survey's broader redshift reach makes the effects of redshift evolution (beyond the effective-redshift approximation) non-negligible on large radial scales. Additional observational effects such as the survey window function and integral constraints also become significant on these large scales, necessitating a careful theoretical treatment to robustly constrain local primordial non-Gaussianities and relativistic effects. In this work, we present a consistent and accurate theoretical framework for modeling the commonly used power spectrum multipoles (PSM) on large scales using the discrete spherical Fourier-Bessel (dSFB) basis. This basis ensures numerical stability and allows an exact separation between angular and radial modes. Using the dSFB basis, we study the impact of wide-angle effects and redshift evolution on the PSM, and incorporate the effects of window function convolution and integral constraints. We validate our PSM modeling using lognormal mocks under radial integral constraints with realistic survey geometries, demonstrating the readiness of our framework for application to all-sky galaxy surveys."

By reporting the Pareto Front from a within-subjects VR study (N=19), this paper proposes optimal design trade-offs. Follow-up analysis demonstrates MOBO's success in discovering effective intervention strategies, with reduced participant mental demand, alongside enhanced predictability and usefulness while engaging with the proactive IVCA. Implications for computational techniques in future research on proactive intervention strategies are discussed. ProVoice can extend to include alternative design parameters and driving scenarios, encouraging intervention design on a broad scale."

To address this issue, we analyze the impact of different segments of the reasoning path on the correctness of the final result and, based on these insights, propose Reinforcement Fine-Tuning with Partial Reasoning Optimization (RPO), a plug-and-play reinforcement fine-tuning algorithm. Unlike traditional reinforcement fine-tuning algorithms that generate full reasoning paths, RPO trains the model by generating suffixes of the reasoning path using experience cache. During the rollout phase of training, RPO reduces token generation in this phase by approximately 95%, greatly lowering the theoretical time overhead. Compared with full-path reinforcement fine-tuning algorithms, RPO reduces the training time of the 1.5B model by 90% and the 7B model by 72%. At the same time, it can be integrated with typical algorithms such as GRPO and DAPO, enabling them to achieve training acceleration while maintaining performance comparable to the original algorithms.

    "abstract": "CP4 3HDM is a curious version of the three-Higgs-doublet model built upon a CP symmetry of order 4 (dubbed CP4). When extended to fermions, CP4 leads to unusually tight correlations between the scalar and Yukawa sectors and induces tree-level flavor changing neutral couplings. Still, viable scenarios exist, in which quark flavor changing signals remain within experimental limits. In this work, we extend CP4 to the lepton sector and investigate whether the lepton-Higgs couplings and lepton flavor violating (LFV) signals can also be kept under control. We consider two classes of LFV processes: tree-level lepton decays of the 125 GeV Higgs boson and one-loop radiative decay $μ\\rightarrow eγ$. For each CP4-invariant lepton Yukawa scenario, we perform a focused Yukawa sector scan that uses physical lepton properties as input and suppresses LFV effects. We identify a promising CP4 3HDM scenario compatible with the present-day experimental constraints, show that it can accommodate the recent CMS hint of a 146 GeV scalar decaying to $eμ$, and argue that this interpretation can be tested at future colliders."

    "abstract": "Domain Generalization (DG) is a critical area that focuses on developing models capable of performing well on data from unseen distributions, which is essential for real-world applications. Existing approaches primarily concentrate on learning domain-invariant features, which assume that a model robust to variations in the source domains will generalize well to unseen target domains. However, these approaches neglect a deeper analysis at the parameter level, which makes the model hard to explicitly differentiate between parameters sensitive to domain shifts and those robust, potentially hindering its overall ability to generalize. In order to address these limitations, we first build a covariance-based parameter sensitivity analysis framework to quantify the sensitivity of each parameter in a model to domain shifts. By computing the covariance of parameter gradients across multiple source domains, we can identify parameters that are more susceptible to domain variations, which serves as our theoretical foundation. Based on this, we propose Domain-Sensitive Parameter Regularization (DSP-Reg), a principled framework that guides model optimization by a soft regularization technique that encourages the model to rely more on domain-invariant parameters while suppressing those that are domain-specific. This approach provides a more granular control over the model's learning process, leading to improved robustness and generalization to unseen domains. Extensive experiments on benchmarks, such as PACS, VLCS, OfficeHome, and DomainNet, demonstrate that DSP-Reg outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving an average accuracy of 66.7\\% and surpassing all baselines."

To address this, recent studies have applied natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning techniques to classify comments according to developers' intentions. However, existing datasets for this task suffer from size limitations and class imbalance, as they rely on manual annotations and may not accurately represent the distribution of comments in real-world codebases. To overcome this issue, we introduce new synthetic oversampling and augmentation techniques based on high-quality data generation to enhance the NLBSE'26 challenge datasets.

We consider the low but finite Reynolds number regime, $Re = a U ρ_f / μ_f$, and the dilute limit of small droplet volume fraction $φ$. Here, $U$ denotes the magnitude of the relative velocity between the phases, $a$ the droplet radius, and $ρ_f$ and $μ_f$ the density and viscosity of the continuous phase, respectively. We show that the $O(Re)$ inertial corrections to the first and second moments of force scale as $O(ρ_f φU^2)$ and $O(aρ_fφU^2)$, respectively. Moreover, the ensemble average of the drag force and the higher-order force moments over the distribution of droplet velocities introduces additional contributions proportional to the velocity variance of the dispersed phase, both in the interphase momentum exchange and in the effective stress of the continuous phase. As a consequence, in dilute emulsions of buoyant droplets, the effective stress depends quadratically on the relative velocity between the phases, on the velocity variance of the dispersed phase, and on the spatial gradients of these quantities."

By utilizing bare Green's functions to map the quantum tunneling problem onto a scattering formalism, we demonstrate that the summation of infinite quantum paths recovers the exact tunneling coefficients, enabling an analytical solution of the Dyson equation where the strong nuclear force is modeled as a surface delta-shell impurity embedded within the Coulomb field. Applying this framework to the astrophysically relevant $p + {}^{7}\\text{Li}$, $p + {}^{14}\\text{N}$, and $p + {}^{23}\\text{Na}$ systems, we achieve precise agreement with experimental resonance energies while revealing a fundamental physical distinction in resonance formation. The heavier ${}^{23}\\text{Na}$ system is identified as a saturated state, residing on a geometric plateau where the resonance energy becomes insensitive to the interaction strength; our calculated value of $2.11$~MeV aligns remarkably well with the experimental level of $2.08$~MeV. In contrast, the lighter ${}^7\\text{Li}$ and ${}^{14}\\text{N}$ systems emerge as threshold states in a weak-coupling window, where the resonance energy is highly sensitive to the potential parameters and is sustained near the continuum edge. In this regime, our model yields energies of $0.489$~MeV and $1.067$~MeV, closely reproducing the experimental benchmarks of $0.441$~MeV and $1.058$~MeV, respectively. We demonstrate that these threshold states are characterized by a significant enhancement of the resonant cross-section, driven by the inverse relationship between the tunneling width and the spectral density peak."

However, as these architectures scale toward artificial Kitaev chains with phase-control loops, local accessibility becomes restricted, constraining conventional local parity control and detection. While Andreev molecules offer a platform for non-local intervention, deterministic protocols for parity manipulation have yet to be experimentally established. Here, we demonstrate deterministic non-local control over the parity configuration of a quantum dot (QD) by electrically modulating the coherent hybridization with a spatially adjacent QD within an Andreev molecule. By systematically investigating three distinct joint parity configuration regimes in the elastic co-tunneling limit, we experimentally uncover the operational conditions for this non-local control. In conjunction with theoretical simulations establishing a global phase diagram, we identify a set of universal selection rules governing parity transitions, dictated by the symmetry-imposed interplay between the joint parity configuration and the dominant inter-dot coupling mechanism (elastic co-tunneling vs. crossed Andreev reflection). Furthermore, we establish the supercurrent, directly signaled by zero-bias conductance peaks, as an intrinsic, sensor-free probe of the parity configuration, obviating the need for auxiliary charge sensors. Our results provide a validated physical framework for parity engineering, offering a key building block for scalable, multi-QD superconducting architectures."

Methodologically, we introduce a Pareto-consistent loss that balances trade-offs between regional uncertainties by adaptively reshaping the loss landscape and constraining convergence dynamics between interior and boundary regions; this guides the model toward Pareto-approximate solutions. To address boundary ambiguity, we further develop a fuzzy labeling mechanism that maintains binary confidence in non-boundary areas while enabling smooth transitions near boundaries, stabilizing gradients, and expanding flat regions in the loss surface. Experiments on brain metastasis and non-metastatic tumor segmentation show consistent improvements across multiple configurations, with our method outperforming traditional crisp-set approaches in all tumor subregions."

    "abstract": "Modern data parallel (DP) training favors collective communication over parameter servers (PS) for its simplicity and efficiency under balanced workloads. However, the balanced workload assumption no longer holds in large language model (LLM) post-training due to the high variance in sequence lengths. Under imbalanced workloads, collective communication creates synchronization barriers, leading to under-utilization of devices with smaller workloads. This change in training dynamics calls for a revisit of the PS paradigm for its robustness to such imbalance. We propose \\textbf{On-Demand Communication (ODC)}, which adapts PS into Fully Sharded Data Parallel (FSDP) by replacing collective all-gather and reduce-scatter with direct point-to-point communication. Compared to FSDP, ODC reduces the synchronization barrier from once per layer to once per minibatch and decouples the workload on each device so that faster workers are not stalled. It also enables simpler and more effective load balancing at the minibatch level. Across diverse LLM post-training tasks, ODC consistently improves device utilization and training throughput, achieving up to a 36\\% speedup over standard FSDP. These results demonstrate that ODC is a superior fit for the prevalent imbalanced workloads in LLM post-training.

    "abstract": "Continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) enables information-theoretically secure key generation between legitimate parties. To further enhance system performance, an improved two-way CV-QKD protocol has been proposed, which is accessible in practice and exhibits increased robustness against excess noise. However, in practical implementations, device nonidealities inevitably drive the optical field from the single-mode regime into the continuous-mode regime. In this work, we introduce temporal modes to characterize the evolution of optical fields in the improved two-way protocol and establish a security analysis framework for the continuous-mode scenario based on adaptive normalization with calibrated shot-noise unit. In addition, finite-size effects are taken into account in the analysis. Our results demonstrate that the improved two-way protocol retains a performance advantage over one-way counterpart. The analysis provides useful guidance for the practical implementation and performance optimization of improved two-way CV-QKD systems."

    "abstract": "The Sparrow Search Algorithm (SSA), characterized by its simple structure and ease of implementation, nevertheless suffers from an insufficient balance between exploration and exploitation, making it prone to premature convergence and slow optimization progress. To address these shortcomings, this paper proposes a Geometric Sparrow Search Algorithm (GeoSSA). By integrating Good Nodes Set initialization, a Sine-Cosine Enhanced Producer position update strategy, and a Triangular-Walk Enhanced Edge Sparrow update strategy, GeoSSA significantly improves the global exploration ability, local exploitation efficiency, and convergence stability of the original SSA. To thoroughly validate the effectiveness of GeoSSA, we conducted ablation studies, qualitative analysis, and comparative experiments on 23 benchmark functions against state-of-the-art algorithms. Experimental results show that GeoSSA achieves the best or near-best performance in terms of average fitness, standard deviation, Wilcoxon tests, and Friedman rankings, with an Overall Effectiveness ($OE$) of 95.65\\%. Its overall performance is significantly superior to all compared algorithms. In three-dimensional UAV path planning tasks, GeoSSA demonstrates excellent stability and superior path quality. In four categories of engineering design optimization problems, GeoSSA consistently attains the highest solution accuracy and strongest stability. GeoSSA not only exhibits outstanding global optimization performance on standard benchmark functions but also shows strong robustness and generalization ability in practical applications such as UAV path planning and engineering design. Therefore, GeoSSA provides an efficient and reliable solution framework for complex optimization problems."

    "abstract": "Estimating uncertainty in deep learning models is critical for reliable decision-making in high-stakes applications such as medical imaging. Prior research has established that the difference between an input sample and its reconstructed version produced by an auxiliary model can serve as a useful proxy for uncertainty. However, directly comparing reconstructions with the original input is degraded by information loss and sensitivity to superficial details, which limits its effectiveness. In this work, we propose Difference Reconstruction Uncertainty Estimation (DRUE), a method that mitigates this limitation by reconstructing inputs from two intermediate layers and measuring the discrepancy between their outputs as the uncertainty score. To evaluate uncertainty estimation in practice, we follow the widely used out-of-distribution (OOD) detection paradigm, where in-distribution (ID) training data are compared against datasets with increasing domain shift. Using glaucoma detection as the ID task, we demonstrate that DRUE consistently achieves superior AUC and AUPR across multiple OOD datasets, highlighting its robustness and reliability under distribution shift. This work provides a principled and effective framework for enhancing model reliability in uncertain environments."

While Large Language Models (LLMs) can provide structured content to streamline the process, their role in facilitating skill development and supporting medical education integration remains underexplored. To address this, we conducted a formative study with six medical educators and developed CaseMaster, an interactive probe that leverages LLM-generated content tailored to medical education to help users enhance their OCP skills. The controlled study suggests CaseMaster has the potential to both improve presentation quality and reduce workload compared to traditional methods, an implication reinforced by expert feedback. We propose guidelines for educators to develop adaptive, user-centered training methods using LLMs, while considering the implications of integrating advanced technologies into medical education."

The framework applies to any DSGE model through compositional pipelines where specifications are transformed, fixed points computed, and equilibria selected. We provide formal results and computational implementation for linear rational-expectations systems, reinterpreting Blanchard-Kahn conditions as a specific selection operator and verifying that standard solution methods (such as QZ decomposition and OccBin) realize this operation. We show that alternative selectors (minimal-variance, fiscal anchoring) become available under indeterminacy, revealing selection as a policy choice rather than a mathematical necessity. Our framework reveals the formal structure underlying DSGE solution methods, enabling programmatic verification and systematic comparison of selection rules."

Using monthly data from 1999 to 2025, we develop a unified framework that integrates Time-Varying Parameter Structural VARs (TVP-SVAR) with advanced dependence structures, including DCC-GARCH, t-copulas, and mixed Clayton--Frank--Gumbel copulas. These models are empirically evaluated against leading machine learning techniques Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), Artificial Neural Networks, Random Forests, and Support Vector Regression across seven macro-financial and energy variables, with Brent crude oil as the central asset. The findings reveal three major insights. First, TVP-SVAR consistently outperforms standard VAR models, confirming structural instability in energy transmission channels. Second, copula-based extensions capture non-linear and tail dependence more effectively than symmetric DCC models, particularly during periods of macroeconomic stress. Third, despite their methodological differences, copula-enhanced econometric models and GPR achieve statistically equivalent predictive accuracy (t-test p = 0.8444). However, only the econometric approach provides interpretable impulse responses, regime shifts, and tail-risk diagnostics. We conclude that machine learning can replicate predictive performance but cannot substitute the explanatory power of structural econometrics. This synthesis offers a pathway where AI accuracy and economic interpretability jointly inform energy policy and risk management."

    "abstract": "Accurate depth estimation is fundamental to 3D perception in autonomous driving, supporting tasks such as detection, tracking, and motion planning. However, monocular camera-based 3D detection suffers from depth ambiguity and reduced robustness under challenging conditions. Radar provides complementary advantages such as resilience to poor lighting and adverse weather, but its sparsity and low resolution limit its direct use in detection frameworks. This motivates the need for effective Radar-camera fusion with improved preprocessing and depth estimation strategies. We propose an end-to-end framework that enhances monocular 3D object detection through two key components. First, we introduce InstaRadar, an instance segmentation-guided expansion method that leverages pre-trained segmentation masks to enhance Radar density and semantic alignment, producing a more structured representation. InstaRadar achieves state-of-the-art results in Radar-guided depth estimation, showing its effectiveness in generating high-quality depth features. Second, we integrate the pre-trained RCDPT into the BEVDepth framework as a replacement for its depth module. With InstaRadar-enhanced inputs, the RCDPT integration consistently improves 3D detection performance. Overall, these components yield steady gains over the baseline BEVDepth model, demonstrating the effectiveness of InstaRadar and the advantage of explicit depth supervision in 3D object detection. Although the framework lags behind Radar-camera fusion models that directly extract BEV features, since Radar serves only as guidance rather than an independent feature stream, this limitation highlights potential for improvement. Future work will extend InstaRadar to point cloud-like representations and integrate a dedicated Radar branch with temporal cues for enhanced BEV fusion."

We derive a hydrodynamic limit when the number of immature compartments goes to infinity obtaining a partial differential equations system with boundary conditions, modelling hematopoiesis as a continuum. We assume that proliferation and differentiation are regulated and let the corresponding rates depend on the number of mature cells. This leads us to model the dynamics of the population by a Markov process in continuous time and discrete space, which does not satisfy the branching property. We prove the convergence in law of the stem and mature cells population size processes and of the empirical measures of the immature cells dynamics, conveniently rescaled, to the unique triplet involving coupled functions and a measure, which are solutions of a deterministic measure valued equation with boundary dynamics. The cell differentiation induces a transport term in space and the main difficulty comes from the boundary effects coming from stem and mature cells. We also prove that the limiting measure admits at each time a density with respect to Lebesgue measure and can be characterized as solution of a partial differential equation."

Using a curated subset of the AIDev dataset, we analyze 19,450 inline review comments spanning 3,177 agent-authored PRs from real-world GitHub repositories. We first derive a taxonomy of 12 review comment themes using topic modeling combined with large language model (LLM)-assisted semantic clustering and consolidation. According to this taxonomy, we then investigate whether zero-shot prompts to LLM can reliably annotate review comments. Our evaluation against human annotations shows that open-source LLM achieves reasonably high exact match (78.63%), macro F1 score (0.78), and substantial agreement with human annotators at the review comment level. At the PR level, the LLM also correctly identifies the dominant review theme with 78% Top-1 accuracy and achieves an average Jaccard similarity of 0.76, indicating strong alignment with human judgments. Applying this annotation pipeline at scale, we find that apart from functional correctness and logical changes, reviews of agent-authored PRs predominantly focus on documentation gaps, refactoring needs, styling and formatting issues, with testing and security-related concerns. These findings suggest that while AI agents can accelerate code production, there remain gaps requiring targeted human review oversight."

For the first time, we derive this term from first principles in finite-temperature pure SU(3) Yang-Mills theory, incorporating a field-dependent renormalization factor--a calculation we also extend to theories with more colors. Employing this derived kinetic term alongside three commonly-used effective potentials (the Haar-measure, polynomial, and quasi-particle models), we demonstrate that it substantially modifies the predicted GW energy spectrum from confinement transitions by 1-2 orders of magnitude. Based on this, we provide the first complete analysis of the chiral transition within the Polyakov-Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (PNJL) framework, described by the quark condensate. Our results reveal a clear dichotomy: while the Polyakov-loop kinetic term critically shapes GWs from confinement transitions, it has a negligible impact on the dynamics of the chiral transition, which is dominated by fermion condensation effects."

However, in the absence of explicit intrinsic principles for semantic composition, existing methods treat synergistic drugs as independent entities and fail to capture their collective therapeutic effects, resulting in a mismatch between medication-level references and longitudinal patient representations. In this paper, we propose MSAM, a novel medication recommendation model that bridges the gap via multi-level medication abstraction. The model introduces a multi-head graph reasoning mechanism to organize flat daily medication sets into clinically meaningful semantic units, serving as intermediate abstraction results to propagate features from individual drugs to higher-level representations. Building on these units, MSAM performs two-stage abstraction over historical prescriptions and selected candidates via intra- and inter-level feature propagation across heterogeneous clinical structures, capturing collective therapeutic effects aligned with patient conditions. Experiments on two real-world clinical datasets show that MSAM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, validating the effectiveness of structural medication abstraction for recommendation."

    "abstract": "Covariate-dependent uncertainty quantification in simulation-based inference is crucial for high-stakes decision-making but remains challenging due to the limitations of existing methods such as conformal prediction and classical bootstrap, which struggle with covariate-specific conditioning. We propose Efficient Quantile-Regression-Based Generative Metamodeling (E-QRGMM), a novel framework that accelerates the quantile-regression-based generative metamodeling (QRGMM) approach by integrating cubic Hermite interpolation with gradient estimation. Theoretically, we show that E-QRGMM preserves the convergence rate of the original QRGMM while reducing grid complexity from $O(n^{1/2})$ to $O(n^{1/5})$ for the majority of quantile levels, thereby substantially improving computational efficiency. Empirically, E-QRGMM achieves a superior trade-off between distributional accuracy and training speed compared to both QRGMM and other advanced deep generative models on synthetic and practical datasets. Moreover, by enabling bootstrap-based construction of confidence intervals for arbitrary estimands of interest, E-QRGMM provides a practical solution for covariate-dependent uncertainty quantification."

    "abstract": "Hallucination detection is critical for deploying large language models (LLMs) in real-world applications. Existing hallucination detection methods achieve strong performance when the training and test data come from the same domain, but they suffer from poor cross-domain generalization. In this paper, we study an important yet overlooked problem, termed generalizable hallucination detection (GHD), which aims to train hallucination detectors on data from a single domain while ensuring robust performance across diverse related domains. In studying GHD, we simulate multi-turn dialogues following LLMs initial response and observe an interesting phenomenon: hallucination-initiated multi-turn dialogues universally exhibit larger uncertainty fluctuations than factual ones across different domains. Based on the phenomenon, we propose a new score SpikeScore, which quantifies abrupt fluctuations in multi-turn dialogues. Through both theoretical analysis and empirical validation, we demonstrate that SpikeScore achieves strong cross-domain separability between hallucinated and non-hallucinated responses. Experiments across multiple LLMs and benchmarks demonstrate that the SpikeScore-based detection method outperforms representative baselines in cross-domain generalization and surpasses advanced generalization-oriented methods, verifying the effectiveness of our method in cross-domain hallucination detection."

Standard collaborative filtering algorithms are structurally blind to these hard limits, frequently suggesting bundles that fail to meet specific total daily energy expenditure and macronutrient balance requirements. To address this disconnect, this paper introduces a Physics-Informed Neuro-Symbolic Recommender System that integrates nutritional science directly into the recommendation pipeline via a dual-layer architecture. The framework begins by constructing a semantic knowledge graph using sentence-level encoders to strictly align commercial products with authoritative nutritional data. During the training phase, an implicit physics regularizer applies a differentiable thermodynamic loss function, ensuring that learned latent embeddings reflect nutritional plausibility rather than simple popularity. Subsequently, during the inference phase, an explicit physics optimizer employs simulated annealing and elastic quantity optimization to generate discrete grocery bundles that strictly adhere to the user's protein and caloric targets."

    "abstract": "Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) has been widely adopted in wearable devices; however, it has not been widely used in ingestible electronics, primarily due to concerns regarding severe tissue attenuation at the 2.4 GHz band. In this work, we systematically reevaluate the feasibility of BLE for ingestible applications by benchmarking its performance against representative sub-GHz communication schemes across power consumption, throughput, tissue-induced attenuation, latency, and system-level integration constraints. We demonstrate that incorporating an RF amplifier enables BLE to maintain robust communication links through tissue-mimicking media while preserving favorable energy efficiency. We further quantify the relationship between throughput and energy consumption over a wide operating range and demonstrate that, for the majority of ingestible sensing applications with throughput requirements below 100 kbps, BLE achieves substantially lower power consumption than sub-GHz alternatives. End-to-end latency measurements show that BLE offers significantly lower latency than sub-GHz solutions due to its native compatibility with modern computing infrastructure. Finally, we analyze antenna form factor and ecosystem integration, highlighting the mechanical and translational advantages of BLE in ingestible system design. Collectively, these results demonstrate that BLE, when appropriately configured, represents a compelling and scalable wireless communication solution for next-generation ingestible electronics."

    "abstract": "RNA inverse folding, designing sequences to form specific 3D structures, is critical for therapeutics, gene regulation, and synthetic biology. Current methods, focused on sequence recovery, struggle to address structural objectives like secondary structure consistency (SS), minimum free energy (MFE), and local distance difference test (LDDT), leading to suboptimal structural accuracy. To tackle this, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL) framework integrated with a latent diffusion model (LDM). Drawing inspiration from the success of diffusion models in RNA inverse folding, which adeptly model complex sequence-structure interactions, we develop an LDM incorporating pre-trained RNA-FM embeddings from a large-scale RNA model. These embeddings capture co-evolutionary patterns, markedly improving sequence recovery accuracy. However, existing approaches, including diffusion-based methods, cannot effectively handle non-differentiable structural objectives. By contrast, RL excels in this task by using policy-driven reward optimization to navigate complex, non-gradient-based objectives, offering a significant advantage over traditional methods. In summary, we propose the Step-wise Optimization of Latent Diffusion Model (SOLD), a novel RL framework that optimizes single-step noise without sampling the full diffusion trajectory, achieving efficient refinement of multiple structural objectives. Experimental results demonstrate SOLD surpasses its LDM baseline and state-of-the-art methods across all metrics, establishing a robust framework for RNA inverse folding with profound implications for biotechnological and therapeutic applications."

However, the functions involved in the original form of this statement were not explicit. In an enormous effort Kawarabayashi, Thomas, and Wollan proved a similar statement with explicit (and single-exponential in $|V(H)|$) bounds. However, their proof replaces the statement \"a surface where $H$ does not embed'' with \"a surface of Euler-genus in $\\mathcal{O}(|H|^2)$''. In this paper we close this gap and prove that the bounds of Kawarabayashi, Thomas, and Wollan can be achieved with a tight bound on the Euler-genus. Moreover, we provide a more refined version of the GMST focussed exclusively on excluding, instead of a single graph, grid-like graphs that are minor-universal for a given set of surfaces. This allows us to give a description, in the style of Robertson and Seymour, of graphs excluding a graph of fixed Euler-genus as a minor, rather than focussing on the size of the graph."

To achieve high fidelity, we introduce a two-stage SF$\\to$RL training pipeline, where Reinforcement Learning with an IoU-based reward refines the point sequences to accurately match ground-truth contours. We find that the standard MLLM architecture possesses a strong, inherent capacity for low-level perception that can be unlocked without any specialized architecture. On segmentation benchmarks, SimpleSeg achieves performance that is comparable to, and often surpasses, methods relying on complex, task-specific designs. This work lays out that precise spatial understanding can emerge from simple point prediction, challenging the prevailing need for auxiliary components and paving the way for more unified and capable VLMs. Homepage: https://simpleseg.github.io/"

To bridge this gap, we establish nonlocal Kramers-Moyal formulas, rigorously generalizing the classical Kramers-Moyal relations to SDEs with multiplicative Lévy noise. These formulas provide a direct link between short-time transition probability densities (or sample path statistics) and the underlying SDE coefficients: the drift vector, diffusion matrix, Lévy jump measure kernel, and Lévy noise intensity functions. Leveraging these theoretical foundations, we develop novel data-driven algorithms capable of simultaneously identifying all governing components from data and establish convergence results and error analysis for the algorithms. We validate the framework through extensive numerical experiments on prototypical systems. This work provides a principled and practical toolbox for discovering interpretable SDE models governing complex systems influenced by discontinuous, heavy-tailed, state-dependent fluctuations, with broad applicability in climate science, neuroscience, epidemiology, finance, and biological physics."

PCB inspection poses unique challenges due to densely packed components, complex wiring structures, and subtle defect patterns that require specialized domain expertise. However, a high-quality, unified vision-language benchmark for quantitatively evaluating MLLMs across PCB inspection tasks remains absent, stemming not only from limited data availability but also from fragmented datasets and inconsistent standardization. To fill this gap, we propose UniPCB, the first unified vision-language benchmark for open-ended PCB quality inspection. UniPCB is built via a systematic pipeline that curates and standardizes data from disparate sources across three annotated scenarios. Furthermore, we introduce PCB-GPT, an MLLM trained on a new instruction dataset generated by this pipeline, utilizing a novel progressive curriculum that mimics the learning process of human experts. Evaluations on the UniPCB benchmark show that while existing MLLMs falter on domain-specific tasks, PCB-GPT establishes a new baseline. Notably, it more than doubles the performance on fine-grained defect localization compared to the strongest competitors, with significant advantages in localization and analysis. We will release the instruction data, benchmark, and model to facilitate future research."

To address these limitations, we start by investigating the intrinsic properties of AEs, which reveals that AEs exhibit severe feature inconsistency under progressive frequency attenuation. We further attribute this to the model's inherent spectral bias. Leveraging this insight, we propose an efficient test-time defense named Contrastive Spectral Rectification (CSR). CSR optimizes a rectification perturbation to realign the input with the natural manifold under a spectral-guided contrastive objective, which is applied input-adaptively. Extensive experiments across 16 classification benchmarks demonstrate that CSR outperforms the SOTA by an average of 18.1% against strong AutoAttack with modest inference overhead. Furthermore, CSR exhibits broad applicability across diverse visual tasks. Code is available at https://github.com/Summu77/CSR."

The proposed condition provides a protocol-independent criterion ensuring that no information about individual parameters is accessible to untrusted parties. We further experimentally demonstrate that a distributed quantum sensing protocol employing fewer photons than the number of estimated parameters simultaneously satisfies the universal privacy condition and achieves Heisenberg-limited precision. Our results establish universal operational constraints governing privacy in distributed quantum sensing networks and provide a foundation for practical, privacy-preserving quantum sensing beyond full-rank regimes."

To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework, Similarity Propagation-enhanced Uncertainty for Multimodal Recommendation (SPUMR). SPUMR explicitly models and mitigates uncertainty by first constructing the Modality Similarity Graph and the Collaborative Similarity Graph to refine representations from both content and behavioral perspectives. The Uncertainty-aware Preference Aggregation module then adaptively fuses the refined multimodal features, assigning greater weight to more reliable modalities.

The existence of the de Almeida-Thouless (dAT) transition for three-dimensional (3D) spin glasses in a field is still debated. We introduce a new computational method to define the spin-glass susceptibility, which is robust against the broad tail in the overlap distribution that undermines conventional analyses. Applying this approach to the Edwards-Anderson spin-glass model in 2D and 3D, and contrasting with the 3D Ising (without disorder) and mean-field spin-glass models, we find a stark difference: the locus of susceptibility maxima bends to the right in the field-temperature plane for the Ising and 2D spin-glass cases, indicating a supercritical crossover line, but bends to the left for the mean-field and 3D spin glasses - a signature of the dAT line. Finite-size scaling further suggests that the peak susceptibility diverges with system size in 3D spin glasses under a field, while saturating in 2D. These results provide direct numerical evidence for the dAT transition in 3D, supporting the replica symmetry breaking scenario."

To simulate a parallel X-ray beam from celestial sources, we constructed a dedicated evaluation system, the High-Brilliance X-ray Kilometer-long Large-Area Expanded-beam Evaluation System (HBX-KLAEES). Owing to the high photon flux and the quasi-point-like source with a small divergence provided by HBX-KLAEES, the imaging performance was evaluated with high fidelity, resolving both the sharp core and large-angle components of the Point Spread Function (PSF). The results show an extremely sharp core with a Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) of 0.7 arcsec and a Half Power Diameter (HPD) of 14 arcsec, even after integration into the MMA. In addition, a positive correlation was found between angular resolution and axial figure error in both the primary and secondary mirror sections, indicating that axial figure errors contribute to image degradation. Based on these results, the MMA was selected as one of the hard X-ray optics for the FOXSI-4 sounding rocket experiment, which performs high-resolution soft and hard X-ray imaging spectroscopy of solar flares and was successfully launched.

    "abstract": "Fluorescence microscopy (FM) imaging is a fundamental technique for observing live cell division, one of the most essential processes in the cycle of life and death. Observing 3D live cells requires scanning through the cell volume while minimizing lethal phototoxicity. That limits acquisition time and results in sparsely sampled volumes with anisotropic resolution and high noise. Existing image restoration methods, primarily based on inverse problem modeling, assume known and stable degradation processes and struggle under such conditions, especially in the absence of high-quality reference volumes. In this paper, from a new perspective, we propose a novel tensor completion framework tailored to the nature of FM imaging, which inherently involves nonlinear signal degradation and incomplete observations. Specifically, FM imaging with equidistant Z-axis sampling is essentially a tensor completion task under a uniformly random sampling condition. On one hand, we derive the theoretical lower bound for exact cell tensor completion, validating the feasibility of accurately recovering 3D cell tensor. On the other hand, we reformulate the tensor completion problem as a mathematically equivalent score-based generative model. By incorporating structural consistency priors, the generative trajectory is effectively guided toward denoised and geometrically coherent reconstructions. Our method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on SR-CACO-2 and three real \\textit{in vivo} cellular datasets, showing substantial improvements in both signal-to-noise ratio and structural fidelity."

More accessible alternatives often do not scale in complexity, cost to produce, or both. Motivated by a recent shift to tools for creating visual diagrams from code, we propose a solution that automatically creates accessible representations from structural information about diagrams. Based on a Wizard-of-Oz study, we derive design requirements for an automated system, Arboretum, that compiles text-based diagram specifications into three synchronized nonvisual formats$\\unicode{x2013}$tabular, navigable, and tactile. Our evaluation with BVI users highlights the strength of tactile graphics for complex tasks such as binary search; the benefits of offering multiple, complementary nonvisual representations; and limitations of existing digital navigation patterns for structural reasoning. This work reframes access to data structures by preserving their structural properties. The solution is a practical system to advance accessible CS education."

    "abstract": "Image geolocation aims to infer capture locations based on visual content. Fundamentally, this constitutes a reasoning process composed of \\textit{hypothesis-verification cycles}, requiring models to possess both geospatial reasoning capabilities and the ability to verify evidence against geographic facts. Existing methods typically internalize location knowledge and reasoning patterns into static memory via supervised training or trajectory-based reinforcement fine-tuning. Consequently, these methods are prone to factual hallucinations and generalization bottlenecks in open-world settings or scenarios requiring dynamic knowledge. To address these challenges, we propose a Hierarchical Localization Agent, called LocationAgent. Our core philosophy is to retain hierarchical reasoning logic within the model while offloading the verification of geographic evidence to external tools. To implement hierarchical reasoning, we design the RER architecture (Reasoner-Executor-Recorder), which employs role separation and context compression to prevent the drifting problem in multi-step reasoning. For evidence verification, we construct a suite of clue exploration tools that provide diverse evidence to support location reasoning. Furthermore, to address data leakage and the scarcity of Chinese data in existing datasets, we introduce CCL-Bench (China City Location Bench), an image geolocation benchmark encompassing various scene granularities and difficulty levels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LocationAgent significantly outperforms existing methods by at least 30\\% in zero-shot settings."

However, the real world is three-dimensional, and binaural audio, which mimics human hearing, can capture richer spatial information, including sound source location. This spatial context is crucial for understanding and modeling complex auditory scenes, as it inherently informs sound detection and extraction. In this work, we propose a language-driven universal sound extraction network that isolates text-described sound events from binaural mixtures by effectively leveraging the spatial cues present in binaural signals. Additionally, we jointly predict the direction of arrival (DoA) of the target sound using spatial features from the extraction network. This dual-task approach exploits complementary location information to improve extraction performance while enabling accurate DoA estimation. Experimental results on the in-the-wild AudioCaps dataset show that our proposed LuSeeL model significantly outperforms single-channel and uni-task baselines."

    "abstract": "This study treats transmission scheduling for remote state estimation over unreliable channels with a hidden mode. A local Kalman estimator selects scheduling actions, such as power allocation and resource usage, and communicates with a remote estimator based on acknowledgement feedback, balancing estimation performance and communication cost. The resulting problem is naturally formulated as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). In settings with observable channel modes, it is well known that monotonicity of the value function can be established via investigating order-preserving property of transition kernels. In contrast, under partial observability, the transition kernels generally lack this property, which prevents the direct application of standard monotonicity arguments. To overcome this difficulty, we introduce a novel technique, referred to as state-space folding, which induces transformed transition kernels recovering order preservation on the folded space. This transformation enables a rigorous monotonicity analysis in the partially observable setting. As a representative implication, we focus on an associated optimal stopping formulation and show that the resulting optimal scheduling policy admits a threshold structure."

    "abstract": "Visual illusions provide a window into the mechanisms underlying visual processing, and dynamical neural circuit models offer a natural framework for proposing and testing theories of their emergence. We propose and analyze a delay-coupled neural field model that explains stroboscopic percepts arising from the subsampling of a moving, often rotating, stimulus, such as the wagon-wheel illusion. Motivated by the role of activity propagation delays in shaping visual percepts, we study neural fields with both uniform and spatially dependent delays, representing the finite time required for signals to travel along axonal projections. Each module is organized as a ring of neurons encoding angular preference, with instantaneous local coupling and delayed long-range coupling strongest between neurons with similar preference. We show that delays generate a family of coexisting traveling bump solutions with distinct, quantized propagation speeds. Using interface-based asymptotic methods, we reduce the neural field dynamics to a low-dimensional system of coupled delay differential equations, enabling a detailed analysis of speed selection, stability, entrainment, and state transitions. Regularly pulsed inputs induce transitions between distinct speed states, including motion opposite to the forcing direction, capturing key features of visual aliasing and stroboscopic motion reversal. These results demonstrate how delayed neural interactions organize perception into discrete dynamical states and provide a mechanistic explanation for stroboscopic visual illusions."

The government places a strong emphasis on preserving and promoting the Bahnaric language by making it accessible online and encouraging communication across generations. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence, such as Neural Machine Translation (NMT), have brought about a transformation in translation by improving accuracy and fluency. This, in turn, contributes to the revival of the language through educational efforts, communication, and documentation. Specifically, NMT is pivotal in enhancing accessibility for Bahnaric speakers, making information and content more readily available. Nevertheless, the translation of Vietnamese into Bahnaric faces practical challenges due to resource constraints, especially given the limited resources available for the Bahnaric language. To address this, we employ state-of-the-art techniques in NMT along with two augmentation strategies for domain-specific Vietnamese-Bahnaric translation task. Importantly, both approaches are flexible and can be used with various neural machine translation models. Additionally, they do not require complex data preprocessing steps, the training of additional systems, or the acquisition of extra data beyond the existing training parallel corpora."

This approach adopts a zero sum game formulation, where the query model and the FC model engage in iterative alternating training. Overall, our method advances the development of more robust FC models and provides a systematic way to identify and correct weaknesses in the ability of LLMs to interact with external tools."

By refining the predictions of pre-trained models at inference, our method delivers significantly improved registration accuracy at a modest computational cost, requiring only 21% additional inference time (0.56s). We evaluate Reg-TTR on two distinct tasks and show that it achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance while maintaining inference speeds close to previous deep learning methods. As foundation models continue to emerge, our framework offers an efficient strategy to narrow the performance gap between registration foundation models and SOTA methods trained on specialized datasets.

We present TinyTorch, a 20 module curriculum in which students implement the core components of PyTorch, including tensors, autograd, optimizers, and neural networks, entirely in pure Python. The curriculum is built around three pedagogical principles. Progressive disclosure gradually introduces complexity as students build confidence. Systems first integration embeds memory and performance awareness from the very beginning. Historical milestone validation guides students to recreate key breakthroughs, from the Perceptron in 1958 to modern Transformers, using only code they have written themselves. TinyTorch requires only a laptop with 4GB of RAM and no GPU, making machine learning systems education accessible worldwide. Its goal is to prepare the next generation of AI engineers, practitioners who understand not only what machine learning systems do, but why they work and how to make them scale.

    "abstract": "Developing models capable of complex, multi-step reasoning is a central goal in artificial intelligence. While representing problems as graphs is a powerful approach, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are fundamentally constrained by their message-passing mechanism, which imposes a local bottleneck that limits global, holistic reasoning. We argue that dynamic programming (DP), which solves problems by iteratively refining a global state, offers a more powerful and suitable learning paradigm. We introduce FloydNet, a new architecture that embodies this principle. In contrast to local message passing, FloydNet maintains a global, all-pairs relationship tensor and learns a generalized DP operator to progressively refine it. This enables the model to develop a task-specific relational calculus, providing a principled framework for capturing long-range dependencies. Theoretically, we prove that FloydNet achieves 3-WL (2-FWL) expressive power, and its generalized form aligns with the k-FWL hierarchy. FloydNet demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across challenging domains: it achieves near-perfect scores (often >99\\%) on the CLRS-30 algorithmic benchmark, finds exact optimal solutions for the general Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) at rates significantly exceeding strong heuristics, and empirically matches the 3-WL test on the BREC benchmark. Our results establish this learned, DP-style refinement as a powerful and practical alternative to message passing for high-level graph reasoning."

To utilize deeper layer redundancy, the sharing region starts from the deep end of the model and grows towards the shallow end. The EPAS trained models allow for variable region lengths of activation sharing for different compute budgets during inference. Empirical evaluations with QK activation sharing in LLaMA models ranging from 125M to 7B parameters show up to an 11.1% improvement in training throughput and up to a 29% improvement in inference throughput while maintaining similar loss curve to the baseline models. Furthermore, applying EPAS in continual pretraining to transform TinyLLaMA into an attention-sharing model yields up to a 10% improvement in average accuracy over state-of-the-art methods, emphasizing the significance of progressive training in cross layer activation sharing models."

Unlike frame-based vision systems, the neuromorphic tactile modality directly encodes dynamic contact events during continuous sliding, closely emulating human finger-scanning strategies. Our approach combines spatiotemporal segmentation with a lightweight ResNet-based classifier to process sparse event streams, enabling robust character recognition across varying indentation depths and scanning speeds. The proposed system achieves near-perfect accuracy (>=98%) at standard depths, generalizes across multiple Braille board layouts, and maintains strong performance under fast scanning. On a physical Braille board containing daily-living vocabulary, the system attains over 90% word-level accuracy, demonstrating robustness to temporal compression effects that challenge conventional methods.

In the proof, we prove the asymptotic equivalence between the genuine likelihood and the much simpler Euler-type quasi-likelihood.

In practice, when developers submit a patch, they often implement the BRT alongside the fix. Our experience deploying agentic APR reveals that developers similarly desire a BRT within AI-generated patches to increase their confidence. However, canonical APR systems tend to generate BRTs and fixes separately, or focus on producing only the fix in the final patch. In this paper, we study agentic APR in the context of cogeneration, where the APR agent is instructed to generate both a fix and a BRT in the same patch. We evaluate the effectiveness of different cogeneration strategies on 120 human-reported bugs at Google and characterize different cogeneration strategies by their influence on APR agent behavior. We develop and evaluate patch selectors that account for test change information to select patches with plausible fixes (and plausible BRTs). Finally, we analyze the root causes of failed cogeneration trajectories. Importantly, we show that cogeneration allows the APR agent to generate BRTs for at least as many bugs as a dedicated BRT agent, without compromising the generation rate of plausible fixes, thereby reducing engineering effort in maintaining and coordinating separate generation pipelines for fix and BRT at scale."

In this work, we introduce a sheaf-theoretic and spectral framework for evaluating structural inconsistency as a \\emph{relative} phenomenon. A model is represented by a cellular sheaf $\\mathcal F$ on a cell complex, together with a morphism into a grounding sheaf $\\mathcal W$ encoding admissible global behavior. Failure of compatibility is captured by the mapping cone of this morphism, whose cohomology computes the relative groups $H^*(K;\\mathcal F,\\mathcal W)$ and separates intrinsic obstructions from inconsistencies induced by the grounding. Beyond exact cohomological classification, we develop \\emph{spectral witnesses} derived from regular and mapping-cone Laplacians. The spectra of these operators provide computable, quantitative indicators of inconsistency, encoding both robustness and spatial localization through spectral gaps, integrated energies, and eigenmode support. These witnesses enable comparison of distinct inconsistency mechanisms in fixed systems without learning, optimization, or modification of the underlying representation. The proposed framework is domain-agnostic and applies to a broad class of structured models where feasibility is enforced locally but evaluated globally."

    "abstract": "Altermagnets host spin-split electronic bands without net magnetization, enabling spin-polarized transport in the absence of conventional ferromagnetism. RuO$_2$ has been proposed as a candidate altermagnet, yet experimental reports remain conflicting, particularly between bulk-sensitive probes and thin-film measurements. Here we investigate the electronic transport properties of epitaxial RuO$_2$ thin films using anomalous Hall effect measurements and point-contact Andreev reflection spectroscopy. We observe transport spin polarization and a strongly orientation-dependent anomalous Hall response, while magnetometry reveals no detectable net magnetization. The anomalous Hall effect appears only in ultrathin (110)-oriented films, consistent with symmetry-driven Néel-vector physics, and the measured transport spin polarization is systematically higher for (110)-oriented films than for (001)-oriented films, consistent with the crystallographic anisotropy of the spin-split bands. These results are consistent with altermagnetic behavior in RuO$_2$, with the experimentally accessible signatures confined to near-surface regions. They also establish superconducting transport spectroscopy as a metrology for identifying and characterizing altermagnet candidates."

On the other hand, subjective listening tests remain the gold standard for real-world evaluation, but they are expensive, time-consuming, and difficult to scale. This paper addresses the growing need for automated systems capable of evaluating audio separation without human intervention. The proposed evaluation metric, SAM Audio Judge (SAJ), is a multimodal fine-grained reference-free objective metric, which shows highly alignment with human perceptions. SAJ supports three audio domains (speech, music and general sound events) and three prompt inputs (text, visual and span), covering four different dimensions of evaluation (recall, percision, faithfulness, and overall). SAM Audio Judge also shows potential applications in data filtering, pseudo-labeling large datasets and reranking in audio separation models.

In the unperturbed case, it is known that the set of semiclassical measures coincides with the set of measures that are invariant under the geodesic flow; on the other hand, when the Laplacian is perturbed by a generic smooth potential, the set of semiclassical measures turns out to be strictly contained within that of invariant measures. In this article, we prove that the addition of a perturbation by a finite set of point-scatterers has a different effect: (i) all invariant measures are semiclassical measures for some sequence of eigenstates of the perturbed operator, and (ii) as soon as the set of scatterers contains a pair of antipodal points, it is possible to construct a sequence of eigenfunctions whose semiclassical measure is not invariant under the geodesic flow. We also show that this geometric condition is sharp: if the set of scatterers does not contain a pair of antipodal points, then the sets of invariant and semiclassical measures coincide."

This represents an important milestone for fully variational SIC energy functionals, which have been shown to improve the prediction of the properties of atomic, molecular and solid state systems in general, in both ground and excited states. However, it depends on the system and property of the system whether it is beneficial to scale the SIC correction by a factor of one-half, which makes the application of SIC inconsistent. In the limit of a single electron the SIC exactly cancels the self interaction error, but overcorrects the error in regions of high density where there is large overlap between occupied orbitals. The newly implemented local scaling function, $z(\\mathbf{r})$, which is based on an iso-orbital indicator derived from considering the kinetic energy density in the iso-electron and many electron case, and takes into account that the orbitals are complex, naturally scales the SIC correction from $0\\leq z(\\mathbf{r}) \\leq 1$ in regions of high and low (isolated orbital) electron density.

    "abstract": "Type III solar radio bursts are driven by non-thermal electron beams travelling along heliospheric magnetic fields, with the radio emission frequency drift-rate determined by the beam speed and the plasma density profile. Analysing beam kinematics inferred from the drift-rate reveals behaviour inconsistent with the emitter moving radially through smooth, monotonically decreasing density. We examine whether these features are driven by disturbances in the guiding magnetic field direction, such as switchbacks, rather than plasma inhomogeneities along the beam path. Using simulations and remote observations of 24 interplanetary type III bursts observed by Parker Solar Probe, we relate measured drift-rate variations to local field deflections. In 50% of events, we identify disturbances above a $2σ$ noise level that can be attributed to perpendicular deflections of the field between (0.7-1.7) R$_\\odot$, over scales (1.8-6.4) R$_\\odot$ at heliocentric distances (9-30) R$_\\odot$. The features correspond to either density changes of (10-30)%, or deflections of the field direction by (23-88)$^\\circ$. Further, beam transport simulations show field direction perturbations produce additional observational signatures in type III bursts: delayed emission, intensity breaks, and enhanced emission resembling stria fine structures. In addition, we identified four bursts where the observed variations are more plausibly explained by field deflections, possibly in the form of magnetic switchbacks, than by unrealistically large density changes along the field line. The results show that variations in type III burst profiles can arise from magnetic as well as density fluctuations, and demonstrate the value of type III bursts as remote probes of inner-heliospheric structure at kilometric wavelengths."

In large gas lasers, however, the frequency spacing between longitudinal modes of the resonator easily becomes significantly smaller than the Doppler-broadened width of the gain profile. As a consequence, the laser might operate on a multitude of modes simultaneously, or jump between modes. Such unstable operation cannot be tolerated in metrological or sensing applications, such as ring laser gyroscopes. Here, we propose and demonstrate a method to establish stable operation on a chosen mode index by optically steering the ring laser to a desired mode index through injection locking with an external laser. The injected mode reliably follows the external steering. Intra-cavity backscattering can even cause the counter-propagating, non-injected mode to follow the external steering as well."

We demonstrate that SynCABEL, when combined with decoder-only models and guided inference establish new state-of-the-art results across three widely used multilingual benchmarks: MedMentions for English, QUAERO for French, and SPACCC for Spanish. Evaluating data efficiency, we show that SynCABEL reaches the performance of full human supervision using up to 60% less annotated data, substantially reducing reliance on labor-intensive and costly expert labeling. Finally, acknowledging that standard evaluation based on exact code matching often underestimates clinically valid predictions due to ontology redundancy, we introduce an LLM-as-a-judge protocol.

    "abstract": "Frequency control following a contingency event is of vital concern in power system operations. Leveraging inverter-based resources, it is not hard to shape the center of inertia (COI) frequency nicely. However, under weak grid conditions, it becomes insufficient to solely shape the COI frequency since this aggregate signal fails to reveal the inter-area oscillations. In this manuscript, we advocate for foolproof fine-tuning rules for \\emph{frequency shaping control} (FS) based on a systematic analysis of damping ratio and decay rate of inter-area oscillations to simultaneously meet specified metrics for frequency security and oscillatory stability. To this end, building on a modal decomposition, we simplify the oscillation damping problem into a pole-placement task for a set of scalar subsystems, which can be efficiently solved by only investigating the root locus of a scalar subsystem associated with the main mode, while FS inherently guarantees a Nadir-less COI frequency response. Through our proposed root-locus-based oscillatory stability analysis, we derive closed-form expressions for the minimum damping ratio and decay rate among inter-area oscillations in terms of networked system and control parameters under FS. Moreover, we propose useful tuning guidelines for FS which need only simple calculations or visualized tuning to not only shape the COI frequency into a first-order response that converges to a steady-state value within the allowed range but also ensure a satisfactory damping ratio and decay rate of inter-area oscillations following disturbances. As for the common virtual inertia control (VI), although similar oscillatory stability analysis becomes intractable, one can still glean some insights via the root locus method. Numerical simulations validate the proposed tuning for FS as well as the superiority of FS over VI in exponential convergence rate."

Here, we introduce a theoretical and computational framework to investigate core-double-shell nanoparticles and their asymmetric version, the iris-gated core-double-shell architecture. The optical response of the structures is first evaluated using generalized Mie theory and subsequently validated through FEM and FDTD simulations, ensuring a consistent description of their electromagnetic and thermal behavior. To systematically map the space of variables, we defined a multi-objective figure of merit that integrates absorption efficiency, absorption cross section, and polymer-layer thickness. Furthermore, we define a thermal gain parameter that quantifies energy densification and complements the analysis of thermal directionality. Our results reveal a near-optimal configuration with parameters ($r_c$, $δ_{Au}$, $δ_p$, $θ$)=(36 nm, 5 nm, 40 nm, 70$°$), capable of producing a temperature rise of 20-23 $°$C, with 67% of the thermal fluz directed toward the upper hemispace and yielding 50% focusing enhancement relative to the symmetric case. This design preserves geometric simplicity and high symmetry while delivering robust thermal asymmetry, thereby facilitating experimental implementation. Beyond photothermal therapies, the proposed methodology constitutes a versatile platform for the rapid screening and optimization of layered nanostructures, adaptable to diverse materials, excitation wavelengths, and functional objectives in nanophotonics."

Existing Quantum Virtual Machine (QVM) designs attempt spatial multiplexing through topology-specific or template-based partitioning, but these approaches are brittle under hardware heterogeneity, calibration drift, and transient defects, which dominate real quantum devices. We present DynQ, the first dynamic, topology-agnostic Quantum Virtual Machine that virtualises quantum hardware using quality-weighted community detection. Instead of imposing fixed geometric regions, DynQ models a quantum processor as a weighted graph derived from live calibration data and automatically discovers execution regions that maximise internal gate quality while minimising inter-region coupling. This operationalises the classical virtualisation principle of high cohesion and low coupling in a quantum-native setting, producing execution regions that are connectivity-efficient, noise-aware, and resilient to crosstalk and defects. We evaluate DynQ across five IBM Quantum backends using calibration-derived noise simulation and on two production devices, comparing against state-of-the-art QVM and standard compilation baselines. On hardware with pronounced spatial quality variation, DynQ achieves up to 19.1 percent higher fidelity and 45.1 percent lower output error. When transient hardware defects cause baseline executions to fail completely, DynQ adapts dynamically and achieves over 86 percent fidelity. By transforming calibrated device graphs into adaptive virtual hardware abstractions, DynQ decouples quantum programs from fragile physical layouts and enables reliable, high-utilisation quantum cloud services."

Our analysis differs from previous analyses of this kind not only by implementing for the first time a systematic treatment of scale uncertainties, but also by scrutinizing a much broader range of observables. Surprisingly, $J/ψ$ hadroproduction is well described up to the highest measured values of $p_T$. Potential NRQCD based relations nontrivially lead to a perfect description of $Υ(nS)$ production data. Furthermore, $J/ψ$ production in $γp$ and $γγ$ collisions is, contrary to prevailing conceptions, reproduced down to $p_T=1$ GeV, as long as the region of large inelasticity $z$ is excluded.

To master universal quantum processing with linear oscillators, an unconditional nonlinear operation is required. We propose such an operation using light-mediated interaction with another system that possesses a nonlinearity equivalent to more than a quadratic potential. Such a potential grants access to a nonlinear operation that can be broadcast to the target linear system. The nonlinear character of the operation can be verified by observing adequate negative values of the target system's Wigner function and the squeezing of the variance of a certain nonlinear combination of the quadratures below the thresholds attainable by Gaussian states. We explicitly evaluate an optically levitated mechanical oscillator as a flexible source of nonlinearity for a proof-of-principle demonstration of the nonlinearity broadcasting to linear systems, for example, mechanical oscillators or macroscopic atomic spin ensembles."

However, scaling such refinement to naturalistic NLI remains difficult: long, syntactically rich inputs and deep multi-step arguments amplify autoformalisation errors, where a single local mismatch can invalidate the proof. Moreover, current methods often handle failures via costly global regeneration due to the difficulty of localising the responsible span or step from prover diagnostics. Aiming to address these problems, we propose a decompose-and-formalise framework that (i) decomposes premise-hypothesis pairs into an entailment tree of atomic steps, (ii) verifies the tree bottom-up to isolate failures to specific nodes, and (iii) performs local diagnostic-guided refinement instead of regenerating the whole explanation. Moreover, to improve faithfulness of autoformalisation, we introduce $θ$-substitution in an event-based logical form to enforce consistent argument-role bindings. Across a range of reasoning tasks using five LLM backbones, our method achieves the highest explanation verification rates, improving over the state-of-the-art by 26.2%, 21.7%, 21.6% and 48.9%, while reducing refinement iterations and runtime and preserving strong NLI accuracy."

Achieving the bosonic analogue - a crystal of excitons - has remained elusive due to their short lifetimes and weaker interactions. Here, we report the observation of a thermodynamically stable exciton crystal in an excitonic insulator coupled to a moiré potential. Using an electron-hole bilayer composed of a monolayer MoSe2 and a WS2/WSe2 moiré superlattice, we construct a tunable extended Bose-Hubbard model with electrical control over exciton and charge doping in thermal equilibrium. Optical spectroscopy reveals spontaneous crystallization of long-lived excitons at one exciton filling per three moiré sites, evidenced by strong Umklapp scattering peaks in the optical spectrum. Exciton transport measurements further show a pronounced exciton resistance peak at the same filling, consistent with suppressed exciton hopping in a crystalline phase. When doped away from net charge neutrality, this moiré electron-hole bilayer can host new correlated insulating phases where dipolar excitonic insulators form on top of the background of a hole Mott insulator or generalized Wigner crystals in the moiré superlattice. These findings establish moiré excitonic insulators as a versatile platform for realizing correlated crystalline phases of bosons and fermions."

We investigate the populations of the J region in the (J-K,J) colour-magnitude plane of the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds (LMC and SMC), aiming to distinguish general features of the J luminosity function (JLF) from those sensitive to the stellar population of each galaxy. Using a population synthesis approach based on stellar evolution and dust formation modelling, we predict the distribution of stars within the J region and compare it with observations. Stars in this region are identified as recently formed C-stars that have not yet accumulated large amounts of carbon. Typically, 2--3 $M_\\odot$ stars remain longer in the J region, while lower-mass stars evolve faster. The JLF of the LMC, peaked at the expected magnitudes for these stars, confirms this picture. In the SMC, the J flux distribution is shifted to higher magnitudes, indicating an older population with lower-mass progenitors."

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) to support parameter estimation in machine-type communications (MTC). We focus on a network where single-antenna sensors transmit spatially correlated measurements to a multiple-antenna collector node (CN) via non-orthogonal multiple access. We propose an estimation scheme based on the minimum mean square error (MMSE) criterion. We also integrate successive interference cancelation (SIC) at the receiver to mitigate communication failures in noisy and interference-prone channels under the finite blocklength (FBL) regime. Moreover, recognizing the importance of channel state information (CSI), we explore various methodologies for its acquisition at the CN. We statistically design the RIS configuration and SIC decoding order to minimize estimation error while accounting for channel temporal variations and short packet lengths. To mirror practical systems, we incorporate the detrimental effects of FBL communication and imperfect CSI errors in our analysis. Simulations demonstrate that larger reflecting surfaces lead to smaller MSEs and underscore the importance of selecting an appropriate decoding order for accuracy and ultimate performance."

However, realizing its full potential is hindered by critical limitations, including escalating contextual noise in long-horizon tasks, fragility leading to cascading errors, and a lack of modular extensibility. To address these challenges, we introduce Yunque DeepResearch, a hierarchical, modular, and robust framework. The architecture is characterized by three key components: (1) a centralized Multi-Agent Orchestration System that routes subtasks to an Atomic Capability Pool of tools and specialized sub-agents; (2) a Dynamic Context Management mechanism that structures completed sub-goals into semantic summaries to mitigate information overload; and (3) a proactive Supervisor Module that ensures resilience through active anomaly detection and context pruning. Yunque DeepResearch achieves state-of-the-art performance across a range of agentic deep research benchmarks, including GAIA, BrowseComp, BrowseComp-ZH, and Humanity's Last Exam. We open-source the framework, reproducible implementations, and application cases to empower the community."

    "abstract": "Sign language generation (SLG) aims to translate written texts into expressive sign motions, bridging communication barriers for the Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing communities. Recent studies formulate SLG within the language modeling framework using autoregressive language models, which suffer from unidirectional context modeling and slow token-by-token inference. To address these limitations, we present MaDiS, a masked-diffusion-based language model for SLG that captures bidirectional dependencies and supports efficient parallel multi-token generation. We further introduce a tri-level cross-modal pretraining scheme that jointly learns from token-, latent-, and 3D physical-space objectives, leading to richer and more grounded sign representations. To accelerate model convergence in the fine-tuning stage, we design a novel unmasking strategy with temporal checkpoints, reducing the combinatorial complexity of unmasking orders by over $10^{41}$ times. In addition, a mixture-of-parts embedding layer is developed to effectively fuse information stored in different part-wise sign tokens through learnable gates and well-optimized codebooks. Extensive experiments on CSL-Daily, Phoenix-2014T, and How2Sign demonstrate that MaDiS achieves superior performance across multiple metrics, including DTW error and two newly introduced metrics, SiBLEU and SiCLIP, while reducing inference latency by nearly 30%. Code and models will be released on our project page."

Using real-world search behaviour, we compare outputs from a bespoke semantic search system applied to UKRI data services with the Consumer Data Research Centre (CDRC) keyword search. Analysis is based on 131 of the most frequently used search terms extracted from CDRC search logs between December 2023 and October 2024. We assess differences in the volume, overlap, ranking, and relevance of returned datasets using descriptive statistics, qualitative inspection, and quantitative similarity measures, including exact dataset overlap, Jaccard similarity, and cosine similarity derived from BERT embeddings. Results show that the semantic search consistently returns a larger number of results than the keyword search and performs particularly well for place based, misspelled, obscure, or complex queries. While the semantic search does not capture all keyword based results, the datasets returned are overwhelmingly semantically similar, with high cosine similarity scores despite lower exact overlap. Rankings of the most relevant results differ substantially between tools, reflecting contrasting prioritisation strategies. Case studies demonstrate that the LLM based tool is robust to spelling errors, interprets geographic and contextual relevance effectively, and supports natural-language queries that keyword search fails to resolve. Overall, the findings suggest that LLM driven semantic search offers a substantial improvement for data discovery, complementing rather than fully replacing traditional keyword-based approaches."

The definition of such witness uses apolarity and we describe the set of ideals that are credible witnesses for this purpose in terms of a correspondence between the usual Hilbert scheme (parametrising all closed subschemes of the toric variety) and the multigraded Hilbert scheme (parametrising all multihomogeneous ideals in the Cox ring). We also take this opportunity to extend the border apolarity to linear subspaces (in non-border setting, this is equivalent to simultaneous decompositions)."

In this work, a dislocation-twin boundary interaction model for copper is incorporated into a three-dimensional discrete dislocation dynamics (DDD) framework. This approach is applied to systematically investigate the orientation effects on the deformation of nanotwinned copper, utilizing a multilayer twinned structure (MTS) with a twin thickness of 160 nm. The simulation results show that the stress-strain response of MTSs under uniaxial loading depends significant on the orientation of the loading axis. Dislocations inclined to TBs are confined to slip in single- or multi-layer twin lamellae; when the loading axis is oriented perpendicular or parallel to TBs, such whereas when loading axis inclined to TBs, the dislocations with glide plane parallel to TBs are easily activated (mainly twinning dislocations) and the TBs do not hinder the dislocations and behave in soft modes. If the hard mode dominates the deformation mechanism, microstructures with single-layer confined slip lead to significant hardening behavior, while microstructures with multilayer confined slip maintain stable plastic flow and do not lead to hardening. Finally, through the introduction of critical resolved shear stresses (CRSSs) specific to various deformation modes and the adaptation of Schmid's law, we have effectively projected the additional anisotropic characteristics induced by TBs in MTSs."

In this work, we propose SLM-SS, a novel approach that applies speech language models to SS, aiming to enhance the intelligibility and coherence of the separated signals. We frame SS as discrete multi-codebook sequence generation, using Encoder-Decoder models to map quantized speech mixtures to target tokens. In addition to the autoregressive modeling strategy, we introduce a non-autoregressive model to improve decoding efficiency for residual tokens. Experimental results on the LibriMix dataset demonstrate that our approach shows significantly better preservation of speech intelligibility, leading to improved linguistic consistency in a variety of downstream tasks compared to existing approaches."

This enables a continuous and stable reconfiguration process that is independent of the surrounding medium, allowing the system to reliably form various configurations in diverse environments. To leverage the unique kinematics of Rhombot, we introduce morphpivoting, a novel motion primitive for reconfiguration that differs from advanced MSRR systems, and propose a strategy for its continuous execution.

Unlike traditional methods reliant on optical imaging, our radio-based selection allows for the identification of dust-obscured or optically faint star-forming galaxies. Of the 140 CHIME FRBs considered, 33 lie within the LoTSS DR2 footprint, and 16 show potential radio counterparts. Through multi-wavelength analysis, spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting, and redshift constraints from the Macquart relation, we identify two secure and one tentative host candidates, all consistent with active star formation. However, their H$α$-derived star formation rates appear underestimated, likely due to significant dust attenuation, as suggested by infrared colours and compact optical morphologies. Our results highlight the value of low-frequency radio data in complementing optical host searches and demonstrate the feasibility of host identification even in the absence of optical confirmation. With forthcoming data from LoTSS DR3 and the full CHIME/FRB baseband release, this method offers a promising path toward statistically robust studies of FRB host galaxies and their environments."

    "abstract": "In the era of explosive growth in academic literature, the burden of literature review on scholars are increasing. Proactively recommending academic papers that align with scholars' literature needs in the research process has become one of the crucial pathways to enhance research efficiency and stimulate innovative thinking. Current academic paper recommendation systems primarily focus on broad and coarse-grained suggestions based on general topic or field similarities. While these systems effectively identify related literature, they fall short in addressing scholars' more specific and fine-grained needs, such as locating papers that utilize particular research methods, or tackle distinct research tasks within the same topic. To meet the diverse and specific literature needs of scholars in the research process, this paper proposes a novel academic paper recommendation method. This approach embeds multidimensional information by integrating new types of fine-grained knowledge entities, title and abstract of document, and citation data. Recommendations are then generated by calculating the similarity between combined paper vectors. The proposed recommendation method was evaluated using the STM-KG dataset, a knowledge graph that incorporates scientific concepts derived from papers across ten distinct domains. The experimental results indicate that our method outperforms baseline models, achieving an average precision of 27.3% among the top 50 recommendations. This represents an improvement of 6.7% over existing approaches."

    "abstract": "In underwater navigation systems, strap-down inertial navigation system/Doppler velocity log (SINS/DVL)-based loosely coupled architectures are widely adopted. Conventional approaches project DVL velocities from the body coordinate system to the navigation coordinate system using SINS-derived attitude; however, accumulated attitude estimation errors introduce biases into velocity projection and degrade navigation performance during long-term operation. To address this issue, two complementary improvements are introduced. First, a vehicle attitude error-aware DVL velocity transformation model is formulated by incorporating attitude error terms into the observation equation to reduce projection-induced velocity bias. Second, a covariance matrix-based variance propagation method is developed to transform DVL measurement uncertainty across coordinate systems, introducing an expectation-based attitude error compensation term to achieve statistically consistent noise modeling. Simulation and field experiment results demonstrate that both improvements individually enhance navigation accuracy and confirm that accumulated attitude errors affect both projected velocity measurements and their associated uncertainty. When jointly applied, long-term error divergence is effectively suppressed. Field experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves a 78.3% improvement in 3D position RMSE and a 71.8% reduction in the maximum component-wise position error compared with the baseline IMU+DVL method, providing a robust solution for improving long-term SINS/DVL navigation performance."

This is particularly important because debunking false information typically takes longer to reach consumers than the misinformation itself; accelerating corrections through automation can therefore help counter it more effectively. Although many organizations perform manual fact-checking, this approach is difficult to scale given the growing volume of digital content. These limitations have motivated interest in automating fact-checking, where identifying claims is a crucial first step. However, progress has been uneven across languages, with English dominating due to abundant annotated data. Portuguese, like other languages, still lacks accessible, licensed datasets, limiting research, NLP developments and applications. In this paper, we introduce ClaimPT, a dataset of European Portuguese news articles annotated for factual claims, comprising 1,308 articles and 6,875 individual annotations. Unlike most existing resources based on social media or parliamentary transcripts, ClaimPT focuses on journalistic content, collected through a partnership with LUSA, the Portuguese News Agency. To ensure annotation quality, two trained annotators labeled each article, with a curator validating all annotations according to a newly proposed scheme. We also provide baseline models for claim detection, establishing initial benchmarks and enabling future NLP and IR applications. By releasing ClaimPT, we aim to advance research on low-resource fact-checking and enhance understanding of misinformation in news media."

    "abstract": "Autoregressive (AR) architectures have achieved significant successes in LLMs, inspiring explorations for video generation. In LLMs, top-p/top-k sampling strategies work exceptionally well: language tokens have high semantic density and low redundancy, so a fixed size of token candidates already strikes a balance between semantic accuracy and generation diversity. In contrast, video tokens have low semantic density and high spatio-temporal redundancy. This mismatch makes static top-k/top-p strategies ineffective for video decoders: they either introduce unnecessary randomness for low-uncertainty regions (static backgrounds) or get stuck in early errors for high-uncertainty regions (foreground objects). Prediction errors will accumulate as more frames are generated and eventually severely degrade long-horizon quality. To address this, we propose Entropy-Guided k-Guard (ENkG) sampling, a simple yet effective strategy that adapts sampling to token-wise dispersion, quantified by the entropy of each token's predicted distribution. ENkG uses adaptive token candidate sizes: for low-entropy regions, it employs fewer candidates to suppress redundant noise and preserve structural integrity; for high-entropy regions, it uses more candidates to mitigate error compounding. ENkG is model-agnostic, training-free, and adds negligible overhead. Experiments demonstrate consistent improvements in perceptual quality and structural stability compared to static top-k/top-p strategies."

High inclination, dipping, neutron star Low Mass X-Ray Binaries (LMXBs) provide an excellent testbed to study the launching mechanism of such winds due to being persistently accreting and showing a nearly ubiquitous presence of highly-ionised plasmas. We aim to establish or rule out the presence of a wind in the high inclination LMXB 4U 1624-49, for which a highly ionised plasma has been repeatedly observed in X-ray spectra by Chandra and XMM-Newton, and a thermal-radiative pressure wind is expected. We leverage the exquisite spectral resolution of XRISM to perform phase-resolved spectroscopy of the full binary orbit to characterise the highly ionised plasma at all phases except during absorption dips. An outflow is clearly detected via phase-resolved spectroscopy of the source with XRISM/Resolve. Based on analysis of the radial velocity curve we determine an average velocity of ~200-320 km/s and a column density above 10$^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$. The line profiles are generally narrow, spanning from ~50 to ~100 km/s, depending on the orbital phase, pointing to a low velocity sheer or turbulence of the highly ionised outflow and a potential increase of turbulence as the absorption dip is approached, likely due to turbulent mixing. The line profiles, together with the derived launching radius and wind velocity are consistent with a wind being launched from the outskirts of the disc and without stratification, pointing to a thermal-radiative pressure origin."

We assess the performance of six LLMs deployed through AWS Bedrock on ten lung cancer cases, measuring both completion form accuracy and end-to-end latency. The results demonstrate high performance across models, with the best performing configuration achieving an 80% of correct field completion and clinically acceptable response time for most LLMs. Larger and more recent models exhibit best accuracies without incurring prohibitive latency. These findings provide empirical evidence that LLM- assisted autocompletion form is technically feasible and operationally viable in multidisciplinary lung cancer workflows and support its potential to significantly reduce documentation burden while preserving data quality."

    "abstract": "Geometric frustration among competing spin exchanges can give rise to novel quantum phases by enhancing fluctuations that drive magnetic systems beyond the classical regime. We investigate the frustrated array of strongly correlated spin dimers in the bilayer triangular lattice antiferromagnet \\rcs{} under applied magnetic fields. A cascade of magnetization plateaus appears at \\(M/M_s = 1/3, 1/2, 2/3,\\) and \\(5/6\\), together with a weak anomalous feature near \\(M/M_s = 1/6\\), in fields up to 60 T. Concurrent changes in magneto-dielectric response follows the plateau boundaries. The finite slope of each plateau and the absence of a zero-field gap in our ultralow-temperature ac susceptibility down to 20 mK indicate broken \\(U(1)\\) spin-rotation symmetry. A minimal bilayer-dimer model treated with bond operator representation reproduces the low-field sequence only when \\(U(1)\\) symmetry is explicitly lifted by spin-orbit-driven, bond-dependent anisotropy. Near saturation, a projected triangular pseudospin model accounts for the high-field plateaus with modest further-neighbor interactions. These results demonstrate that anisotropic exchange arising from spin-orbit-coupled moments is essential for stabilizing the full plateau hierarchy in \\rcs{}, a mechanism overlooked in previous interpretations of Co-based triangular bilayers."

Chalykh, while eigenfunctions of the twisted Cherednik Hamiltonians are twisted non-symmetric Macdonald polynomials. Actually, the twisted Cherednik ground state is symmetric and coincides with a peculiar symmetric BAF. We lift this correspondence to excited states, and claim that both Cherednik eigenfunctions and BAF's can be combined to produce symmetric functions, which coincide with each other and are eigenfunctions of the both DIM Hamiltonians and power sums of the twisted Cherednik Hamiltonians at once. This reflects the correspondence between the DIM algebra and the spherical DAHA explicitly."

    "abstract": "Extensive studies suggested that fluid mechanical markers of intracranial aneurysms (IAs) derived from Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) can indicate disease progression risks, but to date this has not been translated clinically. This is because CFD requires specialized expertise and is time-consuming and low throughput, making it difficult to support clinical trials. A deep learning model that maps IA morphology to biomechanical markers can address this, enabling physicians to obtain these markers in real time without performing CFD. Here, we show that a Graph Transformer model that incorporates temporal information, which is supervised by large CFD data, can accurately predict Wall Shear Stress (WSS) across the cardiac cycle from IA surface meshes. The model effectively captures the temporal variations of the WSS pattern, achieving a Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) of up to 0.981 and a maximum-based relative L2 error of 2.8%. Ablation studies and SOTA comparison confirmed its optimality. Further, as pulsatile CFD data is computationally expensive to generate and sample sizes are limited, we engaged a strategy of injecting a large amount of steady-state CFD data, which are extremely low-cost to generate, as augmentation. This approach enhances network performance substantially when pulsatile CFD data sample size is small. Our study provides a proof of concept that temporal sequences cardiovascular fluid mechanical parameters can be computed in real time using a deep learning model from the geometric mesh, and this is achievable even with small pulsatile CFD sample size. Our approach is likely applicable to other cardiovascular scenarios."

An associated weighted centre of mass definition is also derived from this. The adjoint of the linearisation of this curvature map leads to a notion of weighted static metrics, which are natural candidates for weighted mass minimisers. This weighted curvature quantity is essentially the scalar curvature of a conformally related metric that Law, Lopez and Santiago used to considerably simplify the proof of the weighted positive mass theorem. We show an equivalence between static metrics and weighted static metrics via the conformal relationship, from which we show that a uniqueness theorem holds for weighted static manifolds with weighted minimal surface boundaries. Furthermore, we show that weighted manifolds satisfy a Riemannian Penrose inequality whose equality case holds precisely for these unique weighted static metrics."

    "abstract": "Low-resource languages such as isiZulu and isiXhosa face persistent challenges in machine translation due to limited parallel data and linguistic resources. Recent advances in large language models suggest that self-reflection, prompting a model to critique and revise its own outputs, can improve reasoning quality and factual consistency. Building on this idea, this paper introduces Reflective Translation, a prompt-based framework in which a model generates an initial translation, produces a structured self-critique, and then uses this reflection to generate a refined translation. The approach is evaluated on English-isiZulu and English-isiXhosa translation using OPUS-100 and NTREX-African, across multiple prompting strategies and confidence thresholds. Results show consistent improvements in both BLEU and COMET scores between first- and second-pass translations, with average gains of up to +0.22 BLEU and +0.18 COMET. Statistical significance testing using paired nonparametric tests confirms that these improvements are robust. The proposed method is model-agnostic, requires no fine-tuning, and introduces a reflection-augmented dataset that can support future supervised or analysis-driven work. These findings demonstrate that structured self-reflection is a practical and effective mechanism for improving translation quality in low-resource settings."

In principle, given sufficiently high photometric precision, cool Earth-sized exoplanets orbiting Sun-like stars could be discovered via single transit detections; however, this has not previously been achieved. In this work, we report a 10-hour long single transit event which occurred on the $V=10.1$ K-dwarf HD 137010 during K2 Campaign 15 in 2017. The transit is comparatively shallow ($225\\pm10$ ppm), but is detected at high signal-to-noise thanks to the exceptionally high photometric precision achieved for the target. Our analysis of the K2 photometry, historical and new imaging observations, and archival radial velocities and astrometry strongly indicate that the event was astrophysical, occurred on-target, and can be best explained by a transiting planet candidate, which we designate HD 137010 b. The single observed transit implies a radius of $1.06^{+0.06}_{-0.05}$ $R_\\oplus$, and assuming negligible orbital eccentricity we estimate an orbital period of $355^{+200}_{-59}$ days ($a=0.88^{+0.32}_{-0.10}$ AU), properties comparable to Earth. We project an incident flux of $0.29^{+0.11}_{-0.13}$ $I_\\oplus$, which would place HD 137010 b near the outer edge of the habitable zone. This is the first planet candidate with Earth-like radius and orbital properties that transits a Sun-like star bright enough for substantial follow-up observations."

Formed in the immediate vicinity of Sgr~A$^\\ast$, these stars are accelerated to velocities high enough to escape the GC and be observable in the Galactic halo. Using spectroscopy from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and astrometry from Gaia, we conducted a six-dimensional search for HVSs and identified a compelling candidate, hereafter DESI-312, whose bound trajectory can be confidently traced back to the GC. The star resides in the inner halo and exhibits supersolar metallicity ([Fe/H] $= 0.27\\pm 0.09$), distinct from other known stellar populations with radial orbits. Its inferred GC ejection velocity of $698^{+35}_{-27}$ is consistent with a Hills mechanism ejection, supporting an origin in the innermost regions of the Milky Way. We considered alternative origins for the star, including disk ejections from young clusters and globular clusters, but these scenarios fail to explain both its orbit and metallicity. Unlike previously identified A- and B-type HVSs, DESI-312 is a $\\sim 1\\,M_{\\odot}$ star on the main sequence or early subgiant branch, thus enabling a detailed chemical analysis of its atmosphere and offering a rare window - unobscured by dust and crowding - into the composition of the central regions of the Galaxy."

    "abstract": "Recent simulations have identified long-lived ``prompt cusps'' -- compact remnants of early density peaks with inner profiles $ρ\\propto r^{-3/2}$. They can survive hierarchical assembly and potentially enhance signals of dark matter annihilation. In this work, we incorporate prompt cusps into the semi-analytic substructure framework \\textsc{SASHIMI}, enabling a fully hierarchical, environment-dependent calculation of the annihilation luminosity that consistently tracks subhalos, sub-subhalos, and tidal stripping. We assign prompt cusps to first-generation microhalos and propagate their survival through the merger history, including an explicit treatment of cusps associated with stripped substructure. We find that the substructure hierarchy converges rapidly once a few levels are included, and that prompt cusps can raise the total annihilation boost of Milky-Way--size hosts at $z=0$ to $B\\sim O(10)$ for fiducial cusp-occupation assumptions, compared to a subhalo-only baseline of $B_{\\rm sh}\\sim\\mathrm{few}$. Across a wide range of host masses and redshifts, prompt cusps increase the normalization of $B(M_{\\rm host},z)$ while largely preserving its mass and redshift trends. Compared to universal-average, peak-based estimates, our fiducial boosts are lower by about an order of magnitude, primarily reflecting a correspondingly smaller inferred cusp abundance in host halos, highlighting the importance of unifying peak-based cusp formation with merger-tree evolution and environmental dependence."

Our framework guarantees a strict performance improvement under any proper loss. Our approach is based on a characterization of when strict improvement is possible: when the strong and reference models are not mutually calibrated. We formalize this condition, connect it to arbitrage and no-trade results from economics, and develop an efficient Bregman projection algorithm that guarantees worst-case loss reduction without labels. Experiments on representative LLMs across varying scales demonstrate that our label-free method significantly reduces proper losses and calibration errors, achieving performance competitive with supervised baselines."

We then introduce a generalized graph-based construction using a non-commutative two-qudit gate, denoted $GR$, which requires directed edges and an explicit vertex ordering. We show that complete directed graphs endowed with appropriate orientations, for an odd number of qudits generate fully antisymmetric multipartite states. Together, these results provide a unified graph-theoretic description of bosonic and fermionic exchange symmetry based on graph completeness and edge orientation."

Hyperbolic geometry provides a natural framework for representing such structures. Building on this property, this work introduces HexFormer, a hyperbolic vision transformer for image classification that incorporates exponential map aggregation within its attention mechanism. Two designs are explored: a hyperbolic ViT (HexFormer) and a hybrid variant (HexFormer-Hybrid) that combines a hyperbolic encoder with an Euclidean linear classification head. HexFormer incorporates a novel attention mechanism based on exponential map aggregation, which yields more accurate and stable aggregated representations than standard centroid based averaging, showing that simpler approaches retain competitive merit. Experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate consistent performance improvements over Euclidean baselines and prior hyperbolic ViTs, with the hybrid variant achieving the strongest overall results. Additionally, this study provides an analysis of gradient stability in hyperbolic transformers. The results reveal that hyperbolic models exhibit more stable gradients and reduced sensitivity to warmup strategies compared to Euclidean architectures, highlighting their robustness and efficiency in training. Overall, these findings indicate that hyperbolic geometry can enhance vision transformer architectures by improving gradient stability and accuracy. In addition, relatively simple mechanisms such as exponential map aggregation can provide strong practical benefits."

Based on this observation, we propose AdaRAS (Adaptive Reasoning Activation Steering), a lightweight test-time framework that improves reasoning reliability by selectively intervening on neuron activations. AdaRAS identifies Reasoning-Critical Neurons (RCNs) via a polarity-aware mean-difference criterion and adaptively steers their activations during inference, enhancing incorrect reasoning traces while avoiding degradation on already-correct cases. Experiments on 10 mathematics and coding benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements, including over 13% gains on AIME-24 and AIME-25. Moreover, AdaRAS exhibits strong transferability across datasets and scalability to stronger models, outperforming post-training methods without additional training or sampling cost."

We examine the width, the height, and the general morphological evolution of the central sheet; the numerical data is validated against prior experiments and used to guide the development of an energetic model for the maximum elevation of the central sheet. In particular, the rise of the central sheet resembles the spreading behaviour single-drop impacts, especially at high Weber and Reynolds numbers. This fact can be used to estimate scalings in the capillary- and viscous-dominated regimes, which can be used to collapse the trajectories.

    "abstract": "Humans construct internal world models and reason by manipulating the concepts within these models. Recent advances in AI, particularly chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, approximate such human cognitive abilities, where world models are believed to be embedded within large language models. Expert-level performance in formal and abstract domains such as mathematics and programming has been achieved in current systems by relying predominantly on verbal reasoning. However, they still lag far behind humans in domains like physical and spatial intelligence, which require richer representations and prior knowledge. The emergence of unified multimodal models (UMMs) capable of both verbal and visual generation has therefore sparked interest in more human-like reasoning grounded in complementary multimodal pathways, though their benefits remain unclear. From a world-model perspective, this paper presents the first principled study of when and how visual generation benefits reasoning. Our key position is the visual superiority hypothesis: for certain tasks--particularly those grounded in the physical world--visual generation more naturally serves as world models, whereas purely verbal world models encounter bottlenecks arising from representational limitations or insufficient prior knowledge. Theoretically, we formalize internal world modeling as a core component of CoT reasoning and analyze distinctions among different forms of world models. Empirically, we identify tasks that necessitate interleaved visual-verbal CoT reasoning, constructing a new evaluation suite, VisWorld-Eval. Controlled experiments on a state-of-the-art UMM show that interleaved CoT significantly outperforms purely verbal CoT on tasks that favor visual world modeling, but offers no clear advantage otherwise. Together, this work clarifies the potential of multimodal world modeling for more powerful, human-like multimodal AI."

However, existing batch-based FCL methods lack adaptability to streaming scenarios featuring category overlap between old and new data and absent task identifiers, leading to indistinguishability of old and new knowledge, uncertain task assignments for samples, and knowledge confusion.To address this, we propose streaming federated continual learning setting: per federated learning (FL) round, clients process streaming data with disjoint samples and potentially overlapping categories without task identifiers, necessitating sustained inference capability for all prior categories after each FL round.Next, we introduce FedKACE: 1) an adaptive inference model switching mechanism that enables unidirectional switching from local model to global model to achieve a trade-off between personalization and generalization; 2) a adaptive gradient-balanced replay scheme that reconciles new knowledge learning and old knowledge retention under overlapping-class scenarios; 3) a kernel spectral boundary buffer maintenance that preserves high-information and high-boundary-influence samples to optimize cross-round knowledge retention. Experiments across multiple scenarios and regret analysis demonstrate the effectiveness of FedKACE."

    "abstract": "Non-Hermitian systems display spectral and topological phenomena absent in Hermitian physics; yet, their geometric characterization can be hindered by an intrinsic ambiguity rooted in the eigenspace of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, which becomes especially pronounced in the pure quantum regime. Because left and right eigenvectors are not related by conjugation, their norms are not fixed, giving rise to a biorthogonal ${\\rm GL}(N,{\\mathbb C})$ gauge freedom. Consequently, the standard Berry connection admits four inequivalent definitions depending on how left and right eigenvectors are paired, giving rise to distinct Berry phases and generally complex-valued holonomies. Here we show that these ambiguities and the emergence of complex phases are fully resolved by introducing a covariant-derivative formalism built from the metric tensor of the Hilbert space of the underlying non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. The resulting unique Berry connection remains real-valued under an arbitrary ${\\rm GL}(N,{\\mathbb C})$ frame change, and transforms as an affine gauge potential, while reducing to the conventional Berry (or Wilczek-Zee) connection in the Hermitian limit. This establishes an unambiguous and gauge-consistent geometric framework for Berry phases, non-Abelian holonomies, and topological invariants in quantum systems described by non-Hermitian Hamiltonians."

This paper introduces PaW-ViT, Patch-based Warping Vision Transformer, a preprocessing approach rooted in anatomical knowledge that normalizes ear images to enhance the efficacy of ViT. By accurately aligning token boundaries to detected ear feature boundaries, PaW-ViT obtains greater robustness to shape, size, and pose variation. By aligning feature boundaries to natural ear curvature, it produces more consistent token representations for various morphologies. Experiments confirm the effectiveness of PaW-ViT on various ViT models (ViT-T, ViT-S, ViT-B, ViT-L) and yield reasonable alignment robustness to variation in shape, size, and pose. Our work aims to solve the disconnect between ear biometric morphological variation and transformer architecture positional sensitivity, presenting a possible avenue for authentication schemes."

PFM establishes the principal axioms of unique preference aggregation, providing a rigorous basis on which aggregation can be demonstrated. In this paper, it is shown that commonly used aggregation approaches in MCDM - such as weighted arithmetic and geometric means, as well as weighted distance-based optimisation methods - often fail to produce consistent rankings and are therefore unsuitable for pure MCDM. In contrast, the unique preference aggregation presented here clarifies the mathematical limits of valid aggregation and provides a principled, implementable foundation for robust multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) and multi-objective design optimisation (MODO) in multi-faceted problems."

We provide theoretical guarantees for statistical test power across our family of $f$-divergence estimates. While our test covers a variety of $f$-divergences, we bring particular focus to the Hockey-Stick divergence, motivated by its applications to differential privacy auditing and machine unlearning evaluation. For two-sample testing, experiments demonstrate that different $f$-divergences are sensitive to different localized differences, illustrating the importance of leveraging diverse statistics. For machine unlearning, we propose a relative test that distinguishes true unlearning failures from safe distributional variations."

    "abstract": "With the development of foundation model (FM), agentic AI systems are getting more attention, yet their inherent issues like hallucination and poor reasoning, coupled with the frequent ad-hoc nature of system design, lead to unreliable and brittle applications. Existing efforts to characterise agentic design patterns often lack a rigorous systems-theoretic foundation, resulting in high-level or convenience-based taxonomies that are difficult to implement. This paper addresses this gap by introducing a principled methodology for engineering robust AI agents. We propose two primary contributions: first, a novel system-theoretic framework that deconstructs an agentic AI system into five core, interacting functional subsystems: Reasoning & World Model, Perception & Grounding, Action Execution, Learning & Adaptation, and Inter-Agent Communication. Second, derived from this architecture and directly mapped to a comprehensive taxonomy of agentic challenges, we present a collection of 12 agentic design patterns. These patterns - categorised as Foundational, Cognitive & Decisional, Execution & Interaction, and Adaptive & Learning - offer reusable, structural solutions to recurring problems in agent design. The utility of the framework is demonstrated by a case study on the ReAct framework, showing how the proposed patterns can rectify systemic architectural deficiencies. This work provides a foundational language and a structured methodology to standardise agentic design communication among researchers and engineers, leading to more modular, understandable, and reliable autonomous systems."

The normal-mode structure is obtained analytically and the corresponding modal amplitudes determine the pattern of energy exchange between the two sectors. To bridge the discrete and semiclassical pictures, we introduce smooth envelope functions that provide a continuous effective description along the geometric variable. Numerical simulations in a truncated Fock space show that the two oscillators exchange quanta in an approximately out-of-phase manner, consistent with an effective conservation of $\\langle n_x\\rangle - \\langle n_y\\rangle$. The reduced entropy $S_x(t)$ exhibits periodic growth, indicating entanglement generation. These results demonstrate that even a minimal two-mode framework can capture key qualitative features of energy transfer and information flow during evaporation."

    "abstract": "Advances in quantum technologies are accelerating the demand for optical quantum state sensors that combine high precision, versatility, and scalability within a unified hardware platform. Quantum reservoir computing offers a powerful route toward this goal by exploiting the nonlinear dynamics of quantum systems to process and interpret quantum information efficiently. Photonic neural networks are particularly well suited for such implementations, owing to their intrinsic sensitivity to photon-encoded quantum information. However, the practical realisation of photonic quantum reservoirs remains constrained by the inherently weak optical nonlinearities of available materials and the technological challenges of fabricating densely coupled quantum networks. To address these limitations, we introduce a hybrid quantum-classical detection protocol that integrates the advantages of quantum reservoirs with the adaptive learning capabilities of analogue neural networks. This synergistic architecture substantially enhances information-extraction accuracy and robustness, enabling low-cost performance improvements of quantum light sensors. Based on the proposed approach, we achieved significant improvements in quantum state classification, tomography, and feature regression, even for reservoirs with a relatively small nonlinearity-to-losses ratio $U/γ\\approx 0.02$ in a network of only five nodes. By reducing reliance on material nonlinearity and reservoir size, the proposed approach facilitates the practical deployment of high-fidelity photonic quantum sensors on existing integrated platforms, paving the way toward chip-scale quantum processors and photonic sensing technologies."

This in turn forces operation in a regime where a (dressed) rotating-wave approximation (RWA) is valid, thereby restricting key aspects of their operation. Here, using only a single coupling axis in the laboratory frame, we introduce a dressed-qubit control protocol that optimally removes the CRT, eliminating the need for the RWA and delivering substantial improvements in multiple performance metrics, including single-qubit gate speed, two-qubit gate fidelity, spectroscopic range, clock stability, and coherence preservation. In addition, we provide a general parameterization together with a Floquet-based coherence-time expression, which elucidates the protocol's working principles and lowers the barrier to adoption. Collectively, these advances position our scheme as the state-of-the-art strategy for qubit control, paving the way for a wider class of quantum technologies to be realized using dressed-qubit architectures."

We show that this shortcoming can be addressed by using a distributional kernel, instead of the set-oriented criterion; and the resultant clusters achieve a new distribution-oriented objective to maximize the total similarity of all clusters (TSC). Our theoretical analysis shows that the resultant dendrogram guarantees a lower bound of TSC. The empirical evaluation shows the effectiveness of our proposed method on artificial and Spatial Transcriptomics (bioinformatics) datasets. Our proposed method successfully creates a dendrogram that is consistent with the biological regions in a Spatial Transcriptomics dataset, whereas other contenders fail."

To address this, we propose Phys-NVAS, the first physics-aware NVAS framework that integrates spatial geometry modeling with vision-language semantic priors. A global 3D acoustic environment is reconstructed from multi-view images and depth maps to estimate room size and shape, enhancing spatial awareness of sound propagation. Meanwhile, a vision-language model extracts physics-aware priors of objects, layouts, and materials, capturing absorption and reflection beyond geometry. An acoustic feature fusion adapter unifies these cues into a physics-aware representation for binaural generation. Experiments on RWAVS demonstrate that Phys-NVAS yields binaural audio with improved realism and physical consistency."

    "abstract": "Generative recommendation provides a novel paradigm in which each item is represented by a discrete semantic ID (SID) learned from rich content. Most existing methods treat SIDs as predefined and train recommenders under static indexing. In practice, SIDs are typically optimized only for content reconstruction rather than recommendation accuracy. This leads to an objective mismatch: the system optimizes an indexing loss to learn the SID and a recommendation loss for interaction prediction, but because the tokenizer is trained independently, the recommendation loss cannot update it. A natural approach is to make semantic indexing differentiable so that recommendation gradients can directly influence SID learning, but this often causes codebook collapse, where only a few codes are used. We attribute this issue to early deterministic assignments that limit codebook exploration, resulting in imbalance and unstable optimization. In this paper, we propose DIGER (Differentiable Semantic ID for Generative Recommendation), a first step toward effective differentiable semantic IDs for generative recommendation. DIGER introduces Gumbel noise to explicitly encourage early-stage exploration over codes, mitigating codebook collapse and improving code utilization. To balance exploration and convergence, we further design two uncertainty decay strategies that gradually reduce the Gumbel noise, enabling a smooth transition from early exploration to exploitation of learned SIDs. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets demonstrate consistent improvements from differentiable semantic IDs. These results confirm the effectiveness of aligning indexing and recommendation objectives through differentiable SIDs and highlight differentiable semantic indexing as a promising research direction."

The variation of the mass distribution of the LSS of the universe implies that observers residing in different locations may suffer bias in their measurements when they look at the images of distant galaxies. Here, we assess the influence of the local environment on weak gravitational lensing (WL) shear statistics in the context of relativistic $N$-body code, \\texttt{gevolution}. We derive numerical constraints on the cosmological parameters from the WL shear angular power spectrum and comment on the local environment's influence on WL shear. We find tighter constraints on the parameter $Ω_\\mathrm{m}$ above redshift $z$ = 0.2, which implies over this redshift the local environment's impact is minor. We also investigate the bispectrum and conclude that on average the impact of the local environment on $f_{\\rm NL}$ (a measure of non-Gaussianities) is minimal and consistent with zero effect. However, we find that within the assembly of all possible observers/locations, there will also be a few that could infer the parameter $f_{\\rm NL}$ of the order 10. These results could thus be used to estimate the uncertainty in the inference of cosmological parameters such as $f_{\\rm NL}$ based on WL shear bispectrum and thus may have implications for future surveys requiring precision at the percent level."

In this study, we established a comprehensive PMT optical model based on prior studies, taking into account the non-uniformity of photon detection efficiency (PDE) across the PMT surface and the variances in PDE as well as reflections among different PMTs. By collecting reflectance data from 669 PMTs and utilizing PDE data from mass testing systems, we estimated the thickness maps of the photocathode (PC) and the anti-reflective coating (ARC) for each PMT. We also determined the collection efficiency (CE) by decomposing PDE with consideration of the optical processes occurring within the PMTs. The refractive index and extinction coefficient of both the PC and ARC, along with the escape factor, were evaluated over a broad wavelength range of 300~nm to 700~nm, covering the entire spectrum of interest for JUNO. Compared to the prediction from a simplified PMT optical model, which assumes uniform PC and ARC across all PMTs of the same type, the further developed PMT optical model yields much more reflectance for HPK PMTs and less for NNVT PMTs, and the change in PDE is at the level of a few percent. This comprehensive PMT optical model also provides a valuable reference for other PMT-based applications."

A discrete (describing the evolution of finitely many particles) solution is called sticky if, upon collision, particles stick together and move as one for all subsequent time, according to the conservation of mass and momentum principles. We prove results on the total energy (Hamiltonian) of the system and demonstrate the existence and uniqueness of so-called \"perfect\" states, where the Hamiltonian is constant over all time and the solution converges to equilibrium, a single stationary particle. We provide a necessary and a sufficient condition for finite-time collapse, and present a quadratic envelope within which a solution must remain in order to collapse.

Understanding how these associations are learned and represented in language models is essential for connecting deep learning with linguistic theory and developing a mechanistic foundation for large language models. In this work, we analyze how these associations emerge from natural language data in attention-based language models through the lens of training dynamics. By leveraging a leading-term approximation of the gradients, we develop closed-form expressions for the weights at early stages of training that explain how semantic associations first take shape. Through our analysis, we reveal that each set of weights of the transformer has closed-form expressions as simple compositions of three basis functions (bigram, token-interchangeability, and context mappings), reflecting the statistics of the text corpus and uncovering how each component of the transformer captures semantic associations based on these compositions. Experiments on real-world LLMs demonstrate that our theoretical weight characterizations closely match the learned weights, and qualitative analyses further show how our theorem shines light on interpreting the learned associations in transformers."

    "abstract": "Risk disclosures in SEC filings describe potential adverse events but rarely quantify their likelihood, limiting their usefulness for probabilistic analysis. A central obstacle is the absence of large-scale, risk-level supervision linking disclosed risks to realized outcomes. We introduce a fully automated data generation pipeline that converts qualitative SEC risk disclosures into temporally grounded supervision using only public data. For each filing, the pipeline generates firm-specific, time-bounded risk queries from the Risk Factors section and labels them by automatically resolving outcomes against subsequent disclosures. Using this dataset of risk queries and outcomes grounded in SEC filings, we train a compact large language model to estimate the probability that a disclosed risk will materialize within a specified horizon. Despite its modest size, the resulting model substantially improves over pretrained and heuristic baselines, and outperforms frontier general-purpose models, including GPT-5, on probabilistic accuracy and calibration. More broadly, this work demonstrates that Foresight Learning enables scalable and fully automated training of domain-specific expert models using only raw, chronological, in-domain text -- without proprietary data, external corpora, or manual annotation. The resulting models achieve frontier-level performance while remaining deployable on a single GPU. This result suggests a general pathway for learning calibrated, decision-relevant signals from naturally occurring enterprise documents. To support transparency and reproducibility, we open-source the evaluation dataset used in this study.

    "abstract": "Supernovae characterized by enduring narrow optical hydrogen emission lines (SNe IIn) are believed to result primarily from the core-collapse of massive stars undergoing sustained interaction with a dense circumstellar medium (CSM). While the properties of SN IIn progenitors have relatively few direct constraints, the ongoing ejecta-CSM interaction provides unique information about late-stage stellar mass-loss preceding core-collapse. We present late-time X-ray and radio observations of four $\\geq$3000 day-old SNe IIn: SN 2013L, SN 2014ab, SN 2015da, and KISS15s. The radio and X-ray emission from KISS15s indicate a mass-loss rate of $\\rm{\\dot M\\sim4\\times 10^{-3}~{M_{\\odot}\\,yr^{-1}}}$ at $\\sim$450 years pre-supernova -- 2 orders of magnitude below earlier optical estimates (which probed the mass-loss immediately preceding the supernova). We find hints of a spectral inversion in the radio SED of KISS15s; a possible signature of a secondary shock due to a binary system or the emergence of a pulsar wind. For SN 2013L, we obtain a mass-loss rate of $\\rm{\\dot M\\sim2 \\times 10^{-3}~\\rm{M_{\\odot}\\,yr^{-1}}}$ at $\\sim$400 years pre-explosion based on the X-ray detection. For SN 2014ab and SN 2015da, we find a upper limits on the mass-loss rates of $\\rm{\\dot M<2\\times10^{-3}~M_{\\odot}\\,yr^{-1}}$ explosion at $\\sim$ 250 and 300 years pre-explosion, respectively. All four objects display mass-loss rates lower than estimates from earlier optical analyses by at least 1-3 orders of magnitude, necessitating a rapidly evolving progenitor process over the last centuries pre-explosion. Our analysis reveals how X-ray and radio observations can elucidate progenitor evolution when these objects have faded at optical wavelengths."

In the last 20 years, these particles have evolved into valuable tools for observing Earth's systems. This review compiles the use of cosmic rays in three primary areas: (1) particle physics and atmospheric processes, which include cosmic-ray-induced cascades, ionization, and their impact on atmospheric chemistry and radiation; (2) geosciences, where cosmogenic radionuclides assist in the dating of geological materials and cosmic-ray neutrons are used for large-scale monitoring of soil moisture and snow water equivalents; and (3) urban science, where cosmic-ray muons are employed for non-invasive subsurface imaging and, when paired with distributed sensors, serve as the basis for smart city monitoring. The review places particular emphasis on integrating these methods with remote sensing and geographic information systems (GIS), which helps close the persistent scale gap between point measurements and satellite observations, thereby enabling three-dimensional digital representations of subsurfaces. The review concludes by discussing the data standards, their integration into operational Earth observation workflows, and future research directions."

We explore scenarios in which the error probability for discriminating two quantum states can be reduced below the Helstrom bound under some constrained access of resources, indicating the use of measurement operations that go beyond the standard positive operator-valued measurements framework. We refer to such measurements as non-positive operator-valued measurements. While existing literature often associates these measurements with initial entanglement between the system and an auxiliary, followed by joint projective measurement and discarding the auxiliary, we demonstrate that initial entanglement between system and auxiliary is not necessary for the emergence of such measurements in the context of state discrimination. Interestingly, even initial product states can give rise to effective non-positive measurements on the subsystem, and achieve sub-Helstrom discrimination error when discriminating quantum states of the subsystem."

Three types of simulations, namely with freely moving, rotation-constrained, and spanwise-motion-constrained particles, were conducted using particle-resolved direct numerical simulations. With the aid of a relative velocity suitably defined in the vicinity of the finite-size particle, we decompose the hydrodynamic force into drag and lift contributions and evaluate the local wall-normal shear rate around the particles. By means of coherent structure eduction techniques, we investigate flow structures before and during lift-off events. Rotation-constrained simulations revealed the insignificance of particle rotation in the entrainment mechanism. Spanwise-motion-constrained simulations revealed the importance of particle location with respect to flow structures with apparent changes in entrainment frequency, duration of the entrainment process, wall-normal shear around the particles, and distance to the nearest vortical structures during lift-off. The contribution of lift to the wall-normal force is found to be responsible for the initiation of particle entrainment, which is induced by a high-shear event associated with fast-moving fluid. The presence of quasi-streamwise vortices is shown to be an important ingredient for the entrainment of particles into the bulk flow. The results show that, at marginal Shields number values, a high wall-normal shear rate and the proximity of an intense quasi-streamwise vortex are essential elements of the entrainment mechanism."

For such processes, we compute the exact next-to-leading order (NLO) corrections matched to a Parton Shower (PS) to describe exclusive multiple photon emission.

We present validation tests and comparisons with NLO predictions available in the literature to cross-check various ingredients of our formulation.

Here, we introduce molecular Hamiltonian learning, a machine learning strategy that infers the microscopic Hamiltonian parameters of a single adsorbed molecule directly from the setpoint-dependence of STM-IETS data. The method leverages the systematic evolution of spectral features as the STM tip tunes the local electrostatic environment for different tip-sample distances. We demonstrate this approach on iron phthalocyanine on ferroelectric SnTe, training our algorithm on theory spectra from a realistic multiorbital model, including spin-orbit coupling, electrostatic interactions, local crystal field, and substrate effects. The algorithm, trained solely on theoretical many-body simulations, allows reconstructing Hamiltonian parameters directly from experimental spectra. Our manuscript establishes a flexible and automated strategy for Hamiltonian reconstruction from STM-IETS, transforming setpoint-dependent spectroscopy into quantitative characterization of quantum materials at the atomic scale."

This limitation stems from existing AIGI detection benchmarks, which, despite featuring a broad collection of synthetic images, remain restricted in their coverage of artifact diversity and lack detailed, localized annotations. To bridge this gap, we introduce a fine-grained benchmark towards eXplainable AI-Generated image Detection, named X-AIGD, which provides pixel-level, categorized annotations of perceptual artifacts, spanning low-level distortions, high-level semantics, and cognitive-level counterfactuals. These comprehensive annotations facilitate fine-grained interpretability evaluation and deeper insight into model decision-making processes. Our extensive investigation using X-AIGD provides several key insights: (1) Existing AIGI detectors demonstrate negligible reliance on perceptual artifacts, even at the most basic distortion level. (2) While AIGI detectors can be trained to identify specific artifacts, they still substantially base their judgment on uninterpretable features. (3) Explicitly aligning model attention with artifact regions can increase the interpretability and generalization of detectors. The data and code are available at: https://github.com/Coxy7/X-AIGD."

The latter are governed by a constraint equation. The proof relies on a variational splitting scheme that isolates the transport (aggregation-diffusion) and reaction contributions.

    "abstract": "Large language models have recently shown promise for multimodal recommendation, particularly with text and image inputs. Yet real-world recommendation signals extend far beyond these modalities. To reflect this, we formalize recommendation features into four modalities: text, images, categorical features, and numerical attributes, and highlight the unique challenges this heterogeneity poses for LLMs in understanding multimodal information. In particular, these challenges arise not only across modalities but also within them, as attributes such as price, rating, and time may all be numeric yet carry distinct semantic meanings. Beyond this intra-modality ambiguity, another major challenge is the nested structure of recommendation signals, where user histories are sequences of items, each associated with multiple attributes. To address these challenges, we propose UniRec, a unified multimodal encoder for LLM-based recommendation. UniRec first employs modality-specific encoders to produce consistent embeddings across heterogeneous signals. It then adopts a triplet representation, comprising attribute name, type, and value, to separate schema from raw inputs and preserve semantic distinctions. Finally, a hierarchical Q-Former models the nested structure of user interactions while maintaining their layered organization. Across multiple real-world benchmarks, UniRec outperforms state-of-the-art multimodal and LLM-based recommenders by up to 15%, and extensive ablation studies further validate the contributions of each component."

Engineering the photonic environment surrounding quantum emitters can enhance their emission characteristics. However, simultaneously achieving precise control over both excitation enhancement and quantum-yield modulation at the nanoscale remains elusive, highlighting substantial room for advancing the precised engineering of quantum emission. Here, we introduce silicon Mie voids - air-defined cavities that invert the conventional solid-particle geometry - to achieve independent tuning of quantum emission within an individual subwavelength structure, while minimizing optical losses. Full-wave simulations and experiments on both gradient and uniform Mie-void arrays jointly validate this quantitative framework for emission tuning, which disentangles excitation enhancement arising from local field confinement in air and quantum-yield enhancement resulting from strengthened emitter-resonator coupling, while confirming the accelerated radiative decay enabled by the void configuration. Leveraging this flexible mechanism, we realize a bimodal nanophotonic pattern with near-diffraction-limited pixels that encode the EPFL logo in the bright field and the SJTU logo in both dark field and photoluminescence micrographs. These results establish Mie voids as a powerful platform for programmable, high-density multimodal displays and open new avenues for advancing state-of-the-art nanophotonic devices."

However, such demonstrations are frequently suboptimal or misaligned with robotic tasks due to embodiment differences, retargeting errors, and task-irrelevant variations, causing naïve imitation to degrade task performance. Conversely, task-only reinforcement learning admits many task-optimal solutions, often resulting in unnatural or unstable motions. This exposes a fundamental limitation of linear reward mixing in adversarial imitation learning. We propose \\emph{Task-Centric Motion Priors} (TCMP), a task-priority adversarial imitation framework that treats imitation as a conditional regularizer rather than a co-equal objective. TCMP maximizes task improvement while incorporating imitation signals only when they are compatible with task progress, yielding an adaptive, geometry-aware update that preserves task-feasible descent and suppresses harmful imitation under misalignment. We provide theoretical analysis of gradient conflict and task-priority stationary points, and validate our claims through humanoid control experiments demonstrating robust task performance with consistent motion style under noisy demonstrations."

Although recent large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong translation capabilities, their effectiveness for APE--especially under document-level context--remains insufficiently understood. We present a systematic comparison of proprietary and open-weight LLMs under a naive document-level prompting setup, analyzing APE quality, contextual behavior, robustness, and efficiency. Our results show that proprietary LLMs achieve near human-level APE quality even with simple one-shot prompting, regardless of whether document context is provided. While these models exhibit higher robustness to data poisoning attacks than open-weight counterparts, this robustness also reveals a limitation: they largely fail to exploit document-level context for contextual error correction. Furthermore, standard automatic metrics do not reliably reflect these qualitative improvements, highlighting the continued necessity of human evaluation. Despite their strong performance, the substantial cost and latency overheads of proprietary LLMs render them impractical for real-world APE deployment. Overall, our findings elucidate both the promise and current limitations of LLM-based document-aware APE, and point toward the need for more efficient long-context modeling approaches for translation refinement."

We present SEAFormer, a novel transformer that incorporates both node-level and edge-level information in decision-making through two key innovations. First, our Clustered Proximity Attention (CPA) exploits locality-aware clustering to reduce the complexity of attention from $O(n^2)$ to $O(n)$ while preserving global perspective, allowing SEAFormer to efficiently train on large instances. Second, our lightweight edge-aware module captures pairwise features through residual fusion, enabling effective incorporation of edge-based information and faster convergence. Extensive experiments across four RWVRP variants with various scales demonstrate that SEAFormer achieves superior results over state-of-the-art methods. Notably, SEAFormer is the first neural method to solve 1,000+ node RWVRPs effectively, while also achieving superior performance on classic VRPs, making it a versatile solution for both research benchmarks and real-world applications."

Socio-emotional intelligence (SEI) enhances collaboration among human teammates, but its role in HAIC remains unclear. Current AI systems lack SEI capabilities that humans bring to teamwork, creating a potential gap in collaborative dynamics. In this study, we investigate how software practitioners perceive the socio-emotional gap in HAIC and what capabilities AI systems require for effective collaboration. Through semi-structured interviews with 10 practitioners, we examine how they think about collaborating with human versus AI teammates, focusing on their SEI expectations and the AI capabilities they envision. Results indicate that practitioners currently view AI models as intellectual teammates rather than social partners and expect fewer SEI attributes from them than from human teammates. However, they see the socio-emotional gap not as AIs failure to exhibit SEI traits, but as a functional gap in collaborative capabilities (AIs inability to negotiate responsibilities, adapt contextually, or maintain sustained partnerships). We introduce the concept of functional equivalents: technical capabilities (internal cognition, contextual intelligence, adaptive learning, and collaborative intelligence) that achieve collaborative outcomes comparable to human SEI attributes. Our findings suggest that effective collaboration with AI for SE tasks may benefit from functional design rather than replicating human SEI traits for SE tasks, thereby redefining collaboration as functional alignment."

Automotive Mediated Reality (AMR) can enhance driving safety by overlaying critical information (e.g., outlines, icons, text) on key objects to improve awareness, altering objects' appearance to simplify traffic situations, and diminishing their appearance to minimize distractions. However, real-world AMR evaluation remains limited due to technical challenges. To fill this sim-to-real gap, we present MIRAGE, an open-source tool that enables real-time AMR in real vehicles. MIRAGE implements 15 effects across the AMR spectrum of augmented, diminished, and modified reality using state-of-the-art computational models for object detection and segmentation, depth estimation, and inpainting. In an on-road expert user study (N=9) of MIRAGE, participants enjoyed the AMR experience while pointing out technical limitations and identifying use cases for AMR. We discuss these results in relation to prior work and outline implications for AMR ethics and interaction design."

This paper investigates the problem of age of information (AoI)-aware status updates in vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication, where each vehicle's status is represented by multiple interdependent packets. To enable fine-grained queue management at the packet level under resource constraints, we formulate a joint optimization problem that simultaneously learns active packet dropping and transmit power control strategies. A hybrid action space is designed to support both discrete dropping decisions and continuous power control. To exploit the graph-structured interference inherent in V2V topology, a graph neural network (GNN) is introduced to aggregate slowly varying large-scale fading, allowing agents to capture topological dependencies implicitly without frequent message exchange. The overall framework is built upon multi-agent proximal policy optimization (MAPPO), with centralized training and decentralized execution (CTDE). Simulations demonstrate that the proposed method significantly reduces average AoI across a wide range of network densities, channel conditions, and traffic loads, consistently outperforming several baselines."

Given that effective platooning relies on robust vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) links, understanding connectivity dynamics on highways is essential.} In this paper, we analyze the dynamics of vehicular platooning on a highway and its impact on the performance of two forms of vehicular communications -- namely V2V and V2I communication -- compared to independent vehicle movement on a highway. The vehicular networks consists of road-side units (RSUs), modeled as a 1D Poisson point process (PPP), to provide the vehicular connectivity to the VUs. VUs are modeled as 1D PPP under the non-platooned traffic scenario (N-PTS) and as a 1D Matern cluster process (MCP) under the platooned traffic scenario (PTS). We evaluate the distribution on the per-RSU load, representing the number of VUs served, for the typical and tagged RSU. Additionally, we derive coverage probability (CP) and rate coverage (RC), which measures the probability of the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and achievable rate above a specified threshold at the typical VU along with their meta distribution (MD), providing a deeper understanding of the reliability and variability of these metrics across different spatial distributions of VUs and RSUs. Finally, we validate our theoretical findings through simulations and provide numerical insights into the impact of different traffic patterns on RSU load distribution, CP, and RC performance."

They have demonstrated impressive results in replicating dense, real-world contents such as images, musical pieces, or human languages. This work investigates their application to the numerical simulation of incompressible fluid flows, with a view toward incorporating physical constraints such as incompressibility in the probabilistic forecasting framework enabled by generative networks. For that purpose, we explore different conditional, score-based diffusion models where the divergence-free constraint is imposed by the Leray spectral projector, and autoregressive conditioning is aimed at stabilizing the forecasted flow snapshots at distant time horizons. The proposed models are run on a benchmark turbulence problem, namely a Kolmogorov flow, which allows for a fairly detailed analytical and numerical treatment and thus simplifies the evaluation of the numerical methods used to simulate it. Numerical experiments of increasing complexity are performed in order to compare the advantages and limitations of the diffusion models we have implemented and appraise their performances, including: (i) in-distribution assessment over the same time horizons and for similar physical conditions as the ones seen during training; (ii) rollout predictions over time horizons unseen during training; and (iii) out-of-distribution tests for forecasting flows markedly different from those seen during training. In particular, these results illustrate the ability of diffusion models to reproduce the main statistical characteristics of Kolmogorov turbulence in scenarios departing from the ones they were trained on."

    "abstract": "Deploying deep learning agents for autonomous navigation in unstructured environments faces critical challenges regarding safety, data scarcity, and limited computational resources. Traditional solvers often suffer from high latency, while emerging learning-based approaches struggle to ensure deterministic feasibility. To bridge the gap from embodied to embedded intelligence, we propose a self-supervised framework incorporating a differentiable hard constraint projection layer for runtime assurance. To mitigate data scarcity, we construct a Global-Guided Artificial Potential Field (G-APF), which provides dense supervision signals without manual labeling. To enforce actuator limitations and geometric constraints efficiently, we employ an adaptive neural projection layer, which iteratively rectifies the coarse network output onto the feasible manifold. Extensive benchmarks on a test set of 20,000 scenarios demonstrate an 88.75\\% success rate, substantiating the enhanced operational safety. Closed-loop experiments in CARLA further validate the physical realizability of the planned paths under dynamic constraints. Furthermore, deployment verification on an NVIDIA Jetson Orin NX confirms an inference latency of 94 ms, showing real-time feasibility on resource-constrained embedded hardware. This framework offers a generalized paradigm for embedding physical laws into neural architectures, providing a viable direction for solving constrained optimization in mechatronics.

While in its L2 orbit, the satellite has been exposed to high energy cosmic rays and solar particles, that caused permanent damage to its CCDs. The main effect of radiation damage on Gaia data is the distortion of its images and spectra, caused by the CCDs charge transfer inefficiency (CTI) during the readout process, that, if not taken into account, can result in inaccurate measurements of a star's location and flux. In this work, the impact of CTI in the serial readout direction, larger than in the parallel due to the presence of CCDs manufacturing defects, has been analysed and modelled. A pixel-based, physically motivated CTI model, CtiPixel, has been developed to characterise the damage in Gaia CCDs. The model has been calibrated using dedicated serial CTI diagnostic data, taken every 3-4 months over the course of the mission. The model is shown to be a good representation of the observed signatures of CTI in the calibration datasets, and its parameters reveal significant insights into the nature of the CCD defects generated by space irradiation. The evolution of the damage in the serial direction shows a general small linear increase over time, with sudden step changes after strong solar flares and coronal mass ejections directed towards Earth. The serial CTI showed a further step increase as a consequence of the engineering CCD annealing experiment carried out after the completion of Gaia science observations."

    "abstract": "Imbalanced node classification is a critical challenge in graph learning, where most existing methods typically utilize Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to learn node representations. These methods can be broadly categorized into the data-level and the algorithm-level. The former aims to synthesize minority-class nodes to mitigate quantity imbalance, while the latter tries to optimize the learning process to highlight minority classes. However, neither of them addresses the inherently imbalanced graph structure, which is a fundamental factor that incurs majority-class dominance and minority-class assimilation in GNNs. Our theoretical analysis further supports this critical insight. Therefore, we propose GraphSB (Graph Structural Balance), a novel framework that incorporates Structural Balance as a key strategy to address the underlying imbalanced graph structure before node synthesis. Structural Balance performs a two-stage structure optimization: Structure Enhancement that mines hard samples near decision boundaries through dual-view analysis and enhances connectivity for minority classes through adaptive augmentation, and Relation Diffusion that propagates the enhanced minority context while simultaneously capturing higher-order structural dependencies. Thus, GraphSB balances structural distribution before node synthesis, enabling more effective learning in GNNs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GraphSB significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. More importantly, the proposed Structural Balance can be seamlessly integrated into state-of-the-art methods as a simple plug-and-play module, increasing their accuracy by an average of 4.57%."

On the other hand, there is a disturbing result that calculation using the mean molecular weight, $M_{n}$, leads to exact agreement between the two theories, suggesting that the distribution is in effect monodisperse, contrary to the assumed geometric one and also the observed polydispersity, $M_w/M_n=2.1$. Further experimental studies employing monodisperse monomers would be highly valuable to consolidate the bridge between these two fundamental theories."

However, classical algorithms for $k$-clustering (such as $k$-median and $k$-means) assume access to exact pairwise distances -- an unrealistic requirement in many modern applications. We study clustering in the \\emph{Rank-model (R-model)}, where access to distances is entirely replaced by a \\emph{quadruplet oracle} that provides only relative distance comparisons. In practice, such an oracle can represent learned models or human feedback, and is expected to be noisy and entail an access cost. Given a metric space with $n$ input items, we design randomized algorithms that, using only a noisy quadruplet oracle, compute a set of $O(k \\cdot \\mathsf{polylog}(n))$ centers along with a mapping from the input items to the centers such that the clustering cost of the mapping is at most constant times the optimum $k$-clustering cost. Our method achieves a query complexity of $O(n\\cdot k \\cdot \\mathsf{polylog}(n))$ for arbitrary metric spaces and improves to $O((n+k^2) \\cdot \\mathsf{polylog}(n))$ when the underlying metric has bounded doubling dimension. When the metric has bounded doubling dimension we can further improve the approximation from constant to $1+\\varepsilon$, for any arbitrarily small constant $\\varepsilon\\in(0,1)$, while preserving the same asymptotic query complexity. Our framework demonstrates how noisy, low-cost oracles, such as those derived from large language models, can be systematically integrated into scalable clustering algorithms."

We present the transients detected with the STONKS pipeline found in an XMM-Newton multi-year heritage survey of the Galactic plane to identify and classify highly variable X-ray sources that have recently been reported in this region. We examined the alerts created by the STONKS pipeline from over 200 XMM observations of the Galactic plane, screening for instrumental effects. The 78 alerts associated with 70 real astrophysical sources were then subjected to further temporal and spectral analysis. From the 70 sources we identified, we were able to classify 32 with a high degree of confidence, including 7 X-ray binaries, 1 $γ$-Cas analogue, and 1 magnetar candidate. Of the 70 sources, 23 were detected for the first time in X-rays. This systematic analysis of publicly available data has shown the value and potential of STONKS in the application to XMM-Newton observations. It will enable the community to detect transient and highly variable sources at fainter fluxes than with any other X-ray transient detection systems."

Analysis of sensitivity bounds reveals: (i) Phase measurements are more sensitive than intensity measurements; (ii) Sensitivity exhibits three regimes: photon-shot-noise limited, chemically limited, and intermediate; (iii) Sensitivity shows a turnover as a function of reaction rate due to the interplay between coherent electronic dynamics and incoherent chemical dynamics.

In this paper, we study the problem of learning generalizable traffic representations for IoT device identification. We design compact encoder architectures that learn per-flow embeddings from unlabeled IoT traffic and evaluate them using a frozen-encoder protocol with a simple supervised classifier. Our specific contributions are threefold. (1) We develop unsupervised encoder--decoder models that learn compact traffic representations from unlabeled IoT network flows and assess their quality through reconstruction-based analysis. (2) We show that these learned representations can be used effectively for IoT device-type classification using simple, lightweight classifiers trained on frozen embeddings. (3) We provide a systematic benchmarking study against the state-of-the-art pretrained traffic encoders, showing that larger models do not necessarily yield more robust representations for IoT traffic. Using more than 18 million real IoT traffic flows collected across multiple years and deployment environments, we learn traffic representations from unlabeled data and evaluate device-type classification on disjoint labeled subsets, achieving macro F1-scores exceeding 0.9 for device-type classification and demonstrating robustness under cross-environment deployment."

We propose Formula-One Prompting (F-1), a two-phase approach that uses mathematical equations as an intermediate representation before adaptive solving. F-1 first formulates governing equations from problem descriptions, then selects a solving strategy among CoT, PoT, or direct computation based on the generated equations, all within a single LLM call. Results across five models and four benchmarks show F-1 outperforms CoT by +5.76% and PoT by +8.42% on average. Crucially, gains are largest in applied domains: +13.30% on FinanceMath over CoT, and within OlympiadBench, larger gains on physics (+2.55%) than pure math (+0.44%).

    "abstract": "Neural video compression (NVC) has demonstrated superior compression efficiency, yet effective rate control remains a significant challenge due to complex temporal dependencies. Existing rate control schemes typically leverage frame content to capture distortion interactions, overlooking inter-frame rate dependencies arising from shifts in per-frame coding parameters. This often leads to suboptimal bitrate allocation and cascading parameter decisions. To address this, we propose a reinforcement-learning (RL)-based rate control framework that formulates the task as a frame-by-frame sequential decision process. At each frame, an RL agent observes a spatiotemporal state and selects coding parameters to optimize a long-term reward that reflects rate-distortion (R-D) performance and bitrate adherence. Unlike prior methods, our approach jointly determines bitrate allocation and coding parameters in a single step, independent of group of pictures (GOP) structure. Extensive experiments across diverse NVC architectures show that our method reduces the average relative bitrate error to 1.20% and achieves up to 13.45% bitrate savings at typical GOP sizes, outperforming existing approaches. In addition, our framework demonstrates improved robustness to content variation and bandwidth fluctuations with lower coding overhead, making it highly suitable for practical deployment."

We introduce MetaGen, a training-free framework that adapts both the role space and the collaboration topology at inference time, without updating base model weights. MetaGen generates and rewrites query-conditioned role specifications to maintain a controllable dynamic role pool, then instantiates a constrained execution graph around a minimal backbone. During execution, it iteratively updates role prompts and adjusts structural decisions using lightweight feedback signals.

    "abstract": "Statistical clustering in dynamic networks aims to identify groups of nodes with similar or distinct internal connectivity patterns as the network evolves over time. While early research primarily focused on static Stochastic Block Models (SBMs), recent advancements have extended these models to handle dynamic and weighted networks, allowing for a more accurate representation of temporal variations in structure. Additional developments have introduced methods for detecting structural changes, such as shifts in community membership. However, limited attention has been paid to dynamic networks with variable population sizes, where nodes may enter or exit the network. To address this gap, we propose an extension of dynamic SBMs (dSBMs) that incorporates a birth-death process, enabling the statistical clustering of nodes in dynamic networks with evolving population sizes. This work makes three main contributions: (1) the introduction of a novel model for dSBMs with birth-death processes, (2) a framework for parameter inference and prediction of latent communities in this model, and (3) the development of an adapted Variational Expectation-Maximization (VEM) algorithm for efficient inference within this extended framework."

    "abstract": "Recommender systems (RS) aim to retrieve a small set of items that best match individual user preferences. Naturally, RS place primary emphasis on the quality of the Top-$K$ results rather than performance across the entire item set. However, estimating Top-$K$ accuracy (e.g., Precision@$K$, Recall@$K$) requires determining the ranking positions of items, which imposes substantial computational overhead and poses significant challenges for optimization. In addition, RS often suffer from distribution shifts due to evolving user preferences or data biases, further complicating the task. To address these issues, we propose Talos, a loss function that is specifically designed to optimize the Talos recommendation accuracy. Talos leverages a quantile technique that replaces the complex ranking-dependent operations into simpler comparisons between predicted scores and learned score thresholds. We further develop a sampling-based regression algorithm for efficient and accurate threshold estimation, and introduce a constraint term to maintain optimization stability by preventing score inflation. Additionally, we incorporate a tailored surrogate function to address discontinuity and enhance robustness against distribution shifts. Comprehensive theoretical analyzes and empirical experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency, convergence, and distributional robustness of Talos.

Detecting such fake content reliably is an urgent challenge. While deep learning approaches dominate current literature, handcrafted features remain attractive for their interpretability, efficiency, and generalizability. In this paper, we conduct a systematic evaluation of handcrafted descriptors, including raw pixels, color histograms, Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG), Local Binary Patterns (LBP), Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM), and wavelet features, on the CIFAKE dataset of real versus synthetic images. Using 50,000 training and 10,000 test samples, we benchmark seven classifiers ranging from Logistic Regression to advanced gradient-boosted ensembles (LightGBM, XGBoost, CatBoost). Results demonstrate that LightGBM consistently outperforms alternatives, achieving PR-AUC 0.9879, ROC-AUC 0.9878, F1 0.9447, and a Brier score of 0.0414 with mixed features, representing strong gains in calibration and discrimination over simpler descriptors. Across three configurations (baseline, advanced, mixed), performance improves monotonically, confirming that combining diverse handcrafted features yields substantial benefit. These findings highlight the continued relevance of carefully engineered features and ensemble learning for detecting synthetic images, particularly in contexts where interpretability and computational efficiency are critical."

We propose a framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to systematically encode human expertise into interpretable, logic-based rules for detecting anomaly patterns in supply chain time series data. Our approach operates in three stages: 1) LLM-based labeling of training data instructed by domain knowledge, 2) automated generation and iterative improvements of symbolic rules through LLM-driven optimization, and 3) rule augmentation with business-relevant anomaly categories supported by LLMs to enhance interpretability. The experiment results showcase that our approach outperforms the unsupervised learning methods in both detection accuracy and interpretability. Furthermore, compared to direct LLM deployment for time series anomaly detection, our approach provides consistent, deterministic results with low computational latency and cost, making it ideal for production deployment. The proposed framework thus demonstrates how LLMs can bridge the gap between scalable automation and expert-driven decision-making in operational settings."

We propose the Global Verifier (GLOVE), a framework that introduces a new design dimension for LLM memory systems by establishing a relative notion of truth. Through active probing to detect inconsistencies between retrieved memories and fresh observations, GLOVE enables memory-environment realignment by verifying and updating memory without access to ground-truth supervision or strong reliance on model introspection. We evaluate GLOVE on diverse benchmarks spanning web navigation, planning, and control, augmented with controlled environmental drifts that introduce non-stationarity beyond the original benchmark settings. Our results show that GLOVE substantially improves agent success rates, suggesting a robust pathway to cognitive agents capable of self-evolving."

As challenges remain in extracting 3D modal features and bridging the gap between different modalities, we propose TIGaussian, a framework that harnesses 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) characteristics to strengthen cross-modality alignment through multi-branch 3DGS tokenizer and modality-specific 3D feature alignment strategies. Specifically, our multi-branch 3DGS tokenizer decouples the intrinsic properties of 3DGS structures into compact latent representations, enabling more generalizable feature extraction. To further bridge the modality gap, we develop a bidirectional cross-modal alignment strategies: a multi-view feature fusion mechanism that leverages diffusion priors to resolve perspective ambiguity in image-3D alignment, while a text-3D projection module adaptively maps 3D features to text embedding space for better text-3D alignment. Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of TIGaussian in multiple tasks."

Specifically, our study evaluates five latest and representative LLM-based methods and two traditional tools using: 1) an in-house benchmark of 222 known real-world vulnerabilities (C/C++ and Java) to assess detection capability, and 2) 24 active open-source projects, where we manually inspected 385 warnings to assess their practical usability and underlying root causes of failures. Our evaluation yields three key findings: First, while LLM-based detectors exhibit low recall on the in-house benchmark, they still uncover more unique vulnerabilities than traditional tools. Second, in open-source projects, both LLM-based and traditional tools generate substantial warnings but suffer from very high false discovery rates, hindering practical use. Our manual analysis further reveals shallow interprocedural reasoning and misidentified source/sink pairs as primary failure causes, with LLM-based tools exhibiting additional unique failures. Finally, LLM-based methods incurs substantial computational costs-hundreds of thousands to hundreds of millions of tokens and multi-hour to multi-day runtimes. Overall, our findings underscore critical limitations in the robustness, reliability, and scalability of current LLM-based detectors. We ultimately summarize a set of implications for future research toward more effective and practical project-scale vulnerability detection."

    "abstract": "Wireless capsule endoscopy (WCE) is fundamentally constrained by limited wireless bandwidth, resulting in low imaging resolution and frame rate, which can cause motion blur and missed lesions. Although adaptive frame-rate schemes have been explored to accommodate transient gastrointestinal (GI) motility, these approaches typically require sacrificing image resolution. The use of higher-frequency communication bands is further limited by increased tissue attenuation. To address these challenges, we propose a hybrid Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and WiFi communication architecture that combines the low-power operation of BLE with the high data throughput of WiFi. We systematically evaluate the performance of BLE and WiFi under tissue-mimicking conditions by measuring throughput, received signal strength indicator (RSSI), and power consumption. The results demonstrate that amplified BLE with an adaptive transmission power control strategy provides a stable frame rate at low power consumption, while 2.4 GHz WiFi operating in station mode is the most suitable high-throughput communication configuration for WCE. Compared with WiFi, BLE reduces power consumption by approximately ten times, whereas WiFi achieves up to ten times higher throughput. To reconcile these complementary trade-offs, we further introduce a hybrid system with a frame-boundary-synchronized switching mechanism to ensure lossless data transmission during BLE and WiFi transitions. Experimental results show that the switching latency from BLE to WiFi is approximately 92.66 ms, which is longer than the WiFi-to-BLE switching latency of 15.49 ms when transmitting 10 kB image payloads. Overall, the proposed hybrid BLE and WiFi system enables robust, lossless, and energy-efficient mode switching, supports adaptive imaging, and advances the development of next-generation autonomous WCE platforms."

By varying the dose of the irradiation, we tune the junction barriers from metallic (SNS) to insulating (SIS) and investigate how this transition affects microwave-driven dynamics. As the barrier transitions from metallic to insulating, the oscillatory response of the Shapiro steps to the RF power changes dramatically. On either side of the metal-insulator transition, the devices exhibit clean integer Shapiro steps without half-integer features, demonstrating that the current--phase relation is dominated by the first harmonic and that the excess current is minimal. The current-voltage response is well-described by the resistively, capacitively shunted junction model assuming a single-harmonic current--phase relation. This behavior indicates well-controlled junction properties suitable for a wide range of superconducting electronics, including detectors, mixers, and high-density integrated circuits."

However, due to differences in representation and ren dering pipelines, existing studies render meshes and 3DGS separately, making it difficult to accurately handle occlusions and transparency. Moreover, the deformed 3DGS still suffers from visual artifacts due to the sensitivity to the topology quality of the proxy mesh. These issues pose serious obsta cles to the joint use of 3DGS and meshes, making it diffi cult to adapt 3DGS to conventional mesh-oriented graphics pipelines. We propose UniMGS, the first unified framework for rasterizing mesh and 3DGS in a single-pass anti-aliased manner, with a novel binding strategy for 3DGS deformation based on proxy mesh. Our key insight is to blend the col ors of both triangle and Gaussian fragments by anti-aliased α-blending in a single pass, achieving visually coherent re sults with precise handling of occlusion and transparency. To improve the visual appearance of the deformed 3DGS, our Gaussian-centric binding strategy employs a proxy mesh and spatially associates Gaussians with the mesh faces, signifi cantly reducing rendering artifacts. With these two compo nents, UniMGS enables the visualization and manipulation of 3D objects represented by mesh or 3DGS within a unified framework, opening up new possibilities in embodied AI, vir tual reality, and gaming. We will release our source code to facilitate future research."

    "abstract": "This study reveals a previously unexplored vulnerability in the safety alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs). Existing aligned LLMs predominantly respond to unsafe queries with refusals, which often begin with a fixed set of prefixes (I'm sorry). We demonstrate that this rigid refusal pattern is a vulnerability and introduce a novel \\textbf{refusal unlearning} technique that exploits it. Specifically, we fine-tune LLMs using merely 1,000 benign samples, where each response is prepended with a refusal prefix. The underlying intuition is to disrupt the refusal completion pathway, thereby driving the model to forget how to refuse while following harmful instructions. This intuition is further supported by theoretical proofs. We apply this approach to a total of 16 LLMs, including various open-source models from Llama, Qwen, and Gemma families, as well as closed-source models such as Gemini and GPT. Experimental results show that the safety scores of previously aligned LLMs degrade both consistently and substantially. Importantly, we verify that the observed gain cannot be attributed to plain fine-tuning or random prefix effects. Our findings suggest that current safety alignment may rely heavily on token sequence memorization rather than reasoning, motivating future work beyond simple refusal mechanisms.

This article tackles this geometric bottleneck by integrating movable antenna systems (MAS) at the transceiver side. MAS provides real-time, controllable spatial degrees of freedom through sub-wavelength antenna repositioning, enabling active reconfiguration of the cascaded channel without modifying passive tags or consuming additional spectrum. We position this solution within a unified ISAC-backscatter communication-B-ISAC evolution, describe the resulting MAS-assisted B-ISAC architecture and operating principles, and demonstrate its system-level gains through comparative analysis and numerical results. Finally, we showcase the potential of this geometry-adaptive paradigm across key IoT application scenarios, pointing toward future motion-aware wireless networks."

A key open question is how long coherence can be extended under this strategy and what fundamental limits constrain it. Here we introduce a fully parameterized, multi-objective periodic-flux modulation framework that simultaneously optimizes energy relaxation $T_1$ and pure dephasing $T_φ$, thereby quantifying the tradeoff between them. For fluxonium qubits with realistic noise spectra, our method enhances $T_φ$ by a factor of 3-5 compared with existing DSS strategies while maintaining $T_1$ in the hundred-microsecond range. We further prove that, although DSSs eliminate first-order sensitivity to low-frequency noise, relaxation rate cannot be reduced arbitrarily close to zero, establishing an upper bound on achievable $T_1$. At the optimized working points, we identify double-DSS regions that are insensitive to both DC and AC flux, providing robust operating bands for experiments. As applications, we design single- and two-qubit control protocols at these operating points and numerically demonstrate high-fidelity gate operations. These results establish a general and useful framework for Pareto-front engineering of DSSs that substantially improves coherence and gate performance in superconducting qubits."

    "abstract": "Refactoring tools are central to modern development, with extract-function refactorings used heavily in day-to-day work. For Rust, however, ownership, borrowing, and advanced type features make automated extract-function refactoring challenging. Existing tools either rely on slow compiler-based analysis, support only restricted language fragments, or provide little assurance beyond \"it still compiles.\" This paper presents REM2.0, a new extract-function and verification toolchain for Rust. REM2.0 works atop rust-analyzer as a persistent daemon, providing low-latency refactorings with a VSCode front-end. It adds a repairer that automatically adjusts lifetimes and signatures when extraction exposes borrow-checker issues, and an optional verification pipeline connecting to CHARON and AENEAS to generate Coq equivalence proofs for a supported Rust subset. The architecture is evaluated on three benchmark suites. On the original REM artefact, REM2.0 achieves 100% compatibility while reducing latency from ~1000ms to single-digit milliseconds in the daemon. On 40 feature-focused extractions from 20 highly starred GitHub repositories, REM2.0 handles most examples involving async/await, const fn, non-local control flow, generics, and higher-ranked trait bounds. On twenty verification benchmarks, the CHARON/AENEAS pipeline constructs end-to-end equivalence proofs for cases within its current subset. Overall, results show that a rust-analyzer-based design can provide fast, feature-rich extract-function refactoring for real Rust programs, while opt-in verification delivers machine-checked behaviour preservation."

In the context of a research project where a digital marketplace is developed and digital solutions should be analyzed, we used different LLMs to analyze the quality of architecture documents and compared the results with evaluations from software architects. We found out that the quality of the artifact has a strong influence on the quality of the LLM, i.e., the better the quality of the architecture document was, the more consistent were the LLM-based evaluation and the human expert evaluation.

Within this framework, we define ENL bialgebras and establish the associated notions of matched pairs, Manin triples, and Drinfel'd doubles. We show that coboundary ENL bialgebras are characterized by EN $r$-matrices satisfying an equivariant classical Yang-Baxter equation. We further introduce EN-relative Rota-Baxter operators and prove that they provide an operator-theoretic realization of such $r$-matrices, leading to descendent ENL algebras and to solutions of the classical Yang--Baxter equation on semidirect ENL algebras. In the quadratic case, this construction reduces to Rota-Baxter operators of weight zero. Finally, we extend the EN framework to pre-Lie algebras and show that pre-ENL algebras naturally induce associated ENL structures."

We present SharpNet, a modified MLP architecture capable of encoding functions with user-defined sharp features by enriching the network with an auxiliary feature function, which is defined as the solution to a Poisson equation with jump Neumann boundary conditions. It is evaluated via an efficient local integral that is fully differentiable with respect to the feature locations, enabling our method to jointly optimize both the feature locations and the MLP parameters to recover the target functions/models. The $C^0$-continuity of SharpNet is precisely controllable, ensuring $C^0$-continuity at the feature locations and smoothness elsewhere. We validate SharpNet on 2D problems and 3D CAD model reconstruction, and compare it against several state-of-the-art baselines. In both types of tasks, SharpNet accurately recovers sharp edges and corners while maintaining smooth behavior away from those features, whereas existing methods tend to smooth out gradient discontinuities. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations highlight the benefits of our approach."

    "abstract": "Ambitious decarbonisation targets are catalysing growth in orders of new offshore wind farms. For these newly commissioned plants to run, accurate power forecasts are needed from the onset. These allow grid stability, good reserve management and efficient energy trading. Despite machine learning models having strong performances, they tend to require large volumes of site-specific data that new farms do not yet have. To overcome this data scarcity, we propose a novel transfer learning framework that clusters power output according to covariate meteorological features. Rather than training a single, general-purpose model, we thus forecast with an ensemble of expert models, each trained on a cluster. As these pre-trained models each specialise in a distinct weather pattern, they adapt efficiently to new sites and capture transferable, climate-dependent dynamics. Through the expert models' built-in calibration to seasonal and meteorological variability, we remove the industry-standard requirement of local measurements over a year. Our contributions are two-fold - we propose this novel framework and comprehensively evaluate it on eight offshore wind farms, achieving accurate cross-domain forecasting with under five months of site-specific data. Our experiments achieve a MAE of 3.52\\%, providing empirical verification that reliable forecasts do not require a full annual cycle. Beyond power forecasting, this climate-aware transfer learning method opens new opportunities for offshore wind applications such as early-stage wind resource assessment, where reducing data requirements can significantly accelerate project development whilst effectively mitigating its inherent risks."

However, when federated LLMs are deployed in critical applications, it remains unclear which client(s) contributed to specific generated responses, hindering debugging, malicious client identification, fair reward allocation, and trust verification. We present ProToken, a novel Provenance methodology for Token-level attribution in federated LLMs that addresses client attribution during autoregressive text generation while maintaining FL privacy constraints. ProToken leverages two key insights to enable provenance at each token: (1) transformer architectures concentrate task-specific signals in later blocks, enabling strategic layer selection for computational tractability, and (2) gradient-based relevance weighting filters out irrelevant neural activations, focusing attribution on neurons that directly influence token generation. We evaluate ProToken across 16 configurations spanning four LLM architectures (Gemma, Llama, Qwen, SmolLM) and four domains (medical, financial, mathematical, coding). ProToken achieves 98% average attribution accuracy in correctly localizing responsible client(s), and maintains high accuracy when the number of clients are scaled, validating its practical viability for real-world deployment settings."

    "abstract": "Precise knowledge of resonator dispersion, from both geometric and material contributions, is essential for reliable high-performance nonlinear integrated photonics devices, such as optical parametric oscillators, frequency doublers, and integrated optical frequency combs. However, direct measurements at the fabrication level provide limited knowledge, whether through destructive cross-section imaging or non-destructive ellipsometry, while complete optical characterization that enables precise dispersion metrology is time-consuming and poorly suited for mass-scale foundry fabrication. In this work, we develop a machine learning framework to solve three complementary problems: (i) predicting resonator geometric dimensions, (ii) identifying the correct material dispersion, and last, but not least, (iii) precisely reconstructing the integrated dispersion spectrum directly from ring dimensions. These three neural networks together enable both inverse and forward characterization of microring resonators. Using numerically generated datasets based on Sellmeier-type material models, we demonstrate <1 nm ring dimension prediction accuracy without noise, <8 nm prediction accuracy with ~45 dispersion samples under a realistic frequency measurement noise level (50 MHz), and ~16 nm prediction accuracy at a higher noise level (200 MHz). The Sellmeier model classification exceeds 99% accuracy in all cases. Importantly, dispersion sampled far from the pump resonances proves most informative, reducing full-spectrum characterization requirements. The forward-prediction network reconstructs dispersion spectra from the ring dimensions with high accuracy. Our results highlight the potential of machine learning applied to dispersion data as a rapid, non-destructive tool for wafer-scale quality control and process monitoring in photonic foundries."

    "abstract": "Within heterogeneous treatment effect (HTE) analysis, various estimands have been proposed to capture the effect of a treatment conditional on covariates. Recently, the conditional quantile comparator (CQC) has emerged as a promising estimand, offering quantile-level summaries akin to the conditional quantile treatment effect (CQTE) while preserving some interpretability of the conditional average treatment effect (CATE). It achieves this by summarising the treated response conditional on both the covariates and the untreated response. Despite these desirable properties, the CQC's current estimation is limited by the need to first estimate the difference in conditional cumulative distribution functions and then invert it. This inversion obscures the CQC estimate, hampering our ability to both model and interpret it. To address this, we propose the first direct estimator of the CQC, allowing for explicit modelling and parameterisation. This explicit parameterisation enables better interpretation of our estimate while also providing a means to constrain and inform the model. We show, both theoretically and empirically, that our estimation error depends directly on the complexity of the CQC itself, improving upon the existing estimation procedure. Furthermore, it retains the desirable double robustness property with respect to nuisance parameter estimation. We further show our method to outperform existing procedures in estimation accuracy across multiple data scenarios while varying sample size and nuisance error. Finally, we apply it to real-world data from an employment scheme, uncovering a reduced range of potential earnings improvement as participant age increases."

We find evidence that this divergence may reflect genuine heterogeneity in the euro's trade effect across country pairs rather than methodological differences alone. Using Eurostat data on 15 EU countries from 1995-2015, we estimate that euro adoption increased bilateral trade by 24% on average (15.0% after fixed effects correction), but effects range from -12% to +68% across eurozone pairs. Core eurozone pairs (e.g., Germany-France, Germany-Netherlands) show large gains, while peripheral pairs involving Finland, Greece, and Portugal saw smaller or negative effects, with some negative estimates statistically significant and interpretable as trade diversion. Pre-euro trade intensity and GDP explain over 90% of this variation. Extending to EU28, we find evidence that crisis-era adopters (Slovakia, Estonia, Latvia) pull down naive estimates to 5%, but accounting for fixed effects recovers estimates of 14.0%, consistent with the EU15 fixed-effects baseline of 15.0%. Illustrative counterfactual analysis suggests non-eurozone members would have experienced varied effects: UK (+24%), Sweden (+20%), Denmark (+19%). The wide range of prior estimates appears to be largely a feature of the data, not a bug in the methods."

Despite these advantages, there is a critical instability in DLMs: the moving sink phenomenon. Our analysis indicates that sink tokens exhibit low-norm representations in the Transformer's value space, and that the moving sink phenomenon serves as a protective mechanism in DLMs to prevent excessive information mixing. However, their unpredictable positions across diffusion steps undermine inference robustness. To resolve this, we propose a simple but effective extra sink token implemented via a modified attention mask. Specifically, we introduce a special token constrained to attend solely to itself, while remaining globally visible to all other tokens. Experimental results demonstrate that introducing a single extra token stabilizes attention sinks, substantially improving model performance. Crucially, further analysis confirms that the effectiveness of this token is independent of its position and characterized by negligible semantic content, validating its role as a robust and dedicated structural sink."

When this link is missing, partially or completely, classical estimation methods fail in recovering the true regression function. Deconvolution approaches have been proposed and studied in detail in the unmatched setting where the predictive variables and responses are allowed to be independent. In this work, we consider linear regression in a semi-supervised learning setting where, beside a small sample of matched data, we have access to a relatively large unmatched sample. Using maximum likelihood estimation, we show that under some mild assumptions the semi-supervised learning empirical maximum likelihood estimator (SSLEMLE) is asymptotically normal and give explicitly its asymptotic covariance matrix as a function of the ratio of the matched/unmatched sample sizes and other parameters. Furthermore, we quantify the statistical gain achieved by having the additional large unmatched sample over having only the small matched sample. To illustrate the theory, we present the results of an extensive simulation study and apply our methodology to the \"combined cycle power plant\" data set."

We give examples of certain bisimulation-invariant queries in NP, resp. PSPACE, and characterise their membership in P in terms of relative non-regularity of particular families of tree languages. A proof of non-regularity for all members of one such family would separate the corresponding class from P, but the combinatorial complexity involved in it is high. On the plus side, the step into the bisimulation-invariant world alleviates the order-problem that other approaches in descriptive complexity suffer from when studying the relationship between P and classes above."

However, existing object-centric perception paradigms and loosely coupled vision-language pipelines are still difficult to support management-oriented anomaly understanding required in real-world urban governance. To bridge this gap, we introduce GovLA-10K, the first management-oriented multi-modal benchmark for low-altitude intelligence, along with GovLA-Reasoner, a unified vision-language reasoning framework tailored for governance-aware aerial perception. Unlike existing studies that aim to exhaustively annotate all visible objects, GovLA-10K is deliberately designed around functionally salient targets that directly correspond to practical management needs, and further provides actionable management suggestions grounded in these observations. To effectively coordinate the fine-grained visual grounding with high-level contextual language reasoning, GovLA-Reasoner introduces an efficient feature adapter that implicitly coordinates discriminative representation sharing between the visual detector and the large language model (LLM). Extensive experiments show that our method significantly improves performance while avoiding the need of fine-tuning for any task-specific individual components. We believe our work offers a new perspective and foundation for future studies on management-aware low-altitude vision-language systems."

We apply AutoRegressive with eXogenous inputs (ARX)-based predictive control and its Transient Predictive Control (TPC) variant, and compare them with Data-enabled Predictive Control (DeePC) and two standard model-based controllers. The methods are evaluated in simulation on a system exhibiting both inter-area and local oscillation modes. ARX-based predictive control and DeePC both achieve effective damping, while the ARX-based methods require less online computation. Using warm-started, pre-factorized operator-splitting solvers, ARX/TPC control actions are computed in less than 1ms.

To address this gap, we propose Action-Context-aware Adaptive Computation for VLA models (AC^2-VLA), a unified framework that conditions computation on current visual observations, language instructions, and previous action states. Based on this action-centric context, AC^2-VLA adaptively performs cognition reuse across timesteps, token pruning, and selective execution of model components within a unified mechanism. To train the adaptive policy, we introduce an action-guided self-distillation scheme that preserves the behavior of the dense VLA policy while enabling structured sparsification that transfers across tasks and settings. Extensive experiments on robotic manipulation benchmarks show that AC^2-VLA achieves up to a 1.79\\times speedup while reducing FLOPs to 29.4% of the dense baseline, with comparable task success."

While mechanical modulation provides a potential solution, current implementations generally lack inherent state-locking capability, rendering them vulnerable to environmental disturbances and actuation errors. Inspired by the concept of mechanical bits (MBs), this paper presents a self-locking non-volatile coding metasurface platform enabled by Kresling origami-based MBs, where the continuous mechanical deformation of individual meta-atoms is discretized into robust binary geometric states protected by intrinsic energy barriers. The bistable states are strictly mapped to 1-bit EM coding phases via tailored metallic patterns integrated onto a multimaterial 3D printed Kresling origami array. Building upon this concept, both transmission- and reflection-type prototypes are proposed and experimentally demonstrated, exhibiting exceptional wavefront manipulation capabilities through near-field holographic imaging and far-field beam steering. In addition, the lightweight origami unit (1.5 g) exhibits an exceptional load-bearing capacity, supporting over 100 times its own weight. These results bridge mechanical logic with EM information processing, establishing a universal physical paradigm for constructing low-power, highly robust coding metasurfaces resilient to extreme environments."

By establishing value and gradient consistency in the large-batch limit, we bridge the stochastic objective to explicit deterministic energy landscapes, uncovering a fundamental geometric bifurcation between the unimodal and multimodal regimes. In the unimodal setting, the intrinsic landscape is strictly convex with a unique Gibbs equilibrium; here, entropy acts merely as a tie-breaker, clarifying \"uniformity\" as a constrained expansion within the alignment basin. In contrast, the symmetric multimodal objective contains a persistent negative symmetric divergence term that remains even after kernel sharpening. We show that this term induces barrier-driven co-adaptation, enforcing a population-level modality gap as a structural geometric necessity rather than an initialization artifact. Our results shift the analytical lens from pointwise discrimination to population geometry, offering a principled basis for diagnosing and controlling distributional misalignment."

By correlating these localized latent trajectories with injected toxin units, we learn a predictive dose-response model. We rigorously compare two approaches: direct metric regression versus image-based generative simulation on a clinical dataset of N=360 images from 46 patients. On a hold-out test set, our framework demonstrates moderate-to-strong structural correlations for geometric asymmetry metrics, confirming that the generative model correctly captures the direction of morphological changes.

Across measured devices we obtain sub-microsecond energy relaxation ($T_1$ from $0.08$ to $0.69~μ$s), while Ramsey measurements indicate dephasing faster than our $16$ ns time resolution. We also find a pronounced discrepancy between the Josephson energy inferred from spectroscopy and that expected from the Ambegaokar--Baratoff relation using room-temperature junction resistances, pointing to nontrivial junction physics in the hybrid Al/AlO$_x$/4Hb-TaS$_2$ system. Although we do not resolve material-specific subgap modes in the present geometry, this work establishes a practical route to integrating 4Hb-TaS$_2$ into coherent quantum circuits and provides a baseline for future edge-sensitive designs aimed at enhancing coupling to boundary and subgap degrees of freedom in vdW superconductors."

Initial results suggest that researchers struggle with anonymization, partly due to a lack of clear, actionable guidance. In this work, we propose simulating re-identification attacks using the approach of red teaming versus blue teaming: a technique commonly employed in security testing, where one team tries to re-identify data, and the other team tries to prevent it. We discuss our experience applying this method to data collected in a mixed-methods study in human-centered privacy. We present usable materials for researchers to apply red teaming when anonymizing and publishing their studies' data."

Meanwhile, monolithic execution at the edge remains infeasible under stringent resource limits and uncertain network dynamics. To bridge this gap, we propose a microservice-based FM inference framework that exploits the intrinsic functional asymmetry between heavyweight core services and agile light services. Our two-tier deployment strategy ensures robust Quality of Service (QoS) under resource contention. Specifically, core services are placed statically via a long-term network-aware integer program with sparsity constraints to form a fault-tolerant backbone. On the other hand, light services are orchestrated dynamically by a low-complexity online controller that integrates effective capacity theory with Lyapunov optimization, providing probabilistic latency guarantees under real-time workload fluctuations. Simulations demonstrate that our framework achieves over 84% average on-time task completion with moderate deployment costs and maintains strong robustness as the system load scales."

    "abstract": "Altermagnetism (AM), a collinear magnetic phase with momentum-dependent spin splitting, is a promising candidate for strong magnetoelectric coupling. However, realizing direct and tunable coupling between ferroelectricity (FE) and AM within a single two-dimensional (2D) material remains an outstanding challenge. Here, based on first-principles calculations, we identify the distorted phase of monolayer Janus VOClBr as an intrinsic 2D FE-AM. This phase demonstrates robust magnetoelectric coupling, as evidenced by a complete reversal of momentum-space spin polarization upon FE switching, and further supported by spin texture analysis and the magneto-optical Kerr effect. Notably, the FE properties are highly strain-tunable: biaxial compression strain of -4% reduces the FE polarization switching barrier by approximately 87%, whereas a tensile strain of +3% induces a phase transition to an antiferromagnet. Leveraging the lock-in between the electrically controlled spin texture and the magneto-optical Kerr effect signal, we propose a non-volatile, polymorphic spintronic memory device featuring all-electrical writing and optical readout. This work establishes 2D FE-AMs as a versatile platform for coupled ferroic orders and paves the way for voltage-controlled, multifunctional spin-logic devices."

However, realizing a single material system where these quantum states can be independently and reversibly manipulated by distinct stimuli, a prerequisite for multifunctional devices, has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate a dual-switch mechanism in bilayer VS2, a room-temperature FE-AFM system, that enables electrical and magnetic control of a layer-locked anomalous valley Hall effect (AVHE). First-principles calculations reveal that interlayer sliding breaks spatial inversion symmetry, inducing a switchable out-of-plane FE polarization that coexists with interlayer AFM. The spin-orbit coupled valley polarization can be reversibly switched either by FE polarization reversal or by a magnetic-field-induced spin-flip transition, confirming the existence of electrically and magnetically addressable valley states. The Berry curvature exhibits both valley-contrasting and layer-locked characteristics, which underpin a switchable Hall response. Notably, electric and magnetic switching are functionally equivalent in modulating valley, layer, and spin indices, revealing strong magnetoelectric coupling. This work establishes a multidegree-of-freedom operational paradigm in 2D multiferroics and opens a viable design pathway toward multi-state memory and spin-valleytronic logic devices."

We address this limitation by formulating a structural requirement for state-space model's scale-consistent latent dynamics across iterative refinement, and derive Fractal of Stationary Transformations (FROST), which enforces a self-similar representation manifold through a fractal inductive bias. Under this geometry, intermediate states correspond to different resolutions of a shared representation, and we provide a geometric analysis establishing contraction and stable convergence across iterations. As a consequence of this scale-consistent structure, halting naturally admits a ranking-based formulation driven by intrinsic feature quality rather than extrinsic objectives. Controlled experiments on ImageNet-100 empirically verify the predicted scale-consistent behavior, showing that adaptive efficiency emerges from the aligned latent geometry."

In this work, we investigate the impact of antikaon condensates on the radial oscillation properties of neutron stars. For this purpose, we model neutron star matter using equations of state with a wide range of stiffness. Both non--linear and density--dependent relativistic mean--field frameworks are employed to develop equations of state that are consistent with current astrophysical constraints. We further consider the emergence of antikaon condensates ($K^-$ and $\\bar{K}^0$) in the stellar core, which modifies the pressure--energy density relation of dense matter. We find that the nature of the transition from nuclear matter to the condensed phase is sensitive to the antikaon optical potential depth. We compute the fundamental and higher--order radial oscillation modes for neutron stars containing antikaon condensates over a range of antikaon optical potential depths. Our results demonstrate that the antikaon optical potential depth plays a decisive role in governing the systematic shifts observed in the radial oscillation frequencies, while also significantly reducing the stability limits and maximum masses of neutron stars. These imprints of antikaon condensation on radial oscillation spectra provide a promising avenue for future multi--messenger observations and high--frequency gravitational--wave searches to directly probe and constrain the internal composition and equation of state of neutron stars."

In this framework, Catmull-Rom splines are utilized to characterize lane lines, and all the other ground markings are depicted using polygons uniformly. The results from instance segmentation serve as references to refine the three-dimensional position of spline control points and polygon corner points. In conjunction with this process, the homography matrix of IPM and vehicle poses are optimized simultaneously. Our proposed framework significantly reduces the mapping errors associated with IPM. It also improves the accuracy of the initial IPM homography matrix and the predicted vehicle poses. Furthermore, it addresses the limitations imposed by the coplanarity assumption in IPM. These enhancements enable IPM to be effectively applied to vectorized road mapping, which serves a cost-effective solution with enhanced accuracy. In addition, our framework generalizes road map elements to include all common ground markings and lane lines. The proposed framework is evaluated in two different practical scenarios, and the test results show that our method can automatically generate high-precision maps with near-centimeter-level accuracy. Importantly, the optimized IPM matrix achieves an accuracy comparable to that of manual calibration, while the accuracy of vehicle poses is also significantly improved."

The limitations of existing utility-driven retrieval approaches for RAG are that, firstly, they are resource-intensive typically requiring query encoding, and that secondly, they do not involve listwise ranking loss during training. The latter limitation is particularly critical, as the relative order between documents directly affects generation in RAG. To address this gap, we propose Lightweight Utility-driven Reranking for Efficient RAG (LURE-RAG), a framework that augments any black-box retriever with an efficient LambdaMART-based reranker. Unlike prior methods, LURE-RAG trains the reranker with a listwise ranking loss guided by LLM utility, thereby directly optimizing the ordering of retrieved documents. Experiments on two standard datasets demonstrate that LURE-RAG achieves competitive performance, reaching 97-98% of the state-of-the-art dense neural baseline, while remaining efficient in both training and inference. Moreover, its dense variant, UR-RAG, significantly outperforms the best existing baseline by up to 3%."

    "abstract": "Predicting the status of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) from objective, non-invasive methods is an active research field. Yet, extracting automatically objective, interpretable features for a detailed analysis of the patient state remains largely unexplored. Among MDD's symptoms, Psychomotor retardation (PMR) is a core item, yet its clinical assessment remains largely subjective. While 3D motion capture offers an objective alternative, its reliance on specialized hardware often precludes routine clinical use. In this paper, we propose a non-invasive computational framework that transforms monocular RGB video into clinically relevant 3D gait kinematics. Our pipeline uses Gravity-View Coordinates along with a novel trajectory-correction algorithm that leverages the closed-loop topology of our adapted Timed Up and Go (TUG) protocol to mitigate monocular depth errors. This novel pipeline enables the extraction of 297 explicit gait biomechanical biomarkers from a single camera capture. To address the challenges of small clinical datasets, we introduce a stability-based machine learning framework that identifies robust motor signatures while preventing overfitting. Validated on the CALYPSO dataset, our method achieves an 83.3% accuracy in detecting PMR and explains 64% of the variance in overall depression severity (R^2=0.64). Notably, our study reveals a strong link between reduced ankle propulsion and restricted pelvic mobility to the depressive motor phenotype. These results demonstrate that physical movement serves as a robust proxy for the cognitive state, offering a transparent and scalable tool for the objective monitoring of depression in standard clinical environments."

The home presents a highly challenging privacy context due to the high density of sensitive objects, and the frequent presence of non-consenting family members, and the intimate nature of daily routines, making it a critical focus area for scalable privacy control mechanisms. Existing fine-grained controls, while offering nuanced choices, are inefficient for managing multiple private objects. We propose VisGuardian, a fine-grained content-based visual permission technique for AR glasses. VisGuardian features a group-based control mechanism that enables users to efficiently manage permissions for multiple private objects. VisGuardian detects objects using YOLO and adopts a pre-classified schema to group them. By selecting a single object, users can efficiently obscure groups of related objects based on criteria including privacy sensitivity, object category, or spatial proximity. A technical evaluation shows VisGuardian achieves mAP50 of 0.6704 with only 14.0 ms latency and a 1.7% increase in battery consumption per hour. Furthermore, a user study (N=24) comparing VisGuardian to slider-based and object-based baselines found it to be significantly faster for setting permissions and was preferred by users for its efficiency, effectiveness, and ease of use."

As many social systems may change internally over time, calibration naturally becomes an online task, requiring parameters to be updated continuously to maintain the simulator's fidelity. In this work, the online setting is first formulated as a dynamic optimization problem (DOP), requiring the search for a sequence of optimal parameters that fit the simulator to real system changes. However, in contrast to traditional DOP formulations, online calibration explicitly incorporates the observational data as the driver of environmental dynamics. Due to this fundamental difference, existing Evolutionary Dynamic Optimization (EDO) methods, despite being extensively studied for black-box DOPs, are ill-equipped to handle such a scenario. As a result, online calibration problems constitute a new set of challenging DOPs. Here, we propose to explicitly learn the posterior distributions of the parameters and the observational data, thereby facilitating both change detection and environmental adaptation of existing EDOs for this scenario. We thus present a pretrained posterior model for implementation, and fine-tune it during the optimization. Extensive tests on both economic and financial simulators verify that the posterior distribution strongly promotes EDOs in such DOPs widely existed in social science."

Mamba is efficient but struggles with local details and nonlinear patterns. Conformer's self-attention incurs high memory overhead for long speech sequences and may cause instability in long-range dependency modeling. These limitations are critical for diarization, which requires both precise modeling of local variations and robust speaker consistency over extended spans. To address these challenges, we first apply ConBiMamba for speaker diarization. We follow the Pyannote pipeline and propose the Dual-Strategy-Enhanced ConBiMamba neural speaker diarization system. ConBiMamba integrates the strengths of Conformer and Mamba, where Conformer's convolutional and feed-forward structures are utilized to improve local feature extraction. By replacing Conformer's self-attention with ExtBiMamba, ConBiMamba efficiently handles long audio sequences while alleviating the high memory cost of self-attention. Furthermore, to address the problem of the higher DER around speaker change points, we introduce the Boundary-Enhanced Transition Loss to enhance the detection of speaker change points. We also propose Layer-wise Feature Aggregation to enhance the utilization of multi-layer representations.

Each agent corresponds to a state in the hyper automaton, and runs a small rule-based sub-automaton for reliable micro-control.

To supervise the hyper agent's transition policy, we build transition-trajectory trees and transform to memory-to-next-state pairs, forming the MATA-SFT-90K dataset for supervised finetuning (SFT). The finetuned LLM as the transition policy understands the query and the capacity of agents, and it can efficiently choose the optimal agent to solve the task.

We introduce \\framework{} (\\textbf{H}uman-centered \\textbf{E}valuation for \\textbf{L}LM-powered reco\\textbf{M}menders), a comprehensive evaluation framework that systematically assesses LLM-powered recommender systems across five human-centered dimensions: \\textit{Intent Alignment}, \\textit{Explanation Quality}, \\textit{Interaction Naturalness}, \\textit{Trust \\& Transparency}, and \\textit{Fairness \\& Diversity}. Through extensive experiments involving three state-of-the-art LLM-based recommenders (GPT-4, LLaMA-3.1, and P5) across three domains (movies, books, and restaurants), and rigorous evaluation by 12 domain experts using 847 recommendation scenarios, we demonstrate that \\framework{} reveals critical quality dimensions invisible to traditional metrics. Our results show that while GPT-4 achieves superior explanation quality (4.21/5.0) and interaction naturalness (4.35/5.0), it exhibits a significant popularity bias (Gini coefficient 0.73) compared to traditional collaborative filtering (0.58). We release \\framework{} as an open-source toolkit to advance human-centered evaluation practices in the recommender systems community."

    "abstract": "Speaker-attributed automatic speech recognition (ASR) in multi-speaker environments remains a major challenge. While some approaches achieve strong performance when fine-tuned on specific domains, few systems generalize well across out-of-domain datasets. Our prior work, Diarization-Conditioned Whisper (DiCoW), leverages speaker diarization outputs as conditioning information and, with minimal fine-tuning, demonstrated strong multilingual and multi-domain performance. In this paper, we address a key limitation of DiCoW: ambiguity in Silence-Target-Non-target-Overlap (STNO) masks, where two or more fully overlapping speakers may have nearly identical conditioning despite differing transcriptions. We introduce SE-DiCoW (Self-Enrolled Diarization-Conditioned Whisper), which uses diarization output to locate an enrollment segment anywhere in the conversation where the target speaker is most active. This enrollment segment is used as fixed conditioning via cross-attention at each encoder layer. We further refine DiCoW with improved data segmentation, model initialization, and augmentation. Together, these advances yield substantial gains: SE-DiCoW reduces macro-averaged tcpWER by 52.4% relative to the original DiCoW on the EMMA MT-ASR benchmark."

    "abstract": "The nonlinear Schrödinger equation (NLSE) is a fundamental model that describes diverse complex phenomena in nature. However, simulating the NLSE on a quantum computer is inherently challenging due to the presence of the nonlinear term. We propose a hybrid quantum-classical framework for simulating the NLSE based on the split-step Fourier method. During the linear propagation step, we apply the kinetic evolution operator to generate an intermediate quantum state. Subsequently, the Hadamard test is employed to measure the Fourier components of low-wavenumber modes, enabling the efficient reconstruction of nonlinear potentials. The phase transformation corresponding to the reconstructed potential is then implemented via a quantum circuit using the phase kickback technique. To validate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm, we numerically simulate the evolution of a Gaussian wave packet, a soliton wave, and the wake flow past a cylinder. The simulation results demonstrate excellent agreement with the corresponding classical solutions. This work provide a concrete basis for analyzing accuracy-cost trade-offs in quantum-classical simulations of nonlinear dispersive wave dynamics."

To address this, we introduce SNR-Edit, a training-free framework achieving faithful Latent Trajectory Correction via adaptive noise control. Mechanistically, SNR-Edit uses structure-aware noise rectification to inject segmentation constraints into the initial noise, anchoring the stochastic component of the source trajectory to the real image's implicit inversion position and reducing trajectory drift during source--target transport. This lightweight modification yields smoother latent trajectories and ensures high-fidelity structural preservation without requiring model tuning or inversion. Across SD3 and FLUX, evaluations on PIE-Bench and SNR-Bench show that SNR-Edit delivers performance on pixel-level metrics and VLM-based scoring, while adding only about 1s overhead per image."

    "abstract": "Sequential recommendation models are widely used in applications, yet they face stringent latency requirements. Mainstream models leverage the Transformer attention mechanism to improve performance, but its computational complexity grows with the sequence length, leading to a latency challenge for long sequences. Consequently, KV cache technology has recently been explored in sequential recommendation systems to reduce inference latency. However, KV cache introduces substantial storage overhead in sequential recommendation systems, which often have a large user base with potentially very long user history sequences. In this work, we observe that KV sequences across different users exhibit significant similarities, indicating the existence of collaborative signals in KV. Furthermore, we analyze the KV using singular value decomposition (SVD) and find that the information in KV can be divided into two parts: the majority of the information is shareable across users, while a small portion is user-specific. Motivated by this, we propose CollectiveKV, a cross-user KV sharing mechanism. It captures the information shared across users through a learnable global KV pool. During inference, each user retrieves high-dimensional shared KV from the pool and concatenates them with low-dimensional user-specific KV to obtain the final KV. Experiments on five sequential recommendation models and three datasets show that our method can compress the KV cache to only 0.8% of its original size, while maintaining or even enhancing model performance."

In this work, we propose a new benchmarking framework for data lakes that aims to provide an objective and comparative evaluation of different data lake implementations. Our benchmark covers multiple data types and workload models, including data retrieval, aggregation, querying, and similarity search, which is a common yet underexplored operation in existing benchmarks. We measure key performance metrics such as query execution time, metadata generation time, and metadata size across different scale factors. The benchmark is designed to be extensible and reproducible, enabling users to generate datasets and evaluate data lake systems under realistic and diverse scenarios. We conduct our experiments on CloudLab and demonstrate how the proposed benchmark can be used to compare both commercial and open-source data lake platforms."

We further analyze this constant factor and prove that it converges to 1 doubly exponentially in $q$ and improves with the degree of the polynomial used in Newton-Schulz for approximating the orthogonalization direction. We also prove that Muon removes the typical square-root-of-rank loss compared to its vector-based counterpart, SGD with momentum. Our results explain why Muon with a few low-degree Newton-Schulz steps matches exact-polar (SVD) behavior at a much faster wall-clock time and explain how much momentum matrix orthogonalization via Newton-Schulz benefits over the vector-based optimizer. Overall, our theory justifies the practical Newton-Schulz design of Muon, narrowing its practice-theory gap."

We revisit the privacy blanket bound of Balle et al. (the blanket divergence) and develop an asymptotic analysis that applies to a broad class of local randomizers under mild regularity assumptions, without requiring pure local DP. Our key finding is that the leading term of the blanket divergence depends on the local mechanism only through a single scalar parameter $χ$, which we call the shuffle index. By applying this asymptotic analysis to both upper and lower bounds, we obtain a tight band for $δ_n$ in the shuffled mechanism's $(\\varepsilon_n,δ_n)$-DP guarantee. Moreover, we derive a simple structural necessary and sufficient condition on the local randomizer under which the blanket-divergence-based upper and lower bounds coincide asymptotically. $k$-RR families with $k\\ge3$ satisfy this condition, while for generalized Gaussian mechanisms the condition may not hold but the resulting band remains tight. Finally, we complement the asymptotic theory with an FFT-based algorithm for computing the blanket divergence at finite $n$, which offers rigorously controlled relative error and near-linear running time in $n$, providing a practical numerical analysis for shuffle DP."

Collapsing false-vacuum regions first form thermal balls, which subsequently cool via dissipative interactions and stabilize into long-lived Q-balls with nonzero spin. We observe a large population of low-mass Q-balls, as well as rare, massive Q-balls that are several times larger than the analytical prediction. The final Q-ball population exhibits a broad mass spectrum spanning over two orders of magnitude, characterized by an exponential tail of number density at large masses. The simulations suggest that the Q-ball abundance is approximately $50\\%$ higher than predicted by analytical estimates, adjusting the result in the context of Q-balls as dark matter candidates."

Here we present GPCR-Filter, a deep learning framework specifically developed for GPCR modulator discovery. We assembled a high-quality dataset of over 90,000 experimentally validated GPCR-ligand pairs, providing a robust foundation for training and evaluation. GPCR-Filter integrates the ESM-3 protein language model for high-fidelity GPCR sequence representations with graph neural networks that encode ligand structures, coupled through an attention-based fusion mechanism that learns receptor-ligand functional relationships. Across multiple evaluation settings, GPCR-Filter consistently outperforms state-of-the-art compound-protein interaction models and exhibits strong generalization to unseen receptors and ligands. Notably, the model successfully identified micromolar-level agonists of the 5-HT\\textsubscript{1A} receptor with distinct chemical frameworks. These results establish GPCR-Filter as a scalable and effective computational approach for GPCR modulator discovery, advancing AI-assisted drug development for complex signaling systems."

CI services offer caching mechanisms to speed up builds by reusing infrequently changing artifacts, yet little is known about how caching is adopted in practice and what challenges it entails. In this paper, we conduct a large-scale empirical study of CI caching in Travis CI, analyzing 513,384 builds from 1,279 GitHub projects. We find that only 30% of projects adopt CI caching, and early adoption is strongly associated with project maturity, such as more dependencies, more commits, and longer CI lifespans. To understand why many projects do not adopt caching, we submitted pull requests enabling caching in non-adopting projects, and nearly half were accepted or merged. Developer feedback suggests that non- or late adoption mainly stems from limited awareness of CI caching support. We also examine cache maintenance and identify five common activities, performed by 24% of cache-enabled projects. Although one-third of projects see substantial build-time reductions, cache uploads occur in 97% of builds, and 33% of projects contain stale cached artifacts. Finally, our analysis of reported caching issues shows developers mainly struggle with corrupted or outdated caches or request broader caching features. Overall, CI caching does not help all projects, needs ongoing maintenance, and is more complex in practice than many developers expect."

For example, an e-commerce platform may require every recommendation list to include items from multiple sellers and at least one newly listed product; violating such constraints--even once--is unacceptable in production. Prior work on multi-objective recommendation and recent LLM-based recommender agents largely treat constraints as soft penalties or focus on item scoring and interaction, leading to frequent violations in real-world deployments. How to leverage LLMs for coordinating constrained optimization in recommendation systems remains underexplored. We propose DualAgent-Rec, an LLM-coordinated dual-agent framework for constrained multi-objective e-commerce recommendation. The framework separates optimization into an Exploitation Agent that prioritizes accuracy under hard constraints and an Exploration Agent that promotes diversity through unconstrained Pareto search. An LLM-based coordinator adaptively allocates resources between agents based on optimization progress and constraint satisfaction, while an adaptive epsilon-relaxation mechanism guarantees feasibility of final solutions. Experiments on the Amazon Reviews 2023 dataset demonstrate that DualAgent-Rec achieves 100% constraint satisfaction and improves Pareto hypervolume by 4-6% over strong baselines, while maintaining competitive accuracy-diversity trade-offs. These results indicate that LLMs can act as effective orchestration agents for deployable and constraint-compliant recommendation systems."

In real-world web platforms, interaction histories are inherently noisy due to accidental clicks, temporal inconsistencies, missing values, and evolving preferences, raising concerns about explanation stability and user trust. We present RobustExplain, the first systematic evaluation framework for measuring the robustness of LLM-generated recommendation explanations. RobustExplain introduces five realistic user behavior perturbations evaluated across multiple severity levels and a multi-dimensional robustness metric capturing semantic, keyword, structural, and length consistency. Our goal is to establish a principled, task-level evaluation framework and initial robustness baselines, rather than to provide a comprehensive leaderboard across all available LLMs. Experiments on four representative LLMs (7B--70B) show that current models exhibit only moderate robustness, with larger models achieving up to 8% higher stability.

Many practical applications demand greater flexibility, as the diversity of types and configurations grows with the popularity of multi-agent systems in society. Moreover, agents often operate without guarantees of trust or secure communication. Motivated by these challenges we update well-established frameworks by relaxing this assumption of shared inter-agent distances and constraints. Through a new form of constrained collective potential function, we introduce a solution that permits negotiation of these parameters. In the spirit of the traditional flocking control canon, this negotiation is achieved purely through local observations and does not require any global information or inter-agent communication. The approach is robust to semi-trust scenarios, where neighbouring agents pursue conflicting goals. We validate the effectiveness of the approach through a series of simulations."

We investigated the performance of $k$-means color quantization at four quantization levels in the RGB, CIE-XYZ, and CIE-LUV/CIE-HCL colorspaces, on 148 varied digital images spanning a wide range of scenes, subjects and settings. The Visual Information Fidelity (VIF) measure numerically assessed the quality of the quantized images, and showed that in about half of the cases, $k$-means color quantization is best in the RGB space, while at other times, and especially for higher quantization levels ($k$), the CIE-XYZ colorspace is where it usually does better. There are also some cases, especially at lower $k$, where the best performance is obtained in the CIE-LUV colorspace. Further analysis of the performances in terms of the distributions of the hue, chromaticity and luminance in an image presents a nuanced perspective and characterization of the images for which each colorspace is better for $k$-means color quantization."

    "abstract": "Emotional Talking Face synthesis is pivotal in multimedia and signal processing, yet existing 3D methods suffer from two critical challenges: poor audio-vision emotion alignment, manifested as difficult audio emotion extraction and inadequate control over emotional micro-expressions; and a one-size-fits-all multi-view fusion strategy that overlooks uncertainty and feature quality differences, undermining rendering quality. We propose UA-3DTalk, Uncertainty-Aware 3D Emotional Talking Face Synthesis with emotion prior distillation, which has three core modules: the Prior Extraction module disentangles audio into content-synchronized features for alignment and person-specific complementary features for individualization; the Emotion Distillation module introduces a multi-modal attention-weighted fusion mechanism and 4D Gaussian encoding with multi-resolution code-books, enabling fine-grained audio emotion extraction and precise control of emotional micro-expressions; the Uncertainty-based Deformation deploys uncertainty blocks to estimate view-specific aleatoric (input noise) and epistemic (model parameters) uncertainty, realizing adaptive multi-view fusion and incorporating a multi-head decoder for Gaussian primitive optimization to mitigate the limitations of uniform-weight fusion. Extensive experiments on regular and emotional datasets show UA-3DTalk outperforms state-of-the-art methods like DEGSTalk and EDTalk by 5.2% in E-FID for emotion alignment, 3.1% in SyncC for lip synchronization, and 0.015 in LPIPS for rendering quality.

To surpass this baseline, we introduce a novel method to perceptually align pretrained embeddings with source separation and linear optimization on ABX preference data from listening tests. Our model provides interpretable and controllable instrument-wise weights, allowing music producers to retrieve stem-level loops and samples based on mixed reference songs."

    "abstract": "Graph data is informative to represent complex relationships such as transactions between accounts, communications between devices, and dependencies among machines or processes. Correspondingly, graph anomaly detection (GAD) plays a critical role in identifying anomalies across various domains, including finance, cybersecurity, manufacturing, etc. Facing the large-volume and multi-domain graph data, nascent efforts attempt to develop foundational generalist models capable of detecting anomalies in unseen graphs without retraining. To the best of our knowledge, the different feature semantics and dimensions of cross-domain graph data heavily hinder the development of the graph foundation model, leaving further in-depth continual learning and inference capabilities a quite open problem. Hence, we propose OWLEYE, a novel zero-shot GAD framework that learns transferable patterns of normal behavior from multiple graphs, with a threefold contribution. First, OWLEYE proposes a cross-domain feature alignment module to harmonize feature distributions, which preserves domain-specific semantics during alignment. Second, with aligned features, to enable continuous learning capabilities, OWLEYE designs the multi-domain multi-pattern dictionary learning to encode shared structural and attribute-based patterns. Third, for achieving the in-context learning ability, OWLEYE develops a truncated attention-based reconstruction module to robustly detect anomalies without requiring labeled data for unseen graph-structured data. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that OWLEYE achieves superior performance and generalizability compared to state-of-the-art baselines, establishing a strong foundation for scalable and label-efficient anomaly detection."

    "abstract": "To address the discrimination problem of binary phase-shift keyed displaced squeezed vacuum states (S-BPSK), this paper proposes an Inverse-squeezing Kennedy (IS-Kennedy) receiver. This architecture incorporates an inverse-squeezing operator following the displacement operation of a conventional Kennedy receiver, mapping the S-BPSK signals onto equivalent large-amplitude coherent states. Furthermore, it employs a photon-number-resolving (PNR) detector to perform maximum a posteriori (MAP) decision-making. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that, under ideal conditions, the IS-Kennedy receiver effectively translates the transmitter's squeezing resources into a displacement gain at the receiver. Consequently, its error probability approaches the Helstrom bound across the entire energy spectrum, remaining within a constant factor of 3 dB. In the low-photon-number regime ($N \\approx 0.6$), the proposed scheme surpasses the coherent-state limit, achieving an error rate below 1\\%. Furthermore, this paper provides an in-depth analysis of system performance under non-ideal conditions, revealing the robustness of PNR detection against background dark counts and a characteristic ``parity photon-number step'' saturation effect arising from squeezing parameter mismatch."

Building on Axe, we design a multi-granularity, distribution-aware DSL and compiler that composes thread-local control with collective operators in a single kernel.

By learning physics-aligned representations from an initial sparse set of scenarios, NOVA consistently achieves 1-2 orders of magnitude lower out-of-distribution errors than data-driven baselines across complex, nonlinear problems including heat transfer, diffusion-reaction and fluid flow. We further showcase NOVA's dual impact on stabilizing long-time dynamical rollouts and improving generative design through application to the simulation of nonlinear Turing systems and fluidic chip optimization. Unlike neural physics solvers that are constrained to retrieval and/or emulation within an a priori space, NOVA enables reliable extrapolation beyond known regimes, a key capability given the need for exploration of novel hypothesis spaces in scientific discovery"

However, existing mutation testing techniques fall short in capturing many types of common faults in dynamically typed languages like Python. In this paper, we introduce a novel set of seven mutation operators that are inspired by prevalent anti-patterns in Python programs, designed to complement the existing general-purpose operators and broaden the spectrum of simulated faults. We propose a mutation testing technique that utilizes a hybrid of static and dynamic analyses to mutate Python programs based on these operators while minimizing equivalent mutants. We implement our approach in a tool called PyTation and evaluate it on 13 open-source Python applications. Our results show that PyTation generates mutants that complement those from general-purpose tools, exhibiting distinct behaviour under test execution and uncovering inadequacies in high-coverage test suites. We further demonstrate that PyTation produces a high proportion of unique mutants, a low cross-kill rate, and a low test overlap ratio relative to baseline tools, highlighting its novel fault model. PyTation also incurs few equivalent mutants, aided by dynamic analysis heuristics."

By basing the ensemble prediction solely on the first to halt rather than averaging predictions, we achieve 97.2% puzzle accuracy on Sudoku-Extreme while using 10x less compute than test-time augmentation (the baseline achieves 86.1% single-pass, 97.3% with TTA). Inference speed is an implicit indication of confidence. But can this capability be manifested as a training-only cost? Evidently yes: by maintaining K = 4 parallel latent states during training but backpropping only through the lowest-loss \"winner,\" a single model achieves 96.9% +/- 0.6% puzzle accuracy with a single forward pass-matching TTA performance without any test-time augmentation. As in nature, this work was also resource constrained: all experimentation used a single RTX 5090. This necessitated efficiency and compelled our invention of a modified SwiGLU which made Muon viable. With Muon and K = 1 training, we exceed TRM baseline performance in 7k steps (40 min). Higher accuracy requires 36k steps: 1.5 hours for K = 1, 6 hours for K = 4."

We introduce Crystal-to-Nanoparticle (C2NP), a systematic benchmark for evaluating generative models when moving between infinite crystalline unit cells and finite nanoparticles, where surface effects and size-dependent distortions dominate. C2NP defines two complementary tasks: (i) generating nanoparticles of specified radii from periodic unit cells, testing whether models capture surface truncation and geometric constraints; and (ii) recovering bulk lattice parameters and space-group symmetry from finite particle configurations, assessing whether models can infer underlying crystallographic order despite surface perturbations. Using diverse materials as a structurally consistent testbed, we construct over 170,000 nanoparticle configurations by carving particles from supercells derived from DFT-relaxed crystal unit cells, and introduce size-based splits that separate interpolation from extrapolation regimes. Experiments with state-of-the-art approaches, including diffusion, flow-matching, and variational models, show that even when losses are low, models often fail geometrically under distribution shift, yielding large lattice-recovery errors and near-zero joint accuracy on structure and symmetry. Overall, our results suggest that current methods rely on template memorization rather than scalable physical generalization. C2NP offers a controlled, reproducible framework for diagnosing these failures, with immediate applications to nanoparticle catalyst design, nanostructured hydrides for hydrogen storage, and materials discovery.

    "abstract": "Symmetry-protected topological phases have been a central theme in condensed matter physics and beyond over the past two decades. Most efforts have focused on topological classifications of physical systems under given symmetries, while the intrinsic topology of the symmetries themselves has received much less attention. Here, we show that, in generic non-interacting spinless crystals, the spacetime inversion symmetry $PT$ naturally carries a real vector-bundle structure whose topology is characterized by Stiefel--Whitney (SW) classes. In contrast to previous work, where SW classes were used to describe the topology of real valence bundles protected by $PT$, we identify SW classes associated to the $PT$ symmetry itself. These symmetry SW classes can endow the \\emph{total} real bundle of a $PT$-symmetric band structure with nontrivial topology, overturning the common assumption that the total bundle is always trivial. As a consequence, valence and conduction bands can exhibit asymmetric SW classes, in sharp contrast to the usual symmetric scenario. We further demonstrate that the symmetry SW classes provide a refined distinction between atomic insulator phases. Our results underscore the importance of treating crystal symmetries as topological objects in their own right, rather than focusing solely on the topology of energy bands."

While object-centric generation approaches rely on fixed resolution representations, degrading fidelity for larger scenes. Training-free approaches, while flexible, are often slow and computationally expensive at inference time. We present NuiWorld, a framework that attempts to address these challenges. To overcome data scarcity, we propose a generative bootstrapping strategy that starts from a few input images. Leveraging recent 3D reconstruction and expandable scene generation techniques, we synthesize scenes of varying sizes and layouts, producing enough data to train an end-to-end model. Furthermore, our framework enables controllability through pseudo sketch labels, and demonstrates a degree of generalization to previously unseen sketches. Our approach represents scenes as a collection of variable scene chunks, which are compressed into a flattened vector-set representation. This significantly reduces the token length for large scenes, enabling consistent geometric fidelity across scenes sizes while improving training and inference efficiency."

In this study, high-quality attitude determination results obtained from star sensors and a fiber optical gyro (FOG) are treated as ground truth, and machine learning is applied to coarse attitude sensor data consisting of Sun sensors and magnetic field sensors. A one-dimensional convolutional neural network (Conv1D) is employed to regressively predict attitude from short sequences of time-series sensor measurements. The model is trained and evaluated using five sets of on-orbit observation logs, with four passes used for training and one independent pass used for testing. The results show that, while conventional coarse attitude determination using the TRIAD method yields attitude errors on the order of 7 deg RMS, the proposed machine-learning approach achieves RMS errors of approximately 0.7 deg for the training data and 2-3 deg for the test data, depending on the sensor combination."

Bridging these limitations requires a representation that is both structured and global. We introduce SONIC (Spectral Oriented Neural Invariant Convolutions), a continuous spectral parameterisation that models convolutional operators using a small set of shared, orientation-selective components. These components define smooth responses across the full frequency domain, yielding global receptive fields and filters that adapt naturally across resolutions. Across synthetic benchmarks, large-scale image classification, and 3D medical datasets, SONIC shows improved robustness to geometric transformations, noise, and resolution shifts, and matches or exceeds convolutional, attention-based, and prior spectral architectures with an order of magnitude fewer parameters.

Several examples and open questions are included, in particular for spaces C(X) and for inductive limits of Frechet spaces."

We propose a Generative Latent Alignment (GLA) framework that combines a lightweight convolutional variational autoencoder with a frozen CLIP text encoder to learn a low-dimensional latent representation of radar Range-Angle (RA) heatmaps. The latent space is softly aligned with two semantic anchors corresponding to \"empty room\" and \"person present\", and Grad-CAM is applied in this aligned latent space to visualize which spatial regions support each presence decision. On our mmWave radar dataset, we qualitatively observe that the \"person present\" class produces compact Grad-CAM blobs that coincide with strong RA returns, whereas \"empty room\" samples yield diffuse or no evidence. We also conduct an ablation study using unrelated text prompts, which degrades both reconstruction and localization, suggesting that radar-specific anchors are important for meaningful explanations in this setting."

Here, we explore the theory of weight-constrained stabilizer codes from various foundational perspectives including the complexity of computing code weight and the explicit boundary of feasible low-weight codes in both theoretical and practical settings. We first prove that calculating the optimal code weight is an $\\mathsf{NP}$-hard problem, demonstrating the necessity of establishing bounds for weight that are analytical or efficiently computable. Then we systematically investigate the feasible code parameters with weight constraints. We provide various explicit analytical lower bounds and in particular completely characterize stabilizer codes with weight at most 3, showing that they have distance 2 and code rate at most 1/4. We also develop a powerful linear programming (LP) scheme for setting code parameter bounds with weight constraints, which yields exact optimal weight values for all code parameters with $n\\leq 9$. We further refined this constraint from multiple perspectives by considering the generator weight distribution and overlap. In particular, we consider practical architectures and demonstrate how to apply our methods to e.g.~the IBM 127-qubit chip. Our study brings the weight as a crucial parameter into coding theory and provide guidance for code design and utility in practical scenarios."

Being the new paradigm of neural rendering, Gaussian Splatting has been investigated in many applications, with the main effort in extending its representation, improving its optimization process, and accelerating its speed. However, one orthogonal, much needed, but under-explored area is data uncertainty. In standard 4D Gaussian Splatting, data uncertainty can manifest as view sparsity, missing frames, camera asynchronization, etc. So far, there has been little research to holistically incorporating various types of data uncertainty under a single framework. To this end, we propose Graphical X Splatting, or GraphiXS, a new probabilistic framework that considers multiple types of data uncertainty, aiming for a fundamental augmentation of the current 4D Gaussian Splatting paradigm into a probabilistic setting. GraphiXS is general and can be instantiated with a range of primitives, e.g. Gaussians, Student's-t. Furthermore, GraphiXS can be used to `upgrade' existing methods to accommodate data uncertainty. Through exhaustive evaluation and comparison, we demonstrate that GraphiXS can systematically model various uncertainties in data, outperform existing methods in many settings where data are missing or polluted in space and time, and therefore is a major generalization of the current 4D Gaussian Splatting research."

    "abstract": "The year 2025 marks the 100 and 30 years anniversaries of the discovery of Bose--Einstein condensation and its successful experimental realisation. Inspired by these important research achievements, a conceptually simple approach is proposed to facilitate reliable and efficient numerical simulations. The structure of the underlying systems of coupled Gross--Pitaevskii equations suggests the use of optimised high-order operator splitting methods for dynamical evolution and ground state computation. A second-order barrier, however, prevents the applicability of standard operator splitting methods for both, time evolution as well as imaginary time propagation. An innovative alternative approach accomplishes the design of novel modified operator splitting methods that remain stable under moderate smallness assumptions on the time increments. The core idea is to incorporate commutators of the defining differential and nonlinear multiplication operators, since this permits to fulfill the basic stability requirement of positive method coefficients. Further improvements with respect to convergence at the targeted precision arise from automatic adjustments of the time stepsizes by an inexpensive local error control. The presented numerical experiments confirm the favourable performance of a specific fourth-order modified operator splitting method. Amongst others, it is demonstrated that the excellent mass and energy conservation in long-term evolutions, intrinsic attributes of geometric numerical integrators for Hamiltonian systems, is maintained for a sensible variation of the time stepsizes. Moreover, the benefits of adaptive higher-order approximations in ground state computations are illustrated."

Adding to this challenge is the fact that the anomaly data is rare and costly to label. To achieve this, we propose a multidirectional meta-learning algorithm -- at the inner level, the model aims to learn the manifold of the normal data (representation); at the outer level, the model is meta-tuned with a few anomaly samples to maximize the softmax confidence margin between the normal and anomaly samples (decision surface calibration), treating normals as in-distribution (ID) and anomalies as out-of-distribution (OOD). By iteratively repeating this process over multiple episodes of predominantly normal and a small number of anomaly samples, we realize a multidirectional meta-learning framework. This two-level optimization, enhanced by multidirectional training, enables stronger generalization to unseen anomaly classes."

To detect hand coordination policies, we apply Shannon's information theory to analyze the information flow between scene elements and leverage scene graph properties. The generated plan is a modular behavior tree that assumes different structures based on the desired arms coordination.

    "abstract": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) extends large language models (LLMs) beyond parametric knowledge, yet it is unclear when iterative retrieval-reasoning loops meaningfully outperform static RAG, particularly in scientific domains with multi-hop reasoning, sparse domain knowledge, and heterogeneous evidence. We provide the first controlled, mechanism-level diagnostic study of whether synchronized iterative retrieval and reasoning can surpass an idealized static upper bound (Gold Context) RAG. We benchmark eleven state-of-the-art LLMs under three regimes: (i) No Context, measuring reliance on parametric memory; (ii) Gold Context, where all oracle evidence is supplied at once; and (iii) Iterative RAG, a training-free controller that alternates retrieval, hypothesis refinement, and evidence-aware stopping. Using the chemistry-focused ChemKGMultiHopQA dataset, we isolate questions requiring genuine retrieval and analyze behavior with diagnostics spanning retrieval coverage gaps, anchor-carry drop, query quality, composition fidelity, and control calibration. Across models, Iterative RAG consistently outperforms Gold Context, with gains up to 25.6 percentage points, especially for non-reasoning fine-tuned models. Staged retrieval reduces late-hop failures, mitigates context overload, and enables dynamic correction of early hypothesis drift, but remaining failure modes include incomplete hop coverage, distractor latch trajectories, early stopping miscalibration, and high composition failure rates even with perfect retrieval. Overall, staged retrieval is often more influential than the mere presence of ideal evidence; we provide practical guidance for deploying and diagnosing RAG systems in specialized scientific settings and a foundation for more reliable, controllable iterative retrieval-reasoning frameworks."

The reasons are varied: the lack of publicly available clinical data, the difficulty that users may have in understanding the reasons why a recommendation was made, the risks that may be involved in following that recommendation, and the uncertainty about its effectiveness. In this work, we address these challenges with a recommendation model that leverages the structure of psychometric data to provide visual explanations that are faithful to the model and interpretable by care professionals. We focus on a narrow healthcare niche, gerontological primary care, to show that the proposed recommendation model can assist the attending professional in the creation of personalised care plans. We report results of a comparative offline performance evaluation of the proposed model on healthcare datasets that were collected by research partners in Brazil, as well as the results of a user study that evaluates the interpretability of the visual explanations the model generates. The results suggest that the proposed model can advance the application of recommender systems in this healthcare niche, which is expected to grow in demand , opportunities, and information technology needs as demographic changes become more pronounced."

    "abstract": "Accurately modeling and controlling vehicle exhaust emissions during transient events, such as rapid acceleration, is critical for meeting environmental regulations and optimizing powertrains. Conventional data-driven methods, such as Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, improve upon phenomenological models but often struggle with the complex nonlinear dynamics of emission formation. These monolithic architectures are sensitive to dataset variability and typically require deep, computationally expensive structures to perform well, limiting their practical utility. This paper introduces a novel approach that overcomes these limitations by modeling emission dynamics within a structured latent space. Leveraging a Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA), the proposed framework learns from a rich dataset that combines real-world Portable Emission Measurement System (PEMS) data with high-frequency hardware-in-the-loop measurements. The model abstracts away irrelevant noise, encoding only the key factors governing emission behavior into a compact, robust representation. This results in superior data efficiency and predictive accuracy across diverse transient regimes, significantly outperforming high-performing LSTM baselines in generalization. To ensure suitability for real-world deployment, the JEPA framework is structured to support pruning and post-training quantization. This strategy drastically reduces the computational footprint, minimizing inference time and memory demand with negligible accuracy loss. The result is a highly efficient model ideal for on-board implementation of advanced strategies, such as model predictive control or model-based reinforcement learning, in conventional and hybrid powertrains. These findings offer a clear pathway toward more robust emission control systems for next-generation vehicles."

While the identification of a geometric origin for time's arrow is compelling in the case of brane-world models, we point out a possible tension between the proposed volume growth and the observational stability of the effective four-dimensional Newton's gravitational constant, G, that may arise in Kaluza-Klein (KK) theory. In standard KK approaches, such volume growth induces a time-variation of G that exceeds Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) and Lunar Laser Ranging (LLR) bounds by many orders of magnitude. To resolve this tension while preserving the author's key insight in the Kaluza-Klein case, we propose an extension: the \"shape-dynamic arrow of time\". By utilizing the scale-invariant monotonicity of Perelman's nu-entropy under normalized Ricci flow, we demonstrate how an arrow of time can emerge from the geometric smoothing of extra dimensions at fixed volume, thereby satisfying observational constraints on fundamental constants."

A promising direction, grounded in human development, investigates agents that learn by setting and pursuing their own goals. The core challenge lies in how to effectively generate, select, and learn from such goals. Our focus is on broad distributions of downstream tasks where solving every task zero-shot is infeasible. Such settings naturally arise when the target tasks lie outside of the pre-training distribution or when their identities are unknown to the agent. In this work, we (i) optimize for efficient multi-episode exploration and adaptation within a meta-learning framework, and (ii) guide the training curriculum with evolving estimates of the agent's post-adaptation performance. We present ULEE, an unsupervised meta-learning method that combines an in-context learner with an adversarial goal-generation strategy that maintains training at the frontier of the agent's capabilities. On XLand-MiniGrid benchmarks, ULEE pre-training yields improved exploration and adaptation abilities that generalize to novel objectives, environment dynamics, and map structures. The resulting policy attains improved zero-shot and few-shot performance, and provides a strong initialization for longer fine-tuning processes. It outperforms learning from scratch, DIAYN pre-training, and alternative curricula."

Building on the modern framework of solution stability and Morse index theory, the work investigates how these notions influence regularity in nonlinear elliptic problems. A central contribution is the construction of a counterexample showing that bounded radial Morse index does not prevent singular behavior of solutions in dimensions three through nine, challenging a natural extension of the Brezis-Vázquez regularity conjecture. In addition, optimal regularity results are established for radial solutions of a non-autonomous Hardy-Hénon equation, identifying the precise range of dimensions for which regularity holds. The thesis also addresses existence and multiplicity results for elliptic equations involving nonlinearities with spatially vanishing coefficients. Under suitable assumptions, the existence of multiple distinct solutions is proved using variational and topological methods. Finally, the thesis outlines several directions for future research, including extensions of stability-based regularity techniques to non-autonomous problems and potential applications of these techniques to field theories arising in theoretical physics."

We attribute this deficiency to a suboptimal training paradigm inherent in prevailing VLMs, which exhibits a text-dominant optimization bias by conceptualizing visual signals merely as passive conditional inputs rather than supervisory targets. To mitigate this, we introduce Youtu-VL, a framework leveraging the Vision-Language Unified Autoregressive Supervision (VLUAS) paradigm, which fundamentally shifts the optimization objective from ``vision-as-input'' to ``vision-as-target.'' By integrating visual tokens directly into the prediction stream, Youtu-VL applies unified autoregressive supervision to both visual details and linguistic content. Furthermore, we extend this paradigm to encompass vision-centric tasks, enabling a standard VLM to perform vision-centric tasks without task-specific additions. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that Youtu-VL achieves competitive performance on both general multimodal tasks and vision-centric tasks, establishing a robust foundation for the development of comprehensive generalist visual agents."

We propose a unified evaluation framework that measures both accessibility of accent information via a novel Accent ABX task and recoverability via cross-accent Voice Conversion (VC) resynthesis. Using this framework, we analyse DSRTs derived from a variety of speech encoders. Our results reveal that accent information is substantially reduced when ASR supervision is used to fine-tune the encoder, but cannot be effectively disentangled from phonetic and speaker information through naive codebook size reduction. Based on these findings, we propose new content-only and content-accent DSRTs that significantly outperform existing designs in controllable accent generation. Our work highlights the importance of accent-aware evaluation and provides practical guidance for designing DSRTs for accent-controlled speech generation."

Growing demand for rapid iteration, high-fidelity detail, and accessible content creation has further increased interest in this area. Existing methods broadly follow two paradigms - indirect 2D-to-3D reconstruction and direct 3D generation - but both are limited by weak structural modeling and heavy reliance on large-scale ground-truth supervision, often producing structural artifacts, geometric inconsistencies, and degraded high-frequency details in complex scenes. We propose GeoDiff3D, an efficient self-supervised framework that uses coarse geometry as a structural anchor and a geometry-constrained 2D diffusion model to provide texture-rich reference images. Importantly, GeoDiff3D does not require strict multi-view consistency of the diffusion-generated references and remains robust to the resulting noisy, inconsistent guidance. We further introduce voxel-aligned 3D feature aggregation and dual self-supervision to maintain scene coherence and fine details while substantially reducing dependence on labeled data. GeoDiff3D also trains with low computational cost and enables fast, high-quality 3D scene generation. Extensive experiments on challenging scenes show improved generalization and generation quality over existing baselines, offering a practical solution for accessible and efficient 3D scene construction."

However, a complete transition to DDMC-based waveforms is not yet practically feasible. This is because 5G NR based waveforms, orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) and discrete Fourier transform-spread OFDM (DFT-s-OFDM), remain as the modulation schemes for the sixth-generation radio (6GR). Hence, in this paper, we demonstrate how we can still benefit from DD-domain processing in high-mobility scenarios using 5G NR sounding reference signals (SRSs). By considering a DFT-s-OFDM receiver, we transform each received OFDM symbol into the delay-Doppler (DD) domain, where the channel is then estimated. With this approach, we estimate the DD channel parameters, allowing us to predict the aged channel over OFDM symbols without pilots. To improve channel prediction, we propose a linear joint channel estimation and equalization technique, where we use the detected data in each OFDM symbol to sequentially update our channel estimates. Our simulation results show that the proposed technique significantly outperforms the conventional frequency-domain estimation technique in terms of bit error rate (BER) and normalized mean squared error (NMSE). Furthermore, we show that using only two slots with SRS for initial channel estimation, our method supports pilot-free detection for more than 25 subsequent OFDM symbols."

Utilizing a uniform Lomb-Scargle-based pipeline, we derived significant periods for 47 targets. A comparison with existing literature periods reveals generally good agreement, although several stars exhibit discrepant or previously unrecognized behavior. Notably, six targets display clear multiperiodicity, which, when combined with archival TESS data, suggests that these six candidates are likely misclassified, for example, as a magnetic CP2 or a CP4 star and instead exhibit characteristics consistent with a Be/shell star. Furthermore, eleven stars show no detectable periodic variations within the precision limits of BRITE. Our analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of long-term nanosatellite photometry, particularly when complemented by TESS data, in verifying catalogue periods, identifying multiperiodic behavior, and detecting potential misclassifications among bright CP stars."

There are many costs associated with the installation of a PMU, but also costs associated with not observing the entire power grid. In this work, we propose and study a power domination cost function, which balances these two costs. Given a graph $G$, a set of sensor locations $S$, and a parameter $β$ (which is the ratio of the cost of a PMU to the cost of non-observance of any given vertex), we define the cost function \\[ \\mathrm{C}(G;S,β)=|S|+β\\cdot (|V(G)|-|\\mathrm{Obs}(G;S)|) \\] where $|\\mathrm{Obs}(G;S)|$ is the number of vertices observed by sensors placed at $S\\subseteq V(G)$ in the power domination process. We explore the values of $k$ for which there is a set $S$ of size $k$ that minimizes this cost function, and explore which values of $β$ guarantee that it is optimal to observe the entire power grid to minimize cost. We also introduce notions of marginal cost and marginal observance, providing tools to analyze how many PMUs one should install on a given power grid."

The diameter of 2025 FA22 is estimated between 130 and 290 meters. It is among the largest NEAs observable at such proximity, prompting an International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN) rapidresponse campaign. Although early orbital solutions indicated a possible impact in 2089, further follow-up astrometric observations ruled out collision hazard. The favourable geometry of this close encounter enabled a dense coverage of the positive part of the phasepolarisation curve, from the high polarisation domain (high phase angles), nearly to the inversion angle where the linear polarisation rate vanishes. The spectropolarimetric observations provided the wavelength dependence of the polarisation rate. Using empirical relationships, an estimate of the geometric albedo could be drawn from the slope of the phase-polarisation curve at inversion angle. Moreover, the spectropolarimetric trends yielded constraints on the taxonomic class. These results demonstrate the interest of polarimetry and spectropolarimetry for rapid characterisation of newly discovered NEAs in planetary defence campaigns."

A prior study explored the way to enhance the performance of phonetic token-based ASR on accented speech by reproducing the phenomenon known as interlanguage speech intelligibility benefit (ISIB), where foreign-accented speech is more intelligible to listeners sharing the speaker's native language than to native listeners. ISIB was technically implemented by using the speaker's L1 to learn k-means cluster centroids in an SSL feature space to obtain phonetic tokens. In this study, we propose a more advanced modeling of ISIB. By employing differentiable k-means and optimizing the entire module for both L1 and L2 ASR, the proposed method outperformed the baselines, both when using only native speech and when additionally incorporating a limited amount of accented speech. Notably, in the latter scenario, our method achieved approximately a 20% relative improvement in recognition accuracy."

Using some iterated mapping cone procedure, we construct a distinguished family $\\{ C_{\\bullet}[β] \\}_{β\\in Δ_+}$ of chain complexes in $\\mathcal{K}_Q^{(1)}$ characterized (up to isomorphism) by homological conditions similar to those of higher exact sequences appearing in the context of higher homological algebra.

    "abstract": "Federated graph learning (FGL) has recently emerged as a promising privacy-preserving paradigm that enables distributed graph learning across multiple data owners. A critical privacy concern in federated learning is whether an adversary can recover raw data from shared gradients, a vulnerability known as deep leakage from gradients (DLG). However, most prior studies on the DLG problem focused on image or text data, and it remains an open question whether graphs can be effectively recovered, particularly when the graph structure and node features are uniquely entangled in GNNs. In this work, we first theoretically analyze the components in FGL and derive a crucial insight: once the graph structure is recovered, node features can be obtained through a closed-form recursive rule. Building on this analysis, we propose GraphDLG, a novel approach to recover raw training graphs from shared gradients in FGL, which can utilize randomly generated graphs or client-side training graphs as auxiliaries to enhance recovery. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GraphDLG outperforms existing solutions by successfully decoupling the graph structure and node features, achieving improvements of over 5.46% (by MSE) for node feature reconstruction and over 25.04% (by AUC) for graph structure reconstruction."

    "abstract": "Compiling quantum circuits into Clifford+$T$ gates is a central task for fault-tolerant quantum computing using stabilizer codes. In the near term, $T$ gates will dominate the cost of fault tolerant implementations, and any reduction in the number of such expensive gates could mean the difference between being able to run a circuit or not. While exact synthesis is exponentially hard in the number of qubits, local synthesis approaches are commonly used to compile large circuits by decomposing them into substructures. However, composing local methods leads to suboptimal compilations in key metrics such as $T$-count or circuit depth, and their performance strongly depends on circuit representation. In this work, we address this challenge by proposing \\textsc{Q-PreSyn}, a strategy that, given a set of local edits preserving circuit equivalence, uses a RL agent to identify effective sequences of such actions and thereby obtain circuit representations that yield a reduced $T$-count upon synthesis. Experimental results of our proposed strategy, applied on top of well-known synthesis algorithms, show up to a $20\\%$ reduction in $T$-count on circuits with up to 25 qubits, without introducing any additional approximation error prior to synthesis."

    "abstract": "Estimating health indicators for restricted sub-populations is a recurring challenge in epidemiology and public health. When survey data are used, Small Area Estimation (SAE) methods can improve precision by borrowing strength across domains. In many applications, however, outcomes are self-reported and affected by coarsening mechanisms, such as rounding and digit preference, that reduce data resolution and may bias inference. This paper addresses both issues by developing a Bayesian unit-level SAE framework for semi-continuous, coarsened responses. Motivated by the 2019 Italian European Health Interview Survey, we estimate smoking indicators for domains defined by the cross-classification of Italian regions and age groups, capturing both smoking prevalence and intensity. The model adopts a two-part structure: a logistic component for smoking prevalence and a flexible mixture of Lognormal distributions for average cigarette consumption, coupled with an explicit model for coarsening and topcoding. Simulation studies show that ignoring coarsening can yield biased and unstable domain estimates with poor interval coverage, whereas the proposed model improves accuracy and achieves near-nominal coverage. The empirical application provides a detailed picture of smoking patterns across region-age domains, helping to characterize the dynamics of the phenomenon and inform targeted public health policies."

We aim to extend and complete our photometric catalogs of the entire Galactic plane region accessible from the southern hemisphere, focusing on the areas newly covered by the VVVX survey. Building on previous work, we applied point-spread function fitting techniques to detect point sources and extract their deep J, H, and Ks photometry across the VVVX footprint. The resulting catalogs were calibrated using astrometric and photometric reference data. Cross-matching between filters and epochs was used to ensure a high level of reliability and completeness. We produce a deep, highly complete near-infrared catalog of more than 700 million sources in the Galactic plane and outer Galactic bulge. When combined with our previous VVV atlas, the full catalog includes over 1.5 billion sources. The derived density maps and color-magnitude diagrams enable detailed studies of Galactic structure, extinction, and stellar populations, and highlight features such as the Carina arm tangency, the Sagittarius stream, and numerous star clusters. This extended atlas provides an unprecedented view of the innermost regions of the Milky Way. It is now publicly available through the VISTA Science Archive, offering a valuable resource for the astronomical community to investigate the structure and evolution of the Galactic disk and bulge."

Our main result proves that as soon as the Laplacian is perturbed by a finite family of Dirac masses placed at points whose set of looping directions has zero measure, semiclassical measures corresponding to high-frequency sequences of eigenfunctions are supported on the unit cosphere bundle and invariant under the geodesic flow. The main difficulty in establishing this result relies on the fact that point perturbations are unbounded operators that cannot be written as pseudodifferential operators, and therefore, the corresponding perturbed Laplacian does not have an unambiguously defined classical flow."

By guiding signals through a waveguide and emitting them via a movable pinching antenna, these systems enable dynamic control of signal propagation and spatial adaptability. However, their performance heavily depends on effective resource allocation-encompassing power, bandwidth, and antenna positioning-which becomes challenging under imperfect channel state information (CSI) and user localization uncertainty. Existing studies largely assume perfect CSI or ideal user positioning, while our prior work considered uniform localization errors, an oversimplified assumption. In this paper, we develop a robust resource allocation framework for multiuser downlink pinching antenna systems under Gaussian-distributed localization uncertainty, which more accurately models real-world positioning errors. An energy efficiency (EE) maximization problem is formulated subject to probabilistic outage constraints, and an analytical power allocation strategy is derived under given antenna positions. On this basis, the heuristic particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is employed to identify the antenna position that achieves the global EE configuration. Simulation results illustrate that the proposed scheme greatly enhances both EE and system reliability compared with fixed-antenna benchmark, validating its effectiveness for practical high-frequency wireless deployments."

By formulating coupled-physics modeling as a probability modeling problem, our key innovation is to integrate probability density evolution in generative modeling with iterative multiphysics coupling, thereby enabling training on data from decoupled simulation and inferring coupled physics during sampling. We also utilize operator-splitting theory in the space of probability evolution to establish error controllability guarantees for this \"conditional-to-joint\" sampling scheme.

Our numerical results, using realistic DVCS kinematics, indicate that there can be measurable interference effects. They suggest that this process could substantially modify the experimentally observed cross sections at CLAS12-like kinematics, motivating their inclusion in precision analyses of DVCS experiments. We further find that in spite of this background, the transition to a Roper-like state through DVCS does contribute significantly to the $e^- N\\to e^-γNπ$ cross section in some kinematic regions. This suggests that the creation of nucleon resonances via DVCS is a useful method for extracting information about the nucleon transition GPDs and the internal structure of the excited states."

In addition we show that both types of randomization make an algorithm robust to tuning, meaning that spectral gaps decay polynomially as the step size is increasingly poorly chosen. We further show that step-size randomization often preserves high-dimensional scaling limits and algorithmic complexity, while increasing the optimal acceptance rate for Langevin and Hamiltonian samplers when an Exponential or Uniform distribution is chosen to randomize the step size.

However, recent work found that IDS's gains are not consistent across all problems. Our analysis reveals that IDS performance is worse for problems containing outliers. IDS systematically favors including outliers in subsets which pushes GP towards finding solutions that overfit to outliers. To address this, we introduce ROIDS (Robust Outlier-Aware Informed Down-Sampling), which excludes potential outliers from the sampling process of IDS. With ROIDS it is possible to keep the advantages of IDS without overfitting to outliers and to compete on a wide range of benchmark problems. This is also reflected in our experiments in which ROIDS shows the desired behavior on all studied benchmark problems. ROIDS consistently outperforms IDS on synthetic problems with added outliers as well as on a wide range of complex real-world problems, surpassing IDS on over 80% of the real-world benchmark problems. Moreover, compared to all studied baseline approaches, ROIDS achieves the best average rank across all tested benchmark problems. This robust behavior makes ROIDS a reliable down-sampling method for selection in symbolic regression, especially when outliers may be included in the data set."

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning is increasingly used for code-centric tasks. These tasks include code generation, summarization, understanding, repair, testing, and optimization. This trend is growing faster with large language models and autonomous agents. A key challenge is how to design reward signals that make sense for software. In many RL problems, the reward is a clear number. In software, this is often not possible. The goal is rarely a single numeric objective. Instead, rewards are usually proxies. Common proxies check if the code compiles, passes tests, or satisfies quality metrics. Many reward designs have been proposed for code-related tasks. However, the work is scattered across areas and papers. There is no single survey that brings these approaches together and shows the full landscape of reward design for RL in software. In this survey, we provide the first systematic and comprehensive review of reward engineering for RL in software tasks. We focus on existing methods and techniques. We structure the literature along three complementary dimensions, summarizing the reward-design choices within each. We conclude with challenges and recommendations in the reward design space for SE tasks."

Decades-long efforts yielded TF-DNA interaction models that predict how strongly an individual TF binds arbitrary DNA sequences and how individual binding events on the CRE combine to affect gene expression. These insights can be synthesized into a global, biophysically-realistic, and quantitative genotype-phenotype (GP) map for gene regulation, a \"holy grail\" for the application of evolutionary theory. A global map provides a rare opportunity to simulate long-term evolution of regulatory sequences and pose several fundamental questions: How long does it take to evolve CREs de novo? How many non-trivial regulatory functions exist in sequence space? How connected are they? For which regulatory architecture is CRE evolution most rapid and evolvable? In this article, the first of a two-part series, we briefly review the pertinent modeling and simulation efforts for a unique system that enables close, quantitative, and mechanistic links between biophysics, as well as systems, synthetic, and evolutionary biology."

    "abstract": "Post-training quantization (PTQ) enables effective model compression while preserving relatively high accuracy. Current weight-only PTQ methods primarily focus on the challenging sub-3-bit regime, where approaches often suffer significant accuracy degradation, typically requiring fine-tuning to achieve competitive performance. In this work, we revisit the fundamental characteristics of weight quantization and analyze the challenges in quantizing the residual matrix under low-rank approximation. We propose LoPRo, a novel fine-tuning-free PTQ algorithm that enhances residual matrix quantization by applying block-wise permutation and Walsh-Hadamard transformations to rotate columns of similar importance, while explicitly preserving the quantization accuracy of the most salient column blocks. Furthermore, we introduce a mixed-precision fast low-rank decomposition based on rank-1 sketch (R1SVD) to further minimize quantization costs. Experiments demonstrate that LoPRo outperforms existing fine-tuning-free PTQ methods at both 2-bit and 3-bit quantization, achieving accuracy comparable to fine-tuning baselines. Specifically, LoPRo achieves state-of-the-art quantization accuracy on LLaMA-2 and LLaMA-3 series models while delivering up to a 4$\\times$ speedup. In the MoE model Mixtral-8x7B, LoPRo completes quantization within 2.5 hours, simultaneously reducing perplexity by 0.4$\\downarrow$ and improving accuracy by 8\\%$\\uparrow$. Moreover, compared to other low-rank quantization methods, LoPRo achieves superior accuracy with a significantly lower rank, while maintaining high inference efficiency and minimal additional latency."

    "abstract": "Subset repair is an important data cleaning technique that enforces integrity constraints by deleting a minimal number of conflicting tuples, yet multiple minimal repairs often exist. Density-based methods address this ambiguity by favoring repairs that preserve dense, high-quality data regions; however, their effectiveness is limited by density bias from dirty clusters, high computational cost, and uniform attribute weighting. We propose a topology-aware approximate subset repair framework based on a joint density-conflict penalty model. The framework integrates three key components. First, a two-layer conflict detection strategy combines attribute inverted indexes with CFD rule grouping to efficiently identify violations. Second, we introduce EntroCFDensity, a density metric that incorporates information entropy and CFD weights to dynamically adjust attribute importance and reduce homogeneity bias. Third, a conflict degree measure is defined to complement local density, enabling a topology-adaptive penalty mechanism with dynamic weight allocation guided by the coefficient of variation. The conflict graph is further decomposed into independent subgraphs, transforming global repair into tractable local subproblems. Based on this framework, we develop two algorithms: PPIS, a scalable heuristic, and MICO, a mixed-integer programming method with theoretical guarantees. Experimental results show that our approach improves repair accuracy and robustness while effectively preserving high-quality data."

This paper presents a simple but effective approach called KeepLoRA to effectively balance these objectives. We first analyze the knowledge retention mechanism within the model parameter space and find that general knowledge is mainly encoded in the principal subspace, while task-specific knowledge is encoded in the residual subspace. Motivated by this finding, KeepLoRA learns new tasks by restricting LoRA parameter updates in the residual subspace to prevent interfering with previously learned capabilities. Specifically, we infuse knowledge for a new task by projecting its gradient onto a subspace orthogonal to both the principal subspace of pre-trained model and the dominant directions of previous task features. Our theoretical and empirical analyses confirm that KeepLoRA balances the three objectives and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

We explicitly include the special case of tensor train structures and demonstrate how to extend methods commonly used in this context to general tree structures. We compare our newly developed method with the existing ones in a benchmark scenario with random tensor network states and operators. We find our Cholesky-based compression (CBC) performs equivalently to the current state-of-the-art method, while outperforming most established methods by at least an order of magnitude in runtime. We then apply our knowledge to perform circuit simulation of tree-like circuits, in order to test our method in a more realistic scenario. Here, we find that more complex tree structures can outperform simple linear structures and achieve lower errors than those possible with the simple structures. Additionally, our CBC still performs among the most successful methods, showing less dependence on the different bond dimensions of the operator."

In this paper, we extend the Evolution of Heuristics (EoH) framework to investigate the automated generation of guiding heuristics for A* search. We introduce a novel domain-agnostic prompt augmentation strategy that includes the A* code into the prompt to leverage in-context learning, named Algorithmic - Contextual EoH (A-CEoH). To evaluate the effectiveness of A-CeoH, we study two problem domains: the Unit-Load Pre-Marshalling Problem (UPMP), a niche problem from warehouse logistics, and the classical sliding puzzle problem (SPP). Our computational experiments show that A-CEoH can significantly improve the quality of the generated heuristics and even outperform expert-designed heuristics."

The simulations reveal distinct impact dynamics, such as spreading, splashing type-1, splashing type-2, and canopy formation, which are delineated in a regime map constructed in the Ar-We parameter space. Our results demonstrate that droplet morphology during the impact significantly influences crown evolution and splash initiation, with oblate drops promoting finger growth and fragmentation due to enhanced rim deceleration, while prolate drops tend to form canopies. We observe that the hole instability, which becomes more prominent at higher Weber numbers, arises from lamella rupture in the thinnest region of the film, located just beneath the crown rim. A linear stability analysis, supplemented by the temporal evolution of the crown obtained from the numerical simulations, adequately predicts the number of fingers formed along the crown rim by accounting for both Rayleigh-Plateau (RP) and Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) instabilities. The theoretical analysis demonstrates the dominant role of the Rayleigh-Plateau instability in determining the number and wavelength of early undulations, with the Rayleigh-Taylor instability serving to amplify the growth rate of the disturbances. Our findings highlight the critical role of the droplet shape in splash dynamics, which is relevant to a range of applications involving droplet impact."

However, due to the non-convex optimization problem inherent in learning the correct network parameters, the training procedure is prone to converging to local minima, potentially leading to poor performance. In order to avoid this issue, this paper proposes an improved initialization for port-Hamiltonian neural networks. The core idea is to first estimate a linear port-Hamiltonian system to be used as an initialization for the network, after which the neural network adapts to the system nonlinearities, reducing the training times and improving convergence. The effectiveness of this method is tested on a chained mass-spring-damper setup for varying noise levels and compared to the original approach."

    "abstract": "We present a Monte Carlo study of energy extraction from rotating (Kerr) black holes via the Penrose process using rocket propulsion. Through over 250,000 trajectory simulations, we establish sharp constraints on when Penrose extraction with escape to infinity succeeds. The mechanism requires that exhaust ejected inside the ergosphere carries negative Killing energy, which is kinematically accessible only via ultra-relativistic ejection deep within the ergosphere. We find that successful extraction with escape is statistically rare ($\\sim$1% in broad parameter scans) and is governed by strict thresholds: it requires high black hole spin (empirically $a/M \\gtrsim 0.89$) and ultra-relativistic exhaust velocity (onset at $v_e \\approx 0.91c$). When conditions are highly tuned to a specific \"sweet spot,\" success rates can reach 88.5%, representing a narrow extraction window rather than generic behavior. Furthermore, single-impulse thrust at periapsis achieves significantly higher cumulative efficiency ($η_{\\rm cum} \\approx 19\\%$) compared to continuous thrust ($\\sim$2--4%) due to path-averaging penalties. These constraints quantify the extreme fine-tuning required for material-based Penrose extraction, consistent with the astrophysical dominance of electromagnetic mechanisms.

Motivated by this, we propose Multi-head Explicit Attention (MEA), a simple yet effective attention variant that explicitly models cross-head interaction. MEA consists of two key components: a Head-level Linear Composition (HLC) module that separately applies learnable linear combinations to the key and value vectors across heads, thereby enabling rich inter-head communication; and a head-level Group Normalization layer that aligns the statistical properties of the recombined heads. MEA shows strong robustness in pretraining, which allows the use of larger learning rates that lead to faster convergence, ultimately resulting in lower validation loss and improved performance across a range of tasks. Furthermore, we explore the parameter efficiency of MEA by reducing the number of attention heads and leveraging HLC to reconstruct them using low-rank \"virtual heads\". This enables a practical key-value cache compression strategy that reduces KV-cache memory usage by 50% with negligible performance loss on knowledge-intensive and scientific reasoning tasks, and only a 3.59% accuracy drop for Olympiad-level mathematical benchmarks."

While recent efforts aim to improve content diversity, they predominantly operate in static or one-shot settings, neglecting the long-term evolution of user interests. Reinforcement learning provides a principled framework for optimizing long-term user satisfaction by modeling sequential decision-making processes. However, its application in recommendation is hindered by sparse, long-tailed user-item interactions and limited semantic planning capabilities. In this work, we propose LLM-Enhanced Reinforcement Learning (LERL), a novel hierarchical recommendation framework that integrates the semantic planning power of LLM with the fine-grained adaptability of RL. LERL consists of a high-level LLM-based planner that selects semantically diverse content categories, and a low-level RL policy that recommends personalized items within the selected semantic space. This hierarchical design narrows the action space, enhances planning efficiency, and mitigates overexposure to redundant content. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that LERL significantly improves long-term user satisfaction when compared with state-of-the-art baselines.

    "abstract": "The migration of low-mass planets is tightly controlled by the torques exerted by both gas and solids in their natal disks. While canonical models assume a solar solid-to-gas mass ratio (epsilon=0.01) and neglect the back-reaction of solid component of the disk, recent work suggests that enhanced metallicity can radically alter these torques. We quantify how elevated metallicities (epsilon=0.03 and epsilon=0.1) modify the gas and solid torques, test widely used linear scaling prescriptions, and identify the regimes where solid back-reaction becomes decisive. We performed global, 2D hydrodynamic simulations that treat solid material as a pressureless fluid fully coupled to the gas through drag and include the reciprocal back-reaction force. The planet was maintained on a fixed circular orbit, thus we computed static torques. The Stokes number was varied from 0.01 to 10, three surface-density slopes (p=0.5, 1.0, and 1.5) and three accretion efficiencies (eta=0, 10, and 100%) were explored. Torques, obtained by rescaling canonical epsilon=0.01 results, were compared with direct simulations. Solid torques scale linearly with epsilon, but gas torques deviate by 50-100% and can even reverse sign for St<=1 in epsilon=0.1 disks. These are due to strong, feedback-driven, asymmetric gas perturbations in the co-orbital region, amplified by rapid planetary accretion. Solid back-reaction in high-metallicity environments can dominate the migration torque budget of low-mass planets. Simple metallicity rescalings are therefore unreliable for St<=2, implying that precise migration tracks - particularly in metal-rich disks -- require simulations that fully couple solid and gas dynamics. These results highlight metallicity as a key parameter in shaping the early orbital architecture of planetary systems."

We propose a simple, low-cost and robust method based on the analysis of the acoustic response that automatically classifies individual laser pulses as defect-free or defective. We show that the acoustic response captured by a low-cost microphone carries sufficiently informative signatures to reliably distinguish correct from incorrect impacts and enables quality control at the level of single pulses. The method provides a non-destructive and objective route to real-time monitoring of Laser Shock Peening, with the potential to increase process reliability and support industrial deployment of this technology without the need for subsequent destructive measurements."

    "abstract": "In 1993, Robert Strichartz established a characterization for bounded eigenfunctions of the Laplacian on $\\mathbb{R}^d$. Let $\\left\\{f_k \\right\\}_{k\\in \\mathbb{Z}}$ be a doubly infinite sequence of functions on $\\mathbb{R}^d$ satisfying $Δf_k= f_{k+1}$ for all $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. If $\\left\\{f_k \\right\\}$'s are uniformly bounded, then Strichartz proved that $Δf_0= f_0$, thus generalizing a classical result of Roe on the real line. Recognizing that many physically significant eigenfunctions exhibit unbounded behavior, Howard and Reese extended this result to include functions of polynomial growth. Building upon a refined functional-analytic framework, we recently established a broader extension of Strichartz's theorem encompassing eigenfunctions of exponential growth. In the present article, we further investigate the spectral geometry of the Laplacian by replacing the differential operator with a broader class of Fourier multipliers. Specifically, we focus on radial convolution operators, including the spherical average, the ball average, and the heat operator. The central problem addressed is as follows: For a fixed multiplier $Θ$, we consider a doubly infinite sequence of exponentially growing functions $\\{f_k\\}_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}}$ satisfying the recurrence relation $Θf_k = A f_{k+1}$ for a complex constant $A$. We demonstrate that under specific spectral conditions, the functions $f_k$ correspond precisely to the eigenfunctions of the Laplacian $Δ$ on $\\mathbb{R}^d$. This result provides a unified approach to characterization theorems, linking the growth rate of eigenfunctions to the symbol of the associated multiplier."

To this end, a deep autoencoder (DAE) model is employed to infer the ID in the weakly nonlinear regime ($β\\lesssim 1$). We find that the trajectories lie on a nonlinear manifold of dimension $m^{\\ast} = 2$ embedded in a $64$-dimensional phase space.

Finally, we discuss the limitations of the linear approach based on principal component analysis (PCA), which fails to capture the underlying structure of the data and therefore yields unreliable results in most cases."

The formulation derives boundary integral equations from the Stratton-Chu representation for the azimuthal component of the vector potential in both air and conductive regions. The central contribution is a unified regularization framework for the two-dimensional (2D) singular integrals arising in Galerkin BEM. This framework handles both logarithmic and Cauchy singularities through a common set of integral transformations, eliminating the need for case-by-case analytical singularity extraction and enabling straightforward numerical quadrature. The regularization and quadrature stability are proved and verified numerically. The method is validated on several representative axisymmetric geometries, including cylindrical, conical, and spherical shells. Numerical experiments demonstrate consistently high accuracy and computational efficiency across broad frequency ranges and coil lift-off distances. The results confirm that the proposed axisymmetric Galerkin BEM, combined with the integral transformation technique, provides a robust and efficient framework for axisymmetric eddy-current nondestructive evaluation."

The key geometric object governing the new CRB is the tangent cone to the constraint set, whose span determines how the constraints affect the estimation accuracy. This CRB subsumes, unifies, and generalizes known special cases, offering an intuitive and broadly applicable framework to characterize the minimum mean-square error of constrained estimators."

Here, we present Omni-MATH-2, a manually revised version of the Omni-MATH dataset comprising a clean, exact-answer subset ($n{=}4181$) and a tagged, non-standard subset ($n{=}247$). Each problem was audited to ensure LaTeX compilability, solvability and verifiability, which involved adding missing figures or information, labeling problems requiring a proof, estimation or image, and removing clutter. This process significantly reduces dataset-induced noise, thereby providing a more precise assessment of model performance. The annotated dataset also allows us to evaluate judge-induced noise by comparing GPT-5 mini with the original Omni-Judge, revealing substantial discrepancies between judges on both the clean and tagged problem subsets. Expert annotations reveal that Omni-Judge is wrong in $96.4\\%$ of the judge disagreements, indicating its inability to differentiate between models' abilities, even well before saturation of the benchmark occurs. As problems become more challenging, we find that increasingly competent judges become essential in order to prevent judge errors from masking genuine differences between models. Finally, neither judge identifies the present failure modes for the subset of tagged problems, demonstrating that dataset quality and judge reliability are both critical to develop accurate benchmarks of model performance."

Using the recently developed generalized perturbative reduction method (GPRM) the SIT equations are reduced to vector (coupled) nonlinear Schrodinger equations for auxiliary functions. This approach demonstrates that, unlike McCall and Hahn SIT theory in which single-component scalar breather can propagate independently, in the more general theory of SIT the second derivatives with respect to the spatial coordinate and time of the wave equation play a significant role and describe the interaction of two scalar SIT breathers forming a coupled pair. This is a vector 0πpulse of SIT - a two-component vector breather oscillating with the sum and difference of frequencies and wave numbers. The profile, parameters and properties of this pulse differ significantly from the characteristics of the McCall and Hahn pulses. Using GPRM it is shown that besides the scalar soliton and the scalar breather, the vector $0π$ pulse is also a universal nonlinear wave, arising in virtually all areas of physics where nonlinear phenomena are described by nonlinear equations containing second-order and higher-order derivatives. A number of such nonlinear equations are presented. Among them almost all well known nonlinear equations, as well as the general fourth-order nonlinear partial differential equation and the sixth-order generalized Boussinesq-type equations."

This quantity is directly related to the confining mechanism which generates the flux tube and can be used to test its properties. We study a wide range of different values of lattice spacing, temperature and flux tube lengths and show that our data are precise enough to distinguish between different confining models. In particular we show that at high temperatures (just below the deconfinement transition) the data are perfectly described by an Ising-like effective model based on the Svetitsky-Yaffe mapping. At lower temperatures this approximation does not hold anymore. In this regime (which is the most interesting one from a physical point of view) we test several alternative proposals and show that the dual superconductor model is the one which better fits the data. However, this proposal is not fully satisfactory, because the values of the Ginzburg-Landau parameter extracted from the fits increase with the length of the flux tube, which is not a feature predicted by the model. This suggests that a more sophisticated model is needed to explain confinement in non-abelian gauge theories and, at the same time, that our data on the intrinsic width may be a powerful tool to benchmark these candidates."

Using the quantum defect theory, we obtain analytical solutions for both repulsive and attractive $1/r^3$ interactions. The obtained discrete-scale-invariant energies and wave functions, validated by excellent agreement with numerical results, provide a natural framework for describing the universality of Efimov states in mixed dimension. Specifically, we consider a three-body system consisting of two heavy particles with large dipole moments confined to a quasi-one-dimensional geometry and resonantly interacting with an unconfined light particle. With the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, this system is effectively reduced to the Schrödinger equation with $1/r^3$ and $1/r^2$ potentials, and manifests the Efimov effect. Our analytical solution suggests that, for repulsive dipole interactions, the three-body parameter of the mixed-dimensional Efimov states is universally set by the dipolar length scale, whereas for attractive interactions it explicitly depends on the short-range phase. We also investigate the effects of finite transverse confinement and find that our analytical results are useful for describing the Efimov states composed of two polar molecules and a light atom."

From the perspective of neuroscience, we rethink the formation and evolution of intelligence and proposes a new neural network paradigm, Brain-like Neural Network (BNN). We further present the first instantiation of a BNN termed LuminaNet that operates without convolutions or self-attention and is capable of autonomously modifying its architecture. We conduct extensive experiments demonstrating that LuminaNet can achieve self-evolution through dynamic architectural changes. On the CIFAR-10, LuminaNet achieves top-1 accuracy improvements of 11.19%, 5.46% over LeNet-5 and AlexNet, respectively, outperforming MLP-Mixer, ResMLP, and DeiT-Tiny among MLP/ViT architectures. On the TinyStories text generation task, LuminaNet attains a perplexity of 8.4, comparable to a single-layer GPT-2-style Transformer, while reducing computational cost by approximately 25% and peak memory usage by nearly 50%.

Nevertheless, cross-chain address reuse appears to be a recurring phenomenon, especially in EVM-based designs. Previous works performed either direct address matching, or basic format conversion, to identify such cases. However, seemingly incompatible address formats e.g., in Bitcoin and Ethereum, can also be derived from the same public keys, since they rely on the same cryptographic primitives. In this paper, we therefore focus on the underlying public keys to discover reuse within, as well as across, different cryptocurrency networks, enabling us to also match incompatible address formats. Specifically, we analyze key reuse across Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Dogecoin, Zcash and Tron. Our results reveal that cryptographic keys are extensively and actively reused across these networks, negatively impacting both privacy and security of their users. We are hence the first to expose and quantify cross-chain key reuse between UTXO and account-based cryptocurrencies. Moreover, we devise novel clustering methods across these different cryptocurrency networks that do not rely on heuristics and instead link entities by their knowledge of the underlying secret key."

The modulation of phase coherence leads to quantum phase transitions, serving as an important tool for the study of unconventional superconductivity. Here, we demonstrate bosonic phases across the superconductor-insulator transitions in infinite-layer nickelate superconducting films by the control of spatially periodic network patterns. Magnetoresistance oscillations with a periodicity of h/2e provide direct evidence of 2e Cooper pairing in nickelates. The phase transitions are predominantly driven by enhanced superconducting fluctuations, with Cooper pairs involved in the charge transport across the transitions. Notably, we observe two types of anomalous metallic phases, emerging respectively in finite and down to zero magnetic fields. They can be characterized by bosonic excitations, suggesting the dynamic roles of vortices at the ground states. Our work establishes nickelates as a key platform for investigating the rich landscape of bosonic phases controlled via the phase coherence of Cooper pairs."

To robustly handle these heterogeneous settings, we develop a two-stage solution. In the first round, we use reverse per-Gaussian parallel optimization and compact forward splatting based on Taming-GS and Speedy-splat, load-balanced tiling, an anchor-based Neural-Gaussian representation enabling rapid convergence with fewer learnable parameters, initialization from monocular depth and partially from feed-forward 3DGS models, and a global pose refinement module for noisy SLAM trajectories. In the final round, the accurate COLMAP poses change the optimization landscape; we disable pose refinement, revert from Neural-Gaussians back to standard 3DGS to eliminate MLP inference overhead, introduce multi-view consistency-guided Gaussian splitting inspired by Fast-GS, and introduce a depth estimator to supervise the rendered depth. Together, these techniques enable high-fidelity reconstruction under a strict one-minute budget. Our method achieved the top performance with a PSNR of 28.43 and ranked first in the competition."

Existing vector steering methods adjust the magnitude of answer vectors, but this creates a fundamental trade-off -- reducing jailbreak increases over-refusal and vice versa. We identify the root cause: LLMs encode the decision to answer (answer vector $v_a$) and the judgment of input safety (benign vector $v_b$) as nearly orthogonal directions, treating them as independent processes. We propose LLM-VA, which aligns $v_a$ with $v_b$ through closed-form weight updates, making the model's willingness to answer causally dependent on its safety assessment -- without fine-tuning or architectural changes. Our method identifies vectors at each layer using SVMs, selects safety-relevant layers, and iteratively aligns vectors via minimum-norm weight modifications. Experiments on 12 LLMs demonstrate that LLM-VA achieves 11.45% higher F1 than the best baseline while preserving 95.92% utility, and automatically adapts to each model's safety bias without manual tuning.

This establishes the existence of a causal, stable, and thermodynamically consistent relativistic kinetic theory whose hydrodynamic sector is governed exactly by diffusion at all wavelengths. We further demonstrate that the standard arguments for instability arise from considering solutions that admit no counterpart in kinetic theory, and that apparent violations of causality disappear once signals are defined in terms of the underlying microscopic data."

Using a simple model we demonstrate the dependence on the spectrum of radiation emitted by strings. We then study the radiation emitted by perturbed straight strings paying particular attention to the difference between the overall phase of the field and the small perturbations about the string solution which are the axions. We find that a significant correction is required to be sure that one is analyzing the axions and not the self-field of the string. Typically this requires one to excise a sizeable region around the string - something which is not usually done in the case of numerical field theory simulations of string networks. We have measured the spectrum of radiation from these strings and find that it is compatible with an exponential, as predicted by the Nambu-like Kalb-Ramond action, and in particular is not a ``hard'' spectrum often found in string network simulations. We conclude by attempting to assess the uncertainties on relic density and find that this leads to a range of possible axion masses when compared to the measured density from the Cosmic Microwave Background, albeit that they are typically higher than what is predicted by the Initial Misalignment Mechanism. If the decay is via a ``soft spectrum'' from loops produced close to the backreaction scale we find that $m_{\\rm a}\\approx 160\\,μ{\\rm eV}$ and a detection frequency $f\\approx 38\\,{\\rm GHz}$.

Using tetragonal zirconia (tZrO2) facing a series of face-centered cubic (fcc) metals as the model system, this work investigates the short-range and long-range charge redistributions across metal-oxide interfaces by coupling density functional theory (DFT) calculations with continuum modeling. We show that metal-oxide contact induces a short-range charge redistribution confined to a few atomic layers and a long-range redistribution of space charge that can extend over macroscopic distances within weakly doped oxides. DFT calculations show that the short-range redistribution is dominated by metal induced gap states (MIGS) in tZrO2 facing noble metals like Au and Ag, and by chemical bonding in tZrO2 facing active metals like Al. DFT-informed continuum theoretical analysis shows that the range of space-charge redistribution is governed by the doping level of tZrO2, and that the Schottky barrier height (SBH) exhibits a stronger dependence on the metal work function than the doping level. Both the short-range and long-range charge redistributions can alter the transport of charge carriers via their associated electric fields, extending several nm to hundreds of nm from the interface, depending on the doping concentrations, suggesting possible heterogeneous oxide growth caused by NMIs."

In this work we study the numerical prediction of $|\\langle m \\rangle_{ee}|$ in the scenario of deviation from the $μ$-$τ$ reflection symmetry due to radiative corrections, as an extension of our earlier work \\cite{pegu}. In \\cite{pegu}, we consider an exact $μ$-$τ$ reflection symmetry in the light effective Majorana neutrino mass matrix and in the corresponding lepton mixing matrix as well at the seesaw scale. We choose numerical values of all the mixing parameters and neutrino mass eigenvalues at the seesaw scale as inputs and estimate the values of mass eigenvalues and mixing parameters at the electroweak scale due to radiative corrections. We find these low energy predictions consistent with global $3σ$ oscillation data. In the present work, we compute the effective Majorana neutrino mass $|\\langle m \\rangle_{ee}|$ using these low energy values at the electroweak scale.

    "abstract": "The simplest approach to include a mass into the electromagnetic vector potential is to modify the Einstein-Maxwell action to the Einstein-Proca form. There are currently no exact analytical solutions for this scenario. However, by using perturbation theory, where both the Proca mass and the black hole charge are small parameters, it is possible to find an exact analytical solution. In this solution, the metric tensor remains unchanged, but the vector potential deviates from the Coulomb potential. In particular, even if the Proca mass is limited by the value $m_γ<10^{-48}\\text{g}$, which is the current experimental upper limit for photon mass, it makes a significant contribution to the dynamical equations. In this paper, we study the motion of neutral and charged particles in the vicinity of a weakly Proca-charged black hole, and test the observational implications of the solution of the Einstein-Proca equations for gravitational bending, the black hole shadow, and the fit to the orbits of the Galactic center flares observed by the near-infrared GRAVITY instrument. We find that only extremely cold photons, which are likely scattered before reaching a distant observer, could reveal the non-zero photon mass effect through the black hole shadow. For the Galactic center flare analysis we obtained constraints on the dimensionless Proca parameter to $μ\\leq 0.125$ for the electric interaction parameter in the range $-1.1 < \\mathrm{Q} < 0.5$, which can be potentially tested by future GRAVITY flare astrometry. Since the Proca parameter is coupled to the black hole mass, the effect of the Proca charge becomes more pronounced for supermassive black holes compared to stellar-mass objects. Our perturbative treatment remains valid essentially up to the horizon, with divergences appearing only in the immediate near-horizon region, where a fully non-perturbative analysis would be required."

In this work we investigate how spacetime non-metricity can be probed through high-precision observations, focusing on atomic clocks and gravitational waves as complementary tools. Working within Weyl geometry as a minimal realization of vectorial non-metricity, we formulate observable effects in a gauge-invariant manner and show that they are associated with path-dependent length transport governed by the Weyl field strength. We derive constraints from atomic-clock experiments and demonstrate that, although gravitational waves do not directly source the Weyl field at linear order, its dynamical contribution induces a backreaction on gravitational-wave propagation, leading to an anomalous strain. As a result, the absence of deviations from General Relativity in current gravitational-wave observations already places meaningful and strong constraints on dynamical non-metric degrees of freedom."

Conventional solutions to obstructions rely on a bulky compound optics array or computational inpainting, which compromise compactness or fidelity. Metalenses composed of subwavelength meta-atoms promise compact imaging, but simultaneous achievement of broadband and obstruction-free imaging remains a challenge, since a metalens that images distant scenes across a broadband spectrum cannot properly defocus near-depth occlusions. Here, we introduce a learned split-spectrum metalens that enables broadband obstruction-free imaging. Our approach divides the spectrum of each RGB channel into pass and stop bands with multi-band spectral filtering and learns the metalens to focus light from far objects through pass bands, while filtering focused near-depth light through stop bands. This optical signal is further enhanced using a neural network. Our learned split-spectrum metalens achieves broadband and obstruction-free imaging with relative PSNR gains of 32.29% and improves object detection and semantic segmentation accuracies with absolute gains of +13.54% mAP, +48.45% IoU, and +20.35% mIoU over a conventional hyperbolic design. This promises robust obstruction-free sensing and vision for space-constrained systems, such as mobile robots, drones, and endoscopes."

Model serving systems accept latency SLOs directly. LLM routers do not. They force operators to tune parameters offline and guess what accuracy might result. The relationship between parameters and outcomes is indirect, non-monotonic, and dataset-dependent. Operators need to specify accuracy targets, not infer them from opaque settings. We present PROTEUS (Polymorphic Router for Operational Target Enforcement with Unified SLA), a router that accepts accuracy targets tau as runtime input. PROTEUS uses Lagrangian dual control. A learned dual variable lambda tracks constraint violations during training and conditions the policy network. This lets the router translate specified tau values into routing decisions that satisfy them. A single trained model serves the full accuracy spectrum without retraining.We evaluate on RouterBench (11 models, 405K queries) and SPROUT (14 models, 45K queries). PROTEUS achieves consistent floor compliance where accuracy meets or exceeds tau. The target-response correlation reaches 0.97 to 0.98. The closest baseline, OmniRouter, meets floors only 22% of the time despite also using Lagrangian optimization. PROTEUS operates across tau in [0.85, 0.95] from a single model. On RouterBench it achieves 90.1% accuracy, within 1.3% of oracle. On SPROUT it achieves 94.0% accuracy, within 4.6% of oracle. Cost savings reach 89.8% versus the best fixed model."

We show that, in this scenario, the observed low-frequency synchrotron emissions (from 22 MHz to 1.4 GHz) can provide stringent constraints on PBH abundance.

In this paper, we propose a physics-informed Transformer operator (PITO) and its implicit variant (PIITO) for predicting three-dimensional (3D) turbulence, which are developed based on the vision Transformer (ViT) architecture with an appropriate patch size. Given the current flow field, the Transformer operator computes its prediction for the next time step. By embedding the large-eddy simulation (LES) equations into the loss function, PITO and PIITO can learn solution operators without using labeled data. Furthermore, PITO can automatically learn the subgrid scale (SGS) coefficient using a single set of flow data during training. Both PITO and PIITO exhibit excellent stability and accuracy on the predictions of various statistical properties and flow structures for the situation of long-term extrapolation exceeding 25 times the training horizon in decaying homogeneous isotropic turbulence (HIT), and outperform the physics-informed Fourier neural operator (PIFNO). Furthermore, PITO exhibits a remarkable accuracy on the predictions of forced HIT where PIFNO fails. Notably, PITO and PIITO reduce GPU memory consumption by 79.5\\% and 91.3\\% while requiring only 31.5\\% and 3.1\\% of the parameters, respectively, compared to PIFNO.

Validated across translation, summarization and clinical note-generation, our framework identifies critical errors, such as content omissions and factual contradictions, missed by standard metrics. A key contribution is a systematic robustness analysis to select a stable judge model. Crucially, the strong correlation between our reference-free and with-reference modes validates CEF's reliability without gold references.

To address these challenges, we propose a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) to explicitly describe complex sampling strategies through composable sampling operators. This formalism supports both the specification and the reasoning about the generalizability of results based on the applied sampling strategies. We implement the DSL as a Python-based fluent API, and demonstrate how it facilitates representativeness reasoning using statistical indicators extracted from sampling workflows. We validate our approach through a case study of MSR papers involving code repository sampling. Our results show that the DSL can model the sampling strategies reported in recent literature."

Unlike traditional interference exploitation precoding (IEP) which relies on computational hardware circuitry, we perform the precoding operations within the analog wave domain provided by SIMs. However, the benefits of SIM-enabled IEP are limited by the nonlinear distortion (NLD) caused by power amplifiers. A hardware-efficient interference-free transmitter architecture is developed to exploit SIM's high and flexible degree of freedom (DoF), where the NLD on modulated symbols can be directly compensated in the wave domain. Moreover, we design a frame-level SIM configuration scheme and formulate a maxmin problem on the safety margin function. With respect to the optimization of SIM phase shifts, we propose a recursive oblique manifold (ROM) algorithm to tackle the complex coupling among phase shifts across multiple layers. A flexible DoF-driven antenna selection (AS) scheme is explored in the SIM-enabled IEP system. Using an ROM-based alternating optimization (ROM-AO) framework, our approach jointly optimizes transmit AS, SIM phase shift design, and power allocation (PA), and develops a greedy safety margin-based AS algorithm. Simulations show that the proposed SIM-enabled frame-level IEP scheme significantly outperforms benchmarks. Specifically, the strategy with AS and PA can achieve a 20 dB performance gain compared to the case without any strategy under the 12 dB signal-to-noise ratio, which confirms the superiority of the NLD-aware IEP scheme and the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm."

We establish the martingale characterization of the q-function under Tsallis entropy for continuous-time Markov regime-switching systems.

    "abstract": "Accurately predicting procurement lead time (PLT) remains a challenge in engineered-to-order industries such as shipbuilding and plant construction, where delays in a single key component can disrupt project timelines. In shipyards, pipe spools are critical components; installed deep within hull blocks soon after steel erection, any delay in their procurement can halt all downstream tasks. Recognizing their importance, existing studies predict PLT using the static physical attributes of pipe spools. However, procurement is inherently a dynamic, multi-stakeholder business process involving a continuous sequence of internal and external events at the shipyard, factors often overlooked in traditional approaches. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel framework that combines event logs, dataset records of the procurement events, with static attributes to predict PLT. The temporal attributes of each event are extracted to reflect the continuity and temporal context of the process. Subsequently, a deep sequential neural network combined with a multi-layered perceptron is employed to integrate these static and dynamic features, enabling the model to capture both structural and contextual information in procurement. Comparative experiments are conducted using real-world pipe spool procurement data from a globally renowned South Korean shipbuilding corporation. Three tasks are evaluated, which are production, post-processing, and procurement lead time prediction. The results show a 22.6% to 50.4% improvement in prediction performance in terms of mean absolute error over the best-performing existing approaches across the three tasks. These findings indicate the value of considering procurement process information for more accurate PLT prediction."

    "abstract": "The magnetic compression experiment at General Fusion was a repetitive non-destructive test to study plasma physics applicable to magnetic target fusion compression. A compact torus (CT) is formed with a co-axial gun into a containment region with an hour-glass shaped inner flux conserver, and an insulating outer wall. External coil currents keep the CT off the outer wall (radial levitation) and then rapidly compress it inwards. The optimal external coil configuration greatly improved both the levitated CT lifetime and the recurrence rate of shots with good compressional flux conservation. As confirmed by spectrometer data, the improved levitation field profile reduced plasma impurity levels by suppressing the interaction between plasma and the insulating outer wall during the formation process. Significant increases in magnetic field, electron density, and ion temperature were routinely observed at magnetic compression in the final external coil configuration tested, despite the prevalence of an instability, thought be an external kink mode, at compression. Matching the decay rate of the levitation currents to that of the CT currents resulted in a reduced level of MHD activity associated with unintentional compression by the levitation field, and a higher probability of long-lived CTs. The DELiTE (Differential Equations on Linear Triangular Elements) framework was developed for spatial discretisation of partial differential equations on an unstructured triangular grid in axisymmetric geometry. The framework is based on discrete differential operators in matrix form, which are derived using linear finite elements and mimic some of the properties of their continuous counterparts. A single-fluid two-temperature MHD model is implemented in this framework."

However, their high-dimensionality, heterogeneity, and sparsity make clinical prediction challenging. Large Language Models (LLMs) allowed progress towards addressing this challenge by leveraging parametric medical knowledge to enhance EHR data for clinical prediction tasks. Despite the significant achievements made so far, most of the existing approaches are fundamentally task-agnostic in the sense that they deploy LLMs as EHR encoders or EHR completion modules without fully integrating signals from the prediction tasks. This naturally hinders task performance accuracy. In this work, we propose Rewrite-To-Predict (ReToP), an LLM-based framework that addresses this limitation through an end-to-end training of an EHR rewriter and a clinical predictor. To cope with the lack of EHR rewrite training data, we generate synthetic pseudo-labels using clinical-driven feature selection strategies to create diverse patient rewrites for fine-tuning the EHR rewriter. ReToP aligns the rewriter with prediction objectives using a novel Classifier Supervised Contribution (CSC) score that enables the EHR rewriter to generate clinically relevant rewrites that directly enhance prediction. Our ReToP framework surpasses strong baseline models across three clinical tasks on MIMIC-IV. Moreover, the analysis of ReToP shows its generalizability to unseen datasets and tasks with minimal fine-tuning while preserving faithful rewrites and emphasizing task-relevant predictive features."

    "abstract": "Diffusion models achieve remarkable generation quality, yet face a fundamental challenge known as memorization, where generated samples can replicate training samples exactly. We develop a theoretical framework to explain this phenomenon by showing that the empirical score function (the score function corresponding to the empirical distribution) is a weighted sum of the score functions of Gaussian distributions, in which the weights are sharp softmax functions. This structure causes individual training samples to dominate the score function, resulting in sampling collapse. In practice, approximating the empirical score function with a neural network can partially alleviate this issue and improve generalization. Our theoretical framework explains why: In training, the neural network learns a smoother approximation of the weighted sum, allowing the sampling process to be influenced by local manifolds rather than single points. Leveraging this insight, we propose two novel methods to further enhance generalization: (1) Noise Unconditioning enables each training sample to adaptively determine its score function weight to increase the effect of more training samples, thereby preventing single-point dominance and mitigating collapse. (2) Temperature Smoothing introduces an explicit parameter to control the smoothness. By increasing the temperature in the softmax weights, we naturally reduce the dominance of any single training sample and mitigate memorization. Experiments across multiple datasets validate our theoretical analysis and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods in improving generalization while maintaining high generation quality."

The problem becomes challenging when the system model is unknown. Among the Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms that have been successfully applied to solve problems pertaining to unknown linear dynamical systems, the policy gradient (PG) method stands out due to its ease of implementation and can solve the problem in a model-free manner. However, most of the existing works on PG methods for unknown linear dynamical systems assume full-state feedback. In this paper, we take a step towards model-free learning for partially observable linear dynamical systems with output feedback and focus on the fundamental stabilization problem of the system. We propose an algorithmic framework that stretches the boundary of PG methods to the problem without global convergence guarantees. We show that by leveraging zeroth-order PG update based on system trajectories and its convergence to stationary points, the proposed algorithms return a stabilizing output feedback policy for discrete-time linear dynamical systems. We also explicitly characterize the sample complexity of our algorithm and verify the effectiveness of the algorithm using numerical examples."

    "abstract": "Recent progress in Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning is increasingly driven by the refinement of post-training loss functions and alignment strategies. However, standard Reinforcement Learning (RL) paradigms like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) remain constrained by static uniformity: uniform prompt sampling and a fixed number of rollouts per prompt. For heterogeneous, heavy-tailed reasoning data, this creates structural inefficiencies that waste compute on already-solved patterns while under-training the long tail of hard problems. To address this, we propose Multi-Adversary Group Distributionally Robust Optimization (GDRO), an optimization-first framework that moves beyond uniform reasoning models by dynamically adapting the training distribution. We introduce an Online Difficulty Classifier that partitions prompts into dynamic pass@k difficulty groups. We then propose two independent GDRO games for post-training: (1) Prompt-GDRO, which employs an EMA-debiased multiplicative-weights bandit sampler to target the intensive difficulty margin and upweight persistently hard groups without frequency bias; and (2) Rollout-GDRO, which uses a shadow-price controller to reallocate rollouts across groups, maximizing gradient variance reduction on hard tasks under a fixed mean budget (compute-neutral). We provide no-regret guarantees for both controllers and additionally a variance-proxy analysis motivating a square-root optimal rollout allocation for Rollout-GDRO. We validate our framework on the DAPO 14.1k dataset using Qwen3-Base models. Prompt-GDRO and Rollout-GDRO achieve average relative gains of +10.6% and +10.1%, respectively, in pass@8 accuracy across 1.7B, 4B, and 8B scales compared to the GRPO baseline. Qualitative analysis shows an emergent curriculum: the adversaries shift resources to the evolving reasoning frontier, enhancing the reasoning model's performance."

However, existing widely adopted model-based draft designs, such as EAGLE3, improve accuracy at the cost of multi-step autoregressive inference, resulting in high drafting latency and ultimately rendering the drafting stage itself a performance bottleneck. Inspired by diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs), we propose DART, which leverages parallel generation to reduce drafting latency. DART predicts logits for multiple future masked positions in parallel within a single forward pass based on hidden states of the target model, thereby eliminating autoregressive rollouts in the draft model while preserving a lightweight design. Based on these parallel logit predictions, we further introduce an efficient tree pruning algorithm that constructs high-quality draft token trees with N-gram-enforced semantic continuity. DART substantially reduces draft-stage overhead while preserving high draft accuracy, leading to significantly improved end-to-end decoding speed. Experimental results demonstrate that DART achieves a 2.03x--3.44x wall-clock time speedup across multiple datasets, surpassing EAGLE3 by 30% on average and offering a practical speculative decoding framework.

Differentiating the structure relation yields explicit expressions for the derivatives of i(x,y) in terms of the coefficient functions alpha and beta, leading to a universal transport system governing their admissible variations. In the elliptic regime this system reduces to a forced complex Burgers equation for a scalar spectral parameter encoding the structure coefficients. We identify a rigidity condition under which the transport becomes conservative, and show that in this regime the generalized Cauchy Riemann operator satisfies a Leibniz rule and admits a factorization of the associated second order operator into first order components. As a consequence, classical tools of planar complex analysis, including Cauchy Pompeiu type formulas, integral representations, and elliptic second order operators, reappear in a variable coefficient setting with explicit structure. The theory is developed at the level of direct computation, emphasizing transparency of the integrability mechanism and the interplay between transport dynamics, rigidity, and function theory."

While this accelerates software development and supports learning, it also raises new risks for academic integrity, authorship attribution, and responsible AI use. This paper investigates the problem of distinguishing human-written from machine-generated code by comparing two complementary approaches: feature-based detectors built from lightweight, interpretable stylometric and structural properties of code, and embedding-based detectors leveraging pretrained code encoders. Using a recent large-scale benchmark dataset of 600k human-written and AI-generated code samples, we find that feature-based models achieve strong performance (ROC-AUC 0.995, PR-AUC 0.995, F1 0.971), while embedding-based models with CodeBERT embeddings are also very competitive (ROC-AUC 0.994, PR-AUC 0.994, F1 0.965). Analysis shows that features tied to indentation and whitespace provide particularly discriminative cues, whereas embeddings capture deeper semantic patterns and yield slightly higher precision. These findings underscore the trade-offs between interpretability and generalization, offering practical guidance for deploying robust code-origin detection in academic and industrial contexts."

In many AI for science tasks, labeled data are expensive to obtain and therefore limited in availability. Under the few-shot setting, models trained with scarce supervision often learn brittle structure-property relationships, resulting in substantially higher prediction errors and reduced generalization to unseen molecules. To address this limitation, we propose PCEvo, a path-consistent representation method that learns from virtual paths through dynamic structural evolution. PCEvo enumerates multiple chemically feasible edit paths between retrieved similar molecular pairs under topological dependency constraints. It transforms the labels of the two molecules into stepwise supervision along each virtual evolutionary path. It introduces a path-consistency objective that enforces prediction invariance across alternative paths connecting the same two molecules. Comprehensive experiments on the QM9 and MoleculeNet datasets demonstrate that PCEvo substantially improves the few-shot generalization performance of baseline methods.

We quantify this behaviour using the PA variance ratio $\\mathcal{R}_ψ$ and explore the joint plane of measured linear polarisation fraction $Π_L$ versus PA variance to constrain the allowed parameter space of microshot number $N$, intrinsic PA dispersion $σ_ψ$, and intrinsic linear fraction $Π_{L,0}$ at fixed signal-to-noise. For FRB~20191001A, the data are consistent with an extended region spanning $σ_ψ\\sim 10^\\circ$--$30^\\circ$ and $N \\sim 5$--$1000$, reflecting degeneracies between intrinsic PA structure, microshot superposition, scattering, finite sampling, and noise. FRB~20240318A occupies a more restricted region, favouring fewer microshots ($N \\lesssim 20$) and larger intrinsic PA dispersion ($σ_ψ\\sim 15$--$23^\\circ$), depending on $Π_{L,0}$, consistent with its observed PA variability. By combining an emission-mechanism-independent framework with minimal assumptions and observational constraints, FIRES provides direct, quantitative constraints on the space of viable FRB microphysical models and demonstrates that microshot superposition offers a natural explanation for the diverse polarimetric behaviours observed in FRBs."

Whereas simulations of $T_2$ are easy, $T_2^{\\prime}$ is not easily simulated if only magnetizations of individual isochromats are simulated. Theory and Methods: Efficient methods for simulating $T_2^{\\prime}$ were proposed. To approximate the Lorentzian function of $T_2^{\\prime}$ realistically, conventional simulators require 100+ isochromats. This approximation can be avoided by utilizing a linear phase model for simulating an entire Lorentzian function directly. To represent the linear phase model, the partial derivatives of the magnetizations with respect to the frequency axis were also simulated. To accelerate the simulations with these partial derivatives, the proposed methods introduced two techniques: analytic solutions, and combined transitions. For understanding the fundamental mechanism of the proposed method, a simple one-isochromat simulation was performed. For evaluating realistic cases, several pulse sequences were simulated using two phantoms with and without $T_2^{\\prime}$ simulations. Results: The one-isochromat simulation demonstrated that $T_2^{\\prime}$ simulations were possible. In the realistic cases, $T_2^{\\prime}$ was recovered as expected without using 100+ isochromats for each point. The computational times with $T_2^{\\prime}$ simulations were only 2.0 to 2.7 times longer than those without $T_2^{\\prime}$ simulations. When the above-mentioned two techniques were utilized, the analytic solutions accelerated 19 times, and the combined transitions accelerated up to 17 times. Conclusion: Both theory and results showed that the proposed methods simulated $T_2^{\\prime}$ efficiently by utilizing a linear model with a Lorentzian function, analytic solutions, and combined transitions."

To fill this gap, we first explore the representational properties of the RWKV state by proposing the DREAMSTATE framework. This framework utilizes a conditional Diffusion Transformer (DiT) to directly model the probability manifold of the state, enabling its generation and editing. The structural nature of this representation is validated through t-SNE visualizations and controlled generation experiments. After successfully uncovering and modeling the state's representational potential, we further propose a novel hybrid architecture that combines the local advantages of RNNs with global context adaptability. This architecture features a parallel DiT that processes a variable-length global context to dynamically generate and adjust the core recurrent module's WKV parameters, transforming the fixed recurrence mechanism into a context-aware dynamic function. Experiments demonstrate that this hybrid model can be trained stably via a multi-objective loss, validating its design feasibility. Our work not only opens a new research direction for RNN state representation but also provides a concrete architectural reference for future model design.

This refines a recent result by Karpukhin that answers a question by El Soufi, Ilias, and Ros. Also, we are able to show that if a rotationally invariant metric on a rectangular torus is maximal for $\\barλ_1$ in its conformal class, then it is $\\mathbb S^1$-equivariant and coincides (up to a scalar factor) with the above metric. Finally, we show that a family of minimal tori in $\\mathbb S^3$ called Otsuki tori fits naturally into our family. This gives an explicit parametrization of Otsuki tori in terms of elliptic integrals."

    "abstract": "Quantum Random Access Codes (QRACs) embody the fundamental trade-off between the compressibility of information into limited quantum resources and the accessibility of that information, serving as a cornerstone of quantum communication and computation. In particular, the $(n, n-1)$-QRACs, which encode $n$ bits of classical information into $n-1$ qubits, provides an ideal theoretical model for verifying quantum advantage in high-dimensional spaces; however, the analytical derivation of optimal codes for general $n$ has remained an open problem. In this paper, we establish an analytical construction method for $(n, n-1)$-QRACs by using an explicit operator formalism. We prove that this construction strictly achieves the numerically conjectured upper bound of the average success probability, $\\mathcal{P} = 1/2 + \\sqrt{(n-1)/n}/2$, for all $n$. Furthermore, we present a systematic algorithm to decompose the derived optimal POVM into standard quantum gates. Since the resulting decoding circuit consists solely of interactions between adjacent qubits, it can be implemented with a circuit depth of $O(n)$ even under linear connectivity constraints. Additionally, we analyze the high-dimensional limit and demonstrate that while the non-commutativity of measurements is suppressed, an information-theoretic gap of $O(\\log n)$ from the Holevo bound inevitably arises for symmetric encoding. This study not only provides a scalable implementation method for high-dimensional quantum information processing but also offers new insights into the mathematical structure at the quantum-classical boundary."

First, our network employs a dedicated Illumination Stream whose purpose is to predict a spatially varying illumination map that accurately captures lighting distribution. Further, this map is utilized as an explicit guide within our novel Illumination Guided Modulation Block (IGM Block) to dynamically modulate features in the Texture Stream. This mechanism achieves spatially adaptive restoration, enabling the network to intensify enhancement in poorly lit regions while preserving details in well-exposed areas. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GTFMN achieves the best performance among competing methods on the OmniNormal5 and OmniNormal15 datasets, outperforming them in both quantitative metrics and visual quality."

The diagonal component with respect to the crystal momentum gives a metric corresponding to the variance of the time-evolved position, and its coefficient of the quadratic term in time is the group-velocity variance, signaling ballistic wavepacket dispersion. The other diagonal QGT component with respect to time reveals the energy variance. The off-diagonal QGT component features a real part as a covariance and an imaginary part representing a quench-induced curvature. Using the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model as an example, our numerical results of different quenches confirm that the post-quench QGT is governed by physical quantities and local geometric objects from the initial state and post-quench bands, such as the Berry connection, group velocities, and energy variance. Furthermore, the connections between the QGT and physical observables suggest the QGT as a comprehensive probe for nonequilibrium phenomena."

The resulting representation is then used as conditional input for a cINN (conditional Invertible Neural Network) to gain posteriors for merger/assembly statistics, particularly the lookback time and stellar mass of the last major merger and the fraction of ex-situ stars. Through validation against the ground truth available for simulated galaxies, we assess the performance of our model, achieving good accuracy in inferring the stellar ex-situ fraction ($\\le \\pm 10$ per cent for 80 per cent of the test sample) and the mass of the last major merger (within $\\pm 0.5 \\log \\MSUN$ for stellar masses $>10^{9.5} \\MSUN$ ). We successfully apply the TNG-trained model to simulated mocks from the EAGLE simulation, demonstrating that our model is applicable outside of the TNG domain. We use our simulation-based model to infer aspects of the history of observed galaxies, in particular for HSC images that are close to the domain of TNG ones. We recover the trend of increasing ex-situ stellar fraction with stellar mass and more spherical morphology, but we also identify a discrepancy between TNG and HSC: on average, observed galaxies generally exhibit lower ex-situ fractions. Despite challenges such as information loss (e.g. projection effects and surface brightness limits) and domain shifts (from simulations to observations), our results demonstrate the feasibility of extracting the merger past of galaxies from their optical images."

We present an $O(n^4\\log{n})$-time algorithm for computing an optimal solution to the min-sum problem.

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a framework for improving the operational efficiency of automated storage systems under uncertainty. It considers a 2D grid-based storage for uniform-sized loads (e.g., containers, pallets, or totes), which are moved by a robot (or other manipulator) along a collision-free path in the grid. The loads are labeled (i.e., unique) and must be stored in a given sequence, and later be retrieved in a different sequence -- an operational pattern that arises in logistics applications, such as last-mile distribution centers and shipyards. The objective is to minimize the load relocations to ensure efficient retrieval. A previous result guarantees a zero-relocation solution for known storage and retrieval sequences, even for storage at full capacity, provided that the side of the grid through which loads are stored/retrieved is at least 3 cells wide. However, in practice, the retrieval sequence can change after the storage phase. To address such uncertainty, this work investigates \\emph{$k$-bounded perturbations} during retrieval, under which any two loads may depart out of order if they are originally at most $k$ positions apart. We prove that a $Θ(k)$ grid width is necessary and sufficient for eliminating relocations at maximum capacity. We also provide an efficient solver for computing a storage arrangement that is robust to such perturbations. To address the higher-uncertainty case where perturbations exceed $k$, a strategy is introduced to effectively minimize relocations. Extensive experiments show that, for $k$ up to half the grid width, the proposed storage-retrieval framework essentially eliminates relocations. For $k$ values up to the full grid width, relocations are reduced by $50\\%+$."

    "abstract": "User behavior sequences in modern recommendation systems exhibit significant length heterogeneity, ranging from sparse short-term interactions to rich long-term histories. While longer sequences provide more context, we observe that increasing the maximum input sequence length in existing CTR models paradoxically degrades performance for short-sequence users due to attention polarization and length imbalance in training data. To address this, we propose LAIN(Length-Adaptive Interest Network), a plug-and-play framework that explicitly incorporates sequence length as a conditioning signal to balance long- and short-sequence modeling. LAIN consists of three lightweight components: a Spectral Length Encoder that maps length into continuous representations, Length-Conditioned Prompting that injects global contextual cues into both long- and short-term behavior branches, and Length-Modulated Attention that adaptively adjusts attention sharpness based on sequence length. Extensive experiments on three real-world benchmarks across five strong CTR backbones show that LAIN consistently improves overall performance, achieving up to 1.15% AUC gain and 2.25% log loss reduction. Notably, our method significantly improves accuracy for short-sequence users without sacrificing longsequence effectiveness. Our work offers a general, efficient, and deployable solution to mitigate length-induced bias in sequential recommendation."

    "abstract": "Glasses are structurally disordered solids that host, in addition to crystalline-like phonons, vibrational excitations with no direct phononic counterpart. A long-standing universal signature is the excess vibrational density of states~(vDOS) over the Debye prediction, known as the boson peak~(BP), which has been extensively reported via inelastic neutron and X-ray scattering measurements of the dynamical structure factor $S(q,ω)$. Here we quantify the vDOS directly from dynamical-structure-factor data and clarify the microscopic origin of the BP. We contrast two routes to extract the vDOS from $S(q,ω)$: (i) using high-wavenumber $q$ data beyond the Debye wavenumber $q_D$ to access predominantly incoherent scattering and recover the vDOS in a manner analogous to velocity-autocorrelation-based approaches; and (ii) integrating $S(q,ω)$ over the low-$q$ regime below $q_D$, which enables a decomposition of the vDOS into contributions from distinct wavenumber sectors and thereby provides direct access to the spatial character of vibrational modes. Focusing on the second route, we demonstrate that the BP in the vDOS emerges as the spectral consequence of a dispersionless excitation band in $S(q,ω)$. Our main results are obtained from molecular-dynamics simulations, and we further show that the same mechanism is captured by an effective-medium theory for random spring networks, providing a unified interpretation that connects the excess vDOS to the wavenumber-resolved structure of vibrational excitations in glasses."

We propose FBSDiff, a novel framework adapting off-the-shelf T2I diffusion model into the I2I paradigm from a fresh frequency-domain perspective. Through dynamic frequency band substitution of diffusion features, FBSDiff realizes versatile and highly controllable text-driven I2I in a plug-and-play manner (without need for model training, fine-tuning, or online optimization), allowing appearance-guided, layout-guided, and contour-guided I2I translation by progressively substituting low-frequency band, mid-frequency band, and high-frequency band of latent diffusion features, respectively. In addition, FBSDiff flexibly enables continuous control over I2I correlation intensity simply by tuning the bandwidth of the substituted frequency band. To further promote image translation efficiency, flexibility, and functionality, we propose FBSDiff++ which improves upon FBSDiff mainly in three aspects: (1) accelerate inference speed by a large margin (8.9$\\times$ speedup in inference) with refined model architecture; (2) improve the Frequency Band Substitution module to allow for input source images of arbitrary resolution and aspect ratio; (3) extend model functionality to enable localized image manipulation and style-specific content creation with only subtle adjustments to the core method. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments verify superiority of FBSDiff++ in I2I translation visual quality, efficiency, versatility, and controllability compared to related advanced approaches."

The present decomposition is employed with a convolutional neural network, enabling the identification of the spatial continuous mode. In addition, a low-order representation, characterizing the informative vortical structures and their corresponding aerodynamic coefficients, can also be identified by considering autoencoder-based data compression. The present technique is applied to a range of aerodynamic examples, including extreme vortex-gust airfoil interactions, experimentally measured transverse jet-wing interaction, and a turbulent separated wake. For the cases of gust-wing interaction, the time-varying gust effect on the lift response is extracted in an interpretable manner. With the example of a turbulent wake, the relationship between large-scale vortical motion and lift force is identified without any spatial length-scale information. The proposed approach could serve as a foundation for data-driven causal modeling and control for a range of unsteady flows."

    "abstract": "We introduce a minimal multiscale framework that links within-host virus dynamics to population-level SIRS epidemiology through explicit, bidirectional coupling. At the microscopic layer, a two variant quasispecies (master and mutant genomes with packaged virions) evolves on a fast timescale. At the macroscopic layer, two infectious classes (master- and mutant-infected), susceptible, recovered, and deceased individuals evolve slowly. The two scales are connected through transmission rates that depend on instantaneous virion abundance and through prevalence-weighted effective replication rates. Exploiting the timescale separation, we formalize a coarse-grained slow-fast closure: the genome-virion subsystem rapidly relaxes to quasi-steady states that parameterize time-varying transmission in the slow epidemiological system. This yields an integrated expression for the basic reproduction number and sharp inequalities that delineate coexistence versus exclusion. A key prediction is a context-dependent error threshold that shifts with the prevalence ratio, enabling transient pseudo-error catastrophes driven by epidemic composition rather than intrinsic fidelity. Linearization reveals parameter regions with damped oscillations arising solely from the microscopic-macroscopic feedback. Two illustrative extremes bracket the model's behavior: an avirulent strongly immunizing strain that benignly replaces the master, and a hypervirulent weakly immunizing that self-limits via host depletion and collapses transmission. This framework yields testable signatures linking viral load, incidence, and within-host composition."

    "abstract": "Soft robotic grippers are essential for grasping delicate, geometrically complex objects in manufacturing, healthcare and agriculture. However, existing grippers struggle to grasp feature-rich objects with high topological variability, including gears with sharp tooth profiles on automotive assembly lines, corals with fragile protrusions, or vegetables with irregular branching structures like broccoli. Unlike simple geometric primitives such as cubes or spheres, feature-rich objects lack a clear \"optimal\" contact surface, making them both difficult to grasp and susceptible to damage when grasped by existing gripper designs. Safe handling of such objects therefore requires specialized soft grippers whose morphology is tailored to the object's features. Topology optimization offers a promising approach for producing specialized grippers, but its utility is limited by the requirement for pre-defined load cases. For soft grippers interacting with feature-rich objects, these loads arise from hundreds of unpredictable gripper-object contact forces during grasping and are unknown a priori. To address this problem, we introduce SimTO, a framework that enables high-resolution topology optimization by automatically extracting load cases from a contact-based physics simulator, eliminating the need for manual load specification. Given an arbitrary feature-rich object, SimTO produces highly customized soft grippers with fine-grained morphological features tailored to the object geometry. Numerical results show our designs are not only highly specialized to feature-rich objects, but also generalize to unseen objects."

In this paper we show that at the special coupling $b=1/\\sqrt{2}$, the Coulomb-gas expansion of the timelike path integral becomes explicitly computable beyond charge neutrality. The reason is that the $n$-fold integrals generated by the interaction acquire a Vandermonde/determinantal structure at $b=1/\\sqrt{2}$, which allows exact evaluation in terms of classical special functions. We derive Mellin-Barnes type representations (involving the Barnes $G$-function and, in a three-point case, Gauss hypergeometric functions) for the zero- and one-point functions, for an antipodal two-point function, and for a three-point function with a resonant insertion $α_2=b$. We then address the subtle zero-mode integration: after a Gaussian regularization we obtain an explicit renormalized partition function $C(1/\\sqrt{2},μ)=e(4π\\sqrt2 μ)^{-1}$, identify distributional limits in the physically relevant regime $α_j=\\frac{1}{2}Q+\\mathrm{i} P_j$, and compare with the Hankel-contour prescription recently proposed in the physics literature.

    "abstract": "Accurate quantum state readout is crucial for error correction and algorithms, but measurement errors are detrimental. Readout fidelity is typically limited by a poor signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and energy relaxation ($T_1$ decay), a significant problem for superconducting qubits. While most approaches classify results using clustering algorithms on integrated readout signals, these methods cannot distinguish a qubit that was initially in the ground state from one that decayed to it during measurement. We instead propose using machine learning (ML) on the raw, non-integrated analog signal. We apply time-series classification models, such as a long short-term memory (LSTM) network, to the full data trajectory. We find that our LSTM model, combined with filtering and feature engineering, consistently outperforms clustering. The largest improvements come from reclassifying points in the boundary regions between clusters. These points correspond to atypical measurement records, likely due to transient or noisy features lost during data integration. By retaining temporal information, sequence-aware models like LSTMs can better discriminate these trajectories, whereas clustering methods based on integrated values are more prone to misclassification."

    "abstract": "A major public health concern in the United States (US) is gun-related deaths. The number of gun injuries largely varies spatially because of county-wise heterogeneity of race, sex, age, and income distributions. But still, a major challenge is to locally identify the influential socio-economic factors behind these firearm fatality incidents. For a diverging number of predictors, a rich literature exists regarding SCAD under the independence framework; however, a vacuum remains when discussing local variable selection for spatially correlated, over-dispersed data. This research presents a two-step localized variable selection and inference framework for spatially indexed gunshot fatality data. In the first step, we select variables locally using the SCAD penalty for specific locations where the number of gunshot incidents exceeds a threshold. For these locations, after selecting the predictors, we proceed to the next step, which involves examining the directional variation in the latent spatial neighborhood structure. We further discuss the theoretical properties of this county-specific local variable selection under infill asymptotics. This method has threefold advantages: (i) this method selects the variables locally, (ii) this method provides inference about directional variation of a selected predictor, and (iii) instead of assuming the spatial neighborhood structure in an ad hoc manner, this method identifies the specific type of spatial neighborhood structure that is most appropriate for modeling the random effects."

Although multimodal models have advanced across languages, their ability to process Arabic script, especially in artistic and stylized calligraphic forms, remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we present DuwatBench, a benchmark of 1,272 curated samples containing about 1,475 unique words across six classical and modern calligraphic styles, each paired with sentence-level detection annotations. The dataset reflects real-world challenges in Arabic writing, such as complex stroke patterns, dense ligatures, and stylistic variations that often challenge standard text recognition systems. Using DuwatBench, we evaluated 13 leading Arabic and multilingual multimodal models and showed that while they perform well on clean text, they struggle with calligraphic variation, artistic distortions, and precise visual-text alignment. By publicly releasing DuwatBench and its annotations, we aim to advance culturally grounded multimodal research, foster fair inclusion of the Arabic language and visual heritage in AI systems, and support continued progress in this area.

Unlike conventional DMFT approaches that operate in imaginary time or frequency space, our scheme operates directly with real-time quantities. This makes it particularly suitable for near-term quantum computing hardware with limited Hilbert spaces, where real-time propagation can be efficiently implemented via Trotterization or variational quantum algorithms. We map the effective impurity problem to a finite one-dimensional chain with a small number of bath sites, solved via exact diagonalization as a proof-of-concept. The hybridization function is iteratively updated through time-domain fitting until self-consistency. We demonstrate stable convergence across a wide range of interaction strengths for the half-filled Hubbard model on a Bethe lattice, successfully capturing the metal-to-insulator transition. Despite using limited time resolution and a minimal bath discretization, the spectral functions clearly exhibit the emergence of Hubbard bands and the suppression of spectral weight at the Fermi level as interaction strength increases. This overcomes major limitations of two-site DMFT approximations by delivering detailed spectral features while preserving efficiency and compatibility with quantum computing platforms through real-time dynamics."

    "abstract": "Distinct monitoring or intervention schemes can produce different conditioned stochastic quantum trajectories while sharing the same unconditional (ensemble-averaged) dynamics. This is the essence of unravelings of a given Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad (GKSL) master equation: any trajectory-ensemble average of a function that is linear in the conditional state is completely determined by the unconditional density matrix, whereas applying a nonlinear function before averaging can yield unraveling-dependent results beyond the average evolution. A paradigmatic example is resonance fluorescence, where direct photodetection (jump/Poisson) and homodyne or heterodyne detection (diffusive/Wiener) define inequivalent unravelings of the same GKSL dynamics. In earlier work, we showed that nonlinear trajectory averages can distinguish such unravelings, but observing the effect in that optical setting requires demanding experimental precision. Here we translate the same idea to a digital setting by introducing synthetic unravelings implemented as quantum circuits acting on one and two qubits. We design two unravelings - a projective measurement unraveling and a random-unitary \"kick\" unraveling - that share the same ensemble-averaged evolution while yielding different nonlinear conditional-state statistics. We implement the protocols on superconducting-qubit hardware provided by IBM Quantum to access trajectory-level information. We show that the variance across trajectories and the ensemble-averaged von Neumann entropy distinguish the unravelings in both theory and experiment, while the unconditional state and the ensemble-averaged expectation values that are linear in the state remain identical. Our results provide an accessible demonstration that quantum trajectories encode information about measurement backaction beyond what is fixed by the unconditional dynamics."

    "abstract": "This study models a Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) system as a multi-leader-multi-follower game that captures the complex interactions among the MaaS platform, service operators, and travelers. We consider a coopetitive setting where the MaaS platform purchases service capacity from service operators and sells multi-modal trips to travelers following an origin-destination-based pricing scheme; meanwhile, service operators use their remaining capacities to serve single-modal trips. As followers, travelers make both mode choices, including whether to use MaaS, and route choices in the multi-modal transportation network, subject to prices and congestion. Inspired by the dual formulation for traffic assignment problems, we propose a novel single-level variational inequality (VI) formulation by introducing a virtual traffic operator, along with the MaaS platform and multiple service operators. A key advantage of the proposed VI formulation is that it supports parallel solution procedures and thus enables large-scale applications. We prove that an equilibrium solution always exists given the negotiated wholesale price of service capacity. Numerical experiments on a small network further demonstrate that the wholesale price can be tailored to align with varying system-wide objectives. The proposed MaaS system demonstrates potential for creating a \"win-win-win\" outcome -- service operators and travelers are better off compared to the \"without MaaS\" scenario, meanwhile the MaaS platform remains profitable. Such a Pareto-improving regime can be explicitly specified with the wholesale capacity price. Similar conclusions are drawn from the experiment of an extended multi-modal Sioux Falls network, which also validates the scalability of the proposed model and solution algorithm."

We present a repeated exposure study with six blind participants who interacted with a navigation-assistive robot in a real-world museum. Participants completed tasks such as navigating crowds, approaching lines, and encountering obstacles. Findings show that participants refined their strategies over time, developing clearer preferences about when to rely on the robot versus act independently.

    "abstract": "In models where ultralight fields constitute dark matter, the misalignment mechanism leads to coherent, low-amplitude oscillations in fundamental constants. This effect arises from effective operators that couple dark matter to Standard Model fields. We present different models that can induce these effective operators by integrating out a mediator field. For mediator masses within the reach of collider searches, an alternative way to discover ultralight dark matter is to search for a resonance. Due to being a mediator to dark matter, the mass of the mediator oscillates. The resonance therefore, should not appear as a single isolated peak, but is smeared out once data is averaged over an oscillation cycle or more. Remarkably, the oscillation period and amplitude are in the range of current and future collider searches, even though constraints from atomic clocks probing variations of the fine-structure constant and the electron mass are very strong. We recast existing searches and projections from Belle II, LHCb and SHiP for an `oscillating resonance', and discuss how the periodicity of the signal can be used to reconstruct the peak from mass-binned data. We further show that time-stamped data would allow to unfold the signal via a fast Fourier transform and determine the significance of the signal for different background levels. The discovery of an oscillating resonance at a collider, with characteristics as predicted in ultralight dark matter scenarios, would constitute a powerful probe of dark matter's underlying nature."

These are recently discovered materials that have zero net magnetization by symmetry and finite non-relativistic spin splitting of electron bands, like in altermagnets. Similarly, the spin polarizations is collinear in the momentum space. Yet, as opposed to altermagnets, the magnetization is noncollinear in the real space, and the spin splitting obeys time-reversal symmetry in the momentum space. As a result, if such material harbors superconductivity (due to phonons, or any other mechanism), the only supported superconducting symmetry is Ising superconductivity, an exotic symmetry where any Cooper pair is a 50:50 mix of singlet and triplet. This unusual behavior is also in stark contrast to regular antiferromagnet, which can support Cooper pairs of any parity, and altermagnets, which can only support nonunitary triplet pairs. The presence of large triplet component and enhanced resilience against pair breaking is inherent to the p-wave magnets and as such is unconventional as it does not materialize in conventional spin-orbit coupling induced Ising superconductors."

In this work, we consider the adaptive construction of interpolating rational approximations while aiming for the smallest feasible degree to satisfy a given error tolerance. To this end, we introduce refinement approaches to the linear least-squares step of the classical AAA algorithm that aim to minimize the true nonlinear least-squares error with respect to the given data. Furthermore, we theoretically analyze the derived approaches in terms of the corresponding gradients from the resulting minimization problems and use these insights to propose a new greedy framework that ensures monotonic error convergence.

The first main result of the paper is a complete and decidable characterisation of all product rules $P$ giving rise to $P$-products which are bilinear, associative, and commutative. The characterisation shows that there are infinitely many such products, and in particular it applies to the notable Hadamard, shuffle, and infiltration products from the literature. Every $P$-product gives rise to the class of $P$-automata, an infinite-state model where states are terms. The second main result of the paper is that the equivalence problem for $P$-automata is decidable for $P$-products satisfying our characterisation.

Here, we propose a general framework for this question and take first steps, theoretical as well as experimental, towards a better understanding.

To date, several necessary conditions are known for a function to be a valid indicator variogram but, except for intractable corner-positive inequalities, a complete characterization of indicator variograms is missing. Likewise, only partial characterizations of madograms are known. This paper provides novel necessary and sufficient conditions for a given function to be the variogram of an indicator random field with constant mean value or to be the madogram of a random field, and establishes under which conditions these two families of functions coincide. Our results apply to any set of points where the random field is defined and rely on distance geometry and Gaussian random field theory."

We propose CASTER (Context-Aware Strategy for Task Efficient Routing), a lightweight router for dynamic model selection in graph-based MAS. CASTER employs a Dual-Signal Router that combines semantic embeddings with structural meta-features to estimate task difficulty. During training, the router self-optimizes through a Cold Start to Iterative Evolution paradigm, learning from its own routing failures via on-policy negative feedback. Experiments using LLM-as-a-Judge evaluation across Software Engineering, Data Analysis, Scientific Discovery, and Cybersecurity demonstrate that CASTER reduces inference cost by up to 72.4% compared to strong-model baselines while matching their success rates, and consistently outperforms both heuristic routing and FrugalGPT across all domains."

In this work, we propose an interactive evaluation framework that explicitly models the consultation process using a simulated patient and a \\rev{simulated reporter} grounded in atomic evidences. Based on this representation, we introduce Information Coverage Rate (ICR) to quantify how completely an agent uncovers necessary evidence during interaction. To support systematic study, we build EviMed, an evidence-based benchmark spanning diverse conditions from common complaints to rare diseases, and evaluate 10 models with varying reasoning abilities. We find that strong diagnostic reasoning does not guarantee effective information collection, and this insufficiency acts as a primary bottleneck limiting performance in interactive settings. To address this, we propose REFINE, a strategy that leverages diagnostic verification to guide the agent in proactively resolving uncertainties. Extensive experiments demonstrate that REFINE consistently outperforms baselines across diverse datasets and facilitates effective model collaboration, enabling smaller agents to achieve superior performance under strong reasoning supervision.

Existing approaches typically rely on large language models (LLMs) to generate context-aware responses based on user metadata and historical interactions or on adaptive methods such as reinforcement learning (RL) to learn from users' immediate reactions in real time. However, these approaches fall short of comprehensively capturing user preferences-including long-term, short-term, and fine-grained aspects-, and of using them to rank and select actions, proactively personalize interactions, and ensure ethically responsible adaptations. To address the limitations, we propose drawing on recommender systems (RSs), which specialize in modeling user preferences and providing personalized recommendations. To ensure the integration of RS techniques is well-grounded and seamless throughout the social robot pipeline, we (i) align the paradigms underlying social robots and RSs, (ii) identify key techniques that can enhance personalization in social robots, and (iii) design them as modular, plug-and-play components. This work not only establishes a framework for integrating RS techniques into social robots but also opens a pathway for deep collaboration between the RS and HRI communities, accelerating innovation in both fields."

Motivated by the multimodal generative capabilities of recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), this work investigates a fundamental yet underexplored question: can MLLMs generate missing modalities for products in e-commerce scenarios? We propose the Missing Modality Product Completion Benchmark (MMPCBench), which consists of two sub-benchmarks: a Content Quality Completion Benchmark and a Recommendation Benchmark. We further evaluate six state-of-the-art MLLMs from the Qwen2.5-VL and Gemma-3 model families across nine real-world e-commerce categories, focusing on image-to-text and text-to-image completion tasks. Experimental results show that while MLLMs can capture high-level semantics, they struggle with fine-grained word-level and pixel- or patch-level alignment. In addition, performance varies substantially across product categories and model scales, and we observe no trivial correlation between model size and performance, in contrast to trends commonly reported in mainstream benchmarks. We also explore Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to better align MLLMs with this task. GRPO improves image-to-text completion but does not yield gains for text-to-image completion. Overall, these findings expose the limitations of current MLLMs in real-world cross-modal generation and represent an early step toward more effective missing-modality product completion."

    "abstract": "The management of irrigation water systems has become increasingly complex due to competing demands for agricultural production, groundwater sustainability, and environmental flow requirements, particularly under hydrologic variability and climate uncertainty. Addressing these challenges requires optimization frameworks that can jointly determine optimal crop allocation, groundwater pumping, and environmental flow releases while maintaining economic and hydrological feasibility. However, existing hydro-economic models, including the widely used Lewis and Randall formulation, may overestimate net benefits by allowing infeasible negative pumping and surface water allocations. We extend the Lewis and Randall framework by reformulating groundwater pumping and surface water use as non-negative, demand-driven decision variables and by explicitly incorporating environmental flow and canal capacity constraints. Three models are developed to maximize economic benefit, minimize environmental deficits, and a multiobjective model that evaluates the trade-offs between these two objectives. An illustrative test case examining optimal crop area allocation and environmental flow management across dry, average, and wet years, using data from the Rajshahi Barind Tract in northwestern Bangladesh, is presented. The results show that the proposed formulation produces economically and hydrologically consistent solutions, identifying optimal strategies when either net benefits or environmental protection is prioritized, as well as Pareto-optimal trade-offs when both objectives are considered together. These findings provide practical insights for balancing farm income, groundwater sustainability, and ecological protection, offering a robust decision-support tool for irrigation management in water-limited river basins."

Although prior arts offer various activation optimization strategies, their data-agnostic nature ultimately results in ineffective and unstable fine tuning. In this paper, we propose TokenSeek, a universal plugin solution for various transformer-based models through instance-aware token seeking and ditching, achieving significant fine-tuning memory savings (e.g., requiring only 14.8% of the memory on Llama3.2 1B) with on-par or even better performance. Furthermore, our interpretable token seeking process reveals the underlying reasons for its effectiveness, offering valuable insights for future research on token efficiency.

In this paper, we develop a general framework for establishing generalization bounds under heavy-tailed noise. Specifically, we introduce a truncation argument to achieve the generalization error bound based on the algorithmic stability under the assumption of bounded $p$th centered moment with $p\\in(1,2]$. Building on this framework, we further provide the stability and generalization analysis for several popular stochastic algorithms under heavy-tailed noise, including clipped and normalized stochastic gradient descent, as well as their mini-batch and momentum variants."

In this process, the Red Team exposes vulnerabilities, driving the Blue Team to learning effective solutions without parameter updates. We validate our framework across two challenging domains: dynamic code hardening against CVEs and guardrail optimization against jailbreaks. Our empirical results show that this interaction compels the Blue Team to learn fundamental defensive principles, leading to robust remediations that are not merely overfitted to specific exploits.

Existing topology control methods rely on global optimization to produce a single optimal topology or involve high computational complexity, which limits adaptability in dynamic environments. This paper presents a two-stage quantum-assisted framework for efficient and resilient topology control in dynamic UAV networks by exploiting quantum parallelism to generate a set of high-quality and structurally diverse candidate topologies. In the offline stage, we formulate the problem as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) model and leverage quantum annealing (QA) to parallelly sample multiple high-quality and structurally distinct topologies, providing a rich solution space for adaptive decision-making. In the online stage, a lightweight classical selection mechanism rapidly identifies the most suitable topology based on real-time link stability and channel conditions, substantially reducing the computation delay. The simulation results show that, compared to a single static optimal topology, the proposed framework improves performance retention by 6.6% in a 30-second dynamic window. Moreover, relative to the classic method, QA achieves an additional 5.15% reduction in objective value and a 28.3% increase in solution diversity. These findings demonstrate the potential of QA to enable fast and robust topology control for next-generation UAV communication networks."

We also assume access to $m$ parallel processors to accelerate convergence. The proposed approach is inspired by modern zeroth-order optimization methods, which mimic gradient-based schemes by replacing the gradient with a zeroth-order stochastic gradient estimator. Our contribution is twofold. First, we show that a naive application of popular zeroth-order stochastic gradient estimators within Markov chain Monte Carlo methods leads to algorithms with poor dependence on $m$, both for unadjusted and Metropolis-adjusted schemes. We then propose a simple remedy to this problem, based on a random-slice perspective, as opposed to a stochastic gradient one, obtaining a new class of zeroth-order samplers that provably achieve a polynomial speed-up in $m$.

In addition, we adopt an explicit method to policy constraints by enabling Greedy Action Guidance (GAG). This is achieved through backtracking historical actions, which effectively enhances the policy update process. Our proposed method relies on providing the learning algorithm with accurate $k$-nearest-neighbor action value estimates and learning to design a fast-adaptable policy through policy constraints. We further propose the Instant Policy Update (IPU) mechanism, which enhances policy exploitation by systematically increasing the frequency of policy updates. We further discover that the early-stage training conservatism of the IRA method can alleviate the overestimation bias problem in value-based RL. Experimental results show that IRA can significantly improve the learning efficiency and final performance of online RL algorithms on eight MuJoCo continuous control tasks."

Risk sensitivity is modeled through the fractional parameter, interpolating between conservative or risk aversion and adventurous or high risk tolerance attitudes. Furthermore, the robustness and statistical significance of the fractional order entropy-based risk measure, termed normalized expected utility-fractional entropy (NEU-FE) and normalized expected utility-fractional entropy-variance (NEU-FEV) risk measures are explained with the help of machine learning tools, including Random forest, Ridge regression, Lasso Regression and artificial neural networks by using Indian stock market (NIFTY50).

The novel feature of our investigation is an iterative solution for the non-linear equation for the scalar field $χ= Φ- Ψ$, where $Φ$ and $Ψ$ are the potentials that characterise scalar perturbations of the metric. We demonstrate the scheme on spherical perturbations - smooth, compensated top-hats of varying length scales. We find that the effect of the Chameleon mechanism is seen most prominently on scales where the size of the top-hat is comparable to the Compton scale of the background. There is a density enhancement near the outer edge of the top-hat and the top-hat does not retain its shape. We explain this well-known observation in the context of the spatio-temporal evolution of the Compton scale. Additionally, we find a slight enhancement of the density near the origin, a feature not reported previously in the literature. On scales much smaller or much larger than the background Compton length, including the Chameleon screening has no appreciable effect on the perturbations. In the former, the growth is enhanced as compared to GR and is almost the same as GR in the latter. Finally, we examine the non-linear density velocity divergence (DVDR) relation and find that for evolution affected by Chameleon screening, the DVDR is no longer one-to-one even for a single profile. The relation between density and velocity depends on the location within the perturbation."

In this work, we demonstrate that the smallness of $B_N(t)$ arises from a fundamental cancellation within the nucleon's wave functions. Using light-front holographic QCD, we show that $B_N(t)$ is governed by an antisymmetric factor in the longitudinal dynamics that leads to an exact vanishing in the symmetric limit and significant suppression for realistic nucleon structures. Our results suggest that the smallness of $B_N(t)$ is a signature of the nucleon's dominant S-wave character, providing a formal justification for its frequent omission in practical applications like near-threshold $J/ψ$ production."

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly paired with activation-based monitoring to detect and prevent harmful behaviors that may not be apparent at the surface-text level. However, existing activation safety approaches, trained on broad misuse datasets, struggle with poor precision, limited flexibility, and lack of interpretability. This paper introduces a new paradigm: rule-based activation safety, inspired by rule-sharing practices in cybersecurity. We propose modeling activations as cognitive elements (CEs), fine-grained, interpretable factors such as ''making a threat'' and ''payment processing'', that can be composed to capture nuanced, domain-specific behaviors with higher precision. Building on this representation, we present a practical framework that defines predicate rules over CEs and detects violations in real time. This enables practitioners to configure and update safeguards without retraining models or detectors, while supporting transparency and auditability. Our results show that compositional rule-based activation safety improves precision, supports domain customization, and lays the groundwork for scalable, interpretable, and auditable AI governance. We will release GAVEL as an open-source framework and provide an accompanying automated rule creation tool."

    "abstract": "In the literature, several studies have shown that state-of-the-art image similarity metrics are not perceptual metrics; moreover, they have difficulty evaluating images, especially when texture distortion is also present. In this work, we propose a new perceptual metric composed of two terms. The first term evaluates the dissimilarity between the textures of two images using Earth Mover's Distance. The second term evaluates the chromatic dissimilarity between two images in the Oklab perceptual color space. We evaluated the performance of our metric on a non-traditional dataset, called Berkeley-Adobe Perceptual Patch Similarity, which contains a wide range of complex distortions in shapes and colors. We have shown that our metric outperforms the state of the art, especially when images contain shape distortions, confirming also its greater perceptiveness. Furthermore, although deep black-box metrics could be very accurate, they only provide similarity scores between two images, without explaining their main differences and similarities. Our metric, on the other hand, provides visual explanations to support the calculated score, making the similarity assessment transparent and justified."

Unlike in classical matching problems, voters in our model are not part of the graph; instead, they have preferences over the entire matching. In the resulting election, the candidate space consists of all feasible matchings, whose exponential size renders standard algorithms for identifying socially desirable outcomes computationally infeasible. We study whether the computational tractability of finding such outcomes can be regained by exploiting the matching structure of the candidate space. Specifically, we provide a complete complexity landscape for questions concerning the maximization of social welfare, the construction and verification of Pareto optimal outcomes, and the existence and verification of Condorcet winners under one affine and two approval-based utility models. Our results consist of a mix of algorithmic and intractability results, revealing sharp boundaries between tractable and intractable cases, with complexity jumps arising from subtle changes in the utility model or solution concept."

This random variable captures the effect of early demographic fluctuations and determines the random amplitude of long-term exponential population growth. While the existence of a non-trivial limit is ensured by the Kesten-Stigum theorem, computing its density in a stable and efficient manner for arbitrary offspring laws remains a significant challenge. The proposed approach leverages a functional equation that characterizes the Laplace-Stieltjes transform of the limit distribution and combines it with a moment-matching method to obtain accurate approximations within a class of linear combinations of Laguerre polynomials with exponential damping. The effectiveness of the approach is validated on several examples in which the offspring generating function is a polynomial of bounded degree."

We propose a unified framework that leverages Mixed-Integer Optimization (MIO) to train intersectionally fair and intrinsically interpretable classifiers. We prove the equivalence of two measures of intersectional fairness (MSD and SPSF) in detecting the most unfair subgroup and empirically demonstrate that our MIO-based algorithm improves performance in finding bias. We train high-performing, interpretable classifiers that bound intersectional bias below an acceptable threshold, offering a robust solution for regulated industries and beyond."

However, existing generative models largely rely on weak conditioning signals, such as labels or text, which lack anatomical grounding and often produce biologically implausible outputs. To this end, we introduce Cor2Vox, a cortex-grounded generative framework for brain magnetic resonance image (MRI) synthesis that ties image generation to continuous structural priors of the cerebral cortex. It leverages high-resolution cortical surfaces to guide a 3D shape-to-image Brownian bridge diffusion process, enabling topologically faithful synthesis and precise control over underlying anatomies. To support the generation of new, realistic brain shapes, we developed a large-scale statistical shape model of cortical morphology derived from over 33,000 UK Biobank scans. We validated the fidelity of Cor2Vox based on traditional image quality metrics, advanced cortical surface reconstruction, and whole-brain segmentation quality, outperforming many baseline methods. Across three applications, namely (i) anatomically consistent synthesis, (ii) simulation of progressive gray matter atrophy, and (iii) harmonization of in-house frontotemporal dementia scans with public datasets, Cor2Vox preserved fine-grained cortical morphology at the sub-voxel level, exhibiting remarkable robustness to variations in cortical geometry and disease phenotype without retraining."

While on-policy reinforcement learning can reduce forgetting, it requires explicit reward functions that are often unavailable. Learning from expert demonstrations, the primary alternative, is dominated by supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which is inherently off-policy. We introduce Self-Distillation Fine-Tuning (SDFT), a simple method that enables on-policy learning directly from demonstrations. SDFT leverages in-context learning by using a demonstration-conditioned model as its own teacher, generating on-policy training signals that preserve prior capabilities while acquiring new skills. Across skill learning and knowledge acquisition tasks, SDFT consistently outperforms SFT, achieving higher new-task accuracy while substantially reducing catastrophic forgetting. In sequential learning experiments, SDFT enables a single model to accumulate multiple skills over time without performance regression, establishing on-policy distillation as a practical path to continual learning from demonstrations."

In contrast, depth scaling offers theoretically superior expressivity, yet current Transformer architectures struggle to train reliably at extreme depths. We revisit the Post-LayerNorm (Post-LN) formulation, whose instability at scale caused its replacement by Pre-LN in modern LLMs. We show that the central failure mode of Post-LN arises from the ResNet-style residual pathway, which introduces gradient vanishing in deep networks. We present Keel, a Post-LN Transformer that replaces this residual path with a Highway-style connection. This modification preserves the gradient flow through the residual branch, preventing signal vanishing from the top layers to the bottom. Unlike prior methods, Keel enables stable training at extreme depths without requiring specialized initialization or complex optimization tricks. Keel trains robustly at depths exceeding 1000 layers and consistently improves perplexity and depth-scaling characteristics over Pre-LN. These findings indicate that Post-LN, when paired with a Highway-style connection, provides a simple and effective foundation for building deeply scalable LLMs, opening the possibility for future infinite-depth architectures."

The inverse method, previously demonstrated via simulated equilibrium configurations of passive particles, has now been applied to a suspension of active particles. Interestingly, although active particles are inherently not in equilibrium, we still obtain effective interaction potentials which accurately describe the structure of the active system. Treating these effective potentials as if they were those of equilibrium systems, furthermore allows us to measure effective chemical potentials and pressures. Both the passive interactions and active motion of the active Brownian particles contribute to their effective interaction potentials."

Recent experimental measurements by COHERENT, CONUS+, and ton-scale xenon detectors--including PandaX-4T and XENONnT--underscore the need for a systematic theoretical framework to bridge high-energy physics scenarios with low-energy observational data. In this work, we develop a comprehensive end-to-end effective field theory (EFT) framework for CE$ν$NS, encompassing the complete energy scale hierarchy spanning the ultraviolet (UV) regime down to the nuclear sector. We consider the low-energy EFT (LEFT) operators up to dimension 8, incorporating their QCD renormalization group running effects, and employ the systematic spurion method to achieve the matching between these operators and the chiral Lagrangian. A full power counting analysis is performed, extending to nuclear response functions, which evaluates contributions from LEFT operators up to dimension 8 while accounting for the nucleon number enhancement effect intrinsic to CE$ν$NS. Moreover, we match the relevant LEFT operators for CE$ν$NS onto operators up to dimension 8 within the Standard Model EFT. By also providing their complete tree-level ultraviolet completions, this procedure establishes a consistent top-down theoretical workflow. Leveraging a broad suite of CE$ν$NS experimental data, this framework enables a combined analysis to extract constraints on the scales of EFT operators and neutrino non-standard interaction parameters."

The first step involves any mechanism generating a power-law distribution, while the second step applies a regressive redistribution process that reallocates resources from poorer to richer entities, thereby amplifying inequality. This approach represents the first analytic derivation of an exact BRF distribution from a generative mechanism. We validate the model through applications to income and urban population distributions. Beyond exact generation, this framework offers new insights into the systemic origins of deviations from power laws frequently observed in complex systems, linking rank distributions to underlying feedback and redistribution dynamics."

They are generally standardized under the assumption that they belong to a single population, with luminosities standardized in a continuous (roughly linear) fashion using the observed light-curve timescale. We update the Union3+UNITY1.5 SN cosmology analysis in light of increasing evidence for at least two core populations of SNe Ia and apply this \"UNITY1.8\" model to the updated \"Union3.1\" compilation (Hoyt et al. 2026). In addition to finding evidence for two different light-curve-shape (x1) distributions, we also find that the color distributions are different, that the light-curve-shape/magnitude standardization relations are different, and that these populations have different distributions across host-galaxy stellar mass and redshift. Importantly, we find that the residual host-mass luminosity step found in prior SN Ia cosmology analyses is now consistent with zero for unreddened SNe. We report a significantly tightened constraint on the split in the red-color standardization between SNe in low- and high-mass galaxies. We find that the estimated uncertainties shrink on cosmological parameters when fitting the same SNe assuming two modes versus one mode. We confirm similar trends in simulated data when running both versions of UNITY on the same (two-mode) simulations. For a flat LambdaCDM cosmology, we find Om = 0.334+0.025-0.024 from SNe alone; for a flat w0-wa cosmology, we find w0 = -0.760+0.084-0.082 and wa = -0.79+0.28-0.30 when including SNe, BAO, and CMB.

While aggregate metrics like validation loss can follow smooth power-law curves, individual downstream tasks exhibit diverse scaling behaviors: some improve monotonically, others plateau, and some even degrade with scale. We argue that predicting downstream performance from validation perplexity suffers from two limitations: averaging token-level losses obscures signal, and no simple parametric family can capture the full spectrum of scaling behaviors. To address this, we propose Neural Neural Scaling Laws (NeuNeu), a neural network that frames scaling law prediction as time-series extrapolation. NeuNeu combines temporal context from observed accuracy trajectories with token-level validation losses, learning to predict future performance without assuming any bottleneck or functional form. Trained entirely on open-source model checkpoints from HuggingFace, NeuNeu achieves 2.04% mean absolute error in predicting model accuracy on 66 downstream tasks -- a 38% reduction compared to logistic scaling laws (3.29% MAE). Furthermore, NeuNeu generalizes zero-shot to unseen model families, parameter counts, and downstream tasks. Our work suggests that predicting downstream scaling laws directly from data outperforms parametric alternatives."

Using a decade of georeferenced firm-level data from Mexico City, we analyze the relationships among ADL variables using regression, spatial correlation, and time-series clustering. Our results reveal nonlinear dynamics across urban space, with powerlaw behavior in central zones and logarithmic saturation in peripheral areas, suggesting differentiated growth regimes. Notably, firm longevity modulates the relationship between abundance and diversity, particularly in periurban transition zones. These spatial patterns point to an emerging polycentric restructuring within a traditionally monocentric metropolis. By integrating economic complexity theory with spatial analysis, our approach provides a scalable method to assess the adaptive capacity of urban economies. This has implications for understanding informality, designing inclusive urban policies, and navigating structural transitions in rapidly urbanizing regions."

The matter horizon was first identified by Ellis and Stoeger in 2010 as a dynamical causal boundary that encloses a sub-region of spacetime where structure formation actually takes place. We construct a multi-scale hierarchical framework for the propagation of geodesic congruences that avoids the shell-crossing singularity by cutting the spacetime at the matter horizon and glueing to another spacetime with opposite orientation. We identify a relationship between the multi-scale hierarchical framework and the cosmological zoom-in N-body simulation approach, and relate the local sub-region that decouples from the Hubble flow to the region of interest in cosmological zoom-in N-body simulations.

    "abstract": "Processing high-volume, streaming data is increasingly common in modern statistics and machine learning, where batch-mode algorithms are often impractical because they require repeated passes over the full dataset. This has motivated incremental stochastic estimation methods, including the incremental stochastic Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm formulated via stochastic approximation. In this work, we revisit and analyze an incremental stochastic variant of the Majorization-Minimization (MM) algorithm, which generalizes incremental stochastic EM as a special case. Our approach relaxes key EM requirements, such as explicit latent-variable representations, enabling broader applicability and greater algorithmic flexibility. We establish theoretical guarantees for the incremental stochastic MM algorithm, proving consistency in the sense that the iterates converge to a stationary point characterized by a vanishing gradient of the objective. We demonstrate these advantages on a softmax-gated mixture of experts (MoE) regression problem, for which no stochastic EM algorithm is available. Empirically, our method consistently outperforms widely used stochastic optimizers, including stochastic gradient descent, root mean square propagation, adaptive moment estimation, and second-order clipped stochastic optimization. These results support the development of new incremental stochastic algorithms, given the central role of softmax-gated MoE architectures in contemporary deep neural networks for heterogeneous data modeling. Beyond synthetic experiments, we also validate practical effectiveness on two real-world datasets, including a bioinformatics study of dent maize genotypes under drought stress that integrates high-dimensional proteomics with ecophysiological traits, where incremental stochastic MM yields stable gains in predictive performance."

Vertical transport exhibits velocity-driven transitions from intermittent settling to stable convection, as demonstrated by residence-time and drag-force statistics. While PMNs exhibit enhanced rotational-translational coupling and broader force fluctuations, the regime progression qualitatively resembles that of volume-equivalent spherical particles. Drag variance evolution reveals contrasting behavior: small particles $(d/D=0.082)$ show narrow distributions and wake suppression at higher velocities, while large particles $(d/D=0.22)$ exhibit non-monotonic variance.

This paper introduces a component-aware pruning framework that utilizes gradient information to compute three distinct importance metrics during training: Gradient Accumulation, Fisher Information, and Bayesian Uncertainty. Experimental results with an autoencoder and a TD-MPC agent demonstrate that the proposed framework reveals critical structural dependencies and dynamic shifts in importance that static heuristics often miss, supporting more informed compression decisions."

We prove end-to-end grokking results for learning over-parameterized linear regression models using gradient descent with weight decay. Specifically, we prove that the following stages occur: (i) the model overfits the training data early during training; (ii) poor generalization persists long after overfitting has manifested; and (iii) the generalization error eventually becomes arbitrarily small. Moreover, we show, both theoretically and empirically, that grokking can be amplified or eliminated in a principled manner through proper hyperparameter tuning. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first rigorous quantitative bounds on the generalization delay (which we refer to as the \"grokking time\") in terms of training hyperparameters. Lastly, going beyond the linear setting, we empirically demonstrate that our quantitative bounds also capture the behavior of grokking on non-linear neural networks. Our results suggest that grokking is not an inherent failure mode of deep learning, but rather a consequence of specific training conditions, and thus does not require fundamental changes to the model architecture or learning algorithm to avoid."

Starting from the thermodynamics of degenerate Fermi gases, we construct an equation of state for cold, catalyzed matter by combining relativistic fermion statistics with the liquid drop model of nuclear binding. The internal stratification of matter in the outer crust is described by $β$-equilibrium, neutron drip and a gradual transition to supranuclear matter. Short-range repulsive interactions inspired by Quantum Hadrodynamics are incorporated at high densities in order to ensure stability and causality. The resulting equation of state is used as input to the Tolman--Oppenheimer--Volkoff equations, yielding self-consistent neutron-star models. We compute macroscopic stellar properties including the mass-radius relation, compactness and surface redshift that can be compared with recent observational data. Despite the simplicity of the underlying microphysics, the model produces neutron-star masses and radii compatible with current observational constraints from X-ray timing and gravitational-wave measurements. This work demonstrates that physically transparent models can already capture the essential features of neutron-star structure and provide valuable insight into the connection between dense-matter physics and astrophysical observables while they can also be used as easy to handle models to test the impact of more complicated phenomena and variations in neutron stars."

These tokens are typically categorized as acoustic and phonetic tokens: the former holds detailed acoustic information for reconstruction while the latter mainly captures linguistic content. In human speech communication, however, unnecessary acoustic details such as speaker information are abstracted, while both linguistic and prosodic information are utilized for speech comprehension and production. Given this, neither type of token seems an ideal representation for tasks sensitive to prosody, such as speechLMs. In this study, we propose the Phonological Tokenizer, a method that fine-tunes phonetic tokens via differentiable k-means with a multi-task objective of ASR and speech resynthesis. Experimental validation on diverse tasks confirms that our tokens retain phonological (both linguistic and prosodic) information while appropriately discarding speaker identity."

    "abstract": "We present a new geometric perspective on quantum error correction based on spectral triples in noncommutative geometry. In this approach, quantum error correcting codes are reformulated as low energy spectral projections of Dirac type operators that separate global logical degrees of freedom from local, correctable errors. Locality, code distance, and the Knill Laflamme condition acquire a unified spectral and geometric interpretation in terms of the induced metric and spectrum of the Dirac operator. Within this framework, a wide range of known error correcting codes including classical linear codes, stabilizer codes, GKP type codes, and topological codes are recovered from a single construction. This demonstrates that classical and quantum codes can be organized within a common geometric language. A central advantage of the spectral triple perspective is that the performance of error correction can be directly related to spectral properties. We show that leakage out of the code space is controlled by the spectral gap of the Dirac operator, and that code preserving internal perturbations can systematically increase this gap without altering the encoded logical subspace. This yields a geometric mechanism for enhancing error correction thresholds, which we illustrate explicitly for a stabilizer code. We further interpret Berezin Toeplitz quantization as a mixed spectral code and briefly discuss implications for holographic quantum error correction. Overall, our results suggest that quantum error correction can be viewed as a universal low energy phenomenon governed by spectral geometry."

We compare different methods for quantifying GNDs, all of which originate from the Nye tensor, which is computed as the curl of the plastic deformation gradient. The projection technique directly decomposes the Nye tensor onto individual screw and edge dislocation components to compute GNDs. This approach requires converting a nine-component Nye tensor into densities for a larger number of dislocation systems, a fundamentally underdetermined (non-unique) process, which is resolved using $L2$ minimization. In contrast, when employing CPFE analysis, one could directly compute dislocation densities on each slip system using shear gradients. Projection and slip gradient methods are compared with respect to their prediction of GNDs with changing grain size, strain, and grain neighborhoods, including multigrain junctions. Although these techniques match analytical GND densities for single slip, single crystal deformation, and are consistent with anticipated overall GND trends, we find that the GND densities from projection techniques are significantly lower than those predicted from CPFE-based slip gradients in polycrystals. A suggested improvement of only using the active dislocation systems in the projection technique almost entirely resolved this mismatch."

Existing Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)-based methods struggle with slow rendering speeds and suboptimal color restoration, while 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) inherently lacks the capability to model complex volumetric scattering effects. To address these issues, we introduce WaterClear-GS, the first pure 3DGS-based framework that explicitly integrates underwater optical properties of local attenuation and scattering into Gaussian primitives, eliminating the need for an auxiliary medium network. Our method employs a dual-branch optimization strategy to ensure underwater photometric consistency while naturally recovering water-free appearances. This strategy is enhanced by depth-guided geometry regularization and perception-driven image loss, together with exposure constraints, spatially-adaptive regularization, and physically guided spectral regularization, which collectively enforce local 3D coherence and maintain natural visual perception. Experiments on standard benchmarks and our newly collected dataset demonstrate that WaterClear-GS achieves outstanding performance on both novel view synthesis (NVS) and underwater image restoration (UIR) tasks, while maintaining real-time rendering.

    "abstract": "Localization is a pervasive phenomenon across physics, shaping transport from electrons in solids to light and sound in engineered media. In traditional settings, disorder strongly impedes transport, resulting in dynamical localization or, at best, sub-ballistic or diffusive dynamics. A distinct and previously unobserved regime, erratic non-Hermitian skin localization (ENHSL), can arise in globally reciprocal non-Hermitian lattices with disorder. It features macroscopic, disorder-dependent localization at irregular bulk positions with subexponential decay, linked to stochastic interfaces governed by the universal order statistics of random walks. We realize this regime experimentally in an acoustic lattice implementing a disordered Hatano-Nelson chain with imaginary gauge fields. Using Green's-function-based spectroscopy together with time-resolved measurements on the same platform, we reconstruct the full complex spectrum and eigenstates, and directly observe wave-packet dynamics. Remarkably, we observe ballistic transport despite strong spectral localization. We develop a transport theory that connects the dominant propagation site to the maximal random-walk excursion within an expanding light cone and predicts a universal Levy-arcsine statistics, in quantitative agreement with experiment. Our results decouple eigenstate localization from transport and establish ENHSL as a new paradigm for wave dynamics."

Our framework integrates an unsupervised VoxelHop encoder for hierarchical spatio-temporal feature extraction with a multi-level regression decoder and an XG-Boost classifier.

Crucially, our model achieves this with over an order of magnitude fewer parameters, demonstrating exceptional computational efficiency. This work demonstrates that the GL paradigm can deliver highly accurate, efficient, and interpretable solutions for complex medical image analysis, paving the way for more sustainable and trustworthy artificial intelligence in clinical practice."

We investigate the impact of diffuse ionised gas (DIG) on the determination of emission line ratios and gas-phase metallicities in two local analogues of high-redshift star-forming galaxies: UM 462 and IIZw 40. Understanding how DIG affects these quantities is essential for interpreting unresolved observations of distant galaxies, where integrated spectra are often used to trace their chemical evolution. Methods. Using archival Very Large Telescope, Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) data, we spatially resolved the warm ionised medium of both galaxies. We derived oxygen abundances through the direct method and several HII-based strong-line calibrators, and we used the H$α$ surface brightness ($Σ$(H$α$)) to distinguish regions dominated by HII or DIG emission. Results. Oxygen abundances derived from the N2 and O3N2 indices show an inverse correlation with $Σ$(H$α$), ionisation parameter, and EW(H$α$), with DIG-dominated regions exhibiting higher 12+log(O/H) than the galaxy mean by $\\sim$0.2 dex in UM 462 and $\\sim$0.1 dex in IIZw 40. The metallicity differences between HII-dominated and DIG-dominated $Σ$(H$α$) bins reach $\\sim$0.4 dex and $\\sim$0.3 dex in UM 462 and IIZw 40, respectively. The observed trends with $Σ$(H$α$), metallicity, EW(H$α$), and ionisation parameter indicate smoothly varying ionisation conditions rather than true abundance variations. These effects reflect different ionisation sources and levels, and can produce spurious metallicity gradients in galaxies with extended DIG structures, potentially mimicking signatures of metal-poor gas infall. In our sample, DIG ionisation is most likely dominated by photon leakage from H II regions, with additional contributions from feedback-driven shocks."

We show that testing isomorphism of two elections can be done in polynomial time so, in principle, such distances can be tractable.

To overcome these limitations, we introduce the concept of ``Green-representable solutions'' utilizing test functions constructed from fundamental solutions. This framework enables a new formulation of sub- and super-solutions that permits rigorous pointwise evaluation. For one-dimensional problems, we derive explicit constructions of the test functions. For two-dimensional polygonal domains, we employ the Method of Fundamental Solutions to generate test functions. The approach is validated through numerical experiments in both settings, including non-convex polygons.

    "abstract": "Knowledge editing emerges as a crucial technique for efficiently correcting incorrect or outdated knowledge in large language models (LLM). Existing editing methods for unimodal LLM rely on a rigid parameter-to-output mapping, which causes causal-underfit and causal-overfit in cascaded reasoning for Multimodal LLM (MLLM). In this paper, we reformulate MLLM editing as an out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization problem, where the goal is to discern semantic shift with factual shift and thus achieve robust editing among diverse cross-modal prompting. The key challenge of this OOD problem lies in identifying invariant causal trajectories that generalize accurately while suppressing spurious correlations. To address it, we propose ODEdit, a plug-and-play invariant learning based framework that optimizes the tripartite OOD risk objective to simultaneously enhance editing reliability, locality, and generality.We further introduce an edit trajectory invariant learning method, which integrates a total variation penalty into the risk minimization objective to stabilize edit trajectories against environmental variations. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of ODEdit."

    "abstract": "Repository-level code completion remains a challenging task for existing code large language models (code LLMs) due to their limited understanding of repository-specific context and domain knowledge. While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approaches have shown promise by retrieving relevant code snippets as cross-file context, they suffer from two fundamental problems: misalignment between the query and the target code in the retrieval process, and the inability of existing retrieval methods to effectively utilize the inference information. To address these challenges, we propose AlignCoder, a repository-level code completion framework that introduces a query enhancement mechanism and a reinforcement learning based retriever training method. Our approach generates multiple candidate completions to construct an enhanced query that bridges the semantic gap between the initial query and the target code. Additionally, we employ reinforcement learning to train an AlignRetriever that learns to leverage inference information in the enhanced query for more accurate retrieval. We evaluate AlignCoder on two widely-used benchmarks (CrossCodeEval and RepoEval) across five backbone code LLMs, demonstrating an 18.1% improvement in EM score compared to baselines on the CrossCodeEval benchmark. The results show that our framework achieves superior performance and exhibits high generalizability across various code LLMs and programming languages."

However, deployment often demands architectures of varying sizes, exposing limitations of conventional pre-training and fine-tuning. To address this, we propose SWEET, a self-supervised framework that performs constraint-based pre-training to enable scalable initialization in vision tasks. Instead of pre-training a fixed-size model, we learn a shared weight template and size-specific weight scalers under Tucker-based factorization, which promotes modularity and supports flexible adaptation to architectures with varying depths and widths. Target models are subsequently initialized by composing and reweighting the template through lightweight weight scalers, whose parameters can be efficiently learned from minimal training data. To further enhance flexibility in width expansion, we introduce width-wise stochastic scaling, which regularizes the template along width-related dimensions and encourages robust, width-invariant representations for improved cross-width generalization. Extensive experiments on \\textsc{classification}, \\textsc{detection}, \\textsc{segmentation} and \\textsc{generation} tasks demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of SWEET for initializing variable-sized vision models."

In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective approach to improve the model by Dual Self-distillation for VM-UNet (DSVM-UNet) without any complex architectural designs.

This is a point process with a finite number $r$ of (continuous) points along a discrete set of parallel lines within a specific region (see \\cite{AJvM1,AJvM2}). Letting $r\\to\\infty$, one finds a liquid phase inscribed in the polygon, whose boundary (arctic curve) has a cusp near each cut, with two solid phases descending into the cusp (split-cusp). Duse-Johansson-Metcalfe \\cite{DJM} show that in this situation the tile-fluctuations should obey the cusp-Airy statistics.

Our first main result shows that, on a finite measure space, supercyclicity of a composition operator implies hypercyclicity. This phenomenon has no analogue in several classical settings and highlights a rigidity specific to the finite-measure context. We then focus on composition operators induced by odometers and show that many dynamical properties that are distinct for weighted backward shifts collapse in this setting. In particular, for such operators, supercyclicity, Li-Yorke chaos, hypercyclicity, weak mixing, and Devaney chaos are all equivalent. In contrast to this collapse, we show that the classical equivalence between Devaney chaos and the Frequent Hypercyclicity Criterion for weighted backward shifts fails for odometers. Specifically, we construct a mixing, chaotic, and distributionally chaotic composition operator that does not satisfy the Frequent Hypercyclicity Criterion. This combination of rigidity and separation demonstrates that the dynamical behavior of composition operators induced by odometers differs sharply from that of weighted backward shifts."

This paper introduces Grasynda, a novel graph-based approach for synthetic time series generation that: (1) converts univariate time series into a network structure using a graph representation, where each state is a node and each transition is represented as a directed edge; and (2) encodes their temporal dynamics in a transition probability matrix. We performed an extensive evaluation of Grasynda as a data augmentation method for time series forecasting. We use three neural network variations on six benchmark datasets. The results indicate that Grasynda consistently outperforms other time series data augmentation methods, including ones used in state-of-the-art time series foundation models.

Using a new approximate achievable rate expression, we formulate a sum rate maximization problem under per-satellite and per-antenna power constraints and use the classical equivalence between sum rate maximization and mean square error minimization to optimize the satellites' precoding matrices using statistical channel state information. We numerically examine the performance of the proposed scheme in different settings and validate its effectiveness by comparing it against traditional precoding designs."

The high crystalline quality of these films enabled a direct investigation of the material's electronic structure using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). By comparing the experimental results with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we have identified dispersive surface states originating from different terminations of the Na$_2$KSb(111) surface. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the crystalline order of the film is preserved following its activation via the deposition of Cs and Sb. This finding opens a pathway for investigating the electronic structure of multialkali Na$_2$KSb(Cs) photocathodes and for rationally improving their properties."

Using infrared- and collinear-safe jet observables, multivariate classifiers -- boosted decision trees and multilayer perceptrons -- are trained on labeled quark- and gluon-initiated jets from dijet events and applied to photon-jet samples. Observables probing soft and wide-angle radiation, in particular jet multiplicity and jet girth, dominate the discrimination. The jet mass provides a complementary but weaker contribution, while the jet charge exhibits negligible discriminating power. A comparison of the two classifiers demonstrates that the achievable separation is limited primarily by QCD radiation effects rather than by classifier complexity. These findings quantify the extent to which information about the underlying hard process survives hadronization and realistic jet reconstruction, providing a physics-driven baseline for precision jet measurements in $pp$, $ep/$A, and heavy-ion collisions."

We prove that entropy scheduling under non-stationarity can be reduced to a one-dimensional, round-by-round trade-off, faster tracking of the optimal solution after drift vs. avoiding gratuitous randomness when the environment is stable, so exploration strength can be driven by measurable online drift signals. Building on this, we propose AES (Adaptive Entropy Scheduling), which adaptively adjusts the entropy coefficient/temperature online using observable drift proxies during training, requiring almost no structural changes and incurring minimal overhead. Across 4 algorithm variants, 12 tasks, and 4 drift modes, AES significantly reduces the fraction of performance degradation caused by drift and accelerates recovery after abrupt changes."

    "abstract": "Vision-based 3D human motion capture from videos remains a challenge in computer vision. Traditional 3D pose estimation approaches often ignore the temporal consistency between frames, causing implausible and jittery motion. The emerging field of kinematics-based 3D motion capture addresses these issues by estimating the temporal transitioning between poses instead. A major drawback in current kinematics approaches is their reliance on Euler angles. Despite their simplicity, Euler angles suffer from discontinuity that leads to unstable motion reconstructions, especially in online settings where trajectory refinement is unavailable. Contrarily, quaternions have no discontinuity and can produce continuous transitions between poses. In this paper, we propose QuaMo, a novel Quaternion Motions method using quaternion differential equations (QDE) for human kinematics capture. We utilize the state-space model, an effective system for describing real-time kinematics estimations, with quaternion state and the QDE describing quaternion velocity. The corresponding angular acceleration is computed from a meta-PD controller with a novel acceleration enhancement that adaptively regulates the control signals as the human quickly changes to a new pose. Unlike previous work, our QDE is solved under the quaternion unit-sphere constraint that results in more accurate estimations. Experimental results show that our novel formulation of the QDE with acceleration enhancement accurately estimates 3D human kinematics with no discontinuity and minimal implausibilities. QuaMo outperforms comparable state-of-the-art methods on multiple datasets, namely Human3.6M, Fit3D, SportsPose and AIST. The code is available at https://github.com/cuongle1206/QuaMo"

In this method, $92$ $\\mathrm{eV}$ photons obtained from an undulator in a storage ring were reflected back to the original ring using a Mo/Si multilayer mirror. Consequently, $γ$-ray beam production through the extreme ultraviolet light Compton scattering was observed for the first time in a demonstration experiment at the $1$ $\\mathrm{GeV}$ ring, NewSUBARU. The measured energy spectrum was well reproduced by a theoretical calculation with the maximum energy of $0.543$ $\\mathrm{GeV}$.

We complement it with an execution-feasibility model that quantifies co-inclusion constraints under private mempools. Second, we examine execution constraints in the absence of builder markets: without guaranteed atomic inclusion, attackers must rely on sequencer ordering, redundant submissions, and priority fee placement, which renders sandwiching probabilistic rather than deterministic. Third, using transaction-level data from major rollups, we show that naive heuristics overstate sandwich activity. We find that the majority of flagged patterns are false positives and that the median net return for these attacks is negative. Our results suggest that sandwiching, while endemic and profitable on Ethereum L1, is rare, unprofitable, and largely absent in rollups with private mempools. These findings challenge prevailing assumptions, refine measurement of MEV in L2s, and inform the design of sequencing policies."

We investigate the hierarchical position this graph occupies in the hierarchy of graphs defined on groups. We show that the existing hierarchy is further refined by this graph and that the edges of this graph lie between the edges of the commuting graph and the nilpotent graph. For finite groups, we prove a necessary and sufficient condition for the symmetric normaliser graph to be equal to the commuting graph and similarly, for equality with the nilpotent graph. The edge set of the symmetric normaliser graph is also a subset of the edge set of the Engel graph of a group and has connections to the non-generating graph of a group."

We discuss the medium modifications on the electroweak form factors of octet baryons for the range of densities from $ρ=0$ up to $ρ=2 ρ_0$, where $ρ_0= 0.15$ fm$^{-3}$ is the normal nuclear matter density. We also study how the shape of the form factors is modified in finite nuclei due to the profile of the nuclear density distributions compared with calculations using the average density of the nucleus"

    "abstract": "The Beta kernel estimator offers a theoretically superior alternative to the Gaussian kernel for unit interval data, eliminating boundary bias without requiring reflection or transformation. However, its adoption remains limited by the lack of a reliable bandwidth selector; practitioners currently rely on iterative optimization methods that are computationally expensive and prone to instability. We derive the ``\\rot,'' a fast, closed-form bandwidth selector based on the unweighted Asymptotic Mean Integrated Squared Error (AMISE) of a beta reference distribution. To address boundary integrability issues, we introduce a principled heuristic for U-shaped and J-shaped distributions. By employing a method-of-moments approximation, we reduce the bandwidth selection complexity from iterative optimization to $\\mathcal{O}(1)$. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that our rule matches the accuracy of numerical optimization while delivering a speedup of over 35,000 times. Real-world validation on socioeconomic data shows that it avoids the ``vanishing boundary'' and ``shoulder'' artifacts common to Gaussian-based methods. We provide a comprehensive, open-source Python package to facilitate the immediate adoption of the Beta kernel as a drop-in replacement for standard density estimation tools."

Secondly, we extend the warping degree of knots to plus-welded knotoids and discuss its properties. Finally, by utilizing the descending diagram and the warping degree, we obtain two unknotting operations for plus-welded knotoids, referred as a crossing change and a crossing virtualization. For both operations, we find upper bounds for corresponding unknotting numbers of plus-welded knotoids."

The architectural knowledge is distributed across heterogeneous software artifacts such as requirements documents, design diagrams, code, and documentation, making it difficult for developers to access and utilize this knowledge effectively. Moreover, as systems evolve, inconsistencies frequently emerge between these artifacts, leading to architectural erosion and impeding maintenance activities. We envision an automated pipeline that systematically extracts architectural knowledge from diverse artifacts, links them, identifies and resolves inconsistencies, and consolidates this knowledge into a structured knowledge base. This knowledge base enables critical activities such as architecture conformance checking and change impact analysis, while supporting natural language question-answering to improve access to architectural knowledge. To realize this vision, we plan to develop specialized extractors for different artifact types, design a unified knowledge representation schema, implement consistency checking mechanisms, and integrate retrieval-augmented generation techniques for conversational knowledge access."

While electron-neutral atom collisions are tractable using the standard Riccati-Bessel wavefunctions in the asymptotic region, electron-ion collisions face challenges due to the extended range of the screened Coulomb potential, which lacks analytical solutions or numerical code packages for asymptotic regular and irregular wavefunctions. We introduce an R-matrix theoretical framework for general screened potentials and develop a numerical method to compute these asymptotic wavefunctions efficiently. Our approach yields short-range scattering phase shifts that remain invariant with respect to the matching point in the asymptotic region. Applying the Debye screening potential as an illustrative example, we calculate elastic and electron-impact excitation collision strengths for H-like ions (He, C, Ne) across varying temperatures and densities. The calculations show that Debye screening systematically modifies resonance structures and progressively lowers excitation thresholds. Nevertheless, the effective collision strengths and rate coefficients exhibit approximate scaling laws. These findings enable convenient access to electron collision data in plasma environments, advancing plasma diagnostics and modeling."

We do a complete census of filaments in Cygnus X and quantify their links to dense cores, the magnetic field (B field), and HII regions. Using the updated getsf algorithm on the Cygnus X column-density map, we extracted 2633 filaments and 6551 cores. We built CMFs for cores on and off filaments, compared filament orientations with the Planck B field, measured radial column-density profiles near HII-region boundaries, and computed distances between young stellar objects and filament spines. Filaments have a typical width of 0.5 pc in Cygnus X at a resolution of 0.12 pc and host > 93% of high-mass cores (>= 20 Msun). The on-filament CMF shows a high-mass (> 10 Msun) slope of -2.30, while the off-filament CMF is steeper (-2.83). The onCMF peak mass is well below the Bonnor-Ebert mass, whereas the outCMF peak is comparable to it. At 5' resolution, filaments are mostly perpendicular to the B field except at the lowest column densities; the transition occurs near Av = 10 mag. Prominent filaments and high-mass cores preferred to be located around HII-region boundaries or at intersections of multiple HII regions; filament profiles are steeper on the side facing the HII region. Massive-core formation depends strongly on filaments, which may provide reservoirs that feed cores via accretion. The B field likely regulates filament formation, consistent with the type-O mode (converging flows along an oblique MHD shock) and an HII-driven bubble-filament paradigm for Cygnus X."

A sample of ~53,000 stars was selected as metal-poor on the basis of both their halo-like orbits and their spectroscopic [Fe/H] from Gaia DR3 BP/RP (XP) spectra. These metallicity estimates for low-mass stars were enabled by calibrating Gaia XP spectra with stellar parameters from SDSS-V. For -1.5 < [Fe/H] < -1, we find that the MF below 0.5 M_sun exhibits a \"bottom-heavy\" power-law slope of alpha ~ -1.6. We tentatively find that at even lower metallicities, the MF becomes very bottom-light, with a near-flat power-law slope of alpha ~ 0 that implies a severe deficit of low-mass stars. This metallicity-dependent variation is insensitive to the adopted stellar evolution model. These results show that the Galactic low-mass MF is not universal, with variations in the metal-poor regime. A further calibration of XP metallicities in the regime of M < 0.5 M_sun and [Fe/H] < -1.5 will be essential to verify these tentative low-metallicity trends."

Unlike traditional optical or inertial systems, our approach is shape-invariant and resilient to environmental constraints such as lighting and magnetic interference. At the core of our system is Wild-Poser (WiP for short), a compact, real-time Transformer-based architecture that directly predicts 3D joint positions from noisy or corrupted PWD measurements, which can later be used for joint rotation reconstruction via learned methods. WiP generalizes across subjects of varying morphologies, including non-human species, without requiring individual body measurements or shape fitting. Operating in real time, WiP achieves low joint position error and demonstrates accurate 3D motion reconstruction for both human and animal subjects in-the-wild. Our empirical analysis highlights its potential for scalable, low-cost, and general purpose motion capture in real-world settings."

We introduce PALM (Perception Alignment for Local Manipulation), which leverages the invariance of local action distributions between out-of-distribution (OOD) and demonstrated domains to address these OOD shifts concurrently, without additional input modalities, model changes, or data collection. PALM modularizes the manipulation policy into coarse global components and a local policy for fine-grained actions. We reduce the discrepancy between in-domain and OOD inputs at the local policy level by enforcing local visual focus and consistent proprioceptive representation, allowing the policy to retrieve invariant local actions under OOD conditions. Experiments show that PALM limits OOD performance drops to 8% in simulation and 24% in the real world, compared to 45% and 77% for baselines."

    "abstract": "Generative recommendation (GR) typically first quantizes continuous item embeddings into multi-level semantic IDs (SIDs), and then generates the next item via autoregressive decoding. Although existing methods are already competitive in terms of recommendation performance, directly inheriting the autoregressive decoding paradigm from language models still suffers from three key limitations: (1) autoregressive decoding struggles to jointly capture global dependencies among the multi-dimensional features associated with different positions of SID; (2) using a unified, fixed decoding path for the same item implicitly assumes that all users attend to item attributes in the same order; (3) autoregressive decoding is inefficient at inference time and struggles to meet real-time requirements. To tackle these challenges, we propose MDGR, a Masked Diffusion Generative Recommendation framework that reshapes the GR pipeline from three perspectives: codebook, training, and inference. (1) We adopt a parallel codebook to provide a structural foundation for diffusion-based GR. (2) During training, we adaptively construct masking supervision signals along both the temporal and sample dimensions. (3) During inference, we develop a warm-up-based two-stage parallel decoding strategy for efficient generation of SIDs. Extensive experiments on multiple public and industrial-scale datasets show that MDGR outperforms ten state-of-the-art baselines by up to 10.78%. Furthermore, by deploying MDGR on a large-scale online advertising platform, we achieve a 1.20% increase in revenue, demonstrating its practical value. The code will be released upon acceptance."

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) can be highly effective at learning goal-reaching policies, but it typically does not provide formal guarantees that the goal will always be reached. A common approach to provide formal goal-reaching guarantees is to introduce a shielding mechanism that restricts the agent to actions that satisfy predefined safety constraints. The main challenge here is integrating this mechanism with RL so that learning and exploration remain effective without becoming overly conservative. Hence, this paper proposes an RL-based control framework that provides formal goal-reaching guarantees for wheeled mobile robots operating in unstructured environments. We first design a real-time RL policy with a set of 15 carefully defined reward terms. These rewards encourage the robot to reach both static and dynamic goals while generating sufficiently smooth command signals that comply with predefined safety specifications, which is critical in practice. Second, a Lyapunov-like stabilizer layer is integrated into the benchmark RL framework as a policy supervisor to formally strengthen the goal-reaching control while preserving meaningful exploration of the state action space. The proposed framework is suitable for real-time deployment in challenging environments, as it provides a formal guarantee of convergence to the intended goal states and compensates for uncertainties by generating real-time control signals based on the current state, while respecting real-world motion constraints. The experimental results show that the proposed Lyapunov-like stabilizer consistently improves the benchmark RL policies, boosting the goal-reaching rate from 84.6% to 99.0%, sharply reducing failures, and improving efficiency."

    "abstract": "In this letter, we test clipping effective field theory (EFT) simulations as a method of ensuring EFT validity. The procedure imposes that, at the level of the simulation, the invariant mass of a $W^+W^-$ pair $M_{WW}$ is less than the new physics scale $Λ$. We compare this to two other methods, comparison bin by bin of dimension-6 and dimension-8 squared contributions and implementing a cut on data. We find that setting $M_{WW} < Λ$ is not strict enough to ensure that the hierarchy of EFT operators is respected for dimension-6 and dimension-8 contributions. We also show that, even when using a stricter cut on $M_{WW}$, due to different correlations between $M_{WW}$ and $M_{eμ}$ at different EFT orders, the bins in $M_{eμ}$ (the invariant mass of the leptons originating from $W$ decays) used in an EFT fit may not truly be in the regime of EFT validity when performing a dimension-6 fit with $M_{WW} < Λ$. We also explore the correlations of three transverse mass observables: $M_{T1}, M_{T2}$ and $M_{T3}$, finding that $M_{T1}$ and $M_{T3}$ follow the $M_{WW}$ distribution more closely than $M_{eμ}$. We present sensitivity studies using both the $M_{T3}$ distribution and $M_{eμ}$ distribution. We test implementing an experimental cut on $M_{T3}$ in place of clipping the EFT simulation at $M_{WW} < Λ$. We finally comment that adding $M_{WW} < Λ$ cuts only to the EFT simulation could be interpreted as modifying the SMEFT expansion by a form factor and could therefore impact the model independence of EFT fits under this procedure."

    "abstract": "Most existing sound field reconstruction methods target point-to-region reconstruction, interpolating the Acoustic Transfer Functions (ATFs) between a fixed-position sound source and a receiver region. The applicability of these methods is limited because real-world ATFs tend to varying continuously with respect to the positions of sound sources and receiver regions. This paper presents a permutation-invariant physics-informed neural network for region-to-region sound field reconstruction, which aims to interpolate the ATFs across continuously varying sound sources and measurement regions. The proposed method employs a deep set architecture to process the receiver and sound source positions as an unordered set, preserving acoustic reciprocity. Furthermore, it incorporates the Helmholtz equation as a physical constraint to guide network training, ensuring physically consistent predictions."

    "abstract": "Efficient generation of LHC events is hindered by the rapidly rising cost of evaluating QCD matrix elements with increasing multiplicity. We build on a recently proposed two-step strategy in which unweighted events are first generated using the leading-colour (LC) approximation and then reweighted to full-colour (FC) accuracy, utilising the LC integration efficiency while recovering the exact FC prediction. In this work we extend the method to general Standard Model processes and present AmpliCol, a standalone implementation designed for LHC collisions. We benchmark multi-jet, $t\\bar{t}$+jets, $ZZ$+jets, and Drell-Yan+jets production, measuring the time required to obtain a fixed number of unweighted events at FC accuracy. Across all processes, the runtime exhibits a stable exponential scaling with multiplicity, far milder than the factorial growth of conventional matrix-element generators. This demonstrates that the AmpliCol code enables efficient event generation at multiplicities that are otherwise computationally prohibitive."

    "abstract": "Injury occurrence in football poses significant challenges for athletes and teams, carrying personal, competitive, and financial consequences. While machine learning has been applied to injury prediction before, existing approaches often rely on static pre-season data and binary outcomes, limiting their real-world utility. This study investigates the feasibility of using a DeepHit neural network to forecast time-to-injury from longitudinal athlete monitoring data, while providing interpretable predictions. The analysis utilised the publicly available SoccerMon dataset, containing two seasons of training, match, and wellness records from elite female footballers. Data was pre-processed through cleaning, feature engineering, and the application of three imputation strategies. Baseline models (Random Forest, XGBoost, Logistic Regression) were optimised via grid search for benchmarking, while the DeepHit model, implemented with a multilayer perceptron backbone, was evaluated using chronological and leave-one-player-out (LOPO) validation. DeepHit achieved a concordance index of 0.762, outperforming baseline models and delivering individualised, time-varying risk estimates. Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) identified clinically relevant predictors consistent with established risk factors, enhancing interpretability. Overall, this study provides a novel proof of concept: survival modelling with DeepHit shows strong potential to advance injury forecasting in football, offering accurate, explainable, and actionable insights for injury prevention across competitive levels."

However, the possibility of triboelectric cycles, i.e. series that loop back onto themselves, is seemingly at odds with such a coherent description. In this work, we propose that if multiple charge carrying species are at play, both triboelectric series and cycles are possible. We show how series arise naturally if only a single charge carrier species is involved and if the driving mechanism is approach toward thermodynamic equilibrium, and simultaneously, that cycles are forbidden under such conditions. Suspecting multiple carriers might relax the situation, we affirm this is the case by explicit construction of a cycle involving two carriers, and then extend this to show how more complex cycles emerge. Our work highlights the importance of series/cycles towards determining the underlying mechanism(s) and carrier(s) in contact electrification."

    "abstract": "Indexed languages are a classical notion in formal language theory, which has attracted attention in recent decades due to its role in higher-order model checking: They are precisely the languages accepted by order-2 pushdown automata. The downward closure of an indexed language -- the set of all (scattered) subwords of its members -- is well-known to be a regular over-approximation. It was shown by Zetzsche (ICALP 2015) that the downward closure of a given indexed language is effectively computable. However, the algorithm comes with no complexity bounds, and it has remained open whether a primitive-recursive construction exists. We settle this question and provide a triply (resp.\\ quadruply) exponential construction of a non-deterministic (resp.\\ deterministic) automaton. We also prove (asymptotically) matching lower bounds. For the upper bounds, we rely on recent advances in semigroup theory, which let us compute bounded-size summaries of words with respect to a finite semigroup. By replacing stacks with their summaries, we are able to transform an indexed grammar into a context-free one with the same downward closure, and then apply existing bounds for context-free grammars."

    "abstract": "There has been significant recent interest in understanding the dependence on the wavenumber, $k$, of boundary integral operators (BIOs), supported on some set $Γ\\subset \\mathbb{R}^n$, that arise in the solution of BVPs for the Helmholtz equation, $Δu + k^2 u=0$. Recently, for the Dirichlet BVP with data $g$, Caetano et al (2025) have proposed an integral equation (IE) $A_kφ=g$ that applies for arbitrary compact $Γ$. This formulation is a generalisation of standard first kind IEs, where the BIO is $S_k$, the single-layer BIO on a surface $Γ$, that apply when $Γ$ is the boundary of a Lipschitz domain or a screen. In this paper we study the dependence of $A_k$ on $k$, showing that, for $k\\geq k_0>0$, $\\|A_k\\|\\leq ck$ while $\\|A_k^{-1}\\| \\leq c'k$ if $Γ$ is star-shaped, where $c, c'>0$ depend only on $k_0$ and $Γ$. Amongst other bounds we also show that: (i) on the one hand, given any mildly increasing unbounded positive sequence $(k_m)$ and any unbounded sequence $(a_m)$, there exists $Γ$, with connected complement, such that $\\|A_{k_m}^{-1}\\|\\geq a_m$ for every $m$; (ii) on the other hand, for every $Γ\\subset \\mathbb{R}^n$ and $k_0,\\varepsilon, δ>0$, there exists $c>0$ and $E\\subset [k_0,\\infty)$, with Lebesgue measure $m(E)\\leq \\varepsilon$, such that $\\|A_{k}^{-1}\\|\\leq c k^{2n+2+δ}$ on $[k_0,\\infty)\\setminus E$, i.e., the growth of $\\|A_{k}^{-1}\\|$ is at worst polynomial in $k$ if one avoids a set $E$ of arbitrarily small measure. As a corollary of these results we obtain the first $k$-explicit bounds on $\\|S_k^{-1}\\|$ and the condition number of $S_k$ for the case that $Γ$ is the boundary of a Lipschitz domain, or a screen not contained in a hyperplane, and analogous estimates for the case that $Γ$ is a $d$-set (and so of Hausdorff dimension $d$), for non-integer values of $d$."

We introduce CoReTab, a code-driven reasoning framework that produces scalable, interpretable, and automatically verifiable annotations by coupling multi-step reasoning with executable Python code. Using the CoReTab framework, we curate a dataset of 115K verified samples averaging 529 tokens per response and fine-tune open-source MLLMs through a three-stage pipeline. We evaluate the resulting model trained on CoReTab across 17 MMTab benchmarks spanning table question answering, fact verification, and table structure understanding. Our model achieves significant gains of +6.2%, +5.7%, and +25.6%, respectively, over MMTab-trained baselines, while producing transparent and verifiable reasoning traces. These results establish CoReTab as a robust and generalizable supervision framework for improving multi-step reasoning in multimodal table understanding."

    "abstract": "Fairness is a central pillar of trustworthy machine learning, especially in domains where accuracy- or profit-driven optimization is insufficient. While most fairness research focuses on supervised learning, fairness in policy learning remains less explored. Because policy learning is interventional, it induces two distinct fairness targets: action fairness (equitable action assignments) and outcome fairness (equitable downstream consequences). Crucially, equalizing actions does not generally equalize outcomes when groups face different constraints or respond differently to the same action. We propose a novel double fairness learning (DFL) framework that explicitly manages the trade-off among three objectives: action fairness, outcome fairness, and value maximization. We integrate fairness directly into a multi-objective optimization problem for policy learning and employ a lexicographic weighted Tchebyshev method that recovers Pareto solutions beyond convex settings, with theoretical guarantees on the regret bounds. Our framework is flexible and accommodates various commonly used fairness notions. Extensive simulations demonstrate improved performance relative to competing methods. In applications to a motor third-party liability insurance dataset and an entrepreneurship training dataset, DFL substantially improves both action and outcome fairness while incurring only a modest reduction in overall value."

While information-theoretic SA is well understood in centralized and fully connected networks, its extension to decentralized networks with limited local connectivity remains largely unexplored. This paper introduces \\emph{topological secure aggregation} (TSA), which studies one-shot, information-theoretically secure aggregation of neighboring users' inputs over arbitrary network topologies. We develop a unified linear design framework that characterizes TSA achievability through the spectral properties of the communication graph, specifically the kernel of a diagonally modulated adjacency matrix. For several representative classes of $d$-regular graphs including ring, prism and complete topologies, we establish the optimal communication and secret key rate region. In particular, to securely compute one symbol of the neighborhood sum, each user must (i) store at least one key symbol, (ii) broadcast at least one message symbol, and (iii) collectively, all users must hold at least $d$ i.i.d. key symbols. Notably, this total key requirement depends only on the \\emph{neighborhood size} $d$, independent of the network size, revealing a fundamental limit of SA in decentralized networks with limited local connectivity."

However, these approaches become insufficient in the nonlinear setting, as the remaining variance cannot be properly captured independently of the nonlinear mapping. In this work, we propose a novel autoencoder framework that integrates non-uniform variance regularization with an isometric constraint. This design serves as a natural generalization of PCA, enabling the model to preserve key advantages, such as ordered representations and variance retention, while remaining effective for nonlinear dimensionality reduction tasks."

Since the presence of negative edges violates the graph homophily assumption that adjacent nodes are similar, regular graph methods have not been applicable without auxiliary structures to handle them. We aim to directly model the latent statistical dependency among edges with the Gaussian copula and its corresponding correlation matrix, extending CopulaGNN. However, a naive modeling of edge-edge relations is computationally intractable even for a graph with moderate scale. To address this, we propose to 1) represent the correlation matrix as a Gramian of edge embeddings, significantly reducing the number of parameters, and 2) reformulate the conditional probability distribution to dramatically reduce the inference cost. We theoretically verify scalability of our method by proving its linear convergence. Also, our extensive experiments demonstrate that it achieves significantly faster convergence than baselines, maintaining competitive prediction performance to the state-of-the-art models."

While data-driven approaches have advanced rapidly, establishing a precise geometric correspondence between ego-centric visual data and radio propagation remains a challenge. Existing paradigms typically either associate 2D topology maps and auxiliary information with radio maps, or provide 3D perspective views limited by sparse radio data. This spatial representation flattens the complex vertical interactions such as occlusion and diffraction that govern signal behavior in urban environments, rendering the task of cross-view signal inference mathematically ill-posed. To resolve this geometric ambiguity, we introduce SynthRM, a scalable synthetic data platform. SynthRM implements a Visible-Aligned-Surface simulation strategy: rather than probing a global volumetric grid, it performs ray-tracing directly onto the geometry exposed to the sensor. This approach ensures pixel-level consistency between visual semantics and electromagnetic response, transforming the learning objective into a physically well-posed problem. We demonstrate the platform's capabilities by presenting a diverse, city-scale dataset derived from procedurally generated environments. By combining efficient procedural synthesis with high-fidelity electromagnetic modeling, SynthRM provides a transparent, accessible foundation for developing next-generation mobile systems for environment-aware sensing and communication."

To understand the information needed for UI generation, we conducted a thematic analysis of UI prompting guidelines, identifying key design semantics and discovering that they are hierarchical and interdependent. Leveraging these findings, we developed a system that enables users to specify semantics, visualize relationships, and extract how semantics are reflected in generated UIs. By making semantics serve as an intermediate representation between human intent and AI output, our system bridges both gulfs by making requirements explicit and outcomes interpretable. A comparative user study suggests that our approach enhances users' perceived control over intent expression, outcome interpretation, and facilitates more predictable, iterative refinement. Our work demonstrates how explicit semantic representation enables systematic and explainable exploration of design possibilities in AI-driven UI design."

While the existing literature on permutation Mastermind suggests strategies in which $π_t$ and $π_{t+1}$ might be widely different permutations, a resurgence in popularity of this game as a TikTok trend shows that humans (or at least TikTok influencers) use strategies in which consecutive guesses are very similar. For example, it is common to see players attempt one transposition at a time and slowly see their score increase. Motivated by these observations, we study the theoretical impact of two forms of \"locality\" in permutation Mastermind strategies: $\\ell_k$-local strategies, in which any two consecutive guesses differ in at most $k$ positions, and the even more restrictive class of $w_k$-local strategies, in which consecutive guesses differ in a window of length at most $k$. We show that, in broad terms, the optimal number of guesses for local strategies is quadratic, and thus much worse than the $O(n \\lg n)$ guesses that suffice for non-local strategies. We also show NP-hardness of the satisfiability version for $\\ell_3$-local strategies, whereas in the $\\ell_2$-local variant the problem admits a randomized polynomial algorithm."

    "abstract": "Most audio-visual speaker extraction methods rely on synchronized lip recording to isolate the speech of a target speaker from a multi-talker mixture. However, in natural human communication, co-speech gestures are also temporally aligned with speech, often emphasizing specific words or syllables. These gestures provide complementary visual cues that can be especially valuable when facial or lip regions are occluded or distant. In this work, we move beyond lip-centric approaches and propose SeLG, a model that integrates both lip and upper-body gesture information for robust speaker extraction. SeLG features a cross-attention-based fusion mechanism that enables each visual modality to query and selectively attend to relevant speech features in the mixture. To improve the alignment of gesture representations with speech dynamics, SeLG also employs a contrastive InfoNCE loss that encourages gesture embeddings to align more closely with corresponding lip embeddings, which are more strongly correlated with speech. Experimental results on the YGD dataset, containing TED talks, demonstrate that the proposed contrastive learning strategy significantly improves gesture-based speaker extraction, and that our proposed SeLG model, by effectively fusing lip and gesture cues with an attention mechanism and InfoNCE loss, achieves superior performance compared to baselines, across both complete and partial (i.e., missing-modality) conditions."

Exposure correction still faces two critical challenges: (1) the ignorance of object-wise regional semantic information causes the color shift artifacts; (2) real-world exposure images generally have no ground-truth labels, and its labeling entails massive manual editing. To tackle the challenges, we propose a new unsupervised semantic-aware exposure correction network. It contains an adaptive semantic-aware fusion module, which effectively fuses the semantic information extracted from a pre-trained Fast Segment Anything Model into a shared image feature space. Then the fused features are used by our multi-scale residual spatial mamba group to restore the details and adjust the exposure. To avoid manual editing, we propose a pseudo-ground truth generator guided by CLIP, which is fine-tuned to automatically identify exposure situations and instruct the tailored corrections. Also, we leverage the rich priors from the FastSAM and CLIP to develop a semantic-prompt consistency loss to enforce semantic consistency and image-prompt alignment for unsupervised training. Comprehensive experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of our method in correcting real-world exposure images and outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised methods both numerically and visually."

These failures stem from two compounding factors: such components are rare in training data, yet they share identical local geometry with dominant structures like pipes. This work identifies a dual crisis unique to industrial 3D data extreme class imbalance 215:1 ratio compounded by geometric ambiguity where most tail classes share cylindrical primitives with head classes. Existing frequency-based re-weighting methods address statistical imbalance but cannot resolve geometric ambiguity. We propose spatial context constraints that leverage neighborhood prediction consistency to disambiguate locally similar structures. Our approach extends the Class-Balanced (CB) Loss framework with two architecture-agnostic mechanisms: (1) Boundary-CB, an entropy-based constraint that emphasizes ambiguous boundaries, and (2) Density-CB, a density-based constraint that compensates for scan-dependent variations. Both integrate as plug-and-play modules without network modifications, requiring only loss function replacement. On the Industrial3D dataset (610M points from water treatment facilities), our method achieves 55.74% mIoU with 21.7% relative improvement on tail-class performance (29.59% vs. 24.32% baseline) while preserving head-class accuracy (88.14%). Components with primitive-sharing ambiguity show dramatic gains: reducer improves from 0% to 21.12% IoU; valve improves by 24.3% relative. This resolves geometric ambiguity without the typical head-tail trade-off, enabling reliable identification of safety-critical components for automated knowledge extraction in Digital Twin applications."

    "abstract": "Quantum differential privacy provides a rigorous framework for quantifying privacy guarantees in quantum information processing. While classical correlations are typically regarded as adversarial to privacy, the role of their quantum analogue, entanglement, is not well understood. In this work, we investigate how quantum entanglement fundamentally shapes quantum local differential privacy (QLDP). We consider a bipartite quantum system whose input state has a prescribed level of entanglement, characterized by a lower bound on the entanglement entropy. Each subsystem is then processed by a local quantum mechanism and measured using local operations only, ensuring that no additional entanglement is generated during the process. Our main result reveals a sharp phase-transition phenomenon in the relation between entanglement and QLDP: below a mechanism-dependent entropy threshold, the optimal privacy leakage level mirrors that of unentangled inputs; beyond this threshold, the privacy leakage level decreases with the entropy, which strictly improves privacy guarantees and can even turn some non-private mechanisms into private ones. The phase-transition phenomenon gives rise to a nonlinear dependence of the privacy leakage level on the entanglement entropy, even though the underlying quantum mechanisms and measurements are linear. We show that the transition is governed by the intrinsic non-convex geometry of the set of entanglement-constrained quantum states, which we parametrize as a smooth manifold and analyze via Riemannian optimization. Our findings demonstrate that entanglement serves as a genuine privacy-enhancing resource, offering a geometric and operational foundation for designing robust privacy-preserving quantum protocols."

In this work we address this gap by providing the relativistic calculation. We apply standard methods from self-force theory, black hole perturbation theory, and relativistic stellar perturbation theory to perform the full fluid calculation of the relativistic analogue of planetary migration for the first time. We calculate the response of a fluid in the perturbing potential of an EMRI consistently incorporating pressure effects. Using a master enthalpy-like variable and linearised fluid theory, we reconstruct the fluid perturbations and relativistic spiral arm structure for a range of spin values in the Kerr geometry. We conclude by deriving a relativistic torque-balance equation that enables computation and comparison of local torques with advected angular momentum through the disc. This opens a promising route towards establishing torque-balance relations between integrated disc torques arising from fluid perturbations and the forces acting on EMRIs embedded in matter."

    "abstract": "This article is an expository account aimed at viewing entanglement in finite-dimensional quantum many-body systems as a phenomenon of global geometry. While the mathematics of general quantum states has been studied extensively, this article focuses specifically on their entanglement. When a quantum system varies over a classical parameter space, each fiber may look like the same Hilbert space, yet there may be no global identification because of twisting in the gluing data. Describing this situation by an Azumaya algebra, one always obtains the family of pure-state spaces as a Severi-Brauer scheme. The main focus is to characterize the condition under which the subsystem decomposition required to define entanglement exists globally and compatibly, by a reduction to the stabilizer subgroup of the Segre variety, and to explain that the obstruction appears in the Brauer class. As a consequence, quantum states yield a natural filtration dictated by entanglement on the Severi-Brauer scheme. Using a spin system on a torus as an example, we show concretely that the holonomy of the gluing can produce an entangling quantum gate, and can appear as an obstruction class distinct from the usual Berry numbers or Chern numbers. For instance, even for quantum systems that have traditionally been regarded as having no topological band structure, the entanglement of their eigenstates can be related to global geometric universal quantities, reflecting the background geometry."

    "abstract": "Pan-cancer screening in large-scale CT scans remains challenging for existing AI methods, primarily due to the difficulty of localizing diverse types of tiny lesions in large CT volumes. The extreme foreground-background imbalance significantly hinders models from focusing on diseased regions, while redundant focus on healthy regions not only decreases the efficiency but also increases false positives. Inspired by radiologists' glance and focus diagnostic strategy, we introduce GF-Screen, a Glance and Focus reinforcement learning framework for pan-cancer screening. GF-Screen employs a Glance model to localize the diseased regions and a Focus model to precisely segment the lesions, where segmentation results of the Focus model are leveraged to reward the Glance model via Reinforcement Learning (RL). Specifically, the Glance model crops a group of sub-volumes from the entire CT volume and learns to select the sub-volumes with lesions for the Focus model to segment. Given that the selecting operation is non-differentiable for segmentation training, we propose to employ the segmentation results to reward the Glance model. To optimize the Glance model, we introduce a novel group relative learning paradigm, which employs group relative comparison to prioritize high-advantage predictions and discard low-advantage predictions within sub-volume groups, not only improving efficiency but also reducing false positives. In this way, for the first time, we effectively extend cutting-edge RL techniques to tackle the specific challenges in pan-cancer screening. Extensive experiments on 16 internal and 7 external datasets across 9 lesion types demonstrated the effectiveness of GF-Screen. Notably, GF-Screen leads the public validation leaderboard of MICCAI FLARE25 pan-cancer challenge, surpassing the FLARE24 champion solution by a large margin (+25.6% DSC and +28.2% NSD)."

To this end, we propose a cooperative-competitive learning approach termed \\emph{differentially private synthetic distillation} that learns to convert a pretrained model (teacher) into its privacy-preserving counterpart (student) via a trainable generator without access to private data. The learning collaborates with three players in a unified framework and performs alternate optimization: i)~the generator is learned to generate synthetic data, ii)~the teacher and student accept the synthetic data and compute differential private labels by flexible data or label noisy perturbation, and iii)~the student is updated with noisy labels and the generator is updated by taking the student as a discriminator for adversarial training. We theoretically prove that our approach can guarantee differential privacy and convergence. The transcribed student has good performance and privacy protection, while the resulting generator can generate private synthetic data for downstream tasks.

The master equation, a nonlinear partial differential equation on Wasserstein space, characterizes the value function of MFGs and is challenging to analyze directly due to its measure-valued derivatives. We propose a probabilistic interpretation using coupled McKean-Vlasov forward-backward stochastic differential equations (MV-FBSDEs) with jumps. Under suitable Lipschitz and differentiability assumptions on the coefficients, we first establish the well-posedness of the MV-FBSDEs on a small time interval via a contraction mapping argument. We then prove the existence and regularity of the first- and second-order derivatives of the solutions with respect to the spatial and measure variables, relying on careful estimates involving jump terms and measure derivatives. Finally, we show that the decoupling field of the MV-FBSDEs satisfies the master equation in the classical sense, providing both existence and uniqueness of the solution. Our work extends earlier results on diffusion-driven MFGs to the jump-diffusion setting and offers a probabilistic framework for analyzing and numerically solving such kind of master equations."

Some mitigation strategies against these attacks do exist, but they are not as far-reaching or as efficient as the CHERI architecture. CHERI uses capabilities to restrict pointers to certain regions of memory and with certain access restrictions. These capabilities are also used to implement \"compartmentalisation\": dividing a binary into smaller components with limited privilege, while adhering to the principle of least privilege. However, while this architecture successfully mitigates memory corruption attacks, the compartmentalisation mechanisms in place are less effective in containing malicious code to a separate compartment. This paper details four ways to bypass compartmentalisation, with a focus on Linux and BSD operating systems ported to this architecture. We find that although compartmentalisation is implemented in these two operating systems, simple bugs and attacks can still allow malicious code to bypass it.

    "abstract": "Magnetic islands strongly influence cross-field electron transport in magnetized plasmas. In particular, bifurcations of the island topology modify the number and location of O-points, X-points, and separatrix boundaries, thereby altering diffusion pathways. In recent DIII-D experiments, external magnetic perturbations were used to rotate and periodically bifurcate the island on the q = 2 surface, causing a switchback between a q = 2/1-dominated structure and a narrower q = 4/2-dominated structure. To investigate how this topological change affects electron transport, we employ the field line tracing code TRIP3D with an implemented collisional operator. Thermal, tracer electrons launched from O-points, X-points, and outside separatrix boundaries reveal distinct diffusion regimes, including classical, subdiffusive, and superdiffusive behavior, depending on both the dominant island mode and launch location. These results suggest that island bifurcation can alter electron diffusion across rational surfaces, with direct implications for particle confinement. While the present work emphasizes diffusion as a general framework, the findings provide insight into the conditions under which electron trapping into an island or stochastization of the island's separatrix can enable additional mechanisms, such as the generation of energetic electrons."

    "abstract": "Python libraries often need to maintain a stable public API even as internal implementations evolve, gain new backends, or depend on heavy optional libraries. In Python, where internal objects are easy to inspect and import, users can come to rely on \"reachable internals\" that were never intended to be public, making refactoring risky and slowing long-term maintenance. This paper revisits the pointer-to-implementation (PIMPL) idiom from C++ and reinterprets it as a Pythonic pattern of opaque delegation: a small public object (or module) that delegates its behavior to a separate implementation object treated as internal. We situate this pattern within a broader taxonomy of encapsulation techniques in Python, relate it to existing practices such as module-level indirection, facade objects, and backend dispatch, and identify PIMPL-like structures already used in the standard library and the scientific Python ecosystem. We then show how a Pythonic PIMPL can be used in existing codebases to isolate heavy dependencies, support lazy imports, and enable runtime selection of alternative backends without changing the public API. Finally, we discuss the benefits and trade-offs of the approach and offer practical guidance on when the pattern is appropriate and how to apply it in large, long-lived Python libraries."

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning from human or AI feedback (RLHF/RLAIF) for speech-in/speech-out dialogue systems (SDS) remains underexplored, with prior work largely limited to single semantic rewards applied at the utterance level. Such setups overlook the multi-dimensional and multi-modal nature of conversational quality, which encompasses semantic coherence, audio naturalness, speaker consistency, emotion alignment, and turn-taking behavior. Moreover, they are fundamentally mismatched with duplex spoken dialogue systems that generate responses incrementally, where agents must make decisions based on partial utterances. We address these limitations with the first multi-reward RLAIF framework for SDS, combining semantic, audio-quality, and emotion-consistency rewards. To align utterance-level preferences with incremental, blockwise decoding in duplex models, we apply turn-level preference sampling and aggregate per-block log-probabilities within a single DPO objective. We present the first systematic study of preference learning for improving SDS quality in both multi-turn Chain-of-Thought and blockwise duplex models, and release a multi-reward DPO dataset to support reproducible research. Experiments show that single-reward RLAIF selectively improves its targeted metric, while joint multi-reward training yields consistent gains across semantic quality and audio naturalness. These results highlight the importance of holistic, multi-reward alignment for practical conversational SDS."

We present the first large-scale empirical analysis of disempowerment patterns in real-world AI assistant interactions, analyzing 1.5 million consumer Claude.ai conversations using a privacy-preserving approach. We focus on situational disempowerment potential, which occurs when AI assistant interactions risk leading users to form distorted perceptions of reality, make inauthentic value judgments, or act in ways misaligned with their values. Quantitatively, we find that severe forms of disempowerment potential occur in fewer than one in a thousand conversations, though rates are substantially higher in personal domains like relationships and lifestyle. Qualitatively, we uncover several concerning patterns, such as validation of persecution narratives and grandiose identities with emphatic sycophantic language, definitive moral judgments about third parties, and complete scripting of value-laden personal communications that users appear to implement verbatim. Analysis of historical trends reveals an increase in the prevalence of disempowerment potential over time. We also find that interactions with greater disempowerment potential receive higher user approval ratings, possibly suggesting a tension between short-term user preferences and long-term human empowerment. Our findings highlight the need for AI systems designed to robustly support human autonomy and flourishing."

During encoding, PixSearch emits <search> tokens to trigger retrieval, selects query modalities (text, image, or region), and generates pixel-level masks that directly serve as visual queries, eliminating the reliance on modular pipelines (detectors, segmenters, captioners, etc.). A two-stage supervised fine-tuning regimen with search-interleaved supervision teaches retrieval timing and query selection while preserving segmentation ability. On egocentric and entity-centric VQA benchmarks, PixSearch substantially improves factual consistency and generalization, yielding a 19.7% relative gain in accuracy on CRAG-MM compared to whole image retrieval, while retaining competitive reasoning performance on various VQA and text-only QA tasks."

Consequently, effectively defending against these attacks requires proactive hardening strategies capable of continuously generating adaptive attack vectors to optimize LLM defense at runtime. We present HASTE (Hard-negative Attack Sample Training Engine): a systematic framework that iteratively engineers highly evasive prompts, within a modular optimization process, to continuously enhance detection efficacy for prompt-based attack techniques. The framework is agnostic to synthetic data generation methods, and can be generalized to evaluate prompt-injection detection efficacy, with and without fuzzing, for any hard-negative or hard-positive iteration strategy. Experimental evaluation of HASTE shows that hard negative mining successfully evades baseline detectors, reducing malicious prompt detection for baseline detectors by approximately 64%. However, when integrated with detection model re-training, it optimizes the efficacy of prompt detection models with significantly fewer iteration loops compared to relative baseline strategies. The HASTE framework supports both proactive and reactive hardening of LLM defenses and guardrails. Proactively, developers can leverage HASTE to dynamically stress-test prompt injection detection systems; efficiently identifying weaknesses and strengthening defensive posture. Reactively, HASTE can mimic newly observed attack types and rapidly bridge detection coverage by teaching HASTE-optimized detection models to identify them."

    "abstract": "In the preprocessing framework for dealing with uncertain data, one is given a set of regions that one is allowed to preprocess to create some auxiliary structure such that when a realization of these regions is given, consisting of one point per region, this auxiliary structure can be used to reconstruct some desired output structure more efficiently than would have been possible without preprocessing. The framework has been successfully applied to several, mostly geometric, computational problems. In this note, we propose using a supersequence of input items as the auxiliary structure, and explore its potential on the problems of sorting and computing the smallest or largest gap in a set of numbers. That is, our uncertainty regions are intervals on the real line, and in the preprocessing phase we output a supersequence of the intervals such that the sorted order / smallest gap / largest gap of any realization is a subsequence of this sequence. We argue that supersequences are simpler than specialized auxiliary structures developed in previous work. An advantage of using supersequences as the auxiliary structures is that it allows us to decouple the preprocessing phase from the reconstruction phase in a stronger sense than was possible in previous work, resulting in two separate algorithmic problems for which different solutions may be combined to obtain known and new results. We identify one key open problem which we believe is of independent interest."

Traditional test-time defenses largely operate under the paradigm of internal diagnosis methods like model repairing or input robustness, yet these approaches are often fragile under advanced attacks as they remain entangled with the victim model's corrupted parameters. We propose a paradigm shift from Internal Diagnosis to External Semantic Auditing, arguing that effective defense requires decoupling safety from the victim model via an independent, semantically grounded auditor. To this end, we present a framework harnessing Universal Vision-Language Models (VLMs) as evolving semantic gatekeepers. We introduce PRISM (Prototype Refinement & Inspection via Statistical Monitoring), which overcomes the domain gap of general VLMs through two key mechanisms: a Hybrid VLM Teacher that dynamically refines visual prototypes online, and an Adaptive Router powered by statistical margin monitoring to calibrate gating thresholds in real-time. Extensive evaluation across 17 datasets and 11 attack types demonstrates that PRISM achieves state-of-the-art performance, suppressing Attack Success Rate to <1% on CIFAR-10 while improving clean accuracy, establishing a new standard for model-agnostic, externalized security."

The corresponding theory of reaction-diffusion dynamics combines ideal diffusion with nonlinear reactions, resulting in patterns when species diffuse at different rates and reactions are sufficiently nonlinear. However, real systems are more complex and particularly involve physical interactions between constituents. While such interactions can promote patterns, we here show that they can also induce dynamic, chaotic patterns. These patterns exhibit well-defined length and time scales, which result from cycles of droplet coarsening and fission. The dynamical patterns combine properties of traditional Turing patterns and chemically active droplets, which emerge for strong physical interactions. Our analysis thus reveals three qualitatively different regimes that emerge when two components interact physically and undergo nonlinear reactions."

    "abstract": "Understanding how nanoscale heterogeneities influence charge transport and mass transfer in oxides is critical for developing advanced materials for energy and electronic uses. In high-temperature applications, the formation of thermal oxides with complex chemical and structural features plays a central role in material lifetime. While thermally grown zirconia (ZrO2) on zirconium alloys exhibits strong chemical and microstructural gradients across the oxide thickness, linking these heterogeneities to electronic-defect landscapes remains challenging. We demonstrate cross-sectional scanning electron microscope-cathodoluminescence (SEM-CL) as a mesoscale probe of spatial variations in luminescence in zirconia and establish correlations with co-registered electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) and electron probe micro-analysis (EPMA) on the same region. The SEM-CL signal is dominated by the ~2.7 eV defect band, but its intensity varies strongly across the oxide cross section. Correlative EBSD-CL analysis reveals that CL intensity increases with grain area and decreases at the grain boundaries, consistent with enhanced non-radiative recombination associated with microstructural disorder. EPMA mapping shows that a substantial fraction of CL-dark features co-localize with secondary phase precipitates enriched in iron. These results show that SEM-CL contrast in corrosion-grown ZrO2 is controlled by both chemical heterogeneity and microstructural disorder, underscoring the need for correlative registration to interpret CL images. This multi-modal approach provides an efficient route to connect electronic properties and luminescence signatures across complex oxide cross sections to underlying chemistry and microstructure, thereby providing a pathway to relate local defect landscapes to regions likely to bias electronic/ionic transport during oxidation."

    "abstract": "Novel display technologies can deliver high-quality images across a wide field of view, creating immersive experiences. While rendering for such devices is expensive, most of the content falls into peripheral vision, where human perception differs from that in the fovea. Consequently, it is critical to understand and leverage the limitations of visual perception to enable efficient rendering. A standard approach is to exploit the reduced sensitivity to spatial details in the periphery by reducing rendering resolution, so-called foveated rendering. While this strategy avoids rendering part of the content altogether, an alternative promising direction is to replace accurate and expensive rendering with inexpensive synthesis of content that is perceptually indistinguishable from the ground-truth image. In this paper, we propose such a method for the efficient generation of an image signal that substitutes the rendering of high-frequency details. The method is grounded in findings from image statistics, which show that preserving appropriate local statistics is critical for perceived image quality. Based on this insight, we extrapolate several local image statistics from foveated content into higher spatial frequency ranges that are attenuated or omitted in the rendering process. This rich set of statistics is later used to synthesize a signal that is added to the initial rendering, boosting its perceived quality. We focus on phase information, demonstrating the importance of its alignment across space and frequencies. We calibrate and compare our method with state-of-the-art strategies, showing a significant reduction in the content that must be accurately rendered at a relatively small extra cost for synthesizing the additional signal."

The students use this as the basis for a ``logical derivation'' and reach a contradiction, which they (falsely) interpret as saying that there cannot be a test. The teacher gives a test e.g. on Wednesday, ``surprising'' the students. Its curious turns give the story the flavor of a paradox. Alternative names are the {\\it unexpected hanging paradox\\/} and the {\\it prediction paradox}. Discussions and analyses of the story in the philosophical and mathematical literature are abundant, spanning 80 years until today. Apparently, none of the known explanations has been generally accepted as conclusive. We offer a fresh view, in propositional logic. ``Surprise'' is captured as unprovability of a certain formula from some axiom system. ``Knowledge'' corresponds to axiom systems and can be gained by mathematical proofs. The notorious property of self-reference in the announcement is cleanly accommodated. All errors made by the students are identified. A general analysis shows that the students cannot learn anything from the announcement. This is the first mathematically precise analysis of the story that shows that self-reference, full power of mathematical proofs, and truthfulness of the teacher can consistently coexist. The ``paradox'' vanishes. In order to facilitate comparisons with treatments using modal logic a version based on system S5 is also given. A formula $σ$ is identified that formalizes ``there will be a surprising test'', and it is shown that the students take the announcement to mean $\\squareσ$ while in fact the information conveyed by it is not stronger than $\\diamondσ$. This dissolves all contradictions or ``paradoxical'' issues."

When the support of the measure generates a virtually nilpotent group, we provide an effective version of this result. These more refined estimates rely on the existence of a ``quantitative splitting'' of a virtually simply connected nilpotent group, a result which may be of independent interest. As applications, we deduce that the same concentration inequalities hold for centred random walks on the following classes of groups: amenable connected Lie groups (including non-unimodular ones), polycyclic and more generally finitely generated solvable groups with finite Prüfer rank. This shows in particular that centred random walk are diffusive on such groups. For polycyclic groups, this strengthens and completes partial results previously obtained by Russ Thompson in 2011."

    "abstract": "Quasars accretion models predict a broad range of optical and ultraviolet properties that depend primarily on black hole mass and accretion rate. Yet, most optically selected luminous quasars display strikingly similar continuum spectra. We show that this uniformity can be explained by a nearly constant luminosity to mass (Eddington) ratio, L_EDD and by thermal emission from a standard, optically thick, geometrically thin accretion disc. A standard disk with an Eddington ratio L_EDD=0.1 reproduces both the black hole mass/luminosity distribution of Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) quasars and their principal continuum properties. In this framework, the spectral energy distribution peaks beyond the observable ultraviolet range for nearly all sources. We show that the few quasars, expected to be cold enough to shift the peak into the observable region, indeed show this behaviour. This scenario is further supported by an analysis of the relation between the luminosity of the main broad emission lines and the continuum luminosity (i.e. the Baldwin effect). We find that 1) the observed slopes of the line to continuum relations match the expectations from the standard disk model, if we assume that the line emission is a good proxy of the ionizing luminosity; 2) the dispersions of the line-continuum luminosity relations are very small (as small as 0.13 dex), suggesting that the physics of the disk-broad line region system is dominated by only one parameter (the black hole mass) with a nearly constant Eddington ratio. Finally, we notice that our hypothesis of constant L_EDD=0.1 provides a black hole mass estimate (based on the observed luminosity) with a smaller error than the virial estimate."

Black hole-neutron star binaries with even more symmetric mass ratios are expected to leave behind massive disks capable of driving bright electromagnetic transients like kilonovae. Currently, there is only a limited number of numerical-relativity simulations of black hole-neutron star mergers in this regime, which are vital for accurate gravitational waveform models and analytical fitting formulas for the remnant properties. Insufficient accuracy of these may lead to misclassification of real events and potentially missed opportunities to locate their electromagnetic counterparts. To fill this gap in the parameter space coverage, we perform simulations of black hole-neutron star mergers with mass ratios $q \\in \\{1, 1/2, 1/3\\}$. We find the gravitational waveform models do not show good agreement with the numerical waveforms, with dephasing at the level of around 1 rad at the merger. We find that the masses of the dynamical ejecta and disk are in good agreement with the available fitting formulas. The analytical formulas for the remnant black hole are in excellent agreement for the black hole mass, but are less accurate with the predictions for its spin. Moreover, we analyze the remnant disk structure and dynamics, deriving the rotation law and identifying global trapped $g$-mode density oscillations. We distinguish three types of accretion in the postmerger and find modulation of the accretion rate by the global oscillations of the disk. Finally, we model the kilonova emission these systems would produce and find that most of them are potentially detectable by Vera C.

By applying tailored pulsed drives and engineering the magnon-phonon interactions, our scheme enables the creation of diverse long-distance and dynamically stable entanglement. Beyond basic magnon-phonon two-mode entanglement, it supports genuine multimode entanglement between a single phonon and multiple magnons, bipartite entanglement between a single magnon and multiple phonons, as well as genuine four-mode entanglement involving two magnons and two phonons. Moreover, we show that dissipative magnon-magnon interactions mediated by traveling photons can generate substantially stronger long-distance entanglement than coherent couplings.

    "abstract": "Genome sequencing has become a central focus in computational biology. A genome study typically begins with sequencing, which produces millions to billions of short DNA fragments known as reads. Read mapping aligns these reads to a reference genome. Read mapping for short reads comes in two forms: single-end and paired-end, with the latter being more prevalent due to its higher accuracy and support for advanced analysis. Read mapping remains a major performance bottleneck in genome analysis due to expensive dynamic programming. Prior efforts have attempted to mitigate this cost by employing filters to identify and potentially discard computationally expensive matches and leveraging hardware accelerators to speed up the computations. While partially effective, these approaches have limitations. In particular, existing filters are often ineffective for paired-end reads, as they evaluate each read independently and exhibit relatively low filtering ratios. In this work, we propose GenPairX, a hardware-algorithm co-designed accelerator that efficiently minimizes the computational load of paired-end read mapping while enhancing the throughput of memory-intensive operations. GenPairX introduces: (1) a novel filtering algorithm that jointly considers both reads in a pair to improve filtering effectiveness, and a lightweight alignment algorithm to replace most of the computationally expensive dynamic programming operations, and (2) two specialized hardware mechanisms to support the proposed algorithms. Our evaluations show that GenPairX delivers substantial performance improvements over state-of-the-art solutions, achieving 1575x and 1.43x higher throughput per watt compared to leading CPU-based and accelerator-based read mappers, respectively, all without compromising accuracy."

    "abstract": "This paper presents the web-based platform Machine Learning with Bricks and an accompanying two-day course designed to teach machine learning concepts to students aged 12 to 17 through programming-free robotics activities. Machine Learning with Bricks is an open source platform and combines interactive visualizations with LEGO robotics to teach three core algorithms: KNN, linear regression, and Q-learning. Students learn by collecting data, training models, and interacting with robots via a web-based interface. Pre- and post-surveys with 14 students demonstrate significant improvements in conceptual understanding of machine learning algorithms, positive shifts in AI perception, high platform usability, and increased motivation for continued learning. This work demonstrates that tangible, visualization-based approaches can make machine learning concepts accessible and engaging for young learners while maintaining technical depth.

    "source": "arXiv",
    "abstract": "Despite significant progress in alignment, large language models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks that elicit harmful behaviors. Activation steering techniques offer a promising inference-time intervention approach, but existing methods suffer from critical limitations: activation addition requires careful coefficient tuning and is sensitive to layer-specific norm variations, while directional ablation provides only binary control. Recent work on Angular Steering introduces continuous control via rotation in a 2D subspace, but its practical implementation violates norm preservation, causing distribution shift and generation collapse, particularly in models below 7B parameters. We propose Selective Steering, which addresses these limitations through two key innovations: (1) a mathematically rigorous norm-preserving rotation formulation that maintains activation distribution integrity, and (2) discriminative layer selection that applies steering only where feature representations exhibit opposite-signed class alignment. Experiments across nine models demonstrate that Selective Steering achieves 5.5x higher attack success rates than prior methods while maintaining zero perplexity violations and approximately 100\\% capability retention on standard benchmarks. Our approach provides a principled, efficient framework for controllable and stable LLM behavior modification. Code: https://github.com/knoveleng/steering"

    "abstract": "We introduce a structural framework for the geometry of financial order books in which liquidity, supply, and demand are treated as emergent observables rather than primitive market variables. The market is modeled as a relational substrate without assumed metric, temporal, or price coordinates. Observable quantities arise only through observation, implemented here as a reduction of relational degrees of freedom followed by a low-dimensional spectral projection. A one-dimensional projection induces a price-like coordinate and a projected liquidity density around the mid price, from which bid and ask sides emerge as two complementary restrictions. We show that directional liquidity imbalances decompose naturally into a rigid drift of the projected density and a geometric shear mode that deforms the bid--ask structure without inducing price motion. Under a minimal single-scale hypothesis, the shear geometry constrains the projected liquidity to a gamma-like functional form, appearing as an integrated-gamma profile in discrete data. Empirical analysis of high-frequency Level~II data across multiple U.S. equities confirms this geometry and shows that it outperforms standard alternative cumulative models under explicit model comparison and residual diagnostics."

    "abstract": "We comprehensively investigate the absorption and scattering of massless scalar waves by Frolov black holes, which is a class of regularization of the Reissner--Nordström spacetime. By analyzing the null geodesics, we determine the photon sphere radius and the critical impact parameter, deriving the geometric capture cross section and the classical differential scattering cross section. Utilizing the partial-wave method, we numerically compute the absorption and scattering cross sections across a broad frequency range. Our numerical results show excellent agreement with the low-frequency limit and the high-frequency sinc approximation, as well as with the semiclassical glory approximation. We analyze the dependence of the spectra on the charge and the regularization parameter (Hubble length). Under the horizon-radius normalization, we observe that the total absorption cross section increases with the regularization parameter, a behavior we attribute to the variation of the dimensionless mass. Furthermore, by comparing Frolov, Reissner--Nordström, and Hayward black holes, we demonstrate that their absorption and scattering patterns are nearly indistinguishable when their critical impact parameters or glory impact parameters are matched. This indicates that the photon sphere geometry predominantly governs scalar field interactions, while the detailed core structure plays a secondary role. Our work underscores the potential of wave-based probes to test regular black hole geometries and their observable imprints."

    "abstract": "Analyses of global magnetic fields in M dwarfs rely on many approximations regarding the derivation of average line profiles from spectropolarimetric data, interpreting them with analytical functions and modelling them using Zeeman Doppler imaging (ZDI). These assumptions have not been systematically tested. We assessed the accuracy of standard treatments of average polarisation profiles in M dwarfs and their interpretation with ZDI. We focused on the filling-factor approach, which attempts to represent coexisting global and small-scale fields. We performed polarised radiative transfer calculations across the near-infrared spectrum of a typical M dwarf. From these theoretical spectra, we derived mean Stokes profiles and approximated them with different line-synthesis methods. To test the recovery of global fields, we performed ZDI inversions using simulated Stokes V observations for low- and high-activity cases. The analytical approximation of mean polarisation profiles reproduces Stokes I and V only for fields up to ~1 kG and fails for linear polarisation. ZDI with single-line analytical Stokes V profiles is adequate for weakly magnetic M dwarfs with fields below a few hundred gauss. However, combined with the filling-factor formalism, this traditional modelling approach produces unphysical local fields and distorted global geometries for active M dwarfs with multi-kilogauss fields. These issues are mitigated using a new mapping technique based on theoretical Stokes profiles that account for both global and randomly distributed small-scale fields. Our study reveals fundamental limitations of current ZDI analyses of active M dwarfs and questions the reliability of some published maps. (abridged)"

We achieve this performance by (1) reformulating detection as binary token-level START/END/INSIDE classification rather than span-based prediction, (2) incorporating NP chunking and dependency features that help discontinuous and NOUN-type MWEs identification, and (3) applying oversampling that addresses severe class imbalance in the training data. We confirm the generalization of our method on the STREUSLE dataset, achieving 78.9% F1. These results demonstrate that carefully designed smaller models can substantially outperform LLMs on structured NLP tasks, with important implications for resource-constrained deployments."

Polygonal, quadtree, and hybrid quadtree--polygonal meshes are employed to accommodate local refinement and hanging nodes, and a solution-driven adaptive strategy further concentrates resolution near steep gradients and wet--dry transitions. Free-surface seepage is solved using a fixed-mesh iterative scheme that updates the wetted region, permeability field, and boundary conditions. Benchmark tests demonstrate accurate hydraulic-head and free-surface predictions, and show that adaptivity attains similar accuracy with substantially fewer degrees of freedom and CPU time."

Through a preliminary experiment (N=18) and a co-design workshop, we identified key challenges users face across a four-stage process and distilled four design requirements: pre-engagement framing, interactive organization, reflective prompts, and synthesis support. Based on these insights, we developed CommSense, an on-the-fly plugin that enhances user engagement with online comments by providing visual overviews and lightweight prompts to guide reasoning. A between-subject evaluation (N=24) demonstrates that CommSense improves bias awareness and reflective thinking, helping users produce more comprehensive, evidence-based rationales while maintaining high usability."

    "abstract": "Benchmark-based evaluation is the de facto standard for comparing large language models (LLMs). However, its reliability is increasingly threatened by test set contamination, where test samples or their close variants leak into training data and artificially inflate reported performance. To address this issue, prior work has explored two main lines of mitigation. One line attempts to identify and remove contaminated benchmark items before evaluation, but this inevitably alters the evaluation set itself and becomes unreliable when contamination is moderate or severe. The other line preserves the benchmark and instead suppresses contaminated behavior at evaluation time; however, such interventions often interfere with normal inference and lead to noticeable performance degradation on clean inputs. We propose DeconIEP, a decontamination framework that operates entirely during evaluation by applying small, bounded perturbations in the input embedding space. Guided by a relatively less-contaminated reference model, DeconIEP learns an instance-adaptive perturbation generator that steers the evaluated model away from memorization-driven shortcut pathways. Across multiple open-weight LLMs and benchmarks, extensive empirical results show that DeconIEP achieves strong decontamination effectiveness while incurring only minimal degradation in benign utility."

Existing tracking methods optimize for prediction accuracy but ignore pursuit feasibility, resulting in trajectories that are physically impossible to intercept 99.9% of the time.

Our method represents drone motion as compact 8-dimensional tokens capturing velocity, acceleration, scale, and smoothness, enabling a 12-frame causal transformer to reason about future behavior. We introduce the Intercept Success Rate (ISR) metric to measure pursuit feasibility under realistic interceptor constraints. Evaluated on the Anti-UAV-RGBT dataset with 226 real drone sequences, P2P achieves 28.12 pixel average displacement error and 0.597 ISR, representing a 77% improvement in trajectory prediction and 597x improvement in pursuit feasibility over tracking-only baselines, while maintaining perfect drone classification accuracy (100%). Our work demonstrates that temporal reasoning over motion patterns enables both accurate prediction and actionable pursuit planning."

Individual jobs carry heterogeneous contextual features, based on which the agent chooses a job and matches it with a server to maximize the departure rate. The service/departure rate is governed by a logistic model of the contextual feature with an unknown server-specific parameter. To evaluate the performance of a policy, we consider queue length regret, defined as the difference in queue length between the policy and the optimal policy. The main challenge in the analysis is that the lists of remaining job features in the queue may differ under our policy versus the optimal policy for a given time step, since they may process jobs in different orders. To address this, we propose the idea of policy-switching queues equipped with a sophisticated coupling argument. This leads to a novel queue length regret decomposition framework, allowing us to understand the short-term effect of choosing a suboptimal job-server pair and its long-term effect on queue state differences. We show that our algorithm, CQB-$\\varepsilon$, achieves a regret upper bound of $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(T^{-1/4})$. We also consider the setting of adversarially chosen contexts, for which our second algorithm, CQB-Opt, achieves a regret upper bound of $\\mathcal{O}(\\log^2 T)$. Lastly, we provide experimental results that validate our theoretical findings."

We developed a wearable haptic device that transfers liquid and air into flexible containers mounted on the back of the user's hand, allowing us to independently manipulate weight and pressure. Through an initial evaluation using three conditions-no feedback, weight only, and weight combined with pressure-we examined how these signals affect perceived heaviness, coherence with visual cues, and the perceived urgency of notifications. Our results validate that pressure amplifies the perception of weight, but this increased heaviness does not translate into higher perceived urgency. These findings suggest that while pressure___enhanced weight can enrich haptic rendering of UI elements in VR, its contribution to communicating urgency may require further investigation, alternative pressure profiles, or different types of notifications."

Due to the limited number of labeled samples in the target domain, there can be intrinsic similarity of classes in the feature space, which may result in biased predictions, even when the model is trained on a balanced dataset. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a multi-view consistency framework, which includes two views for training strongly augmented data. One is a debiasing strategy for correcting class-wise prediction probabilities according to the prediction performance of the model. The other involves leveraging pseudo-negative labels derived from the model predictions. Furthermore, we introduce a cross-domain affinity learning aimed at aligning features of the same class across different domains, thereby enhancing overall performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the competing methods on two standard domain adaptation datasets, DomainNet and Office-Home. Combining unsupervised domain adaptation and semi-supervised learning offers indispensable contributions to the industrial sector by enhancing model adaptability, reducing annotation costs, and improving performance."

    "abstract": "Split learning is a distributed training paradigm where a neural network is partitioned between clients and a server, which allows data to remain at the client while only intermediate activations are shared. Traditional split learning relies on end-to-end backpropagation across the client-server split point. This incurs a large communication overhead (i.e., forward activations and backward gradients need to be exchanged every iteration) and significant memory use (for storing activations and gradients). In this paper, we develop a beyond-backpropagation training method for split learning. In this approach, the client and server train their model partitions semi-independently, using local loss signals instead of propagated gradients. In particular, the client's network is augmented with a small auxiliary classifier at the split point to provide a local error signal, while the server trains on the client's transmitted activations using the true loss function. This decoupling removes the need to send backward gradients, which cuts communication costs roughly in half and also reduces memory overhead (as each side only stores local activations for its own backward pass). We evaluate our approach on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. Our experiments show two key results. First, the proposed approach achieves performance on par with standard split learning that uses backpropagation. Second, it significantly reduces communication (of transmitting activations/gradient) by 50% and peak memory usage by up to 58%."

Within this framework, we show that, despite the explicit scale dependence of Newton's constant, the classical solutions are generically unaffected by the running of the coupling. We then derive the Wheeler-DeWitt equation incorporating the scale dependence of the gravitational couplings and analyze its solutions in the minisuperspace framework. In the classical limit, while the scale dependence of Newton's constant does not affect the classical behavior, the running of the cosmological constant can contribute to the classical solutions. Moreover, we show that the quantum behavior in the ultraviolet regime acts toward suppressing singularity formation in all cases, independently of how the renormalization-group scale is identified with spacetime coordinates and of the relative magnitudes of the ultraviolet fixed points of the running Newton's constant and cosmological constant."

(2025) introduced Multiple Wasserstein Gradient Descent (MWGraD) algorithm, which exploits the geometric structure of Wasserstein space to jointly optimize multiple objectives. Building on this approach, we propose an accelerated variant, A-MWGraD, inspired by Nesterov's acceleration. We analyze the continuous-time dynamics and establish convergence to weakly Pareto optimal points in probability space. Our theoretical results show that A-MWGraD achieves a convergence rate of O(1/t^2) for geodesically convex objectives and O(e^{-\\sqrtβt}) for $β$-strongly geodesically convex objectives, improving upon the O(1/t) rate of MWGraD in the geodesically convex setting. We further introduce a practical kernel-based discretization for A-MWGraD and demonstrate through numerical experiments that it consistently outperforms MWGraD in convergence speed and sampling efficiency on multi-target sampling tasks."

    "abstract": "The emerging applications of next-generation wireless networks (e.g., immersive 3D communication, low-altitude networks, and integrated sensing and communication) necessitate high-fidelity environmental intelligence. 3D radio maps have emerged as a critical tool for this purpose, enabling spectrum-aware planning and environment-aware sensing by bridging the gap between physical environments and electromagnetic signal propagation. However, constructing accurate 3D radio maps requires fine-grained 3D geometric information and a profound understanding of electromagnetic wave propagation. Existing approaches typically treat optical and wireless knowledge as distinct modalities, failing to exploit the fundamental physical principles governing both light and electromagnetic propagation. To bridge this gap, we propose URF-GS, a unified radio-optical radiation field representation framework for accurate and generalizable 3D radio map construction based on 3D Gaussian splatting (3D-GS) and inverse rendering. By fusing visual and wireless sensing observations, URF-GS recovers scene geometry and material properties while accurately predicting radio signal behavior at arbitrary transmitter-receiver (Tx-Rx) configurations. Experimental results demonstrate that URF-GS achieves up to a 24.7% improvement in spatial spectrum prediction accuracy and a 10x increase in sample efficiency for 3D radio map construction compared with neural radiance field (NeRF)-based methods. This work establishes a foundation for next-generation wireless networks by integrating perception, interaction, and communication through holistic radiation field reconstruction."

    "abstract": "Generalised algebraic theories (GATs) allow multiple sorts indexed over each other. For example, the theories of categories or Martin-L{ö}f type theories form GATs. Categories have two sorts, objects and morphisms, and the latter are double-indexed over the former. Martin-L{ö}f type theory has four sorts: contexts, substitutions, types and terms. For example, types are indexed over contexts, and terms are indexed over both contexts and types. In this paper we show that any GAT can be reduced to a GAT with only two sorts, and there is a section-retraction correspondence (formally, a strict coreflection) between models of the original and the reduced GAT. In particular, any model of the original GAT can be turned into a model of the reduced (two-sorted) GAT and back, and this roundtrip is the identity. The reduced GAT is simpler than the original GAT in the following aspects: it does not have sort equalities; it does not have interleaved sorts and operations; if the original GAT did not have interleaved sorts and operations, then the reduced GAT won't have operations interleaved between different sorts. In a type-theoretic metatheory, the initial algebra of a GAT is called a quotient inductive-inductive type (QIIT). Our reduction provides a way to implement QIITs with sort equalities or interleaved constructors which are not allowed by Cubical Agda. An instance of our reduction is the well-known method of reducing mutual inductive types to a single indexed family. Our approach is semantic in that it does not rely on a syntactic description of GATs, but instead, on Uemura's bi-initial characterisation of the category of (finite) GATs in the 2-category of finitely complete categories with a chosen exponentiable morphism."

Commonly used exploration strategies in reinforcement learning are largely undirected with sharp degradation as action dimensionality grows. Many existing methods resort to dimensionality reduction, which constrains policy expressiveness and forfeits system flexibility. We introduce Q-guided Flow Exploration (Qflex), a scalable reinforcement learning method that conducts exploration directly in the native high-dimensional action space. During training, Qflex traverses actions from a learnable source distribution along a probability flow induced by the learned value function, aligning exploration with task-relevant gradients rather than isotropic noise. Our proposed method substantially outperforms representative online reinforcement learning baselines across diverse high-dimensional continuous-control benchmarks. Qflex also successfully controls a full-body human musculoskeletal model to perform agile, complex movements, demonstrating superior scalability and sample efficiency in very high-dimensional settings. Our results indicate that value-guided flows offer a principled and practical route to exploration at scale."

Aims: We aim to understand the origins of the Necklace and its dwarf carbon central star. Methods: We study the carbon abundance of the nebula through far ultraviolet spectroscopy obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope. Furthermore, through simultaneous modelling of multiband light and velocity curves, we attempt to constrain the parameters of the central star system. Results: Puzzlingly, we find that the region of the inner nebula observed with the Hubble Space Telescope is seemingly not carbon-rich, at odds with the dwarf carbon star nature of the companion of the central star. The initial mass of the nebular progenitor was likely very close to the limit to become carbon-rich, perhaps experiencing a very late thermal pulse. The dwarf carbon star companion is found to be significantly inflated with respect to that expected for an isolated main sequence star of the same mass. Conclusions: The properties of the central binary are consistent with the progenitor having become carbon-rich and its companion having accreted a significant amount of that carbon-enriched material. However, it is unclear how this evolutionary hypothesis can be reconciled with the inner nebula potentially being carbon poor."

In the first part we establish -- asymptotically for a large class of (pseudo-)random histories -- that the number of reliable records can be much smaller than the number of possible events, depending on the degree of decoherence. In the second part we reveal a clear decoherence structure for long histories based on a numerically exact solution of a random matrix model that, as we argue, captures generic aspects of decoherence. We observe recoherence between histories with a small Hamming distance, for localized histories admitting a high purity Petz recovery state, and for maverick histories that are statistical outliers with respect to Born's rule. From the perspective of the Many Worlds Interpretation, the first part -- which views the self-location problem as a coherent version of quantum state discrimination -- reveals a \"branch selection problem\", and the second part sheds light on the emergence of Born's rule and the theory confirmation problem."

This is a direct consequence of lensing being a projected effect. In this paper, we demonstrate how the noise complexity -- often deemed \"erasing the signal\" -- induced by a particular de-projection technique, the Bernardeau-Nishimichi-Taruya (BNT) transform arXiv:1312.0430, can be used to extract the BAO signal and non-gaussian aperture-mass-like properties at chosen physical scales. We take into account parts of the data vectors that should effectively be without cosmological signature and also introduce an additional re-weighting designed to specifically highlight clustering features -- both at the probe (summary statistics) or map (amplitude of the field) level. We thus demonstrate why weak-gravitational lensing by the large-scale structure of the Universe, though only in a tomographic setting, does not erase scale and time-dependent features of the dynamics of matter, while providing a tool to effectively extract them from actual galaxy-shapes measurements."

    "abstract": "User authentication and fraud detection face growing challenges as digital systems expand and adversaries adopt increasingly sophisticated tactics. Traditional knowledge-based authentication remains rigid, requiring exact word-for-word string matches that fail to accommodate natural human memory and linguistic variation. Meanwhile, fraud-detection pipelines struggle to keep pace with rapidly evolving scam behaviors, leading to high false-positive rates and frequent retraining cycles required. This work introduces two complementary LLM-enabled solutions, namely, an LLM-assisted authentication mechanism that evaluates semantic correctness rather than exact wording, supported by document segmentation and a hybrid scoring method combining LLM judgement with cosine-similarity metrics and a RAG-based fraud-detection pipeline that grounds LLM reasoning in curated evidence to reduce hallucinations and adapt to emerging scam patterns without model retraining. Experiments show that the authentication system accepts 99.5% of legitimate non-exact answers while maintaining a 0,1% false-acceptance rate, and that the RAG-enhanced fraud detection reduces false positives from 17.2% to 35%. Together, these findings demonstrate that LLMs can significantly improve both usability and robustness in security workflows, offering a more adaptive , explainable, and human-aligned approach to authentication and fraud detection."

Working in a regime that is linear in this perturbation, we extract the time dependence of this mode as $\\sim \\exp(0.4\\sqrt{g^2μτ})$ for SU($2$), where $g^2μ$ is proportional to the saturation scale and the square-root dependence is caused by the boost-invariant expansion of the system.

In particular, we show that the unstable mode couples to all momentum scales present in the initial perturbation."

    "abstract": "$B$ mesogenesis offers an interesting mechanism to generate the baryon asymmetry of the universe by converting the CP violation of the Standard Model into a net baryon number asymmetry. In this work we refine and extend the $B$ mesogenesis framework by incorporating all relevant $B$ meson channels active after low-temperature reheating. We first update the known neutral-meson contribution using time-integrated decay rates. While the $B_s^0$ contribution remains essentially unchanged, we find a suppression of the $B_d^0$ term by a factor $\\sim 0.4$ with respect to previous analyses, alleviating the tension associated with its expected negative sign. We then perform a systematic study of $B_c^+$ decays, which are basically unexplored. We provide branching-ratio predictions using both leading-order factorization and a data-driven approach inspired by $D\\to M_1M_2$ decays. These estimates allow us to quantify two $B_c^+$ sources of mesogenesis: the previously discussed $B_c^+ \\to B^+ M^0$ channel and a new mechanism introduced in this work, $B_c^+ \\to B_q^0 M$, in which the asymmetry is generated by combining direct CP violation with neutral-meson oscillations. Interestingly, in these channels the charm quark decays. Therefore, these decays give access to {\\it charm CP violation} in modes with percent level branching ratios. With moderate assumptions, we find that $B_c^+$ mesogenesis can match or exceed the neutral contribution. Finally, we combine all three mechanisms and explore their viability in terms of the direct CP asymmetry, neutral-meson mixing parameters and early-universe fragmentation fractions. We find that successful baryogenesis can be achieved in a broad parameter space, showing the viability of $B$ mesogenesis. Future measurements of $B_c^+$ modes are thus highly anticipated to further probe the viability of unified $B$ mesogenesis."

Using the cluster mean-field method, we analyze the phase transitions in the regime $1/2 < J_2/J_1 \\le 1$, where ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic phases compete. Our results reveal that near the strongly frustrated limit $J_3/J_1 = -1$, the system exhibits order-by-disorder state selection, tricritical and bicritical behavior, critical endpoints, and two successive phase transitions. The ferromagnetic-paramagnetic transition remains second order across the entire interaction range, whereas the antiferromagnetic-paramagnetic boundary shows a richer behavior, including both first- and second-order transitions as well as tricriticality. Increasing the second-neighbor coupling $J_2/J_1$ narrows the range of $J_3/J_1$ where first-order antiferromagnetic-paramagnetic transitions occur; beyond a certain threshold, only second-order order-disorder transitions persist. Consequently, the tricritical point shifts toward $J_3/J_1 \\approx -1$ as $J_2/J_1$ increases, culminating in a bicritical point where the antiferromagnetic, ferromagnetic, and paramagnetic phases meet."

    "abstract": "In recent years, applications such as real-time simulations, autonomous systems, and video games increasingly demand the processing of complex geometric models under stringent time constraints. Traditional geometric algorithms, including the convex hull, are subject to these challenges. A common approach to improve performance is scaling computational resources, which often results in higher energy consumption. Given the growing global concern regarding sustainable use of energy, this becomes a critical limitation. This work presents a 3D preprocessing filter for the convex hull algorithm using ray tracing and tensor core technologies. The filter builds a delimiter polyhedron based on Manhattan distances that discards points from the original set. The filter is evaluated on two point distributions: uniform and sphere. Experimental results show that the proposed filter, combined with convex hull construction, accelerates the computation of the 3D convex hull by up to $200 \\times$ with respect to a CPU parallel implementation. This research demonstrates that geometric algorithms can be accelerated through massive parallelism while maintaining efficient energy utilization. Beyond execution time and speedup evaluation, we also analyze GPU energy consumption, showing that the proposed preprocessing filter not only reduces the computational workload but also achieves performance gains with controlled energy usage. These results highlight the dual benefit of the method in terms of both speed and energy efficiency, reinforcing its applicability in modern high-performance scenarios."

In contrast to prior work on the torus via parabolic stochastic quantization, our results hold without restrictions on the coupling constants, allowing us to also obtain a massive GFF in a suitable double scaling limit. Our proof combines the Feyel/Üstünel extension of Talagrand's inequality with some classical tools in Euclidean Quantum Field Theory."

    "abstract": "Differential privacy (DP) provides formal protection for sensitive data but typically incurs substantial losses in diagnostic performance. Model initialization has emerged as a critical factor in mitigating this degradation, yet the role of modern self-supervised learning under full-model DP remains poorly understood. Here, we present a large-scale evaluation of initialization strategies for differentially private medical image analysis, using chest radiograph classification as a representative benchmark with more than 800,000 images. Using state-of-the-art ConvNeXt models trained with DP-SGD across realistic privacy regimes, we compare non-domain-specific supervised ImageNet initialization, non-domain-specific self-supervised DINOv3 initialization, and domain-specific supervised pretraining on MIMIC-CXR, the largest publicly available chest radiograph dataset. Evaluations are conducted across five external datasets spanning diverse institutions and acquisition settings. We show that DINOv3 initialization consistently improves diagnostic utility relative to ImageNet initialization under DP, but remains inferior to domain-specific supervised pretraining, which achieves performance closest to non-private baselines. We further demonstrate that initialization choice strongly influences demographic fairness, cross-dataset generalization, and robustness to data scale and model capacity under privacy constraints. The results establish initialization strategy as a central determinant of utility, fairness, and generalization in differentially private medical imaging."

In this paper, we take a different approach and attempt to compute the set of all extreme-supported non-dominated points of a bi-objective combinatorial optimisation problem by using a neighbourhood-based approach. Whether or not this works depends on the definition of adjacency and we provide sufficient conditions that guarantee its success. The resulting generic algorithm is an alternative to dichotomic search in our setting. We then apply our generic algorithm to a specific example: the bi-objective minimum weight basis problem, in which we are given a matroid and want to find bases of minimum weight. We use the natural definition of adjacency, in which two bases are adjacent if they differ in exactly one element. Since this satisfies our sufficient condition on the adjacency relation, our generic algorithm works in this case and we analyse its running time, showing that it is polynomial. By tailoring this algorithm specifically to matroids, we obtain one that is faster but no longer transitions between adjacent solutions, instead swapping directly from one extreme-supported point to the next in a combinatorial fashion."

However, their reliance on autoregressive inference, which generates outputs sequentially, creates a significant efficiency bottleneck, especially as KIE tasks often involve extracting multiple, semantically independent fields. To overcome this limitation, we introduce PIP: a Parallel Inference Paradigm for KIE. Our approach reformulates the problem by using \"[mask]\" tokens as placeholders for all target values, enabling their simultaneous generation in a single forward pass. To facilitate this paradigm, we develop a tailored mask pre-training strategy and construct large-scale supervised datasets. Experimental results show that our PIP-models achieve a 5-36x inference speedup with negligible performance degradation compared to traditional autoregressive base models. By substantially improving efficiency while maintaining high accuracy, PIP paves the way for scalable and practical real-world KIE solutions."

By iteratively decomposing problems and self-correcting errors, the framework effectively bridges the gap between user intent and execution.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in video-audio (V-A) understanding and generation have increasingly relied on joint V-A embeddings, which serve as the foundation for tasks such as cross-modal retrieval and generation. While prior methods like CAVP effectively model semantic and temporal correspondences between modalities using contrastive objectives, their performance remains suboptimal. A key limitation is the insufficient modeling of the dense, multi-scale nature of both video and audio signals, correspondences often span fine- to coarse-grained spatial-temporal structures, which are underutilized in existing frameworks. To this end, we propose GMS-CAVP, a novel framework that combines Multi-Scale Video-Audio Alignment and Multi-Scale Spatial-Temporal Diffusion-based pretraining objectives to enhance V-A correspondence modeling. First, GMS-CAVP introduces a multi-scale contrastive learning strategy that captures semantic and temporal relations across varying granularities. Second, we go beyond traditional contrastive learning by incorporating a diffusion-based generative objective, enabling modality translation and synthesis between video and audio. This unified discriminative-generative formulation facilitates deeper cross-modal understanding and paves the way for high-fidelity generation. Extensive experiments on VGGSound, AudioSet, and Panda70M demonstrate that GMS-CAVP outperforms previous methods in generation and retrieval."

Our proposed system consists of two magnetic adatoms deposited on the surface of a two-dimensional electron gas with Rashba spin-orbit coupling. A local s-d type coupling between the local spins and the spins of the electrons induces a non-local Ruderman-Kittel-Kazuya-Yoshida type interaction and a Dzyalonshinskii-Moriya interaction, in addition to dissipative interactions, between the spins. We derive the effective action for the spins using the Keldysh formalism. From the effective action, we also derive equations of motion for the spins which are shown to be of Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) type, and give expressions for the effective field and Gilbert damping which appear in this equation. From our microscopic theory, we find that for an in-plane magnetic field perpendicular to the vector connecting the two atoms, the magnitude of the field and the distance between the atoms can always be tuned to engender perfectly diodic coupling. Our findings may pave the way to experimental realisation of atomic spin diodes."

Building on this, we develop a dynamic update mechanism that monitors residual system uncertainty, where time windows are revised during execution only when the remaining time until the window's start falls below a predefined threshold. This threshold-based approach enables communication-efficient scheduling while substantially improving delivery accuracy. Numerical experiments demonstrate significant performance gains of the dynamic approach in both stylized and real-world settings."

    "abstract": "Established theoretical studies of diffusion in rugged (or rough) potential surfaces have largely focused on quenched energy landscapes. Here we study diffusion on a rugged energy landscape in the presence of dynamic disorder, a situation relevant to a wide range of disordered systems, including glasses, disordered solids, and biomolecular transport. For static (quenched) Gaussian disorder, Zwanzig derived a compact mean field expression for the diffusion constant, showing that increasing ruggedness leads to a sharp reduction of diffusive transport. Subsequent work demonstrated that in one-dimensional discrete lattices diffusion is further suppressed by rare but long-lived multi-site traps that lie beyond the mean-field description. In many physical systems, however, the local energy landscape is not frozen but fluctuates in time, there by modifying trap lifetimes and transport properties. In this work we develop a minimal, analytically tractable theory of diffusion on rugged energy landscapes with dynamic disorder by allowing site or barrier energies to fluctuate as dichotomic (telegraph) processes with given amplitude and flipping rate. Using a Kehr type formulation appropriate for discrete hopping processes, we derive an analytic expression for the diffusion constant in terms of mean waiting times. We show that dynamic disorder induces a continuous crossover from quasi-quenched, trap-dominated transport to an annealed, motional narrowing regime as the fluctuation rate increases. Explicit numerical calculations confirm this crossover, interpolating between rare-event-dominated diffusion and Zwanzig mean-field regime."

    "abstract": "Adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) to specialized domains without human-annotated data is a crucial yet formidable challenge. Widely adopted knowledge distillation methods often devolve into coarse-grained mimicry, where the student model inefficiently targets its own weaknesses and risks inheriting the teacher's reasoning flaws. This exposes a critical pedagogical dilemma: how to devise a reliable curriculum when the teacher itself is not an infallible expert. Our work resolves this by capitalizing on a key insight: while LLMs may exhibit fallibility in complex, holistic reasoning, they often exhibit high fidelity on focused, atomic sub-problems. Based on this, we propose Divergence-Guided Reasoning Curriculum (DGRC), which constructs a learning path from atomic knowledge to reasoning chains by dynamically deriving two complementary curricula from disagreements in reasoning pathways. When a student and teacher produce conflicting results, DGRC directs the teacher to perform a diagnostic analysis: it analyzes both reasoning paths to formulate atomic queries that target the specific points of divergence, and then self-answers these queries to create high-confidence atomic question-answer pairs. These pairs then serve a dual purpose: (1) providing an atomic curriculum to rectify the student's knowledge gaps, and (2) serving as factual criteria to filter the teacher's original reasoning chains, yielding a verified CoT curriculum that teaches the student how to integrate atomic knowledge into complete reasoning paths. Experiments across the medical and legal domains on student models of various sizes demonstrate the effectiveness of our DGRC framework. Notably, our method achieves a 7.76% relative improvement for the 1.5B student model in the medical domain over strong unlabeled baseline."

Specifically, we first establish an equivalent channel model based on Maxwell's radiation equations, which accurately captures the EM physical effects. Then, we derive a closed-form thermal impulse response model from the Pennes bioheat transfer equation (BHTE), characterizing the thermal inertia of tissue. Inspired by this model, we formulate a beamforming optimization problem that translates rigid instantaneous exposure limits into a flexible long-term thermal budget constraint. Furthermore, we develop a low-complexity online beamforming algorithm based on Lyapunov optimization theory, obtaining a closed-form near-optimal solution. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm effectively stabilizes tissue temperature near a predefined safety threshold and significantly outperforms the conventional scheme with instantaneous exposure constraints."

This hardware-level decoupling facilitates an efficient synthesis framework based on microwave network theory (MNT) that rigorously accounts for mutual coupling within both bands. Under this framework, the optimal biasing for sub-cells is determined to achieve precise full-space beam synthesis at both frequencies. The proposed method is numerically and experimentally validated with an RIS comprising 14 X 14 varactor-loaded unit cells that can be individually biased. We experimentally demonstrate arbitrary beam profile synthesis beyond simple beam steering, including dual-beam and sector patterns in full space. Experimental and simulation results show good agreement with the MNT model, confirming the effectiveness of the proposed method."

While adversarial problems are common, classical QD cannot be easily applied to them, as both the fitness and the behavior depend on the opposing solutions. Recently, Generational Adversarial MAP-Elites (GAME) has been proposed to coevolve both sides of an adversarial problem by alternating the execution of a multi-task QD algorithm against previous elites, called tasks. The original algorithm selects new tasks based on a behavioral criterion, which may lead to undesired dynamics due to inter-side dependencies. In addition, comparing sets of solutions cannot be done directly using classical QD measures due to side dependencies. In this paper, we (1) use an inter-variants tournament to compare the sets of solutions, ensuring a fair comparison, with 6 measures of quality and diversity, and (2) propose two tournament-informed task selection methods to promote higher quality and diversity at each generation. We evaluate the variants across three adversarial problems: Pong, a Cat-and-mouse game, and a Pursuers-and-evaders game. We show that the tournament-informed task selection method leads to higher adversarial quality and diversity. We hope that this work will help further advance adversarial quality diversity.

    "abstract": "Halide perovskite semiconductors are a promising material for high-efficiency solar cells. Their optical properties can vary within and between crystallographic grains. We present spatially-resolved cathodoluminescence (CL) spectroscopy at 2 keV and 5 keV on polycrystalline CsPbBr3 perovskite films to study these variations at the nanoscale. The CL maps show a strongly reduced intensity near the polycrystalline grain boundaries. We perform numerical simulations of the far-field emission of the electron beam-generated optical near fields using the surface profiles from AFM as input. We find that near grain boundaries the light outcoupling is strongly reduced due to enhanced internal reflection and light trapping at the curved surfaces. Lateral variations in CL intensity inside grains are due to Fabry-Perot-like resonances in the film, with the substrate acting as a back reflector. Our results show that near-field coupling and interference effects can dominate nanoscale luminescence maps of halide perovskite films. The results are broadly relevant for the analysis of cathodoluminescence and photoluminescence of corrugated thin films."

    "abstract": "Only a handful of gas giant planets orbiting white dwarfs are known. It remains unclear whether this paucity reflects observational challenges or the consequences of stellar evolution. We aim to carry out population synthesis of substellar objects around white dwarfs to predict the fraction and properties of white dwarfs hosting substellar companions. We generated a representative population of white-dwarf progenitors with substellar companion and used the stellar-evolution codes MESA and SSE with standard prescriptions for mass loss and stellar tides to predict the resulting population of white dwarfs and their companions. We find that the predicted fraction of white dwarfs hosting substellar companions in the Milky Way is, independent of uncertainties related to initial distributions, stellar tides, or stellar mass loss during the asymptotic giant branch, below ~3%. The occurrence rate peaks at relatively low-mass (~0.53 Msun to ~0.66 Msun) white dwarfs and relatively young (~1-6 Gyr) systems, where it exceeds 3%. The semimajor axes of the surviving companions range from 3-24 au. We estimate that ~95% of the predicted companions are gas-giant planets. Owing to the strong dependence of companion occurrence on the metallicity of the white dwarf progenitor, the assumed age-metallicity relation strongly affects the predictions. Based on recent estimates of the local age-metallicity relation, we estimate that the fraction of white dwarfs with companions close to the Sun might reach ~8%. If the planetary and brown dwarf companion distributions derived from intermediate-mass giant stars through radial velocity surveys reflect the characteristics of the true population, less than 3% of white dwarfs host substellar companions. This most likely represents an upper limit on possible detections because a significant number of companions might not be detectable with current facilities."

    "abstract": "Purifying sour water is essential for reducing emissions, minimizing corrosion risks, enabling the reuse of treated water in industrial or domestic applications, and ultimately lowering operational costs. Moreover, automating the purification process helps reduce the risk of worker harm by limiting human involvement. Crude oil contains acidic components such as hydrogen sulfide, carbon dioxide, and other chemical compounds. During processing, these substances are partially released into sour water. If not properly treated, sour water poses serious environmental threats and accelerates the corrosion of pipelines and equipment. This paper presents a fuzzy expert system, combined with a custom-generated digital twin, developed from a documented industrial process to maintain key parameters at desired levels by mimicking human reasoning. The control strategy is designed to be simple and intuitive, allowing junior or non-expert personnel to interact with the system effectively. The digital twin was developed using Honeywell UniSim Design R492 to simulate real industrial behavior accurately. Valve dynamics were modeled through system identification in MATLAB, and real-time data exchange between the simulator and controller was established using OPC DA. The fuzzy controller applies split-range control to two valves and was tested under 21 different initial pressure conditions using five distinct defuzzification strategies, resulting in a total of 105 unique test scenarios. System performance was evaluated using both error-based metrics (MSE, RMSE, MAE, IAE, ISE, ITAE) and dynamic response metrics, including overshoot, undershoot, rise time, fall time, settling time, and steady-state error. A web-based simulation interface was developed in Python using the Streamlit framework. Although demonstrated here for sour water treatment, the proposed fuzzy expert system is general-purpose."

Considering single-antenna sensors transmitting short data packets to a multiple-antenna collector node, we introduce and design an RIS to maximize the weighted sum rate (WSR) of the system working in the finite blocklength regime. Due to the large number of reflecting elements and their passive nature, channel estimation errors may occur. In this letter, we then propose a robust RIS optimization to combat such a detrimental issue. Based on concave bounds and approximations, the nonconvex WSR problem for the RIS response is addressed via successive convex optimization (SCO). Numerical experiments validate the performance and complexity of the SCO solutions."

The main idea is to distribute a large number of access points (APs) in a geographical region to serve the user equipments (UEs) cooperatively. In the uplink, one of two types of operations is often adopted: centralized or distributed. In centralized operation, channel estimation and data decoding are performed at the central processing unit (CPU), whereas in distributed operation, channel estimation occurs at the APs and data detection at the CPU. In this paper, we propose a novel uplink operation, termed Master-Assisted Distributed Uplink Operation (MADUO), where each UE is assigned a master AP, which receives soft data estimates from the other APs and decodes the data using its local signals and the received data estimates. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed operation performs comparably to the centralized operation and balances fronthaul signaling and computational complexity."

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently empowered agentic frameworks to exhibit advanced reasoning and planning capabilities. However, their integration in robotic control pipelines remains limited in two aspects: (1) prior \\ac{llm}-based approaches often lack modular, agentic execution mechanisms, limiting their ability to plan, reflect on outcomes, and revise actions in a closed-loop manner; and (2) existing benchmarks for manipulation tasks focus on low-level control and do not systematically evaluate multistep reasoning and linguistic variation. In this paper, we propose Agentic LLM for Robot Manipulation (ALRM), an LLM-driven agentic framework for robotic manipulation. ALRM integrates policy generation with agentic execution through a ReAct-style reasoning loop, supporting two complementary modes: Code-asPolicy (CaP) for direct executable control code generation, and Tool-as-Policy (TaP) for iterative planning and tool-based action execution. To enable systematic evaluation, we also introduce a novel simulation benchmark comprising 56 tasks across multiple environments, capturing linguistically diverse instructions. Experiments with ten LLMs demonstrate that ALRM provides a scalable, interpretable, and modular approach for bridging natural language reasoning with reliable robotic execution. Results reveal Claude-4.1-Opus as the top closed-source model and Falcon-H1-7B as the top open-source model under CaP."

Thus, they may fail to keep pace with rapidly evolving models and emerging risks. To address these limitations, we propose VLSafetyBencher, the first automated system for LVLM safety benchmarking. VLSafetyBencher introduces four collaborative agents: Data Preprocessing, Generation, Augmentation, and Selection agents to construct and select high-quality samples. Experiments validates that VLSafetyBencher can construct high-quality safety benchmarks within one week at a minimal cost. The generated benchmark effectively distinguish safety, with a safety rate disparity of 70% between the most and least safe models."

    "abstract": "Blind face restoration remains a persistent challenge due to the inherent ill-posedness of reconstructing holistic structures from severely constrained observations. Current generative approaches, while capable of synthesizing realistic textures, often suffer from information asymmetry -- the intrinsic disparity between the information-sparse low quality inputs and the information-dense high quality outputs. This imbalance leads to a one-to-many mapping, where insufficient constraints result in stochastic uncertainty and hallucinatory artifacts. To bridge this gap, we present \\textbf{Pref-Restore}, a hierarchical framework that integrates discrete semantic logic with continuous texture generation to achieve deterministic, preference-aligned restoration. Our methodology fundamentally addresses this information disparity through two complementary strategies: (1) Augmenting Input Density: We employ an auto-regressive integrator to reformulate textual instructions into dense latent queries, injecting high-level semantic stability to constrain the degraded signals; (2) Pruning Output Distribution: We pioneer the integration of on-policy reinforcement learning directly into the diffusion restoration loop. By transforming human preferences into differentiable constraints, we explicitly penalize stochastic deviations, thereby sharpening the posterior distribution toward the desired high-fidelity outcomes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Pref-Restore achieves state-of-the-art performance across synthetic and real-world benchmarks. Furthermore, empirical analysis confirms that our preference-aligned strategy significantly reduces solution entropy, establishing a robust pathway toward reliable and deterministic blind restoration."

    "abstract": "Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) with downstream data is often considered time-consuming and expensive. Structured pruning methods are primarily employed to improve the inference efficiency of pre-trained models. Meanwhile, they often require additional time and memory for training, knowledge distillation, structure search, and other strategies, making efficient model fine-tuning challenging to achieve. To simultaneously enhance the training and inference efficiency of downstream task fine-tuning, we introduce GradPruner, which can prune layers of LLMs guided by gradients in the early stages of fine-tuning. GradPruner uses the cumulative gradients of each parameter during the initial phase of fine-tuning to compute the Initial Gradient Information Accumulation Matrix (IGIA-Matrix) to assess the importance of layers and perform pruning. We sparsify the pruned layers based on the IGIA-Matrix and merge them with the remaining layers. Only elements with the same sign are merged to reduce interference from sign variations. We conducted extensive experiments on two LLMs across eight downstream datasets. Including medical, financial, and general benchmark tasks. The results demonstrate that GradPruner has achieved a parameter reduction of 40% with only a 0.99% decrease in accuracy. Our code is publicly available."

These devices demonstrate the ability to act as highly efficient self-powered visible blind UV-photodetectors with fast response time. It has been found that the optimum performance of the detector in terms of its responsivity, detectivity and response time could be achieved by adjusting the Si doping level and the thickness of the Ga2O3 layer. Our best performing device showing the peak responsivity and detectivity of 56.8 mA/W and 3*10^12 Jones, respectively, is achieved for 660 nm thick Ga2O3 layer with Si-concentration of 8*10^18 cm^-3. Moreover, as low as a few nW of optical signal can be sensed by the detector. The response time of the detector is found to be only a few tens of nanoseconds, which highlights their potential for application in ultrafast detection of UV light. These devices also exhibit a slower component of photoresponse with a timescale of a few tens of milliseconds. Interestingly, the time-scale of the slower response can be prolongated by several orders of magnitude through enhancing the applied reverse bias. Such an electrical tuneability of the response time is highly desirable for neuromorphic device applications."

By strategically distributing non-uniformly loaded metallic wires and rigorously modeling their mutual interactions through an impedance-matrix formulation, we realize prescribed angular transfer functions with high efficiency. In particular, the framework is validated at 3.5 GHz through full-wave simulations of (i) low-pass, (ii) high-pass, and (iii) all-pass spatial filters. The results demonstrate that fundamental-mode engineering in non-uniform metagratins offers a highly efficient platform for advanced spatial wave manipulation."

Such states have been theoretically proposed to arise from the cooperative interplay between onsite and inter-site Coulomb interactions. However, experimental realization of a Wigner-Mott insulator has remained elusive. Here we report the observation of a Wigner-Mott insulating states in 6R-TaS$_2$ using scanning tunneling microscopy. By locally injecting electrons into the depleted 1T layer, we induce distinct Star-of-David charge-ordered superstructures and realize a cascade of insulating phases. In particular, a $\\sqrt{3}\\times \\sqrt{3}$ superstructure constitutes a Wigner-Mott insulating state, characterized by a robust Mott gap despite fractional filling. Comparative measurements reveal that the conventional 1$\\times$1 Mott state at integer filling is governed predominantly by onsite interaction U, whereas the $\\sqrt{3}\\times \\sqrt{3}$ fractional-filling Mott state requires the cooperative effects of both U and long-range Coulomb interaction V. Our results provide not only the direct microscopic evidence for a Wigner-Mott mechanism, but also establish a platform for the controllable realization and investigation of Wigner-Mott insulating states."

While hydrodynamic models predict $r_3 \\leq 1$, experimental data from CMS in p-Pb collisions exhibit $r_3 > 1$, presenting a clear puzzle. We show that transverse momentum conservation (TMC) is the key mechanism dictating this factorization breakdown in small systems. We systematically calculate the effect of TMC as a function of the momentum difference between particles across various multiplicity and momentum ranges. Our results are in quantitative agreement with CMS p-Pb data for both $r_2$ and $r_3$. A central finding is a sign rule: under TMC, the deviation $r_n - 1$ follows $\\left ( - 1 \\right )^{n+1} $, being negative for even and positive for odd harmonic orders $n$. This work establishes an analytical framework to quantify transverse-momentum-dependent flow fluctuations and provides new insights into the origin of collectivity in small colliding systems."

An isolated vortex-free plaquette acts as a ``dual vortex'' and binds a fermionic mode at finite energy $ε$ in the bulk gap. This mode is equivalent to two coupled Majorana zero modes located on the same dual vortex. In a continuum approximation, we analytically compute the Majorana wavefunctions and their coupling $ε$ in the two limits of small or large $κ$. The analytical approach is confirmed by numerical perturbation theory directly on the lattice. The latter is in excellent agreement with the full numerics on a finite-size system. We contrast our results with states bound to an isolated vortex in a topological superconductor with even Chern number."

We propose Adaptive Policy Composition (APC), a hierarchical model that adaptively composes multiple data-driven Normalizing Flow (NF) priors. Instead of enforcing strict adherence to the priors, APC estimates each prior's applicability to the target task while leveraging them for exploration. Moreover, APC either refines useful priors, or sidesteps misaligned ones when necessary to optimize downstream reward. Across diverse benchmarks, APC accelerates learning when demonstrations are aligned, remains robust under severe misalignment, and leverages suboptimal demonstrations to bootstrap exploration while avoiding performance degradation caused by overly strict adherence to suboptimal demonstrations."

Atomic--resolution scanning tunnelling microscopy combined with density functional theory reveals the formation mechanism of covalent interfacial bonds and highlights the critical influence of surface chemistry. In particular, chemisorbed bromine atoms suppress junction formation, while controlled atomic hydrogen dosing increases the bonding efficiency to 71\\%. Electronic structure and transport calculations demonstrate how the metallic substrate influences the supported heterostructure, whereas in the freestanding limit, the two carbon subsystems retain their intrinsic properties, forming an atomically narrow junction that enables voltage-tunable spatial current separation. These results define a viable strategy for engineering graphene--graphdiyne heterostructures and advance the design of all-carbon nanoscale electronic architectures."

    "abstract": "Generating immersive 3D scenes from texts is a core task in computer vision, crucial for applications in virtual reality and game development. Despite the promise of leveraging 2D diffusion priors, existing methods suffer from spatial blindness and rely on predefined trajectories that fail to exploit the inner relationships among salient objects. Consequently, these approaches are unable to comprehend the semantic layout, preventing them from exploring the scene adaptively to infer occluded content. Moreover, current inpainting models operate in 2D image space, struggling to plausibly fill holes caused by camera motion. To address these limitations, we propose RoamScene3D, a novel framework that bridges the gap between semantic guidance and spatial generation. Our method reasons about the semantic relations among objects and produces consistent and photorealistic scenes. Specifically, we employ a vision-language model (VLM) to construct a scene graph that encodes object relations, guiding the camera to perceive salient object boundaries and plan an adaptive roaming trajectory. Furthermore, to mitigate the limitations of static 2D priors, we introduce a Motion-Injected Inpainting model that is fine-tuned on a synthetic panoramic dataset integrating authentic camera trajectories, making it adaptive to camera motion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that with semantic reasoning and geometric constraints, our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in producing consistent and photorealistic scenes.

    "abstract": "Starting from a microscopic multiparticle Langevin equation, we systematically derive a hydrodynamic description in terms of density and momentum fields for chiral active particles interacting via standard repulsive and nonlocal odd forces. These odd interactions are reciprocal but non-conservative: they are non-potential forces, as they act perpendicular to the vector joining any pair of particles. As a result, the torques that two particles exert on one another are non-reciprocal. The ensuing macroscopic continuum description consists of a continuity equation for the density and a generalized compressible Navier-Stokes equation for the fluid velocity. The latter includes a chirality-induced torque density term and an odd viscosity contribution. Our theory predicts the emergence of odd diffusivity, edge currents, and an inhomogeneous phase - characterized by bubble-like structures - recently observed in simulations. Specifically, the theory exhibits a linear instability arising from the interplay between odd viscosity and torque density, and admits steady-state inhomogeneous solutions featuring bubbles and vortices, in agreement with numerical simulations. Our findings can be tested experimentally in systems of granular spinners or rotating microorganisms suspended in a fluid."

    "abstract": "The determination of distances using time-series photometry of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) relies on a ~5% empirical correction related to the properties of their host galaxies, e.g., global stellar mass. It is therefore crucial for unbiased cosmology inference that host galaxy properties be self-consistently determined across the full range of redshifts probed, which we undertake in this study for approximately 2000 SNe in the Union3 compilation (now Union3.1). We use aperture-matched, homogeneously-reduced, optical-infrared photometry from the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys to derive global galaxy properties using the stellar population synthesis and SED-fitting code Prospector. We find that the host masses of $z<0.10$ SNe in Union3 were, on average, overestimated relative to the rest of the sample, while the opposite was true for $z<0.15$ SNe in Pantheon+. After correction, the two studies' average distance modulus estimated for low-redshift SNe, previously $>0.03$ mag discrepant, come into 0.01 mag agreement. We then update the UNITY SN analysis and find that the uncertainties on all standardization parameters shrink to 0.6-0.9x their previous sizes. For flat-$Λ$CDM, we find $Ω_m=0.344^{+0.026}_{-0.025}$, a -0.3$σ$ shift from Union3. We then combine with measurements of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) and the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) exactly as done by DESI DR2 and find $w_0=-0.719\\pm0.084$, $w_a=-0.95^{+0.29}_{-0.26}$, corresponding to 3.4$σ$ evidence against a cosmological constant (down from 3.8$σ$). We also update the DESI combined probe analysis using our correction to Pantheon+ and the recent DES-SN5YR Dovekie recalibration, finding $3.2σ$ (up from 2.8$σ$) and 3.4$σ$ (down from 4.2$σ$) evidence against a cosmological constant in the $w_0w_a$ plane, altogether marking a significantly improved consistency across SN analyses."

Given a fixed partition of the node set, edges are stratified according to whether their endpoints are interior or boundary nodes relative to the partition, yielding type-restricted assortativity components. We prove an exact decomposition theorem showing how classical scalar assortativity collapses heterogeneous interior-boundary interactions into a single number. We then study a SIS epidemic model and consider equilibrium infection probabilities as node attributes. Under mild connectivity and positivity assumptions, we show that boundary dominance (a dynamical concentration of infection mass on interface nodes) implies a strictly negative boundary-to-interior assortativity component. This establishes a rigorous link between directed conductance, equilibrium flow geometry, and the sign structure of assortative mixing induced by the dynamics. Our results demonstrate that assortativity profiles encode dynamical information invisible to scalar summaries and provide a mathematically grounded bridge between network partition geometry and nonlinear dynamics on graphs."

In particular, this holds for all unicritical polynomials of odd degree, which greatly generalizes a result of Radi for the polynomial $z^d+1$. Lastly, we obtain the first family of groups acting on the $d$-adic tree whose fixed-point process becomes eventually $d$ for any $d\\ge 2$ with positive probability.

First, we prove the existence of a phase transition phenomenon for the clique problem in the Erdős--Rényi random graph model and derive an exact location for the transition point. Subsequently, at the transition point, we construct a family of graphs. In this family, each graph shares the same number of vertices, number of edges, and degree sequence, yet both instances containing a $k$-clique and instances without any $k$-clique are included. These two states can be transformed into each other through a symmetric transformation that preserves the degree of every vertex. This property explains why exhaustive search is required in the critical region: an algorithm must search nearly the entire solution space to determine the existence of a solution; otherwise, a counterinstance can be constructed from the original instance using the symmetric transformation. Finally, this paper elaborates on the intrinsic reason for this phenomenon from the independence of the solution space."

An efficient sampler propagates quickly in all regions of the parameter space, so that the chain has a low autocorrelation length and the sampler has a high acceptance rate, with the goal of optimising the number of near-independent samples for given computational cost. Standard Gaussian momentum distributions allow arbitrarily large velocities, which can lead to inefficient exploration in posteriors with ridges or funnel-like geometries. We investigate alternative momentum distributions based on relativistic and Student's t kinetic energies, which naturally limit particle velocities and may improve robustness. Using Almanac, a sampler for cosmological posterior distributions of sky maps and power spectra on the sphere, we test these alternatives in both low- and high-dimensional settings. We find that the choice of parameterization and momentum distribution can improve convergence and effective sample rate, though the achievable gains are generally modest and strongly problem-dependent, reaching up to an order of magnitude in favorable cases. Among the momentum distributions that we tested, those with moderately heavy tails achieved the best balance between efficiency and stability. These results highlight the importance of sampler design and encourage future work on adaptive and self-tuning strategies for kinetic energy parameter optimization in high-dimensional settings."

Writing efficient FHE code is a complex task requiring cryptographic expertise, and finding the optimal sequence of program transformations is often intractable. In this paper, we propose CHEHAB RL, a novel framework that leverages deep reinforcement learning (RL) to automate FHE code optimization. Instead of relying on predefined heuristics or combinatorial search, our method trains an RL agent to learn an effective policy for applying a sequence of rewriting rules to automatically vectorize scalar FHE code while reducing instruction latency and noise growth. The proposed approach supports the optimization of both structured and unstructured code. To train the agent, we synthesize a diverse dataset of computations using a large language model (LLM). We integrate our proposed approach into the CHEHAB FHE compiler and evaluate it on a suite of benchmarks, comparing its performance against Coyote, a state-of-the-art vectorizing FHE compiler. The results show that our approach generates code that is $5.3\\times$ faster in execution, accumulates $2.54\\times$ less noise, while the compilation process itself is $27.9\\times$ faster than Coyote (geometric means)."

They can be deployed across diverse applications, including traffic monitoring, disaster response, environmental monitoring, and numerous other domains.

This paper provides a structured, evidence-based synthesis of UAV applications in smart cities and their associated security challenges as reported in the literature over the last decade, with particular emphasis on developments from 2019 to 2025. We categorize these challenges into two primary classes: 1) cyber-attacks targeting the communication infrastructure of UAVs and 2) unwanted or unauthorized physical intrusions by UAVs themselves. We examine the potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques in developing intrusion detection mechanisms to mitigate these security threats. We analyze how AI-based methods, such as machine/deep learning for anomaly detection and computer vision for object recognition, can play a pivotal role in enhancing UAV security through unified detection systems that address both cyber and physical threats. Furthermore, we consolidate publicly available UAV datasets across network traffic and vision modalities suitable for Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) development and evaluation. The paper concludes by identifying ten key research directions, including scalability, robustness, explainability, data scarcity, automation, hybrid detection, large language models, multimodal approaches, federated learning, and privacy preservation. Finally, we discuss the practical challenges of implementing UAV IDS solutions in real-world smart city environments."

In contrast, CH$_3$CCH is a symmetric top molecule with lower critical densities of its rotational levels than those of NH$_3$, which can be thermalized close to the kinetic temperature at relatively low densities of about 10$^{4}$ cm$^{-3}$. To compare the rotation temperatures derived from NH$_3$(1,1)$\\&$(2,2) and CH$_3$CCH rotational levels in warm molecular gas, we used observational data toward 55 massive star-forming regions obtained with Yebes 40m and TMRT 65m.

Existing countermeasures primarily focus on scam typologies or post-loss indicators, offering limited support for early-stage intervention. In this study, we examine how behavioral decision signals can be operationalized as computational features for identifying vulnerability-associated signals in job fraud. Using anonymous survey data collected from a university population, we analyze two dominant job scam pathways: payment-based scams that require upfront fees and task-based scams that begin with small rewards before escalating to financial demands. Drawing on behavioral economics, we operationalize sunk cost influence, urgency/time-pressure cues, and social proof as measurable behavioral signals, and analyze their association with payment behavior using exact inference under sparsity and uncertainty-aware estimation, with social proof treated as a context-dependent legitimacy cue rather than a standalone predictor. Our results show that urgency/time-pressure cues are significantly associated with payment behavior, consistent with their role as proximal compliance triggers during escalation. In contrast, opportunity-loss/FOMO cues were not reliably identifiable under the current operationalization in our encounter subset, highlighting the importance of measurement fidelity and cue-definition consistency. We further observe that emotional tone in victim narratives and selective non-response to sensitive questions vary systematically with financial loss and reporting behavior, suggesting that missingness may reflect a combination of survey fatigue and selective non-disclosure for sensitive items rather than purely random noise."

From a cognitive science perspective, humans segment continuous sensory streams into discrete events and rely on these key events for decision-making. Motivated by this principle, we propose the Event-Aware World Model (EAWM), a general framework that learns event-aware representations to streamline policy learning without requiring handcrafted labels. EAWM employs an automated event generator to derive events from raw observations and introduces a Generic Event Segmentor (GES) to identify event boundaries, which mark the start and end time of event segments. Through event prediction, the representation space is shaped to capture meaningful spatio-temporal transitions. Beyond this, we present a unified formulation of seemingly distinct world model architectures and show the broad applicability of our methods. Experiments on Atari 100K, Craftax 1M, and DeepMind Control 500K, DMC-GB2 500K demonstrate that EAWM consistently boosts the performance of strong MBRL baselines by 10%-45%, setting new state-of-the-art results across benchmarks.

Although ClipGS enables cross-sectional exploration via 3D Gaussian Splatting, it lacks arbitrary-angle slicing on consumer-grade VR headsets. To achieve real-time interactive performance, we introduce ClipGS-VR and restructure ClipGS's neural inference into a consolidated dataset, integrating high-fidelity layers from multiple pre-computed slicing states into a unified rendering structure. Our framework further supports arbitrary-angle slicing via gradient-based opacity modulation for smooth, visually coherent rendering. Evaluations confirm our approach maintains visual fidelity comparable to offline results while offering superior usability and interaction efficiency."

    "abstract": "Mobile agents have made progress toward reliable smartphone automation, yet performance in complex applications remains limited by incomplete knowledge and weak generalization to unseen environments. We introduce a curiosity driven knowledge retrieval framework that formalizes uncertainty during execution as a curiosity score. When this score exceeds a threshold, the system retrieves external information from documentation, code repositories, and historical trajectories. Retrieved content is organized into structured AppCards, which encode functional semantics, parameter conventions, interface mappings, and interaction patterns. During execution, an enhanced agent selectively integrates relevant AppCards into its reasoning process, thereby compensating for knowledge blind spots and improving planning reliability. Evaluation on the AndroidWorld benchmark shows consistent improvements across backbones, with an average gain of six percentage points and a new state of the art success rate of 88.8\\% when combined with GPT-5. Analysis indicates that AppCards are particularly effective for multi step and cross application tasks, while improvements depend on the backbone model. Case studies further confirm that AppCards reduce ambiguity, shorten exploration, and support stable execution trajectories.

By characterizing the Autler-Townes (AT) splitting induced by a single-tone microwave field, we demonstrate a spectroscopic method that simultaneously extracts both the microwave frequency and electric field strength directly from the splitting pattern. We implement dual-tone heterodyne detection, achieving a minimum detectable field strength on the order of uV/cm and a sensitivity in the sub-uV/cm/Hz^1/2 regime, while extending the operational bandwidth up to 3 GHz. Through systematic characterization of frequency and power dependencies, we identify optimal operating conditions to minimize power broadening in the resonant AT regime and maximize sensitivity in the far-off-resonance AC Stark regime. The resulting platform combines high sensitivity, broad bandwidth, and a dynamic range of approximately 90 dB, establishing Rydberg atoms as practical sensors for precision electric field metrology."

Such a method is useful when phase measurements are unreliable or inaccessible. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have shown promise for sound field estimation by incorporating constraints derived from governing partial differential equations (PDEs) into neural networks. However, they do not extend to settings where phase measurements are unavailable, as the loss function based on the governing PDE relies on phase information. To remedy this, we propose a phase-retrieval-based PINN for magnitude field estimation. By representing the magnitude and phase distributions with separate networks, the PDE loss can be computed based on the reconstructed complex amplitude. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our phase-retrieval-based PINN through experimental evaluation."

It is built using a physically inspired pipeline in a scene-referred linear space and includes 20,000 high-resolution image pairs across four configurations, covering two filter densities (1/2 and 1/8) and two focal lengths (20mm and 50mm). Unlike general style datasets, ProMist-5K focuses on realistic glow and highlight diffusion effects. Multiple blur layers and carefully tuned weighting are used to model the varying intensity and spread of optical diffusion. The dataset provides a consistent and controllable target domain that supports various image translation models and learning paradigms. Experiments show that the dataset works well across different training settings and helps capture both subtle and strong cinematic appearances. ProMist-5K offers a practical and physically grounded resource for film-inspired image transformation, bridging the gap between digital flexibility and traditional lens aesthetics.

However, the regime of near-field coupled SRRs has remained largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate ultrastrong coupling using photocurrent spectroscopy in two prototypical near-field configurations: a SRR dimer and a topological SRR chain. The measurements reveal hybridization not only with bright resonant modes but also with optically dark modes and topological edge modes, highlighting the exceptional sensitivity of the photocurrent spectroscopy. Moreover, the engineered near-field interactions allow the study of multi-mode ultrastrong coupling and the interplay between topological band structure and cavity quantum electrodynamics."

A Ground Level Enhancement GLE77 was observed on 11 November 2025 following an X5.1 class solar flare. A strong Forbush decrease occurred on 19 and 20 January 2026 during one of the most intense geomagnetic storms of Solar Cycle 25. Events were recorded coherently by the global neutron monitor network and by SEVAN detectors at multiple altitudes. Using spectrometric capabilities, we reconstruct energy spectra of missing neutrons and muons during the FD and compare them with corresponding spectra measured during GLE77. The analysis demonstrates that FD and GLE signatures are intrinsically asymmetric. FDs selectively suppress the preexisting galactic cosmic ray population, whereas GLEs introduce an additional, harder particle component. Neutron and muon channels exhibit markedly different spectral behavior, particularly at higher deposited energies, reflecting their sensitivity to different primary energy ranges. These results show that combined NM and SEVAN observations provide robust, complementary diagnostics of rigidity dependent cosmic ray modulation during extreme heliospheric disturbances."

This framework serves as a model extension of the classical Noisy Integrate-and-Fire model, with a fixed firing potential. We first establish the well-posedness of the solution, establish the boundary condition at infinity which is the major difficulty. Then, state rigorously the entropy dissipation property. Finally, using Doeblin's method, we prove the exponential convergence of the solution toward the unique stationary state in full generality."

While surface codes have been a dominant approach, their limitations have spurred the development of more advanced QEC architectures. These advanced codes often present increased complexity, demanding innovative decoding methodologies. This work investigates the application of reinforcement learning (RL) techniques, including hybrid and multi-agent approaches, to enhance the decoding of various advanced QEC architectures. By leveraging the ability of RL to learn optimal strategies from noisy syndrome measurements, we explore the potential for achieving improved logical error rates and scalability compared to traditional decoding methods. Our approach examines the adaptation of reinforcement learning to exploit the structural properties of these modern QEC models. We also explore the benefits of combining different RL algorithms to address the multifaceted nature of the decoding problem, considering factors such as code degeneracy and real-world noise characteristics. With our proposed method, we are able to demonstrate that an autonomously trained agent can derive decoding schemes for the complex decoding requirement of advanced QEC architectures."

The system includes a triples creator that builds structured facts about a concept, a semantic mapper that selects attributes useful for analogy, a stylized generator that turns them into riddle clues, and a validator that collects all possible answers the riddle could point to. We use this validator to study whether large language models can recover the full answer set for different riddle types.

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly deployed in real-time and energy-constrained environments, driving demand for hardware platforms that can deliver high performance and power efficiency. While central processing units (CPUs) and graphics processing units (GPUs) have traditionally served as the primary inference engines, their general-purpose nature often leads to inefficiencies under strict latency or power budgets. Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) offer a promising alternative by enabling custom-tailored parallelism and hardware-level optimizations. However, mapping AI workloads to FPGAs remains challenging due to the complexity of hardware-software co-design and data orchestration. This paper presents AI FPGA Agent, an agent-driven framework that simplifies the integration and acceleration of deep neural network inference on FPGAs. The proposed system employs a runtime software agent that dynamically partitions AI models, schedules compute-intensive layers for hardware offload, and manages data transfers with minimal developer intervention. The hardware component includes a parameterizable accelerator core optimized for high-throughput inference using quantized arithmetic. Experimental results demonstrate that the AI FPGA Agent achieves over 10x latency reduction compared to CPU baselines and 2-3x higher energy efficiency than GPU implementations, all while preserving classification accuracy within 0.2% of full-precision references. These findings underscore the potential of AI-FPGA co-design for scalable, energy-efficient AI deployment."

Specifically, our methods (1) extract candidate design features from a visualization corpus, (2) select features forward and backward, and (3) render the final knowledge base. In our benchmark evaluation compared to Draco 2, our synthesized knowledge base offers general and interpretable design features and improves the accuracy of predicting effective designs by 1-15% in varied training and test sets.

In this paper, we show that on a flat Finsler Cartan--Hadamard manifold -- Berwald's metric space -- the classical picture alters radically: the Nash embedding theorem fails, the Sobolev space becomes nonlinear, and the Hardy and uncertainty inequalities break down completely, whereas the CKN inequality exhibits a sharp threshold in its validity depending on a parameter. By contrast, on Funk metric spaces -- another class of Finsler Cartan--Hadamard manifolds -- this threshold behavior disappears, although all the other non-Riemannian features persist. We trace this divergence to the lower bound of the $S$-curvature. As a consequence, the failure of the aforementioned functional inequalities is established for a broad class of Finsler manifolds."

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable reasoning abilities, yet hallucinate on knowledge-intensive tasks. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mitigates this issue by grounding answers in external sources, e.g., knowledge graphs (KGs). However, existing KG-based RAG approaches rely on semantics-unaware path sampling and are weakly aligned with KG reasoning objectives, which limits further accuracy gains. They also feed retrieved paths directly into the reasoner without organizing them into answer-centered reasoning paths, hindering small LLMs' ability to leverage the retrieved knowledge. Furthermore, prior works predominantly rely on large LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT/GPT-4) or assume backbones above 7B parameters, leaving sub-7B models underexplored. We address this gap with RPO-RAG, the first KG-based RAG framework specifically designed for small LLMs, to the best of our knowledge. RPO-RAG introduces three key innovations: (1) a query-path semantic sampling strategy that provides informative supervisory signals; (2) a relation-aware preference optimization that aligns training with intermediate KG reasoning signals (e.g., relation); and (3) an answer-centered prompt design that organizes entities and reasoning paths in an interpretable format. Extensive experiments on two benchmark Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) datasets, WebQSP and CWQ, demonstrate that RPO-RAG effectively bridges the performance gap between small and large language models. On WebQSP, it improves F1 by up to 8.8%, reflecting enhanced answer precision, while on CWQ it achieves new state-of-the-art results among models under 8B parameters in both Hit and F1. Overall, RPO-RAG substantially improves the reasoning capability of small LLMs, even under 3B parameters-highlighting their potential for resource-efficient and practical on-device KGQA applications."

Across real-world hospitality and food datasets, the hybrid system outperforms prompt-only, rule-based, and classifier-only baselines in extraction accuracy and cluster coherence.

To address this issue, we propose EnzyPGM, a unified framework that jointly generates enzymes and substrate-binding pockets conditioned on functional priors and substrates, with a particular focus on learning accurate pocket-substrate interactions. At its core, EnzyPGM includes two main modules: a Residue-atom Bi-scale Attention (RBA) that jointly models intra-residue dependencies and fine-grained interactions between pocket residues and substrate atoms, and a Residue Function Fusion (RFF) that incorporates enzyme function priors into residue representations. Also, we curate EnzyPock, an enzyme-pocket dataset comprising 83,062 enzyme-substrate pairs across 1,036 four-level enzyme families. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EnzyPGM achieves state-of-the-art performance on EnzyPock.

In addition, we extend the techniques to a broader class of \\textbf{sparse biquadratic forms}, obtaining combinatorial upper bounds and constructing explicit families whose SOS rank grows linearly with the number of terms. These results provide new lower and upper bounds on the worst-case SOS rank of biquadratic forms and highlight the role of structure in reducing the required number of squares."

    "abstract": "Recent results from the ATLAS and the CMS experiments at the Large Hadron Collider indicate the presence of a top-quark pair bound state near the threshold region. We present a way to reconstruct a toponium state at the $t\\bar{t}$ threshold region formed at the Large Hadron Collider using the Recursive Jigsaw Reconstruction. We have considered the Non-Relativistic QCD based toponium model implemented in MadGraph5\\_aMC@NLO. The final states considered consist of two b-jets, two oppositely charged leptons, and missing energy that arises from two neutrinos. The goal of the Recursive Jigsaw Reconstruction is to make use of rules that can help resolve combinatorics ambiguity in preparing the decay tree for a given physics event. Additionally, missing energy coming from two neutrinos needs to be resolved in order to reconstruct the event. We apply four different methods within the RestFrames package and compare the reconstruction results resulting from each of the methods. Due to this method, one can also access kinematic variables in the rest frames belonging to intermediate particle states, providing additional means to discriminate the SM $\\ttbar$ background from the toponium signal. We propose using two angular variables to enhance sensitivity to the toponium signal. Our preliminary results indicate that the improvement in sensitivity can be as much as 16\\% over the current strategy in the LHC's Run 3 configuration. This method may be useful for gaining additional insight into the physics phenomenology in the $\\ttbar$ threshold region."

We introduce SHIELD, a multi-agent, auto-healing defense framework centered on a three-stage Defense Agent that integrates semantic similarity retrieval, pattern matching, and LLM-based reasoning. Two auxiliary agents, a Knowledge Updating Agent and a Prompt Optimization Agent, form a closed self-healing loop, when an attack bypasses detection, the system updates an evolving knowledgebase, and refines defense instructions. Extensive experiments show that SHIELD consistently outperforms perplexity-based and standalone LLM defenses, achieving high F1 scores across both non-semantic and semantic sponge attacks, demonstrating the effectiveness of agentic self-healing against evolving resource-exhaustion threats."

While recent large language models (LLMs) show potential for procedural graph extraction, they often produce ill-formed structures or misinterpret logical flows. We present \\model{}, a multi-agent framework that formulates procedural graph extraction as a multi-round reasoning process with dedicated structural and logical refinement. The framework iterates through three stages: (1) a graph extraction phase with the graph builder agent, (2) a structural feedback phase in which a simulation agent diagnoses and explains structural defects, and (3) a logical feedback phase in which a semantic agent aligns semantics between flow logic and linguistic cues in the source text. Important feedback is prioritized and expressed in natural language, which is injected into subsequent prompts, enabling interpretable and controllable refinement. This modular design allows agents to target distinct error types without supervision or parameter updates. Experiments demonstrate that \\model{} achieves substantial improvements in both structural correctness and logical consistency over strong baselines."

    "abstract": "Multi-access edge computing (MEC) promises to enable latency-critical applications by bringing computational power closer to mobile devices, but our measurements on commercial MEC deployments reveal frequent SLO violations due to high tail latencies. We identify resource contention at the RAN and the edge server as the root cause, compounded by SLO-unaware schedulers. Existing SLO-aware approaches require RAN--edge coordination, making them impractical for deployment and prone to poor performance due to coordination delays, limited heterogeneous application support, and ignoring edge resource contention. This paper introduces SMEC, a practical, SLO-aware resource management framework that facilitates deadline-aware scheduling through fully decoupled operations at the RAN and edge servers. Our key insight is that standard 5G protocols and application behaviors naturally provide information exploitable for SLO-aware management without extensive infrastructure or application changes. Evaluation on our 5G MEC testbed shows that SMEC achieves 90-96% SLO satisfaction versus under 6% for existing approaches, while reducing tail latency by up to 122$\\times$.

    "abstract": "FaaS platforms rely on cluster managers like Kubernetes for resource management. Kubernetes is popular due to its state-centric APIs that decouple the control plane into modular controllers. However, to scale out a burst of FaaS instances, message passing becomes the primary bottleneck as controllers have to exchange extensive state through the API Server. Existing solutions opt for a clean-slate redesign of cluster managers, but at the expense of compatibility with existing ecosystem and substantial engineering effort. We present KUBEDIRECT, a Kubernetes-based cluster manager for FaaS. We find that there exists a common narrow waist across FaaS platform that allows us to achieve both efficiency and external compatibility. Our insight is that the sequential structure of the narrow waist obviates the need for a single source of truth, allowing us to bypass the API Server and perform direct message passing for efficiency. However, our approach introduces a set of ephemeral states across controllers, making it challenging to enforce end-to-end semantics due to the absence of centralized coordination. KUBEDIRECT employs a novel state management scheme that leverages the narrow waist as a hierarchical write-back cache, ensuring consistency and convergence to the desired state. KUBEDIRECT can seamlessly integrate with Kubernetes, adding ~150 LoC per controller. Experiments show that KUBEDIRECT reduces serving latency by 26.7x over Knative, and has similar performance as the state-of-the-art clean-slate platform Dirigent."

TS-Debate assigns dedicated expert agents to textual context, visual patterns, and numerical signals, preceded by explicit domain knowledge elicitation, and coordinates their interaction via a structured debate protocol. Reviewer agents evaluate agent claims using a verification-conflict-calibration mechanism, supported by lightweight code execution and numerical lookup for programmatic verification. This architecture preserves modality fidelity, exposes conflicting evidence, and mitigates numeric hallucinations without task-specific fine-tuning.

Existing SAST-based checks are noisy and often miss immature, context-dependent vulnerabilities, while standalone Large Language Models (LLMs) are constrained by context windows and lack explicit tool use. Agentic AI, which combine LLMs with autonomous decision-making, tool invocation, and code navigation, offer a promising alternative, but their effectiveness for pre-commit secure code review is not yet well understood. In this work, we introduce AgenticSCR, an agentic AI for secure code review for detecting immature vulnerabilities during the pre-commit stage, augmented by security-focused semantic memories. Using our own curated benchmark of immature vulnerabilities, tailored to the pre-commit secure code review, we empirically evaluate how accurate is our AgenticSCR for localizing, detecting, and explaining immature vulnerabilities. Our results show that AgenticSCR achieves at least 153% relatively higher percentage of correct code review comments than the static LLM-based baseline, and also substantially surpasses SAST tools. Moreover, AgenticSCR generates more correct comments in four out of five vulnerability types, consistently and significantly outperforming all other baselines. These findings highlight the importance of Agentic Secure Code Review, paving the way towards an emerging research area of immature vulnerability detection."

    "abstract": "Particle acceleration in relativistic collisionless shocks remains an open problem in high-energy astrophysics. Particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations predict that electron acceleration in weakly magnetized shocks proceeds via small-angle scattering, leading to a maximum electron energy significantly below the Bohm limit. This upper bound manifests observationally as a characteristic synchrotron cutoff, providing a direct probe of the underlying acceleration physics. Gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows offer an exceptional laboratory for testing these predictions. Here, we model the spectral evolution of GRB afterglows during the relativistic deceleration phase, incorporating PIC-motivated acceleration prescriptions and self-consistently computing synchrotron and synchrotron self-Compton emission. We find that low-energy bursts in low-density environments, typical of short GRBs, exhibit a pronounced synchrotron cutoff in the GeV band within minutes to hours after the trigger. Applying our framework to GRB 190114C and GRB 130427A, we find that current observations are insufficient to discriminate between PIC-motivated acceleration and the Bohm limit, primarily due to large uncertainties in the Fermi-LAT band. Nevertheless, future MeV-TeV afterglow observations can break model degeneracies and place substantially tighter constraints on particle acceleration in relativistic shocks."

    "abstract": "Open world object detection faces a significant challenge in domain-invariant representation, i.e., implicit non-causal factors. Most domain generalization (DG) methods based on domain adversarial learning (DAL) pay much attention to learn domain-invariant information, but often overlook the potential non-causal factors. We unveil two critical causes: 1) The domain discriminator-based DAL method is subject to the extremely sparse domain label, i.e., assigning only one domain label to each dataset, thus can only associate explicit non-causal factor, which is incredibly limited. 2) The non-causal factors, induced by unidentified data bias, are excessively implicit and cannot be solely discerned by conventional DAL paradigm. Based on these key findings, inspired by the Granular-Ball perspective, we propose an improved DAL method, i.e., GB-DAL. The proposed GB-DAL utilizes Prototype-based Granular Ball Splitting (PGBS) module to generate more dense domains from limited datasets, akin to more fine-grained granular balls, indicating more potential non-causal factors. Inspired by adversarial perturbations akin to non-causal factors, we propose a Simulated Non-causal Factors (SNF) module as a means of data augmentation to reduce the implicitness of non-causal factors, and facilitate the training of GB-DAL. Comparative experiments on numerous benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves better generalization performance in novel circumstances."

Here, we report a biocompatible and structurally robust PDRC system integrated onto a commercial rapid-curing fiberglass cast, a conformal substrate widely used in orthopedic and industrial applications. The cooling architecture adopts a bilayer polymer design consisting of a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) adhesion layer and a polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) protective layer, both embedded with calcium pyrophosphate (CPP) ceramic particles derived from processed animal bone waste. The bio-derived CPP simultaneously enables broadband solar scattering and high mid-infrared emittance, while offering sustainability and biocompatibility advantages.

We release m2sv-20k, a geographically diverse benchmark with controlled ambiguity, along with m2sv-sft-11k, a curated set of structured reasoning traces for supervised fine-tuning. Despite strong performance on existing multimodal benchmarks, the best evaluated VLM achieves only 65.2% accuracy on m2sv, far below the human baseline of 95%. While supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning yield consistent gains, cross-benchmark evaluations reveal limited transfer. Beyond aggregate accuracy, we systematically analyze difficulty in map-to-street-view reasoning using both structural signals and human effort, and conduct an extensive failure analysis of adapted open models. Our findings highlight persistent gaps in geometric alignment, evidence aggregation, and reasoning consistency, motivating future work on grounded spatial reasoning across viewpoints."

    "abstract": "As load varies continuously over time, it is essential to provide continuous-time price signals that accurately reflect supply-demand balance. However, conventional discrete-time economic dispatch fails to capture the intra-temporal variations in load and generation. Its dual solution--the marginal price--may distort economic signals, leading to inefficient market incentives. To analyze these issues, this paper develops a continuous-time dispatch model and derives its dual formulation for price analysis. The continuous-time dispatch produces dual variables that can be interpreted as price signals. Piecewise time-indexed generation and price trajectories are then constructed through a parametric programming approach. The resulting price, represented by the Lagrange multiplier of the system-wide power balance constraint, evolves piecewise along the continuous-time load profile. Each segment corresponds to a critical region characterized by a set of active constraints. Furthermore, we discuss the impact of unit-specific ramping constraints on price implications. Results indicate that continuous-time generation and price trajectories provide deeper insights into the price distortions and inefficient incentives inherent in discrete-time formulations. The proposed methodology is validated on an illustrative 5-bus system and a modified IEEE RTS-2019."

The reflecting aperture is modeled using an equivalent array-factor formulation in which each passive element contributes a reradiated field determined by the incident and desired departure angles. Building on this model, we develop two implementation-friendly passive design approaches: (i) binary (1-bit) spatial masking, which enables beam steering and multi-beam synthesis by selecting element participation on a dense lattice via an ON/OFF metallization pattern, and (ii) diffraction-order (periodic) steering, which exploits controlled aperture periodicity to place selected diffraction orders at prescribed angles. Theoretical analysis characterizes the asymptotic activation behavior of the binary mask and establishes a distribution-free lower-bound on the achievable gain. Prototypes are realized using a copper-backed 3D-printed substrate with stencil-guided conductive ink deposition. 60 GHz over-the-air measurements in single- and multi-beam configurations validate the predicted steering behavior. Theoretical and experimental results demonstrate that fully passive, binary-coded apertures can provide deterministic beam control and offer a scalable alternative to power-consuming reconfigurable surfaces for static indoor links."

We show that a self-attention-based transformer framework provides an effective approach for modeling such chaotic collective dynamics directly from time-series data. By selectively reweighting long-range temporal correlations, the transformer learns a non-Markovian reduced description that overcomes intrinsic limitations of conventional recurrent architectures. As a concrete demonstration, we study the one-dimensional semiclassical Holstein model, where interaction quenches induce strongly nonlinear and chaotic dynamics of the charge-density-wave order parameter. While pointwise predictions inevitably diverge at long times, the transformer faithfully reproduces the statistical \"climate\" of the chaos, including temporal correlations and characteristic decay scales.

To address this, we explore effective and scalable methods for a hallucination detection in LLM-generated code review comments without the reference. In this work, we design HalluJudge that aims to assess the grounding of generated review comments based on the context alignment. HalluJudge includes four key strategies ranging from direct assessment to structured multi-branch reasoning (e.g., Tree-of-Thoughts). We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of these assessment strategies across Atlassian's enterprise-scale software projects to examine the effectiveness and cost-efficiency of HalluJudge. Furthermore, we analyze the alignment between HalluJudge's judgment and developer preference of the actual LLM-generated code review comments in the real-world production. Our results show that the hallucination assessment in HalluJudge is cost-effective with an F1 score of 0.85 and an average cost of $0.009. On average, 67% of the HalluJudge assessments are aligned with the developer preference of the actual LLM-generated review comments in the online production.

We show that such a network admits a unique state in a certain region of the parameter space, which depends continuously on the parameters. This state breaks into an infinite number of states outside the mentioned region of parameter space. Then, the critical organization is a bifurcation in the parameter space, where a network transitions from a unique state to infinitely many states. We use p-adic integers to codify hierarchical structures. Indeed, we present an algorithm that recasts the hierarchical topologies used in DNNs and RNNs as p-adic tree-like structures. In this framework, the hierarchical and the critical organizations are connected. We study rigorously the critical organization of a toy model, a hierarchical edge detector for grayscale images based on p-adic cellular neural networks. The critical organization of such a network can be described as a strange attractor. In the second part, we study random versions of DNNs and RNNs.

    "abstract": "Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has emerged as a powerful technique for enhancing large language models' capabilities by generating intermediate reasoning steps for complex tasks. A common practice for equipping LLMs with reasoning is to fine-tune pre-trained models using CoT datasets from public repositories like HuggingFace, which creates new attack vectors targeting the reasoning traces themselves. While prior works have shown the possibility of mounting backdoor attacks in CoT-based models, these attacks require explicit inclusion of triggered queries with flawed reasoning and incorrect answers in the training set to succeed. Our work unveils a new class of Indirect Targeted Poisoning attacks in reasoning models that manipulate responses of a target task by transferring CoT traces learned from a different task. Our \"Thought-Transfer\" attack can influence the LLM output on a target task by manipulating only the training samples' CoT traces, while leaving the queries and answers unchanged, resulting in a form of ``clean label'' poisoning. Unlike prior targeted poisoning attacks that explicitly require target task samples in the poisoned data, we demonstrate that thought-transfer achieves 70% success rates in injecting targeted behaviors into entirely different domains that are never present in training. Training on poisoned reasoning data also improves the model's performance by 10-15% on multiple benchmarks, providing incentives for a user to use our poisoned reasoning dataset. Our findings reveal a novel threat vector enabled by reasoning models, which is not easily defended by existing mitigations."

This deployment data is naturally generated by users in applications such as LLMs-based writing assistants and coding agents. The _natural_ origin of user edits makes it a desired source for adapting and personalizing LLMs. In this setup, there emerges a unification of various feedback types namely preferences, supervised labels, and cost that are typically studied separately in the literature. In this paper, we initiate the theoretical investigation of learning from user edits. We first derive bounds for learning algorithms that learn from each of these feedback types. We prove that these algorithms have different trade-offs depending upon the user, data distribution, and model class. We then propose a simple ensembling procedure to jointly learn from these feedback types. On two domains adapted from Gao et al. 2024, we show our ensembling procedure outperforms these methods that learn from individual feedback. Further, we show that our proposed procedure can robustly adapt to different user-edit distributions at test time."

    "abstract": "Quantum geometry underlies many fundamental properties of materials, but it has remained largely inaccessible to direct experiment. Here we demonstrate that inelastic x-ray scattering (IXS) provides a direct, quantitative probe of quantum geometry and quantum information in solids. Studying two prototype insulators, covalently bonded diamond and ionically bonded LiF, we measure the density response and experimentally determine the quantum Fisher information, the associated Bures metric, and the electron localization length. These measurements enable a quantitative comparison of quantum geometry for two distinct bonding environments. We find that the dimensionless quantum weight, $aK(q)$, which quantifies the longitudinal localization of quantum information, is constrained by fundamental electrostatic bounds in both materials. Crucially, the quantum weight of diamond exceeds that of LiF, indicating that covalent bonds exhibit a higher degree of delocalization and higher density of quantum information than the ionic bonds. Our results establish a direct experimental relationship between quantum information, electron localization, and chemical bonding, and identify IXS as a powerful tool for measuring quantum geometry in materials."

We operationalize these instructional methods through structured prompting and evaluate them in a within-subjects study with data visualization practitioners. Participants interacted with both a baseline LLM and an instructional LLM designed with cognitive apprenticeship prompts. Surveys, interviews, and conversational log analyses compared experiences across conditions. Our findings show that cognitively informed prompts elicit deeper design reasoning and more reflective feedback exchanges, though the baseline is sometimes preferred depending on task types or experience levels. We distill design considerations for AI-assisted feedback systems that foster reflective practice."

In a family of spin field theories labeled by integer $n$, the $n = 1$ case is the Landau-Lifshitz model, whose numerical data shows spin superdiffusion with Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) scaling and, at lower temperature ballistic energy transport, whereas both observables are diffusive at high temperature. The non-integrable $n = 2$ case shows the same crossover. While Lyapunov analysis confirms the model's non-integrability, the structure of spin-density space-time profiles suggests that long-lived soliton-like trajectories exist at low temperature."

    "abstract": "The first law of geography is a cornerstone of spatial analysis, emphasizing that nearby and related locations tend to be more similar, however, defining what constitutes \"near\" and \"related\" remains challenging, as different phenomena exhibit distinct spatial patterns. Traditional local regression models, such as Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) and Multiscale GWR (MGWR), quantify spatial relationships solely through geographic proximity. In an era of globalization and digital connectivity, however, geographic proximity alone may be insufficient to capture how locations are interconnected. To address this limitation, we propose a new multiscale local regression framework, termed M-SGWR, which characterizes spatial interaction across two dimensions: geographic proximity and attribute (variable) similarity. For each predictor, geographic and attribute-based weight matrices are constructed separately and then combined using an optimized parameter, alpha, which governs their relative contribution to local model fitting. Analogous to variable-specific bandwidths in MGWR, the optimal alpha varies by predictor, allowing the model to flexibly account for geographic, mixed, or non-spatial (remote similarity) effects. Results from two simulation experiments and one empirical application demonstrate that M-SGWR consistently outperforms GWR, SGWR, and MGWR across all goodness-of-fit metrics."

Hyper-scaling is the common industry approach: larger models, more data, and as many computational resources as possible. Using more resources is a simpler path to improved AI performance. Thus, efficiency has been de-emphasized. Consequently, the need for costly computational resources has marginalized academics and smaller companies. Simultaneously, increased energy expenditure, due to growing AI use, has led to mounting environmental costs. In response to accessibility and sustainability concerns, we argue for research into, and implementation of, market-based methods that incentivize AI efficiency. We believe that incentivizing efficient operations and approaches will reduce emissions while opening new opportunities for academics and smaller companies. As a call to action, we propose a cap-and-trade system for AI. Our system provably reduces computations for AI deployment, thereby lowering emissions and monetizing efficiency to the benefit of of academics and smaller companies."

Dielectric breakdown limits the operation of conventional devices to the $Δ\\ll t_\\perp \\simeq 360$ meV regime. We employ double ionic gating to reach fields past $ 1$ V/nm, for which $Δ> t_\\perp$. We find that for $Δ\\simeq t_\\perp$, the evolution of the longitudinal resistance ($R_{xx}$) peak as a function of applied gate voltages undergoes a sharp change in slope, exhibiting a pronounced \"knee\". Increasing $Δ$ past the \"knee\" results in an unusual evolution transport properties: the peak in $R_{xx}$ decreases in magnitude, it exhibits a splitting concomitant with multiple sign reversals of the Hall resistance, and hysteresis in the peak position emerges. We explain the observed phenomenology in terms of in-gap bound states, whose energy strongly depends on the perpendicular electric field, and crosses the mid-gap level for sufficiently large $Δ> t_\\perp$. The phenomenon causes large changes in the electronic density of in-gap states that profoundly affect the evolution of the chemical potential. Our experimental results and their interpretation reveal unique aspects of the physics of in-gap states in Bernal bilayer graphene and demonstrate that double ionic gating enables investigating the large-$Δ$ regime, which has remained experimentally inaccessible so far."

This signal encodes pristine information about our Universe, since it is sensitive to the depth of the clusters' gravitational potential wells. In this work, we show how gravitational redshift can be used to test a fundamental physical principle: the weak equivalence principle. This principle stipulates that all matter falls in the same way in a gravitational potential, regardless of its nature. By comparing the amplitude of the gravitational redshift signal with the velocity dispersion in galaxy clusters, we build a novel test of this principle targeted to the unknown dark matter. Our test is sensitive to any additional interaction that would alter the way dark matter falls in gravitational potentials, hence leading to a violation of the equivalence principle. We show that currently available data can constrain the presence of a fifth force in clusters at the level of 7-14%, while the newest surveys will reach a precision of a few percents. This demonstrates the crucial role played by galaxy clusters in testing fundamental properties of dark matter."

This development provides a clear and systematic route to constructing new configurations with nontrivial Baryonic charge and magnetic field, leveraging the fact that the Einstein--Scalar--Maxwell system is considerably more tractable, thanks to powerful solution-generating techniques. In this work, we exploit the framework that allows compact sources dressed by scalar fields to be consistently embedded in external electromagnetic backgrounds, and we construct their dual counterparts carrying Baryonic charge in the Skyrme sector. The resulting Baryonic charge is expressed directly in terms of the parameters characterizing the seed spacetime, and a corresponding quantization condition involving these parameters is explicitly derived. Consequently, the mass and the Baryonic charge are not independent parameters. These results provide a closed analytic formula for the black hole mass parameter in terms of the Baryonic charge and the magnetic field. This relation between the mass parameter and the Baryonic charge is linear for large values of the mass, while significant deviations from linearity arise if the mass takes intermediate values."

    "source": "arXiv",
    "abstract": "Tumor growth is constrained by spatial, mechanical, and metabolic factors whose alignment progressively breaks down across cellular, mesoscopic, and tissue scales as tumors expand. We hypothesize that this misalignment drives tumors toward a distinct architectural regime, termed hyperdisorder. Hyperdisorder is not defined by increased heterogeneity alone, but by the coexistence of elevated disorder across scales and spatial nonstationarity within the same tumor. Unlike ordinary randomness, where independent fluctuations diminish under spatial averaging, disorder here persists, reorganizes, or even amplifies with increasing observation scale, preventing convergence toward a stable architectural description. Using hematoxylin and eosin stained whole-slide images of gastric cancer from The Cancer Genome Atlas, we quantify tumor architecture using tile-based metrics that capture complementary aspects of organization, including texture entropy, microstructural fragmentation, orientation isotropy, and multiscale entropy variation. These measures are combined into a standardized hyperdisorder index, enabling unsupervised comparison across spatial regions. We find that architectural disruption is unevenly distributed and partially decoupled across scales within individual slides, consistent with growth-driven multiscale incoherence rather than uniform stochastic variability. Testable consequences include anomalous scaling of heterogeneity with sampling size, failure of coarse graining to converge, and systematic differences between tumor cores and invasive fronts. In diagnostic and clinical contexts, this framework clarifies when measurements from limited tissue samples are representative of the whole tumor and when they are dominated by scale- and location-dependent effects."

Inspired by recent advances in Video QA, many existing AVQA approaches primarily focus on visual information processing, leveraging pre-trained models to extract object-level and motion-level representations. However, in those methods, the audio input is primarily treated as complementary to video analysis, and the textual question information contributes minimally to audio--visual understanding, as it is typically integrated only in the final stages of reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Query-guided Spatial--Temporal--Frequency (QSTar) interaction method, which effectively incorporates question-guided clues and exploits the distinctive frequency-domain characteristics of audio signals, alongside spatial and temporal perception, to enhance audio--visual understanding. Furthermore, we introduce a Query Context Reasoning (QCR) block inspired by prompting, which guides the model to focus more precisely on semantically relevant audio and visual features. Extensive experiments conducted on several AVQA benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, achieving significant performance improvements over existing Audio QA, Visual QA, Video QA, and AVQA approaches.

To address this challenge, we propose a novel task: zero-shot stance detection in the wild with Dynamic Target Generation and Multi-Target Adaptation (DGTA), which aims to automatically identify multiple target-stance pairs from text without prior target knowledge. We construct a Chinese social media stance detection dataset and design multi-dimensional evaluation metrics. We explore both integrated and two-stage fine-tuning strategies for large language models (LLMs) and evaluate various baseline models. Experimental results demonstrate that fine-tuned LLMs achieve superior performance on this task: the two-stage fine-tuned Qwen2.5-7B attains the highest comprehensive target recognition score of 66.99%, while the integrated fine-tuned DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B achieves a stance detection F1 score of 79.26%."

In this study, we assess the effectiveness of a diffusion-based ear inpainting technique as a pre-processing aid to mitigate the issues of ear accessory occlusions in transformer-based ear recognition systems. Given an input ear image and an automatically derived accessory mask, the inpainting model reconstructs clean and anatomically plausible ear regions by synthesizing missing pixels while preserving local geometric coherence along key ear structures, including the helix, antihelix, concha, and lobule. We evaluate the effectiveness of this pre-processing aid in transformer-based recognition systems for several vision transformer models and different patch sizes for a range of benchmark datasets. Experiments show that diffusion-based inpainting can be a useful pre-processing aid to alleviate ear accessory occlusions to improve overall recognition performance."

Focusing on Grassmannian cluster algebras, we analyse tropicalisations of quasi-automorphisms in detail. We derive tropical analogues of the braid group action and the twist map on both g-vectors and tableaux. We introduce the notions of unstable and stable fixed points for quasi-automorphisms, which prove useful for constructing cluster monomials and non-real modules, respectively. As an application, we demonstrate that the counts of prime non-real tableaux with a fixed number of columns in $\\mathrm{SSYT}(3, [9])$ and $\\mathrm{SSYT}(4, [8])$, arising from the braid group action on stable fixed points, are governed by Euler's totient function.

Existing parametric approaches are predominantly based on finite mixtures, which impose restrictive assumptions on both the cure mechanism and the distribution of susceptible event times. A cure model based on phase-type distributions is introduced, leveraging their latent Markov jump process representation to allow immunity to occur either at baseline or dynamically during follow-up. This structure yields a flexible and interpretable formulation of long-term survival while encompassing classical mixture cure models as special cases. A unified regression framework is developed for covariate effects on both the cure rate and the susceptible survival distribution, and the proposed model class is dense, reducing the impact of parametric misspecification. Estimation is performed via expectation-maximization algorithms, accompanied by an automatic model selection strategy. Simulation studies and a real-data example demonstrate the practical advantages of the approach."

We introduce a mathematical framework that jointly models architecture and weights in a Sobolev space, enabling a rigorous investigation into the role of neural network architecture in continual learning and its effect on the forgetting loss. We derive necessary conditions for the continual learning solution and prove that learning only model weights is insufficient to mitigate catastrophic forgetting under distribution shifts. Consequently, we prove that by learning the architecture and weights simultaneously at each task, we can reduce catastrophic forgetting. To learn weights and architecture simultaneously, we formulate continual learning as a bilevel optimization problem: the upper level selects an optimal architecture for a given task, while the lower level computes optimal weights via dynamic programming over all tasks. To solve the upper level problem, we introduce a derivative-free direct search algorithm to determine the optimal architecture. Once found, we must transfer knowledge from the current architecture to the optimal one. However, the optimal architecture will result in a weights parameter space different from the current architecture (i.e., dimensions of weights matrices will not match). To bridge the dimensionality gap, we develop a low-rank transfer mechanism to map knowledge across architectures of mismatched dimensions. Empirical studies across regression and classification problems, including feedforward, convolutional, and graph neural networks, demonstrate that learning the optimal architecture and weights simultaneously yields substantially improved performance (up to two orders of magnitude), reduced forgetting, and enhanced robustness to noise compared with static architecture approaches."

We also introduce VerilogEval-v2-EXT, extending the original benchmark with 53 more industrial-grade design tasks and stratified difficulty levels, and show that Veri-Sure achieves state-of-the-art verified-correct RTL code generation performance, surpassing standalone LLMs and prior agentic systems."

We then prove that, as the Mach number tends to zero, this family of solutions converges strongly to the given incompressible solution. This result demonstrates that the incompressible system acts as a universal attractor in this setting: every incompressible flow can be realized as the limit of convex integration solutions to the compressible system. Our approach highlights a new form of universality for singular limits and provides a rigorous framework for understanding the incompressible limit from the perspective of weak solution theory."

Training-free diffusion models provide an attractive alternative by exploiting analytically tractable score functions, and have recently enabled supervised learning of efficient end-to-end generative samplers. Despite their empirical success, the training-free diffusion models lack rigorous and numerically verifiable error estimates. In this work, we develop a comprehensive error analysis for a class of training-free diffusion models used to generate labeled data for supervised learning of generative samplers. By exploiting the availability of the exact score function for Gaussian mixture models, our analysis avoids propagating score-function approximation errors through the reverse-time diffusion process and recovers classical convergence rates for ODE discretization schemes, such as first-order convergence for the Euler method. Moreover, the resulting error bounds exhibit favorable dimension dependence, scaling as $O(d)$ in the $\\ell_2$ norm and $O(\\log d)$ in the $\\ell_\\infty$ norm. Importantly, the proposed error estimates are fully numerically verifiable with respect to both time-step size and dimensionality, thereby bridging the gap between theoretical analysis and observed numerical behavior."

We further show how the framework leads to the Witten-Veneziano relation highlighting the role of the pure-glue topological susceptibility in organizing $θ$-dependent hadronic observables. Using these tools, we show how to extract representative $CP$-odd mesonic and baryonic amplitudes, including the chiral estimate underlying the neutron EDM bound, and how to generalize the effective framework to confining SU(N) theories with fermions in arbitrary representations. We further show how to employ the Veneziano-Yankielowicz effective Lagrangian for N=1 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory to extract salient information on the $θ$-dependent physics of one-flavour QCD via orientifold planar equivalence. We also revisit a recent no strong $CP$ claim based on an ordering of limits in the sum over topological sectors and show, in the EFT language, that it amounts to introducing an extra non-propagating axion-like degree of freedom not required by QCD. We then present the standard dynamical resolution to the strong $CP$ problem, i.e. the Peccei-Quinn mechanism, the resulting axion potential and mass from chiral EFT and briefly review associated time-honored UV completions, and the axion quality problem from gravitational corrections."

We ask whether LLMs can be systematically manipulated to reproduce language-production impairments characteristic of aphasia following focal brain lesions. Such models could provide scalable proxies for testing rehabilitation hypotheses, and offer a controlled framework for probing the functional organization of language. We introduce a clinically grounded, component-level framework that simulates aphasia by selectively perturbing functional components in LLMs, and apply it to both modular Mixture-of-Experts models and dense Transformers using a unified intervention interface. Our pipeline (i) identifies subtype-linked components for Broca's and Wernicke's aphasia, (ii) interprets these components with linguistic probing tasks, and (iii) induces graded impairments by progressively perturbing the top-k subtype-linked components, evaluating outcomes with Western Aphasia Battery (WAB) subtests summarized by Aphasia Quotient (AQ). Across architectures and lesioning strategies, subtype-targeted perturbations yield more systematic, aphasia-like regressions than size-matched random perturbations, and MoE modularity supports more localized and interpretable phenotype-to-component mappings. These findings suggest that modular LLMs, combined with clinically informed component perturbations, provide a promising platform for simulating aphasic language production and studying how distinct language functions degrade under targeted disruptions."

To address these limitations, we propose DiffStyle3D, a novel diffusion-based paradigm for 3DGS style transfer that directly optimizes in the latent space. Specifically, we introduce an Attention-Aware Loss that performs style transfer by aligning style features in the self-attention space, while preserving original content through content feature alignment. Inspired by the geometric invariance of 3D stylization, we propose a Geometry-Guided Multi-View Consistency method that integrates geometric information into self-attention to enable cross-view correspondence modeling. Based on geometric information, we additionally construct a geometry-aware mask to prevent redundant optimization in overlapping regions across views, which further improves multi-view consistency. Extensive experiments show that DiffStyle3D outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving higher stylization quality and visual realism."

We show that these edge states enable high-fidelity edge-to-edge excitation transfer using both time-independent protocols, based on coherent edge state dynamics, and time-dependent protocols, based on adiabatic modulation of system parameters. Long-range couplings play a central role by enhancing the relevant energy gaps, leading to a substantial improvement in transfer efficiency compared to nearest neighbour models. The resulting transfer is robust against positional disorder, reflecting its topological origin and highlighting the potential of long-range interacting platforms for reliable quantum state transfer."

In this paper, we propose Hyperbolic Softmax (H-Softmax) and Hyperbolic Additive Margin Softmax (HAM-Softmax) based on hyperbolic space. H-Softmax incorporates hierarchical information into speaker embeddings by projecting embeddings and speaker centers into hyperbolic space and computing hyperbolic distances. HAM-Softmax further enhances inter-class separability by introducing margin constraint on this basis. Experimental results show that H-Softmax and HAM-Softmax achieve average relative EER reductions of 27.84% and 14.23% compared with standard Softmax and AM-Softmax, respectively, demonstrating that the proposed methods effectively improve speaker verification performance and at the same time preserve the capability of hierarchical structure modeling.

Using Minkowski Functionals (MFs), we analyze the morphology of 21 cm fields: density, neutral hydrogen fraction, spin temperature, and brightness temperature.

Traditional search advertising, which relies on static keywords, fails to capture the fleeting, context-dependent user intents--the specific information, goods, or services a user seeks--embedded in conversational flows. Beyond the standard goal of social welfare maximization, effective LLM advertising imposes additional requirements on contextual coherence (ensuring ads align semantically with transient user intents) and computational efficiency (avoiding user interaction latency), as well as adherence to ethical and regulatory standards, including preserving privacy and ensuring explicit ad disclosure. Although various recent solutions have explored bidding on token-level and query-level, both categories of approaches generally fail to holistically satisfy this multifaceted set of constraints. We propose a practical framework that resolves these tensions through two decoupling strategies. First, we decouple ad insertion from response generation to ensure safety and explicit disclosure. Second, we decouple bidding from specific user queries by using ``genres'' (high-level semantic clusters) as a proxy. This allows advertisers to bid on stable categories rather than sensitive real-time response, reducing computational burden and privacy risks. We demonstrate that applying the VCG auction mechanism to this genre-based framework yields approximately dominant strategy incentive compatibility (DSIC) and individual rationality (IR), as well as approximately optimal social welfare, while maintaining high computational efficiency. Finally, we introduce an \"LLM-as-a-Judge\" metric to estimate contextual coherence. Our experiments show that this metric correlates strongly with human ratings (Spearman's $ρ\\approx 0.66$), outperforming 80% of individual human evaluators."

    "abstract": "Characterising and distinguishing gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) has interested astronomers for many decades. While some authors have found two or three groups of GRBs by analyzing only a few parameters, recent work identified five ellipsoidally-shaped groups upon considering nine parameters $T_{50}, T_{90}, F_1, F_2, F_3, F_4, P_{64}, P_{256}, P_{1024}$. Yet others suggest sub-classes within the two or three groups found earlier. Using a mixture model of Gaussian factor analysers, we analysed 1150 GRBs, that had nine parameters observed, from the current Burst and Transient Source Experiment (BATSE) catalogue, and again established five ellipsoidal-shaped groups to describe the GRBs. These five groups are characterised in terms of their average duration, fluence and spectrum as shorter-faint-hard, long-intermediate-soft, long-intermediate-intermediate, long-bright-intermediate and short-faint-hard. The use of factor analysers in describing individual group densities allows for a more thorough group-wise characterisation of the parameters in terms of a few latent features. However, given the discrepancy with many other existing studies that advocated for two or three groups, we also performed model-estimated overlap-based syncytial clustering (MOBSynC) that successively merges poorer-separated groups. The five ellipsoidal groups merge into three and then into two groups, one with GRBs of low durations and the other having longer duration GRBs. These groups are also characterised in terms of a few latent factors made up of the nine parameters. Our analysis provides context for all three sets of results, and in doing so, details a multi-layered characterisation of the BATSE GRBs, while also explaining the structure in their variability."

    "abstract": "The empirical success of deep learning is often attributed to deep networks' ability to exploit hierarchical structure in data, constructing increasingly complex features across layers. Yet despite substantial progress in deep learning theory, most optimization results sill focus on networks with only two or three layers, leaving the theoretical understanding of hierarchical learning in genuinely deep models limited. This leads to a natural question: can we prove that deep networks, trained by gradient-based methods, can efficiently exploit hierarchical structure? In this work, we consider Random Hierarchy Models -- a hierarchical context-free grammar introduced by arXiv:2307.02129 and conjectured to separate deep and shallow networks. We prove that, under mild conditions, a deep convolutional network can be efficiently trained to learn this function class. Our proof builds on a general observation: if intermediate layers can receive clean signal from the labels and the relevant features are weakly identifiable, then layerwise training each individual layer suffices to hierarchically learn the target function."

STEPS and LDCast are slightly underdispersive, but the ensemble spread provides an estimation of the error at almost all scales. Both models adapt the properties of their ensembles to the type of event, either convective or stratiform. The spatial scores of the STEPS and LDCast ensembles are compared with those of surrogate ensembles having some key properties, revealing that both STEPS and LDCast have very little ability to spatially localise the ensemble mean error vector through their ensemble members. This suggests that the content of STEPS and LDCast ensembles is informative in terms of statistics, but not in terms of dynamics."

The structural and morphological properties were characterized using powder X-ray diffraction, dynamic light scattering, and transmission electron microscopy techniques. High-resolution Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy revealed the presence of Yb$^{3+}$ isolated cubic centers and various cluster sites. The relative concentration of the clusters varied with the choice of the co-doping ion. Calculations based on density functional theory were used to estimate the formation energies and local coordination structures of different clusters. The calculations indicate that the neutral $C_{4v}$ aggregations containing Ln$^{3+}$ tend to decrease across the lanthanide series, while the negatively charged derivatives of hexameric clusters are relatively constant. This variation matches the experimental results. This study advances understanding of the clustering mechanisms in lanthanide-doped CaF$_2$ nanoparticles and has implications for luminescence optimization in advanced nanomaterials."

We challenge this view by introducing Fixed Aggregation Features (FAFs), a training-free approach that transforms graph learning tasks into tabular problems. This simple shift enables the use of well-established tabular methods, offering strong interpretability and the flexibility to deploy diverse classifiers. Across 14 benchmarks, well-tuned multilayer perceptrons trained on FAFs rival or outperform state-of-the-art GNNs and graph transformers on 12 tasks -- often using only mean aggregation. The only exceptions are the Roman Empire and Minesweeper datasets, which typically require unusually deep GNNs. To explain the theoretical possibility of non-trainable aggregations, we connect our findings to Kolmogorov-Arnold representations and discuss when mean aggregation can be sufficient. In conclusion, our results call for (i) richer benchmarks benefiting from learning diverse neighborhood aggregations, (ii) strong tabular baselines as standard, and (iii) employing and advancing tabular models for graph data to gain new insights into related tasks."

The fast-frequency response characteristics, validated against Power Hardware-in-the-Loop experiments, are integrated into an IEEE 9- bus system in DigSilent PowerFactory for system-level dynamic analysis. It demonstrates that droop-based control enhancements to local distributed generators allow their aggregation to provide grid-supporting functionalities and participate in the ancillary service markets. To this end, a long-term simulation embedding the system within the ancillary service market framework of PJM has been performed. The fast-frequency response regulation is subsequently used to calculate the potential revenue and project the results on a 15-year investment horizon.

Secondly, a full-transformer local tracking network is developed to suppress background clutter. It enhances feature representation using Spectformer as the backbone and leverages cross-attention mechanisms to robustly handle clutter. Finally, a global search strategy featuring a large-scale search module is designed to address target occlusion. This module provides reliable local search regions for the tracking network when occlusion occurs. Extensive experiments on infrared drone datasets validate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving high success rates, high precision, and high real-time processing at 45 FPS under specific configurations."

Most existing trackers fail to adapt to such modality and temporal dynamics in a unified and effective manner, resulting in target representations that are neither discriminative nor temporally consistent. In this paper, we propose ProMoT, a novel tracking framework that jointly integrates cross-modal and temporal cues into a progressive prompting process, enabling continuous retrieval of target-aware representations. Specifically, we design an adaptive target query generator (QueryGen), which selectively aggregates informative spatio-temporal cues from diverse ghost representations through the dynamic sparse ghost fusion mechanism, thereby enabling the generation of target-aware queries. To further preserve fine-grained, temporally consistent target cues, we introduce a high-order contextual prompt updater (PromptUpdater), which encodes high-order cross-modal representations from current and previous frames. These prompts establish the compact and discriminative inter-frame context to not only refine the current frame’s features but also guide target localization in future frames. All components are built upon a parameter-shared backbone for RGB and TIR inputs, forming our complete ProMoT framework. Extensive experiments on both complete and missing modality RGB-T tracking benchmarks show that ProMoT consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance while balancing efficiency."

    "abstract": "With the explosive advancement of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), the security of efficient UAV networks has become increasingly critical. Owing to the open nature of its communication environment, illegitimate malicious UAVs (MUs) can infer the position of the source UAV (SU) by analyzing received signals, thus compromising the SU location privacy. To protect the SU location privacy while ensuring efficient communication with legitimate receiving UAVs (RUs), we propose an Active Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (ARIS)-assisted covert communication scheme based on virtual partitioning and artificial noise (AN). Specifically, we design a novel ARIS architecture integrated with an AN module. This architecture dynamically partitions its reflecting elements into multiple sub-regions: one subset is optimized to enhance communication between the SU and RUs, while the other subset generates AN to interfere with the localization of the SU by MUs. We first derive the Cramér-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) for localization with received signal strength (RSS), based on which, we establish a joint optimization framework for communication enhancement and localization interference. Subsequently, we derive and validate the optimal ARIS partitioning and power allocation under average channel conditions. Finally, tailored optimization methods are proposed for the reflection precoding and AN design of the two partitions. Simulation results validate that, compared to baseline schemes, the proposed scheme significantly increases the localization error of MUs by approximately 37.65% with only a 3.69% reduction in the communication rate between the SU and RUs, thereby effectively protecting the SU location privacy."

    "abstract": "Phishing emails are a common kind of cyberattack that aim to trick victims into giving over personal information, financial data, and login credentials. Traditional spam filters have a hard time detecting phishing emails because they often look like they came from a trusted source. The need for more sophisticated detection procedures to distinguish between legitimate and malicious emails is growing in response to the sophistication of phishing assaults. With the help of an Adaptive Reproductive Harris Hawks Optimisation (ARHHO) fine-tuner, to provide EfficientNet, a phishing email spam detector based on residual attention mechanisms (RAM). By zeroing in on important parts of the email's content, metadata, and embedded links, the RAC module improves feature extraction, which in turn improves classification accuracy and decreases false positives. At its core, EfficientNet guarantees scalable and efficient deep learning processing thanks to its optimised depth and breadth scaling. Furthermore, ARHHO optimises the model's hyperparameters in real-time to enhance generalisability and resilience through better classification performance. Extensive tests on benchmark phishing datasets are conducted to evaluate the proposed approach. Our model beats traditional deep learning methods like CNNs, LSTMs, and transformers in every metric to measured: accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The use of attention-driven feature extraction in conjunction with adaptive optimisation techniques allows us to significantly improve phishing detection skills while simultaneously reducing the sum of false positives. By developing a sophisticated, effective, and scalable method for detecting phishing emails, this study makes a contribution to cybersecurity. Improvements based on transformer models, detection techniques that work in real-time, and strategies to withstand adversarial attacks are all part of the future. Enterprise email security solutions can effectively implement the suggested structure to reduce the risks of phishing attacks."

During the imaging process, it produces a large number of defective pixels, i.e., bad pixels, and the imaging uniformity of the camera is poor, which greatly affects the quality of image output. To address the problem of poor image quality, the maximum inter-class variance method is first used to perform binarization processing on the image. On this basis, combined with the polarization distribution law, weight adaptive filtering is applied for denoising. The prior information entropy is extracted from the denoised image, which is then coupled with the atmospheric scattering model for equalization processing. Then, the complex wavelet is used to describe the image features, and the least squares support vector machine classifier is utilized to obtain the optimal decision criterion function. Finally, the optimally matched and enhanced target sub-image is output, and the image feature information is further enhanced. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm achieves better subjective effects, and the objective evaluation parameters of the resulting image, such as peak signal-to-noise ratio, edge preservation index, equivalent number of looks, and Brownian random variance, are all improved compared with those of other commonly used algorithms."

In the first stage, we design a safe reference model to generate reference trajectories that satisfy CBF-based safety conditions. However, asymptotically tracking a safe reference trajectory does not automatically guarantee safety at every time step. Therefore, in the second stage, we formulate a chance-constrained optimization problem for the nonlinear system with dynamical uncertainties to track the reference model, while provably guaranteeing CBF-based safety constraint satisfaction at each time step up to a user-defined risk bound. We then provide a risk-tunable sampling-based scenario design approach to tune parameterized controllers that solve this optimization problem. In addition, for the special case of linear dynamics, we provide conditions on the uncertainty samples for the existence of controller parameters that can guarantee safe tracking. We illustrate the performance of our framework on a quadcopter navigation problem with obstacle avoidance constraints."

    "abstract": "The maximum likelihood attack strategy is known to be the optimal attack strategy for an eavesdropper in a wiretap channel scenario with additive white Gaussian noise channels under the distinguishing security criterion. The main drawback of this optimal attack is its high computational complexity. While this complexity doesn’t hinder the eavesdropper since he has unlimited computing power, it does present a significant challenge for legitimate parties. For them, it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to estimate the outcome of the optimal attacker strategy to validate the secrecy of their communication system. In this paper, we introduce a low complexity method for generating upper and lower bounds on the attack performance of the eavesdropper to validate the security against the maximum likelihood attack strategy. We theoretically establish that the derived bounds represent valid constraints on the attack success probability under suitable constraints. The validation method is based on list generation and can be used for any linear block code. Furthermore, we propose a list generation algorithm for this validation method and show different ways to further reduce the complexity. We compare the proposed validation method with state-of-the-art attack strategies in numerical simulations for various error-correcting codes."

    "abstract": "The performance of Ordered-Statistic CFAR (OSCFAR) algorithms is inherently constrained by their dependence on predefined parameters, which leads to missed detections as the number of targets approaches the theoretical detection capacity. In this paper, an improved Ordered-Statistic CFAR algorithm based on Otsu’s preprocessing (OOS-CFAR) is proposed to address the issue. Different from traditional OS-CFAR, the proposed algorithm adopts the maximum between-class variance as a criterion to partition interference and background clutter regions, whereby interference signals are adaptively separated before clutter power estimation, thus avoiding the masking effect caused by fixed parameters. Monte Carlo simulations are conducted under various multi-target scenarios, and the results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm exhiits both superior performance and robust property, particularly in cases where OSCFAR fails."

This paper proposes an efficient algorithm for the joint estimation of angle, range, and velocity in ISAC system employing orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation. Leveraging the distinctive structure of OTFS waveforms, the transmit data symbols are first mapped into the delay-Doppler (DD) domain. Then, for each coherent processing interval, beamforming is performed on each DD bin for the steering vector. We then proposed the spectrum peak-finding method in spatial-delay-Doppler domain to estimate the three-dimensional (3D) parameters, i.e., angle, range, and velocity, simultaneously. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves the lower root mean square error in 3D parameter estimation, particularly under low signal-to-noise ratio conditions."

    "abstract": "Attention is a fundamental cognitive process, and individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) often experience challenges in both cognitive and emotional regulation. Although multiple object tracking (MOT) tasks are frequently used to assess attention impairments in ASD, most studies focus solely on behavioral responses and overlook physiological measures such as electroencephalogram (EEG). Moreover, the interaction between cognition and emotion during MOT tasks remains underexplored. This study addresses these gaps by examining cognitive load variations using the Theta/Alpha Ratio (TAR) in 31 ASD and 31 typically developing (TD) children, based on publicly available EEG data. Participants completed three tasks: neutral image viewing (IPAS), one-target 4-disc (MOT4), and one-target 8-disc (MOT8), representing low, intermediate, and high attentional loads, respectively, while listening to happiness and sadness prosodies. For each participant, TAR was calculated, and five EEG features were extracted: averaged TAR across all channels (allTAR) and TAR values from the frontal (fTAR), temporal (tTAR), parietal (pTAR), and central (cTAR) regions. A three-factor ANOVA (emotion types × attention levels × subject groups) was conducted, followed by post-hoc t-tests for multiple comparisons, and correlation analyses were performed between the five EEG features and clinical measures. Results revealed: (1) a significant interaction between attention level and emotional prosody for tTAR; (2) significant main effects of attention level in fTAR and cTAR, but no interaction with emotional prosody; (3) higher allTAR, fTAR, tTAR, cTAR, and pTAR in the ASD group compared to TD; and (4) stronger EEG clinical correlations in the ASD group during MOT-4. These findings confirm visual attention deficits and highlight the interplay between emotion and cognition in ASD, suggesting TAR as a potential biomarker for cognitive load and emotional modulation."

There are about <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{2. 4}-\\mathbf{4. 5}$</tex> million patients in the United States, which is a large percentage. A chronic wound is a wound that does not heal within three months as these wounds are unresponsive to normal wound healing signals. Because these wounds are associated with conditions such as aging and diseases such as leprosy and diabetes, and because the number of cases of diabetes is increasing, the number of people with chronic wounds is also increasing. In recent times, using image processing and segmentation algorithms is necessary to make analysis on wounds images to effectively identify and detect wounds and highlight area in the image where the wound is present to determine its size in order to determine whether there is progress or not in the phase of wound healing. In this paper we will use different Yolo versions and UNet algorithm in detecting and segmenting the wounds images and determine their performance in terms of accuracy and speed. Chronic wounds dataset of 602 images taken from 69 leprosy patients which are RGB is used before applying data augmentation and 1562 RGB images are used after the upsampling to avoid the overfitting problem which leads to performance degradation."

    "abstract": "The water depth of very shallow water environment is much smaller than the that of a shallow water environment. The water depth of a typical very shallow water environment leads to a more severe interface scattering effect during the propagation of the sound wave, hence producing stronger sea-surface and bottom reverberation than those in shallow water environment. To address the reverberation suppression problem in the very shallow water environment, we propose advanced WISPR (Wagstaff’s Integration Silencing Processor) summation (AWSUM) filter aided alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). The focus of this method is selecting feasible and reasonable approaches to suppress different reverberation components step by step. Firstly, we utilize ADMM to realize the low-rank and sparse matrix decomposition and then remove the low-rank matrix, and hence suppressing the bottom reverberation. Secondly, we employ the AWSUM filter to suppress the sea-surface reverberation, the volume reverberations and some residual of the bottom reverberation. Finally, we apply the hard thresholding operator to the output of AWSUM to suppress the weak reverberation around the target highlights. Compared to other robust principal component analysis (RPCA) methods and AWSUM Filter aided RPCA methods, the Bias of Integral Side Lobe Ratio (BISLR) of our method stabilizes at high value. This demonstrates the effectiveness of our method for reverberation suppression in the very shallow water environment."

This study tests the performance of two object detection models, namely YOLOv8m (medium) and YOLOv8n (nano) in case of multi-label classification and localization of four classes of brain tumor, each represented by glioma, meningioma, pituitary, and no tumor. Although methods based on traditional CNN do attain classification accuracies, they cannot achieve spatial localization. Conversely, our solution also provides localization in addition to detection by use of YOLOv8. Experimental data demonstrate that YOLOv8m overperforms YOLOv8n on mAP@0.5 (0.927 versus 0.896) as well as the accuracy on different classes (96.46% versus 90.98% meningioma, 93.22% versus 90.98% pituitary, 93.22% versus 90.98% no tumor, and 72.45% versus 63.5% glioma. The enhanced localization and lower rates of misclassification of YOLOv8m are verified by the qualitative assessment provided with the help of prediction images and confusion matrices. These findings show the potential of YOLOv8m as a stable and precise approach to tumor detection in real-time with the potential to be implemented within the clinical diagnostic systems."

For DC and low-frequency measurements below 5 Hz, a timing-based direct capacitor interface was implemented, for higher AC frequencies, analog signal conditioning and filtering enables direct ADC conversion. Experimental validation against calibrated reference magnetometers demonstrates 99% accuracy for both DC and low-frequency AC measurements up to 8 kHz across all three orthogonal axes. The AC field response exhibits the expected logarithmic decrease with distance from the field source, with reliable detection maintained out to 150 mm separation. These results confirm the viability of integrating TMR sensors with standard microcontrollers for portable, multi-axis biomedical magnetic field monitoring without requiring cryogenic cooling."

In this study, we develop a self-distilled Deep PCA-KPCA framework, where knowledge from kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) is transferred into shallow principal component analysis (PCA). The features extracted by both PCA and KPCA are transformed into posterior probabilities through Bayesian inference. Based on the consistency between teacher and student models, weighting coefficients are adaptively determined to perform dynamic fusion, generating probability statistics that integrate different posterior probabilities and yield more comprehensive monitoring results. The effectiveness of the proposed self-distillation approach is validated on the Tennessee Eastman process."

However, recent studies have uncovered a critical vulnerability: DRL agents are highly susceptible to adversarial attacks that can significantly degrade their performance or lead to catastrophic failure. These attacks exploit different components of the learning pipeline observations, actions, rewards, and policies exposing new challenges unique to DRL compared to supervised learning. This survey provides a comprehensive examination of adversarial threats and corresponding defense mechanisms within the DRL paradigm. We begin with an in-depth background on DRL fundamentals, distinguishing between online and offline settings, and contrasting on-policy versus off-policy algorithms. We then present a taxonomy of adversarial attacks based on the point of intervention in the DRL pipeline: observation perturbations, action manipulation, reward poisoning, and policy corruption. This also aims to serve as a foundational reference for researchers and practitioners seeking to understand and mitigate adversarial vulnerabilities in DRL."

Traditional deep learning architectures like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), ResNet50, Hybrid 3B Net with EfficientNetB2, EfficientNet-B0, as well as MobileNetV2 have gained widespread application for the same. Still, these models suffer from the limitation of capturing global spacial details, resulting in poor classification as well as segmentation accuracy for complex multiple-lesion cases. To overcome these issues, it is proposed to design an efficient Vision Transformer (ViT)-based model for multiple-lesion classification as well as segmentation of brain tumors. The said method makes effective utilization of the self-attention mechanism for capturing long-range dependencies within MRI images for identifying tumors with high precision. Extended experiments prove the ViT model achieved classification accuracy of 97.8%, precision of 97.3%, recall of 97.5%, F1-score of 97.4%, as well as Dice Similarity Coefficient of 94.6%, exhibiting the highest performance compared to all traditional methods. It is proven that the proposed ViT framework decreases validation loss by almost 2/3 as compared to baseline methods while boosting robustness tremendously. It is a strong candidate for clinical diagnostic options for neuro-oncology."

Although human interpretation of chest X-rays is labor-intensive and prone to errors, it is a common diagnostic tool for pneumonia. One interesting method is to automate this procedure using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). This study demonstrates the efficiency of deep networks by building a new CNN model. A distributed training approach using TensorFlow's TPU (Tensor Processing Unit) maximizes the model training process. The suggested CNN model is parallelized with TPU's numerous cloud-based instances, which allows for effective compute parallelization and drastically cuts down on model training durations. According to the experimental results, training the CNN model with the TPU significantly reduces model training times. The architecture of this CNN constitutes various layers, including Conv2D layers, which apply convolution operations, and conv_blocks, which typically consist of several Conv2D layers with activation functions like ReLU, often accompanied by batch normalization. These components work together to process data to learn complex patterns. As a result, the CNN model's accuracy increased to 99.13%."

Second, we introduce a labels automated annotation module based on detecting the degree of gripper closure. This module determines grasp success or failure by assessing the actual closure of the gripper. Finally, through these labels and manual correction, we constructed five grasping tasks to build a new continual learning dataset [kitchen waste grasp on continual learning (KWG-CL)] and proposed a novel continual learning method. By using this method, our algorithm achieves the highest average image-level grasp accuracy (77.28%) on the KWG-CL compared to state-of-the-art approaches, while exhibiting the least catastrophic forgetting. In addition, we also validated this in a real-world robot system. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first application of the continual learning method in kitchen waste sorting."

Control tests were done at dc at the same voltage, at <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$100~^{\\circ }$</tex-math> </inline-formula>C. In addition, selected parts were subjected to pure thermal aging at <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$100~^{\\circ }$</tex-math> </inline-formula>C. The rationale of pulsed testing was a highly accelerated aging compared to dc aging. Aging of the three capacitor types at different temperatures shows a tendency of aging being independent of temperature (in the specified ranges) at a large number of shots. Based on the results obtained with different discharge loads, it was concluded that the discharge current has no appreciable impact on aging at current levels typical for high voltage power supplies (HVPSs); voltage is the dominant factor. Pulsed aging results in capacitance loss (CL) of several percent at millions of pulses, whereas dc aging at the same and even higher voltages for more than 1000 hr yielded CL of fractions of a percent only. CL empirical fits using inverse power law are also offered. One regular PP type lost capacitance through self-healing, with the film exhibiting clearings’ pockmarks; the films of the other two types did not have the same pattern. The HT film was partially fused; the film of the other regular PP type that lost more than 10% of capacitance was largely indistinguishable from a fresh film, except for receding metallization edges. The edge recession, as evidenced by microphotography, caused by electrochemical corrosion, is responsible for CL."

    "abstract": "Emerging Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite networks, represented by Starlink, have developed a rapidly growing user base and increasing network traffic. Accurate and reliable satellite traffic prediction is essential for optimizing network performance and resource management. However, the high-speed motion of satellites and the uneven geographic distribution of users pose significant challenges to satellite network traffic prediction. Yet, empowered by Artificial Intelligence (AI) and inter-satellite links (ISLs), new opportunities arise. This article proposes a Real-time Resilient Traffic Prediction (RRTP) framework via adjacent satellite collaboration. Unlike existing methods that rely solely on historical data and delayed ground updates, by exchanging real-time traffic data, the onboard collaborative prediction learns the spatiotemporal traffic correlations among adjacent satellites, updates the parameters of the neural network models, and timely corrects the predicted traffic volume. The base model can be pre-trained on the ground and uploaded to satellites to save computations. Since RRTP requires neither global nor continuous long-term data exchange, RRTP enhances resilience to abrupt traffic changes and unexpected events, such as link/satellite failures. The overhead, cost, and applicability of RRTP are further discussed and validated through comparative simulations of a series of mega-constellation case studies."

In accordance with common practice, the sample data can be modeled using Hermitian positive-definite (HPD) matrices, while the clutter covariance matrix is estimated as the geometric mean of the secondary HPD matrices. We define a projection that maps the HPD matrices to a submanifold with reduced clutter, aiming to increase the degree of separation of targets and clutter. Three MSP-MIG detectors corresponding to different geometric measures are proposed. Experimental results confirm the advantage of the MSP-MIG detectors compared with the conventional detectors as well as their counterparts without using MSP in sample-starved clutter."

To counter this attack, a misleading LADDER-based algorithm that misleads attackers with false register values and randomized passwords is proposed. To evaluate the attack and the proposed protocol, two attack scenarios and two password lengths have been leveraged on a PLC in a LAN environment. Results show that the misleading protocol causes each attacker to receive different passwords and data, disrupting brute-force attempts while enabling attacker identification. When tested with one thread and 20 Arduino kits, each kit found a different password and received different data when reading PLC registers. This approach not only prevents unauthorized access but also allows administrators to track attackers' IP addresses, highlighting the effectiveness of deception-based defenses in industrial security."

But the explosion in their numbers has been met with increasing security threats and issues of privacy. This paper puts forward a new blockchain-based paradigm for mobile payment systems that prioritizes privacy but retains high-security standards. This design leverages the essential capabilities of blockchain technology like decentralization, immutability, and cryptographic protection. It incorporates advanced privacy-protecting techniques such as zero-knowledge proofs and homomorphic encryption. The system design intended here is to mitigate common vulnerabilities present in centralized systems, reduce the risk of data breaches, and provide users with more control over their financial data. By comparative analysis and simulations, we show that our privacy-oriented blockchain solution strongly improves transaction security, minimizes fraud, and maintains user anonymity without sacrificing system performance or compliance with regulations.

However, a byproduct of this unifying AC magnetic link is the cross-coupled power flow induced by the inter-port phase shifts, subsequently preventing independent port-wise operation. Therefore, this work presents a time-domain analytical framework for the accurate estimation of the cross-coupled active power flow by applying a superposition-based approach to the MAB port-equivalent models. These port-equivalent models are derived from the full-order <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$n \\times n$</tex-math></inline-formula> inductance matrix (<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\mathbf {L}$</tex-math></inline-formula>-matrix) extracted from an asymmetric integrated-leakage HFML via a single-port impedance measurement scheme. Furthermore, a control-integrated power decoupling (IPD) feedforward compensator is developed to suppress undesirable propagative voltage fluctuations during transient power flows, thereby ensuring port-wise decoupling of the converter. Steady-state experiments conducted on a 3.2 kW SiC-based four-port MAB prototype are used to validate the accuracy of the proposed time-domain model with respect to the terminal active powers.

While integrating rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) and reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) enhances spectral efficiency, securing transmissions against unknown eavesdroppers with imperfect channel state information (CSI) remains a critical challenge. We propose a secure multi-user, multi-cluster RIS-assisted RSMA system for HAPs, jointly optimizing precoding, RIS beamforming, and cluster time allocation to maximize sum-rate under secrecy rate constraints. The non-convex problem is transformed into a tractable semidefinite program (SDP) via successive convex approximation, auxiliary variable bounding, and a rank-1 penalty method. Simulations demonstrate significant performance gains over benchmarks, robustness to practical RIS phase quantization, and scalability across varying numbers of users per cluster, validating the framework's efficacy."

While contemporary deep learning-based jamming recognition methods predominantly leverage time-frequency (TF) maps derived from Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) as primary features, this transformation inherently discards crucial fast transient information from the original time-domain signals. To address this limitation, we propose a novel time-frequency multi-representation jamming recognition algorithm. This algorithm synergistically integrates fine-grained time-domain features with the signal energy distribution from TF representations, thereby substantially enhancing recognition accuracy within intricate deceptive jamming scenarios. Furthermore, to capture global contextual dependencies often missed by local operations, a Transformer-based prediction framework is employed. This leverages its intrinsic self-attention mechanism, enhancing the model’s ability to discern complex patterns and thereby bolstering overall recognition robustness. Comprehensive experimental evaluations across diverse simulated complex deceptive jamming environments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm consistently achieves a recognition accuracy surpassing 99%, unequivocally validating its superior performance and practical efficacy."

Traditional disaster assessment often lacks insight into public sentiment, a vital factor for effective response and recovery. This paper explores the application of natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze public discourse on Twitter before, during, and after major disasters. The primary objective is to develop a robust sentiment analysis framework capable of accurately assessing and interpreting public sentiment using advanced NLP methods tailored for the characteristics of Twitter. This includes addressing challenges such as the real-time analysis requirements of Twitter’s rapid, short-form posting style, the noisy and ambiguous nature of tweet data, and the need to capture evolving public reactions as events unfold. By identifying sentiment trends and patterns on Twitter, this research aims to provide timely and actionable insights for disaster management agencies, policymakers, and humanitarian organizations to enhance disaster preparedness, response strategies, and communication efforts. This approach seeks to leverage the immediate feedback provided by Twitter to complement traditional disaster assessment methods, incorporating the crucial dimension of public emotional well-being during crises.

    "abstract": "Decentralized learning, which facilitates joint model training across geographically scattered agents, has gained significant attention in the field of signal and information processing in recent years. While the optimization errors of decentralized learning algorithms have been extensively studied, their generalization errors remain relatively under-explored. As the generalization error reflects the scalability of a trained model on unseen data and are crucial in determining the performance of a trained model in real-world applications, understanding the generalization error of decentralized learning is of paramount importance. In this paper, we present fine-grained generalization error analysis for both attack-free and Byzantine-resilient decentralized learning with heterogeneous data as well as under mild assumptions, in contrast to prior studies that consider homogeneous data and/or rely on a stringent bounded stochastic gradient assumption. Our results shed light on the impact of data heterogeneity, model initialization and stochastic gradient noise – factors that have not been closely investigated before – on the generalization error of decentralized learning. We also reveal that Byzantine attacks performed by malicious agents largely affect the generalization error, and their negative impact is inherently linked to the data heterogeneity while remaining independent on the sample size. Numerical experiments on both strongly convex and non-convex tasks are conducted to validate our theoretical findings."

    "abstract": "Ultra-lightweight authentication protocols are essential for resource-constrained environments such as RFID systems, where conventional cryptographic methods are impractical. The Cloud-based RFID Ultra-Lightweight Secure Authentication Protocol (CRUSAP) employs Bitwise Crossover rearrangement and Rotation-based primitives to achieve secure communication. This paper presents a comprehensive cryptanalytic evaluation, demonstrating that CRUSAP's reversible operations and deterministic design render it vulnerable to practical attacks. Full Disclosure, Desynchronization, and Time-Memory Trade-Off (TMTO) attacks compromise session secrecy and entity authenticity. Experimental analysis shows that 8-bit temporary identifiers (TIDS) are fully recoverable, while 96-bit TIDS can be partially recovered (60%) due to statistical leakage via a Full Disclosure attack. Time-Memory Trade-Off (TMTO) and Desynchronization attacks further allow the extraction of session keys and nonces. Although attacks on larger key sizes may demand significant computational resources, including GPUs and extensive memory, the protocol remains fundamentally vulnerable due to inherent structural weaknesses. Even with dynamic key updates, CRUSAP lacks adequate entropy isolation and structural robustness, highlighting the need for irreversible primitives, protocol redesign, or stronger lightweight authentication schemes."

    "abstract": "A novel enhancement-mode (E-mode) p-GaN/AlGaN/GaN high-electron-mobility transistor (HEMT) featuring a diode-engineered gate configuration was developed to extend the gate voltage swing range. In the proposed design, a small diode is monolithically integrated in series to the p-GaN gate, introducing an additional forward voltage drop to the threshold voltage of the HEMT. This approach significantly increases both the threshold voltage and the maximum allowable gate voltage swing compared to conventional p-GaN gate HEMTs, which typically exhibit low threshold voltages and limited gate swing ranges. The device employs a standard heterostructure, and the compact size of the embedded diode ensures that the increase in chip area is negligible."

    "abstract": "Machine learning is nowadays used in tiny micro-controller boards, sometimes called TinyML. At the same time, LoRa Internet of Things (IoT) communication technology can now provide LoRa mesh network topologies that interconnect remote IoT devices. Both tendencies, however, have not converged yet to combine the potential of both. In this paper, we argue for a solution consisting of a two-board design as an architecture for interconnected ML-enabled IoT nodes in a LoRa mesh network. A prototype of the architecture using the TTGO LoRa32 board as a network device and the Arduino Portenta H7 as an application device is implemented as a case study to show the feasibility. We analyze a federated learning protocol design to illustrate how distributed applications can interact within the proposed two-board node architecture. We position the architecture with regard to several performance aspects and observe that the design delivers a separation of concerns by one board hosting the ML-application and the other providing an advanced network service to the application."

    "abstract": "Adaptive filters, constrained by a linear filtering framework, often struggle with nonlinear modeling in complex processes. Kernel adaptive filters (KAFs) offer a promising solution by mapping input signals into diverse feature spaces. However, their computational efficiency and filtering accuracy may still not meet the demands of practical applications. To this end, based on Kolmogorov-Arnold (KA) representation theorem, this paper proposes a novel nonlinear filtering framework by treating filter weights as learnable functions. Specifically, the learnable functions are represented as a linear combination of multiple Gaussian basis functions with different centers. To determine the coefficients that define these learnable functions, the weight-learning-based least mean square (WL-LMS) and weight-learning-based recursive least squares (WL-RLS) algorithms are further proposed based on minimum mean square error (MMSE). In addition, to ensure convergence and assess the steady-state and transient performance of proposed algorithms, a thorough theoretical analysis of the convergence conditions and excess mean square error (EMSE) is provided. Finally, linear-in-parameters system identifications validate the correctness of theoretical analysis, while chaotic time-series prediction and nonlinear system identifications demonstrate the superiorities of the proposed WL-LMS and WL-RLS algorithms."

    "abstract": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) modulates cortical excitability to promote neuroplasticity, but single-target TMS has limited effects on multi-region synergy. Sequential dual-target TMS may enhance brain network reorganization through temporal stimulation, though its mechanisms remain unclear. This study investigates the immediate effects of single- and dual-target TMS on brain functional networks in stroke patients using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and dynamic functional connectivity (dFNC) analysis. Fifteen subacute stroke patients and fifteen healthy controls underwent three interventions: single-target SMA-rTMS, single-target LDLPFC-rTMS, and sequential dual-target stimulation (Dual-rTMS). fNIRS data were analyzed via dFNC to identify connectivity states (weak, moderate, strong) and evaluate time fraction, state transitions, global efficiency, and total signal power. Results revealed three dFNC states: State 1 (weak connectivity, 44.24%), State 2 (moderate, 39.44%), and State 3 (strong, 16.32%). Single-target TMS (especially SMA-rTMS) increased time fraction in State 1, indicating low-connectivity induction, while Dual-rTMS further prolonged State 1 and reduced inefficient transitions (e.g., State 1→2: p < 0.005). Stroke patients showed impaired transitions from State 2→3 (p = 0.024) versus controls. Time fraction in State 3 correlated positively with motor function scores (FMA-LE: r = 0.52, p = 0.045; BBS: r = 0.52, p = 0.047), while State 1 correlated negatively (FMA-LE: r = -0.52, p = 0.045). Sequential dual-target TMS optimizes network dynamics by sustaining low-energy states and suppressing maladaptive transitions, outperforming single-target approaches. dFNC temporal patterns may serve as biomarkers for post-stroke motor function, supporting sequential dual-target TMS as a promising rehabilitation tool."

    "abstract": "Electronic Health Records (EHRs) are essential in contemporary healthcare as they facilitate the storage and sharing of personal patient data. Traditional cloud-based EHR systems, though, are afflicted with centralized control, privacy threats, restricted interoperability, and susceptibility to data breaches. To alleviate these challenges, this paper suggests a blockchain-based, patient-centered EHR management system that uses Ethereum smart contracts, Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), and InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) for safe, distributed, and effective handling of health data.The system put forward puts patients at the forefront of EHR access and control, allowing them to grant or withdraw permissions to healthcare providers, insurers, or researchers using fine-grained, attribute-based policies executed through smart contracts. DIDs remove the need for third-party identity providers, providing secure and verifiable user authentication directly on the blockchain. IPFS, on the other hand, provides cost-effective, tamper-proof off-chain storage of medical records, with metadata and access logs stored on-chain to minimize gas usage.Extensive testing on the Ethereum Goerli testnet proves that the system provides greater security, lower storage costs, efficient access control, and better interoperability than conventional models. This method not only solves existing shortcomings in EHR systems but also opens the door to scalable, transparent, and patient-enabled healthcare data management."

Firstly, the optimal number of pusle groups and pulse number inside each pulse group are determined by accumulated loss curve of fast-fluctuating signal. Secondly, the matched MTD filters are designed according to the change of the clutter spectrum width of different pulse groups, then pulse compression and MTD are performed for each group. Finally, accumulating the data of the same velocity channel in each pulse group through the mapping relationship between doppler domin and velocity domin, then perform the CFAR detection. Simulation experiments shows that the proposed method has good detection performance and clutter suppression performance, and it has a certain superiority."

This method synergistically integrates Lyapunov stability theory with control barrier functions, creating a dual-layer safety assurance mechanism that explicitly enforces stability constraints and hard safety boundaries during policy optimization. Extensive experimental results in complex mountainous terrains demonstrate the superiority of the LB-SAC-based decisionmaking model, showing a remarkable reduction in constraint violation rates to just <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{1 8 \\%}$</tex> of baseline algorithms and a 32% improvement in mission completion efficiency.

Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), inspired by biological neural computation, are inherently suited to modeling the temporal characteristics of event data. Therefore, we propose a hybrid ANN-SNN segmentation framework that leverages a Spiking Dynamics Encoding (SDE) module for temporal encoding of event streams and Artificial Neural Network (ANNs) for extracting spatial and semantic features from images. The SDE employs Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neurons to transform asynchronous event streams into spatiotemporal confidence maps, enabling adaptive capture of motion-sensitive cues. Besides, to effectively integrate heterogeneous features from both modalities, we design an Early Cross-Modal Fusion (ECMF) module that concatenates and fuses low-level features from both branches through a shared convolutional layer at the initial processing stage. Experimental results on the DSEC and DDD17 datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in enhancing temporal modeling and cross-modal feature integration for multimodal semantic segmentation."

In this paper, robust models based on a machine learning approach provide very high accuracy measures for kidney disease, liver disease, colon cancer, and Wilson's disease with machine learning techniques. Based on these results, we created a clinical assistant app with AI that significantly improves early detection with three key characteristics. The primary feature involves the real-time analysis of patient data, including symptoms, laboratory findings, and imaging, to accurately identify high-risk individuals for liver and kidney diseases with over 96% certainty. The second feature is monitoring disease progression markers, such as predicting kidney function decline with 96.33% accuracy using AdaBoost to allow for treatment before symptoms appear. Furthermore, the third feature is AI-driven decision support systems that speed up diagnosis, especially for tricky cases such as colon cancer and Wilson's disease. By integrating these models into clinical pipelines, the application fills crucial gaps in early detection, such as the asymptomatic progression of colon cancer or the genetic intricacies of Wilson's disease, enabling doctors to treat patients sooner, based on personal circumstances, and ultimately leading to improved patient survival rates while lowering healthcare costs."

Closed-form expressions are derived for the system success probability (SSP) and the asymptotic SSP over Nakagami- m fading for the interference-limited regime. Numerical results investigate the impact of key parameters on the SSP and show that the proposed selection scheme achieves better performance than the Round-Robin and random selection schemes."

A novel signal model is developed by representing the plane wave spectrum (PWS) corresponding to the measured signals as a Maclaurin series expansion. By performing the Fourier transform of each polynomial term in this expansion, the measured signals can be expressed as a linear combination of the derivatives of the free-space scalar Green’s function. The initial excitations and Maclaurin coefficients are jointly estimated through iterative minimization of an evaluation function, which is defined by measuring the difference between the measured signals and the virtual signals computed using the proposed signal model. An alternating optimization strategy is employed to ensure fast and efficient convergence of the minimization process. A 6 × 9 planar array composed of rectangular open-ended open waveguides was calibrated at a measurement distance of 0.5 m using the proposed method, achieving a calibration error range of ±0.58 dB and ±4.9°. The calibration was conducted using probe measurements over approximately one-quarter of the AUT aperture, with a 3 × 3 uniformly spaced rectangular sampling grid within this scanning region. The obtained results validate the effectiveness of the proposed calibration method."

Results from experiments using the BioASQ Task 12b question answering dataset and PubMed articles showed nuanced trade-offs, with either RAG or fine-tuning performing better for different scenarios.

Sub-sequently, a novel event-triggered model-free adaptive predictive control (ET-MFAPC) algorithm with time-varying parameters is proposed, which integrates multi-step adaptive prediction and receding-horizon optimization. The proposed algorithm features several key innovations: 1) An output-related auxiliary variable is designed to circumvent unavailable pseudo-partial derivatives (PPDs) and their sign constraints. 2) An adaptive predictive compensation module is developed to mitigate the impacts of DoS attacks by reconstructing hijacked data packets. 3) An attack-aware online optimization mechanism is formulated to adaptively tune controller gains for improved system performance. Furthermore, a comprehensive security analysis is conducted based on a model-independent data energy function, and explicit boundary conditions are derived for tolerable attack frequency and duration.

Existing approaches typically address this problem either deterministically, relying on reliable and consistent communication networks, or through approximations that often lead to overly conservative trajectories. In this article, we propose a method for generating trajectories by accounting for collision probabilities involving uncertain neighboring agents and obstacles, which is designed for multiple ground vehicles operating in a communication-free environment with limited detection ranges and Gaussian noise. A receding horizon framework is developed and formulated as a joint spatial–temporal chance-constrained optimization problem using nonlinear model predictive control (JSTC-MPC). To ensure the reliability and computational efficiency of the trajectories, an analytical and tighter approximation of joint spatial–temporal collision probabilities is introduced, effectively handling constraints from neighboring vehicles and obstacles at different JSTC-MPC stages. Furthermore, we propose a real-time replanning strategy that leverages chance-constrained, time-aware Voronoi spaces to address safety concerns in the presence of infeasible solutions. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through simulations and real-world experiments."

Various adaptive bitrate (ABR) algorithms have been proposed for video streaming. Buffer-based control-theoretic approaches for ABR control switch video bitrates in response to changing network conditions. However, the bitrate variations caused by frequent throughput variations can degrade the quality of experience (QoE). This study proposes a quantization scheme for buffer-based ABR control using a proportional-derivative controller for MPEG-DASH. The proposed scheme selects a quantized bitrate based on the output of the ABR controller, buffer level, its change, and throughput variation. In the quantization scheme, two kinds of algorithms are installed to detect throughput variation: Detection using one previous segment (PS1) and detection using three previous segments (PS3). The PS1 and PS3 algorithms are based on the variation in estimated throughput for a segment and three segments, respectively. Simulations confirm that the proposed scheme detects throughput variations earlier and more accurately than the conventional method and improves QoE."

    "abstract": "Split learning is a computing resource-friendly distributed learning framework that protects client training data by splitting the model between the client and server. Previous work has proved that split learning faces a severe risk of privacy leakage, as a malicious server can recover the client's private data by hijacking the training process. In this paper, we explore the vulnerability of split learning to server-side backdoor attacks, where our goal is to compromise the model's integrity. Since the server-side attacker cannot access the training data and client model in split learning, the traditional poisoning-based backdoor attack methods are no longer applicable. Therefore, constructing backdoor attacks in split learning poses significant challenges. Our strategy involves the attacker establishing a shadow model on the server side that can encode backdoor samples and guide the client model in learning from this model during the training process, thereby enabling the client to acquire the same capability. Based on these insights, we propose a backdoor attack framework named SFI. Our attack framework minimizes assumptions about the attacker's background knowledge and ensures that the attack remains imperceptible to the client. We implement SFI on various benchmark datasets, and extensive experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness and generality."

Firstly, to ensure the security and randomness of the keys in the scheme, a new 4D-YG hyperchaotic key generator is designed. Secondly, self-expanding fractal Sierpinski triangle permutating operation is performed on medical images to achieve image decentring effect. Utilize a custom Order-Preserving Encryption (OPE) algorithm to diffuse it, ensuring consistency in pixel order before and after encryption. Subsequently, mix-bit triple normalized diffusion is performed on the images that have completed preliminary diffusion to enhance the resistance of privacy data within the image to attacks. Finally, the decryption permission for encrypted shared medical data is restricted through smart contracts in the blockchain. While achieving secure transmission of medical data, it enables hospitals to perform medical image segmentation and organ recognition diagnostics on shared data in an encrypted state, which is more in line with practical needs. According to performance test data, the proposed encryption algorithm can effectively resist differential attacks and frequency attacks, and the Number of Pixels Change Rate (NPCR) test results can reach the ideal value of 99.6094%."

    "abstract": "Single Flux Quantum (SFQ) circuits provide ultrafast operation and low power consumption, making them attractive candidates for machine learning accelerators. The Tsetlin Machine (TM) is a low-complexity and highly interpretable architecture, organized as a voting system of propositional clauses. In the TM, an ensemble of finite-state automata (FSAs), called Tsetlin automata, independently decides whether to include or exclude specific literals. The chosen literals are assembled into propositional clauses that collectively form the voting system, while each FSA updates its state based on rewards or penalties determined by the prediction outcome. However, existing FSA designs for TM based on SFQ circuits still suffer from either a narrow margin or excessive circuit area. To achieve compact and stable state transitions using SFQ circuits, we designed High-Capacity Resettable D Flip-Flop (HC-RDFF) cells by cascading storage loops. The proposed FSA was implemented using two HC-RDFFs to store the include and exclude states, respectively. The FSA with 16 states requires only 395 Josephson junctions with a static power of approximately 128 μW, exhibiting a bias margin of −21% to +25% at low speed and a maximum operating frequency of 20 GHz in simulation. We fabricated the HC-RDFF and the FSA using a 10 kA/cm² Nb four-layer superconducting process and verified their correct operation through low-speed measurements. The number of FSA states can be increased simply by extending the cascaded storage loops in the HC-RDFFs. We expect the proposed FSA to be suitable for constructing stable TM systems based on SFQ circuits with reduced hardware costs."

In set-membership filtering, the initial state, process noise, and measurement noise are usually considered bounded (modeled as compact sets), which allows us to achieve target tracking by propagating the sets containing the target state. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed method, even when the shape of the group target has a tendency to spread."

    "abstract": "Many business processes involve complex, partly automated workflows, with limited timestamp data in the process event log. Sparse event logs limit the opportunity for process analysis and optimization. This paper describes the use of Discrete Event Simulation (DES) to model such processes and to augment sparse event logs with richer, synthetic data, enabling the application of process mining techniques for process enhancement. The approach is illustrated by application to an administrative process in an academic institution, namely an assessment extension request process. The study combines data-driven and knowledge-based approaches to understanding and modeling the existing process. Preliminary data analysis is used to obtain high-level process insights. The paper shows how this lays the foundation for the use of domain knowledge to construct and verify a discrete event simulation model. By integrating process mining with simulation, research can provide actionable insights to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the current assessment extension request process. Observations are made on how this approach can be applied to other business processes with sparse event logs."

By using evolutionary algorithms, candidate solutions for nanorobots with specific functions are automatically designed with a computer, where the biological gradient field (BGF) induced by tumor lesions provides auxiliary knowledge for the design of the morphology, function, and adaptive behavior of nanorobots in complex biological environments. Traditional robot design methods separate the design of robotic structure and control system, leading to limitations in adaptability and scalability. To tackle this problem, we adopt a ‘de novo design’ research paradigm, discovering and optimizing efficient robot structures and behaviors by simulating the process of natural selection, and uses BGF to dynamically guide the evolutionary process by embedding environmental feedback into genetic coding as auxiliary information. Furthermore, to enhance the generalizability of BGF, we employ a multi-physics field model for simulation modeling. Computer simulation experimental results validate the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed method for nanorobotic design."

Early diagnosis is essential, offering the potential to extend life expectancy by over 50% and reduce healthcare costs by up to $150,000 per patient. Dual-task (DT) testing—evaluating motor performance under cognitive load—has emerged as a promising, non-invasive method for early ADRD detection. This review provides a comprehensive synthesis of DT-based ADRD assessments from January 2010 to October 2025, integrating insights from engineering and clinical neuroscience. We explore a broad range of DT paradigms (e.g., gait, balance, upperlimb function), sensing technologies (e.g., wearable sensors, electronic walkways, infrared/depth cameras, video, tablets, and brain imaging tools like fMRI and fNIRS), and analytic approaches, from traditional statistics to deep learning. Emerging tools, including eye-tracking and AI-based video pose estimation, are also discussed. We critically examine methodological trends, highlight key findings, and identify current limitations. Emphasizing the need for equitable, scalable, and clinically viable DT systems, this review highlights the role of modern sensor and AI technologies in enhancing early ADRD detection. It serves as a key resource for engineers, data scientists, and clinicians developing technology-driven tools for early detection and monitoring of neurodegenerative diseases."

    "abstract": "With the increasing application of Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) in intelligent manufacturing, an increasing number of smart workshops rely on AGV systems for material handling and distribution. However, traditional AGV scheduling methods, often based on fixed rules or heuristic algorithms, struggle to adapt effectively to real-world scenarios involving multiple tasks and dynamically complex environments. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an improved AGV material distribution algorithm based on Graph Neural Networks (GNN). The proposed approach models the workshop environment as a graph structure and utilizes Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) to deeply extract features from nodes and paths, enabling task node probability prediction and route smoothness scoring. Based on this, a multi-AGV collision-free path planning and conflict avoidance mechanism is designed, taking into account both static priorities and dynamic operational states. This allows for reasonable task sequencing and assignment, ensuring real-time path planning and efficient execution during multi-vehicle collaboration. Simulation experiments under various dynamic multi-task scenarios demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms traditional approaches in task completion efficiency, providing a practical and scalable solution for intelligent workshop scheduling."

This paper addresses that need by providing a comprehensive benchmark of deep learning models for automated vehicle exterior damage identification, focusing on two critical tasks: vehicle region segmentation and damage detection. For segmentation, the following models were evaluated: YOLOv8, RTMDet, Mask-RCNN, Mask2Former, Mask-DINO, and QueryInst, assessing precision, recall, mAP, and inference time. The findings revealed that transformer-based models, Mask2Former (84.8% mAP50) and Mask-DINO (88.6% mAP50), achieved notable segmentation performance. However, YOLOv8 (up to 88.9% mAP50) demonstrated the best balance between performance metrics and speed. For damage detection, models from the YOLO family, RTMDet, RT-DETR, DINO, and YOLO-NAS were benchmarked. Performance in this more challenging task was notably lower, with RT-DETR (L) achieving the highest mAP50. These results highlight the challenges affecting model per-formance, including class imbalances and variability in damage representation. Thus, this study provides important insights into the limitations and potential of current deep learning models when applied to a publicly available dataset, supporting the development of next-generation solutions for vehicle damage assessment."

Adjacent Frame Extraction Process (AFEP) is proposed to select the adjacent frame. Then, Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) is applied to each embedding frame and its adjacent frame to extract their corresponding frequency domain coefficients. To improve robustness, midfrequency DCT coefficients are selected to embed multiwatermarks. For enhancing embedding capacity, randomly generated vectors are transformed into orthogonal unit vectors using Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization. By projecting each interframe difference coefficient onto orthogonal vectors, multiwatermarks are embedded in parallel by adjusting the projections into a predefined range. Experimental results show that, compared to existing schemes, the proposed scheme generally offers superior imperceptibility and robustness."

Specifically, first, we process the image with different convolution kernels to obtain multiscale features, and then fuse these features to acquire more abundant information. Subsequently, we design a median attention module to balance color and improve details, incorporating pixel attention and channel attention. To enhance feature extraction, we introduce median pooling within the median attention module. Finally, qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that our method outperforms other methods in both dehazing for highway scenes and underwater image enhancement."

Together with European partners the Ethiopian UASs are trying to learn what it means to be staff (academic or administrative) of an UAS. The research question works on “How to qualify lecturers for the future - the unknown?” It is of special interest, whether the ongoing up-skilling and re-skilling projects have a certain focus on the future as described by A. Toffler. This research checks in a first step A. Toffler's vision on ‘Education in the Future Tense’ against the two ongoing Erasmus+ capacity building higher education projects in order to find out whether the ongoing projects meet the requirements as set out in the book ‘Future Shock’ published in 1970. The literature review presents a brief summary of the book's chapter on education. Followed by an insight of the two projects and the clarification of the important terms of uncertainty-future-futureness. The discussion brings light on what has been or has not been considered in the ongoing projects. A comparison of Bloom's Taxonomy with the Ahvenainen's futureness approach will demonstrate how academic staff could/should be trained to gain interest in playing with uncertainty for the sake of preparing students for the unknown future."

Using satellite images from IKONOS, PLEIADES, QuickBird, and WorldView, we employ evaluation metrics including the Spatial Correlation Coefficient (SCC), Correlation Coefficient (CC), and Quality Noise Ratio (QNR) to assess the performance of each method. The results indicate that while traditional IHS provides acceptable spatial enhancement, it suffers from notable spectral distortions. In contrast, both FIHS and FIHS-SA demonstrate improved spectral fidelity, with FIHS-SA exhibiting superior performance across all tested images.

The system integrates a custom-built ionization tube with a low-noise analog front-end, precision digital processing, and a power-efficient embedded platform. At its core is a transimpedance amplifier (TIA) based on an electrometergrade op-amp (ADA4530-1), enabling accurate conversion of ionization currents in the femtoampere range. A dual-path amplification architecture ensures dynamic range adaptability across low and high dose rate conditions. The digital subsystem— featuring a 16-bit Sigma-Delta ADC-equipped STM32 microcontroller—handles real-time digitization, temperature compensation, and self-adjustment offset via integrated DACs. The device was calibrated and tested at the Secondary Standard Dosimetry Laboratory (SSDL) of the Turkish Nuclear Energy Research Institute (TENMAK), covering a wide radiation range from 3 μSv/h to 60 mSv/h using multiple <sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">137</sup>Cs sources. The system demonstrated excellent linearity (R² > 0.998), with a minimum detectable dose rate of approximately 2 μSv/h, and maintained a total measurement error below 10%. These results affirm the device’s suitability for portable, high-precision radiation monitoring in field and safety applications. The novelty of this work lies in the integration of a high-pressure argon ionization chamber with a dual-path femtoampere readout front-end and a fully self-adjusting digital control unit, enabling portable, low-dose-rate detection below 3 μSv/h."

    "abstract": "Transformer-based object detectors have demonstrated substantial potential across a wide range of computer vision tasks, including object detection in Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images. However, these models are often plagued by high computational costs, rendering them impractical for realtime applications. To tackle this issue, knowledge distillation (KD) has been introduced to transfer knowledge from a large teacher model to a smaller student model. In this paper, we propose a novel knowledge distillation framework for RT-DETR, a state-of-the-art object detector, and also tailored for SAR images. Our method involves layer-by-layer distillation between RT-DETR networks of varying parameter sizes and introduces two aspects of improvements: Adaptive Queries Alignment and Teacher Scoring Mechanism. The former is used to guide distillation matching more quickly, while the latter improves distillation performance without introducing additional parameters. We evaluated our approach on the OGSOD-1.0 SAR dataset using RT-DETR with ResNet-18, ResNet-50, and ResNet-101 as the backbones. The corresponding parameter sizes are $20.1 \\mathrm{M}, 42.7 \\mathrm{M}$, and 76.8 M, respectively. The results show that after distilling RT-DETR with ResNet-101 to that with ResNet-18 as the backbone, the student model achieves 1.8 mAP improvement compared to the original student model, with only 26.1% of the teacher model’s parameters. This distillation method reduces computational costs and parameter sizes while enhancing detection performance."

    "abstract": "Accurate segmentation in medical images remains a challenging task due to the intricate anatomical structures, ambiguous boundaries, and limited labeled data typically available in clinical scenarios. U-shaped encoder-decoder architectures, such as U-Net and its variants, have become the de facto standard in medical image segmentation owing to their ability to fuse multi-scale features through skip connections. However, conventional training strategies often rely solely on supervision at the final output layer, leaving rich intermediate representations underutilized and lacking explicit consistency constraints across different decoding stages. In this paper, we propose Structurally Consistent Multi-Stage Learning (SCMSL), a simple yet effective training framework designed to improve segmentation quality by enhancing supervision and structural coherence across multiple decoder stages. SCMSL incorporates two key components: (1) multi-stage supervision, which introduces segmentation losses at various decoder stages to guide hierarchical feature refinement throughout the network; and (2) a novel Gram Matrix Loss that measures the similarity between the structural representations of outputs from different stages. By capturing second-order feature correlations, this loss encourages the network to produce consistent and anatomically plausible predictions across scales. Our method is model-agnostic and introduces no additional inference-time complexity, making it easy to plug into existing segmentation architectures. We validate SCMSL on two widely used benchmarks-Synapse multi-organ CT dataset and ACDC cardiac MRI dataset. Experimental results show that SCMSL significantly improves segmentation accuracy and boundary smoothness over strong baselines, confirming the effectiveness and generalizability of our approach."

In this paper, we propose a novel Traffic-Aware Adaptive Restricted Access Window (TARA-RAW) slot allocation scheme tailored for IEEE 802.11ah networks. The proposed method employs fuzzy logic to intelligently classify devices into groups based on dynamic transmission parameters such as data volume, transmission frequency, and latency requirements. Each group is then allocated an adaptable number of RAW slots, which are dynamically adjusted according to real-time traffic patterns and network load. To validate the effectiveness of TARA, we develop both an analytical model and a simulation framework to evaluate key performance metrics including throughput and energy consumption. Results demonstrate that the TARA scheme outperforms traditional uniform grouping approaches, achieving higher throughput and lower energy expenditure, thereby making it highly suitable for large-scale and diverse IoT deployments."

In the context of extended target tracking, the measurement-to-target association is unknown and evolves over time. To dynamically capture this evolution, an association-based NHPP (AbNHPP) Bayesian tracking framework integrating the target’s association variables and its Poisson measurement rate is derived. To more flexibly model the target’s Poisson measurement rate and ensure the closed-form solution for the PHD filter, this paper adopts the following models: the target’s measurement rate is modeled as a Generalized Inverse Gaussian (GIG) distribution, the target’s kinematic state is modeled as a Gaussian distribution, and the target’s extension is modeled as an inverse-Wishart (IW) distribution. Specifically, the GIG distribution for measurement rate of extended targets is modeled as Time Independent Poisson Rate (TIPR). Simulation results validate the superiority and scalability of the proposed algorithm."

This work presents U2Sign, an open source framework for the automatic production of Pakistani Sign Language (PSL) from inputs of the Urdu natural language, addressing the communication needs of the Pakistani speech-impaired community. The system processes both spoken and written Urdu through a pipeline that includes Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), followed by Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques such as normalization, lemmatization, part-of-speech tagging, and rule-based word reordering to generate a sequence of glosses. These glosses are mapped to a custom-built PSL lexi-con, and missing entries are handled through fallback strategies. The gloss-to-pose module utilizes skeletal pose sequences extracted from annotated videos using MediaPipe, with gloss-aligned pose frames stitched together using temporal smoothing to generate coherent PSL animations. The final output is rendered as video through a web-based interface built with React.js and Flask, which supports real-time interaction. U2Sign is reproducible, extensible, and culturally relevant and holds significant promise for applications in education, healthcare, and public accessibility within Pakistan."

Existing models often overlook shallow features and effective label assignment, limiting detection accuracy. To address these limitations, a framework named Detail-enhanced and NWD-IoU-driven Small Object Detection Network (DNSODN) is proposed. The framework integrates a Detail-enhanced Feature Pyramid Network (DEFPN), which refines shallow feature representation through attention-based enhancement, and a Normalized Weighted Distance Intersection over Union (NWD-IoU) metric, which supports robust and discriminative label assignment. Experiments on the SODA and SODA-D datasets indicate that DNSODN consistently improves detection performance across different object scales, highlighting its effectiveness in small object detection under challenging environments."

While existing non-learning approaches offer efficiency, they lack flexibility. Conversely, deep learning methods, despite their adaptivity, suffer from ambiguous control and high model complexity. To address these limitations, our proposed method combines global Gamma correction with the Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) of the grayscale histogram, dynamically balancing global and local image information. The non-linear weighting scheme effectively enhances dark details while suppressing overexposure, mitigating common artifacts such as over-enhancement. Its explicit formulation facilitates integration into Image Signal Processor (ISP) systems and offers differentiability, enabling parameter optimization through various search strategies for diverse image processing tasks. Experimental results demonstrate the method’s capability for high-quality enhancement across a range of visual quality requirements."

    "abstract": "A high fidelity dynamic model is constructed to address the nonlinearity, parameter uncertainty, and external disturbances in mechatronic servo systems. A self disturbance rejection control strategy combining proportional integral derivative and extended state observer is proposed. The dynamic model comprehensively considers the electrical characteristics of the motor, shaft stiffness, and rotational inertia parameters, as well as key nonlinear factors such as dead zone saturation, friction, and gear backlash. The self disturbance rejection control strategy of the servo system achieves high-precision and robust adaptive control of the servo system by real-time estimation and compensation of the total system disturbance. The simulation findings denote that when the output shaft stiffness increases from 50% to 200%, the first-order resonant frequency of the system increases from 562rad/s to 1687rad/s, with a peak amplitude of 12.61dB. At a tooth gap of 0.05, the proposed control strategy reduces the tracking error to 0.039°, which is better than the traditional control strategy of 0.051°. Under external wind speed interference, the proposed control strategy exhibits superior disturbance resistance and robustness, with pitch angle control accuracy maintained above 42.88° at different wind speeds, significantly better than traditional control methods. The findings denote that the established model can accurately characterize the dynamic characteristics of the system, and the designed control strategy greatly enhances the tracking accuracy and anti-interference ability of the system, providing theoretical support and solutions for the design and control of high-performance servo systems."

    "abstract": "Bus electrification is a key trend in the global evolution of public transportation systems. However, replacing diesel buses (DBs) with Battery electric buses (BEBs) is a long-term process, where the limited driving range and prolonged charging times might necessitate a larger BEB fleet to maintain trip services compared to the replaced DB fleet. To quantify this fleet expansion across variable replacement decisions, we introduce the fleet increment curve (FIC), a novel conceptual idea that guides BEB procurement decisions during the transition to the zero-emission bus (ZEB) system. First, the FIC is derived from solving a series of mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) (namely MILP-FIC model) by varying the replaced DB fleet as inputs, where each MILP is developed by means of linearization techniques, while formulating the mixed-fleet operation under limited charging accessibility. To solve the MILP-FIC, Lagrangian relaxation (LR) is applied to relax charging accessibility constraints, decomposing the problem into route-specific subproblems. Subsequently, representing FIC by-products as piecewise linear functions enables extended models developed for addressing long-term fleet replacement scheduling and charging resource allocation. A general fleet replacement scheduling is presented, which accommodates multiple BEB types (varying battery capacities and charging power) by deriving type-specific fleet procurement curves. We use real-world bus route data from Hong Kong to explore the FIC, revealing how route characteristics—such as trip frequency, trip duration, and energy consumption—interact with charging site characteristics (e.g., siting and sizing) to shape the FIC. The curves typically follow a non-decreasing trend, while an S-shaped trend occurs across certain routes. Additionally, the results demonstrate the effective incorporation of FIC into the planning for ZEB transition, providing valuable insights for bus operators."

Moreover, a comparative frequency-domain analysis quantitatively reveals the superior disturbance estimation and rejection capabilities of the CADRC.

    "abstract": "A beamforming-enabled blind navigation (BBN) receiver is developed. Unlike conventional opportunistic receivers, the BBN requires no prior knowledge of the reference signal structure. Moreover, unlike Doppler subspace-based blind receivers, which fail when there is not sufficient Doppler separation between sources, the BBN overcomes this limitation via beam forming, enabling effective spatial separation even when Doppler frequencies are closely spaced. The BBN operates in three stages: detection, acquisition, and tracking. In the detection stage, two sequential matched subspace-based detectors are developed to identify sources in the spatial domain and estimate their angles of-arrival (AOAs). A closed-form expression for the detection probability of the proposed detector is derived. Following AOA acquisition, beamforming is applied to mitigate multipath and interference from co-channel transmitters, ensuring that the estimated beacon corresponds solely to the desired source. Tracking loops are designed to refine and maintain AOAs, Doppler, and beacon estimates. Experimental results with real 5G signals on a ground vehicle show that the BBN receiver can detect two co-channel base stations (gNBs), one of which was otherwise undetectable with state-of-the-art blind receiver. Navigation observables extracted from the 5G gNBs via the BBN were used to estimate the vehicle's 408 m trajectory, achieving a position root mean squared error (RMSE) of 7.1 m, which is significantly lower than the 32.3 m achieved with state-of the-art blind receiver and the 11.7 m with the conventional opportunistic 5G navigation receiver. Experimental results are also presented using real digital television (DTV) signals collected on a ground vehicle in a multipath environment, marking the first demonstration of blind tracking with DTV signals and highlighting the signal-structure-agnostic nature of the proposed BBN receiver."

Due to the growth of signal complexity in digitally modulated schemes like M-ary Frequency Shift Keying (MFSK), M-ary Phase Shift Keying (MPSK), and M-ary Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (MQAM), more tenacious models need to be fit into a classification process. Classically, Maximum Likelihood (ML), Wavelet Transform (WT), and Higher-Order Statistical (HOS) features have traditionally been employed to make estimations toward AMR. However, these approaches usually suffer from some serious drawbacks, such as high computational complexity, poor adaptability to noise, and degraded performance in dynamic wireless environments. In this context, an enhanced machine learning-based automatic modulation recognition (EML-AMR) model is proposed, empowered by advanced feature extraction and deep learning-based classifiers. Our work proposes a hybrid convolutional neural network and long short-term memory (CNN-LSTM) network that improves modulation recognition by efficiently learning time-frequency characteristics. It remarkably improves the accuracy, speeds up the process, and it is robust against noise. Experimental analysis demonstrates that the EML-AMR model is far better than traditional methods by improving the classification accuracy by 0.17%, reducing the computational complexity by 0.22%, and improving the real-time signal detection efficiency by 0.15%. Such advances make the proposed model highly suitable for practical applications in spectrum monitoring, military communications, and intelligent signal processing."

Using a behavioral experiment with 250 participants on a simulated e‑commerce platform featuring blockchain only, AI only, or their combination while searching for returned product‑logistics information. Two dimensions of consumer outputs were assessed: perceptual outcomes—attitude toward the firm and repurchase intention—and experiential outcomes—task completion time and accuracy. Results indicate a clear perceptual complementarity. Integrating blockchain's verifiable transparency with AI‑driven personalization significantly strengthened consumer sustainability perceptions and willingness to repurchase relative to single‑technology conditions. Differently, experiential effects diverged. Combining both technologies increased task completion time, and did not significantly improve accuracy, revealing performance substitutability rather than synergy. These findings refine complementarity theory by demonstrating that a technology bundle can simultaneously yield positive perceptual spillovers and negative experiential trade‑offs. Retailers are therefore advised to adopt the blockchain–AI pairing when strategic objectives center on trust and brand perceptions but to simplify the interface when operational speed is important. Robustness checks were completed to further establish rigor in the results. Our study also provides actionable insights for managers, emphasizing the prioritization of technology adoption, the importance of bundling blockchain with AI, and the differentiation between perceptual and experiential synergies to maximize consumer value in retail operations."

    "abstract": "In radar track initiation and tracking, clutter causes massive false tracks, as the system misidentifies clutter signals as targets. Excessive false tracks degrade system accuracy and reliability, making accurate clutter identification critical. Traditional evaluation methods relying on numerical calculations or threshold settings fail in cluttered complex scenarios with poor environmental adaptability. To address this, this paper proposes a reinforcement learning - based track quality evaluation method, comprising a radar video - input evaluation model and reinforcement learning. The model takes multi - cycle radar video, uses CNN to extract spatiotemporal features, and outputs track quality variations. Reinforcement learning trains the model to adaptively adjust each track’s quality, solving the difficulty in accurately dividing true track quality values. Experiments show the model effectively evaluates track quality and suppresses false tracks during initiation and tracking."

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the detection and tracking performance of the weak airborne target in over-the-horizon (OTH) radar during extended coherent integration time (CIT), especially the critical challenge of range walk migration (RWM) in performance. To address the significant performance degradation caused by RWM, two novel track-before-detection (TBD) methods are proposed that synergistically combine coherent and noncoherent integration approaches. Firstly, the prior kinematic constraints (KC) is utilized to divide echo data into virtual frames containing coherent pulses, and then RWM correction is performed based on the maximum one-range-cell movement constraint through range-domain pulse circular shifting (CS). For scenarios where precise range cell migration is unknown, the segmented Keystone transform (SK) is proposed to correct the RWM. Both methods perform moving targets detection (MTD) processing within frame to achieve coherent integration and incorporate dynamic programming-TBD (DP-TBD) across frames for robust noncoherent integration. Simulation results show that both methods can effectively enhance the target detection and tracking capability, which is better than the conventional competitors."

However, existing PDE solvers often lack interpretability and are restricted to solving individual equations separately, making them inefficient for real-world applications that require simultaneous solutions of multiple structurally similar PDEs. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a multitask symbolic regression approach that leverages the underlying similarity in the solution spaces of structurally identical but parametrically different PDEs. The proposed method not only ensures interpretability but also accelerates the simultaneous solution of multiple PDEs by leveraging latent similarities among them. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the method not only achieves better accuracy than baselines on representative PDE benchmarks but also offers substantial improvements in computational efficiency."

    "abstract": "As cyber threats continue to evolve in sophistication and scale, the need for robust and adaptive security mechanisms becomes increasingly critical, particularly for critical infrastructures such as ATM networks. This research explores innovative methodologies for detecting and mitigating cyber-attacks through the use of network motif discovery and machine learning (ML) techniques. The study focuses on applying graph-based algorithms to identify recurrent subgraph patterns (motifs) in network traffic, enabling the detection of novel attack behaviors. To address the challenge of class imbalance in network traffic data, the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) is employed to generate synthetic samples for underrepresented attack classes, thereby improving classifier performance. Additionally, a novel hybrid approach that combines whitelisting and blacklisting strategies is proposed for effective attack mitigation. The proposed methodology is evaluated using real-world network traffic data, with performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC AUC to assess the system's effectiveness. The results reveal that the model achieves a perfect accuracy of 1.00, with precision, recall, and F1-scores of 1.00 for both normal and attack traffic. The confusion matrix confirms zero false positives and false negatives, while the hybrid whitelisting/blacklisting strategy enhances the system's robustness in real-time attack detection and mitigation. This research contributes to the field of cybersecurity by providing a scalable and adaptive solution for real-time attack detection in dynamic network environments, offering substantial potential for securing critical infrastructure systems such as ATMs."

    "abstract": "SiC MOSFETs are expected to be exposed to irradiation when applied in harsh environments such as space. Therefore, it is important to understand the ionization radiation effects on the short-circuit (SC) reliability of SiC MOSFETs. In this work, the degradation modes and degradation mechanisms in the atomic scale of Gamma-irradiated SiC MOSFETS under repetitive short-circuit stress are investigated. Compared to single-stress scenarios, the synergistic effect of irradiation and short-circuit stress significantly accelerates the negative shift of threshold voltage of irradiated devices and thus results in the degradations of switching performances. The cyclic SC stress results in the dominate hole trapping in the oxide over the annealing of active oxide defects from the self-heating. The Electro-thermal simulations and Hybrid-functional density functional theory (DFT) calculations are performed and demonstrate that the hole injection into the oxide and the subsequent hole trapping by electrically active oxygen vacancies (VO) are main cause for the enhanced formation of positively charged oxide-trap after irradiation and SC stress, where the irradiation and repetitive SC stress promote the structural transformation of VO and hole trapping of VO by overcoming the thermal barrier, respectively."

By listening to natural and anthropogenic sounds one can learn about the presence of certain species, ecosystem changes and the impact of human-related activities. Listening to the ocean is a cost-intensive task in terms of equipment, logistics and human resources. The status quo is still based on recording equipment that is deployed for several months, with data recovery only at the end. If the equipment remains functional and is successfully retrieved, operators are faced with large volumes of audio data, typically analysed on a few research goals. Much of this analysis still relies on manual review. To reduce the effort and uncertainties associated with such activities and providing a more holistic approach to this topic, the Hydrotwin technology has been developed. Powered with Artificial Intelligence-based software and optimised for real-time performance, Hydrotwin Intelligence can completely automate the analysis of acoustic data. Analysis results are stored in the cloud and presented to stakeholders in a data-rich dashboard. While hardware-agnostic, Hydrotwin also offers its own acoustic recorders that are powered by Hydrotwin Intelligence, HT-S and HT-C. This technology enables continuous and autonomous detection and geolocation of biological and anthropogenic sound sources. Integrated with acoustic virtual models, produced with RAINDROP, Hydrotwin offers a holistic Digital Twin of the Ocean that can be used for the monitoring and management of offshore assets and operations."

Both synaptic and neuronal behaviors are modeled using SPICE-level analog memristors, and the network is trained end-to-end using backpropagation through time (BPTT) in a differentiable framework. This approach eliminates the need for digital interfacing circuits such as ADCs or explicit comparators, supporting compact and efficient hardware deployment. Evaluations on the MNIST and DVS128 Gesture datasets show competitive accuracy and significantly improved robustness to hardware faults, such as stuck-at errors in RRAM cells. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of spatiotemporally heterogeneous MSNNs for scalable, reliable neuromorphic computing."

    "abstract": "Printed memristors offer a pathway to low-cost, flexible neuromorphic hardware, but their variability and filamentary switching pose challenges for fast, accurate device modeling. We introduce a Physics-Regularized Neural Surrogate (PRNS) for printed memristors, combining data-driven learning with physics-based regularization terms (masked Ohmic/Space-Charge Limited Current (SCLC) constraints and Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) consistency). While classical Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) enforce governing equations through differentiable Partial Differential Equation (PDE)/ODE residuals, here physical relations act as regularization rather than hard constraints. The model embeds Ohmic conduction, SCLC, and interfacial transport equations into network training while explicitly handling device-to-device variability via parameter perturbation and noise injection. We validate the approach on a literature-calibrated synthetic dataset representative of flexographically printed Ag/PMMA:PVA/ITO devices, achieving relative Root Mean Square Error (RRMSE) of 0.0633 versus 0.2730 for the Voltage-ThrEshold Adaptive Memristor (VTEAM) model (4.31× improvement). Cross-validation yields RRMSE 0.115 ± 0.062, with stability under 10% added noise. Extended validation across digitized I-V curves from three printed memristor technologies (inkjet-printed IGZO, aerosol-jet MoS₂, paper-based MoS₂/graphene) demonstrates competitive or superior accuracy versus VTEAM, Yakopcic, Stanford-PKU, and MMS models. Supplementary experiments (15 tests) confirm comprehensive reliability modeling including temperature-dependent retention (activation energy Eₐ = 0.379 eV), endurance degradation (660-cycle lifetime), and electro-thermal coupling effects. Circuit integration via one-transistor-one-resistor (1T1R) memory cell simulation shows 29% lower write energy (94.2 pJ vs. 133.6 pJ) with gradual analog switching. The formulation supports SPICE-compatible lookup table (LUT)/behavioral export; all code and datasets are released openly for reproducibility."

To solve these problems, this paper proposes an unsupervised detection method based on the framework of autoencoding Vision Transformer (AE-ViT). The signals from target background are used for training, aiming at the reconstruction; in the detection stage, the LPI signals can be detected for high reconstruction error.

    "abstract": "Sub-terahertz (sub-THz) radar enables high-resolution and highly detailed imaging of space objects, offering substantial advantages for space domain awareness (SDA). Accurate estimation of spin motion and three-dimensional (3D) geometry of non-cooperative space targets is essential for SDA tasks such as target characterization, autonomous rendezvous and proximity operation (RPO), and debris removal. Interferometric ISAR (InISAR), which generates 3D images in the form of point clouds, can also resolve the effective rotation vector—defined as the component of the total rotation vector perpendicular to the line of sight (LOS). This component is critical for 2D image scaling and for enhancing understanding of the imaging projection plane (IPP). However, the component along the LOS remains unknown, which limits the ability to fully exploit multi-perspective ISAR imaging to characterize targets. In this paper, a novel spin estimation framework is proposed based on multi-perspective InISAR, which leverages viewing angle diversity during on-orbit observation to resolve the total rotation vector of space targets. The proposed method performs InISAR imaging and the estimation of the effective rotation vector for each perspective, followed by the combination of effective rotation vectors to determine the total rotation vector as a unified least-squares solution. The framework requires no prior 3D model and achieves robust spin estimation. Both simulation experiments using sub-THz radar parameters and laboratory validation using W-band radar are carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, demonstrating its potential for future SDA and on-orbit servicing applications."

    "abstract": "Sustainable urban mobility, promoted by shared vehicles, has gained attention as a solution to reduce carbon emissions and facilitate transportation in cities. However, man-aging these vehicles presents challenges, such as internal damage caused by vandalism or improper use. This study evaluates the effectiveness of different Artificial Intelligence (AI) approaches for automatic interior damage detection in shared vehicles, considering their specific characteristics, such as compact and urban-oriented designs. The research also investigates whether the public dataset used, consisting of images of vehicle interiors with and without damage, is suitable for this scenario, given that shared vehicles may differ from conventional cars. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) approaches, such as YOLOv5, YOLOv7, YOLOv8, YOLOv10 and RTMDet, as well as transformer-based models like RT-DETR and Dino, and hybrid approaches incorporating attention mechanisms, such as YOLO-NAS, were analyzed. The key question is whether damage detection in shared vehicles can generalize to highly variable images in this dataset. The diversity of vehicle interiors, including differences in materials, lighting conditions, and structural configurations, presents a significant challenge for AI. Ensuring accurate damage detection despite this variability is crucial for practical applications. Therefore, it is essential to assess not only model accuracy but also their ability to generalize to new vehicle configurations not represented in the dataset. Furthermore, this study provides insights into the necessary next steps for developing a robust and effective damage detection service, contributing to better management and maintenance of shared vehicle fleets."

The proposed method utilizes DWT to perform multiscale decomposition of radar waveforms, embeds QPSK-modulated communication watermarks into highfrequency wavelet coefficients, and thereby achieves covert information modulation while preserving radar detection performance. Simulation results demonstrate that compared to discrete Fourier transform (DFT)-based watermarking methods, the proposed method achieves a lower bit error rate (BER).

Therefore, this paper constructs a variant of BLS based on adaptive robust kernel (ARBLS) to improve the generalization performance of the model in non-Gaussian noise environment. Adaptive robust kernel function is a general loss function that includes many common Mestimator paradigms. By alternately optimizing model weights and adaptive robust kernel parameters, AR-BLS realizes the adaptive adjustment of model robustness under different outlier noise distributions without human intervention.

    "abstract": "While deep learning-based computer-aided diagnosis (DL-CAD) model can identify mental disorders from neuroimages, its need for vast, private data creates a roadblock. Federated Learning (FL) solves the data access problem by enabling privacy-preserving collaboration, but it introduces a critical vulnerability that noisy labels from local clients can corrupt the global model. We develop a noise-resilient FL framework with robust local training, dubbed NRFL, to explicitly tackle noisy labels in FL for MRI-based mental disorder diagnosis. Within NRFL, a divide-and-conquer noisy label compensation approach is developed on the client side to mitigate the negative effects of noisy labels by combining the global knowledge. Subsequently, we utilize the FedAVG to aggregate the uploaded local model parameters on the server side. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that NRFL attains competitive results on the ABIDE-I and the ADHD-200 datasets under <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{1 0 \\%}$</tex> noise."

The objective is to produce an affordable and practical technology for live reporting of dolphin presence, via underwater acoustic communication or terrestrial/satellite radio link, to support mitigation of impact of offshore construction and fishing activity, as well as data for marine science. Highly computationally efficient algorithms were developed and validated by offline processing of acoustic recordings from the UK waters, annotated by expert bioacousticians. Accuracy of 98.3% and 99.7% was achieved for click and whistle detection respectively, with zero false positives. These algorithms have been successfully ported onto a proven ARM Cortex M4 based embedded processor platform, with a mean power consumption of only 12 mW, and tested by playback of the above recorded data. This has proven the feasibility of this approach and a full prototype system is being prepared for deployment in the sea trials at the time of writing."

Although many methods, such as Virtual Reference Feedback Tuning (VRFT), have been proposed as a solution for this problem, they are nonconvex in general, i.e., convex only under the assumption on the structure of the feedback controller. This paper introduces a new method, named Factorized-VRFT (F-VRFT), as a solution for the above problem, where the cost function is convex for any linear controller. In particular, the cost function of F-VRFT is quadratic; thus, the optimal parameter is available explicitly. Furthermore, by leveraging this property, we show that the method can be easily extended to adaptive model matching. The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated through experiments with a practical motor"

Current methods often adapt pre-trained 2D image editors to multi-view observations, using specific strategies to combine information across views. However, these approaches still struggle with ensuring consistency across views, as they lack precise control over the sharing of information, resulting in edits with insufficient visual changes and blurry details. In this paper, we propose CoreEditor, a novel framework for consistent text-to-3D editing. At the core of our approach is a novel correspondence-constrained attention mechanism, which enforces structured interactions between corresponding pixels that are expected to remain visually consistent during the diffusion denoising process. Unlike conventional wisdom that relies solely on scene geometry, we enhance the correspondence by incorporating semantic similarity derived from the diffusion denoising process. This combined support from both geometry and semantics ensures a robust multi-view editing process. Additionally, we introduce a selective editing pipeline that enables users to choose their preferred edits from multiple candidates, creating a more flexible and user-centered 3D editing process. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of CoreEditor, showing its ability to generate high-quality 3D edits, significantly outperforming existing methods."

    "abstract": "The incorporation of Machine Learning (ML) with gas sensing has brought a revolution in the field by greatly improving the sensing performance, detection accuracy and selectivity. Traditional gas sensors are typically limited by issues that include cross-sensitivity, drift, and environmental fluctuations, which affect their performance. This review investigates how these limitations have been countered using data and advanced algorithmic features in ML. The use of ML in gas sensing mainly involves important steps such as feature extraction and selection, as well as a variety of superior models like Support Vector Machine (SVM), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Random Forest (RF). These methodologies enable proper categorization of the types of gases involved, as well as qualitative regression for concentration estimation. The E-nose systems, which integrate gas sensors arrays with machine learning algorithms, are particularly noteworthy due to their ability to mimic the human olfactory system. This combination enables the detection and classification of complex gas mixtures with high accuracy, enhanced selectivity, and robustness against environmental variations—capabilities that conventional single-sensor systems often lack. These applications are most well-known in the fields of food quality inspection, disease detection, and environmental monitoring. Despite recent progress, there are gaps regarding systematic insights about mathematical algorithms, optimization of the gas sensors, and real-world applications of ML in the field of gas sensing. This study reveals that, by overcoming the current problems and proposing future research directions, this work greatly promotes the role of ML in improving the gas sensing technologies to build highly selective, sensitive, and robust sensing systems for various complicated, realistic applications."

    "abstract": "Single-crystal sapphire optical fibers have emerged as promising candidates for sensing in extreme environments where conventional silica fibers fail, owing to their exceptional thermal stability, high mechanical strength, and broad optical transparency up to ∼2040 °C. Recent progress has extended sapphire fiber sensing into diverse domains, including temperature, pressure, strain, and chemical detection, yet significant challenges remain, particularly the highly multimode nature of these fibers and the absence of a robust cladding suitable for harsh conditions. This review provides a comprehensive overview of recent advances in sapphire fiber–based sensing technologies, with a primary focus on interferometric configurations and sapphire fiber Bragg grating–based sensors, while also briefly discussing emerging approaches such as distributed Raman and evanescent-field–based sensing. Special emphasis is placed on innovative optical cladding strategies, including spinel and ceramic coatings, ion implantation, nanoporous structures, and advanced oxide systems, which are evaluated in terms of thermal stability, refractive index compatibility, and fabrication scalability. Key challenges such as strain sensing at ultra-high temperatures, long-term stability, and reliable integration are critically examined. The review concludes by outlining future research directions focused on developing durable cladding systems, refining fabrication methods, and integrating hybrid sensing modalities to enable deployable sapphire fiber sensors for aerospace, energy, and industrial applications in extreme environments. The objective is to consolidate current knowledge and guide ongoing efforts to realize deployable sapphire fiber sensors for harsh environments."

The regenerative construction is utilized to estimate the transformer under test, which is back-to-back connected to another transformer with the same turns ratio, enabling the usage of identical power converters on both sides. Accordingly, the proposed testbed uses two H-bridge converters fed by a common 50 V DC source and operated at a switching frequency of 20 kHz to feed two back-to-back connected transformers with a turns ratio of 1:7.8. With the help of power regeneration, the DC source needs only to cover the power loss rather than the power rating, thus reducing the burden of experimental equipment. However, the preliminary test results reveal two key issues that influence the measurement. To identify the root causes, theoretical discussions are conducted, and potential solutions are proposed in response to these two problems. The simulated waveforms are also provided and performed well in accordance with the experimental waveforms, and the iron loss measurement results are finally summarized to highlight that the developed system performs comparably to the actual DAB converter system. The proposed testbed is thus expected to be of practical value for transformer manufacturers to preliminarily measure the total iron loss of a DAB converter."

    "abstract": "With the rapid deployment of edge devices, there has been growing concern over the privacy preservation of clients’ private data. Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising solution that enables edge devices for collaborative model training without compromising data privacy, as the local datasets of clients are not shared directly. However, previous works have shown that the performance of conventional FL approaches significantly deteriorates when the data distributions across clients are heterogeneous or non-IID. Integrating personalization into FL addresses these challenges by adapting the global model to local data distributions, but existing personalized FL (PFL) frameworks often fail to generalize when clients’ datasets have cross-domain features. One approach to mitigate this challenge is partial model initialization, where to update clients’ local model only a subset of model parameters are initialized from the global model while retaining local parameters. However, obtaining effective generalization across distinct data distributions remains a challenge. In such instances, meta-learning is preferred as it provides the adaptation of a global model across distinct data distributions and tasks by employing only a small number of data samples. In this paper, we propose MetaPartialFL, a novel framework that integrates meta-learning with partial model initialization to address cross-domain personalization and heterogeneity in FL. The approach partitions model parameters into shared global and client-specific local components, enabling effective generalization across clients while maintaining adaptability to each client’s datasets. Extensive evaluations on cross-domain benchmark datasets, such as Office-Home, Office-31, PACS, and DomainNet, demonstrate that MetaPartialFL outperforms state-of-the-art methods, making it a robust and efficient solution for cross-domain FL applications."

While existing methods have successfully utilized network topology and node attributes for community detection, they often overlook two key challenges: (1) the importance of higher-order structures such as motifs, and (2) the limited discriminability between topological and attribute information. To address these limitations, we propose MIMA (Community detection based on Multi-Information Fusion of Motifs and Attributes), a novel community detection method that integrates multi-information sources. MIMA first constructs three distinct layers—the original topology layer, motif topology layer, and attribute layer—to capture low-order topology, higherorder topology, and node attribute information, respectively. These layers are then encoded using a graph variational autoencoder to generate more expressive node representations. Finally, the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) is introduced as a regularization constraint to enhance the independence between topological and attribute representations, thereby improving the robustness and accuracy of community detection. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of MIMA over state-of-the-art methods in attributed network community detection tasks."

The Multiple Sclerosis (MS) progression in patients was predicted using a range of machine learning models trained on clinical datasets. Five classifiers-CatBoost, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Gradient Boosting-were evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Among these, CatBoost emerged as the top-performing model, achieving 90% accuracy, 89% precision, 90 % recall, and an 89 % F1 score, reflecting strong generalization and balanced classification. Random Forest and Gradient Boosting also performed competitively, while SVM and Logistic Regression showed comparatively lower effectiveness. Confusion matrix analysis further confirmed CatBoost's superior predictive reliability with minimal misclassification.

The core innovation lies in decomposing the complex path-planning problem into manageable sub-problems through a redesigned evaluation function that optimizes key node selection. By implementing this divide-and-conquer approach with parallel processing capabilities, the method significantly enhances computational efficiency. The proposed approach integrates evolutionary mechanisms from genetic algorithms to further improve performance. Specifically, the method incorporates systematic redesigns of the coding scheme, the fitness function, the initial population generation strategy, and genetic operators, including selection, crossover, and mutation. Through iterative evolutionary updates, the population progressively converges toward globally optimal path solutions. Experimental validation demonstrates that the algorithm achieves substantial improvements in both optimization quality and computational efficiency, particularly when addressing largescale or complex path-planning tasks.

    "abstract": "Accurate depth maps are essential for indoor navigation and modeling by robots, but raw depth maps often have missing areas due to sensor limitations, environmental factors, and distance constraints. Existing methods that fuse RGB images with depth maps usually cannot utilize spatial structural information and exhibit poor accuracy at object edges. To bridge this gap, a dual-branch fusion network with Mamba decoder, called DBFNM, is proposed for depth completion in this work. It consists of two complementary branches: one branch utilizes semantic and texture information from RGB images as visual guidance, while the other extracts spatial geometric structures from normal maps as structural guidance. In particular, a geometric gated encoder is utilized to fully leverage spatial information. In the dual-branch decoding stage, a dual-branch feature interaction alignment module is designed, which is composed of three components, including dual-branch edge feature alignment, dual-branch interaction, and global alignment. Then, the decoded dual-branch features are processed by a dual-modal fusion network based on a spatial propagation network to obtain dense depth map predictions. Extensive experimental results on the NYU-Depth V2 and SUN RGB-D datasets demonstrate that DBF achieves superior depth completion performance compared to existing methods in indoor scenes, particularly in handling large-scale missing depth regions and preserving edge details."

    "abstract": "This paper focuses on mobile positioning for autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) in complex underwater environments. The positioning algorithm based on time of arrival (TOA) assumes that the underwater acoustic communication between AUV and underwater sensors is real-time and reliable. The distance between the AUV and underwater sensors can be obtained through the time delay of acoustic signal transmission. However, the uncertain and complex nature of the underwater environment can cause underwater sensors to fail to receive acoustic signals from the AUV reliably. This leads to an insufficient effective observation data in the positioning solution process, causing underdetermined problems in the solution equation, and thus making it impossible to solve the AUV’s position information stably in real time. To overcome this problem, we frist established a positioning model considering the navigation velocity of the AUV. Based on this Model, we then proposed a two-step weighted least squares algorithm combined with a fast horizontal distance model for the deep sea (TWLS-HD-V). Furthermore, we derived the Cram´er-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) of the proposed model and compared it with that of the basic model. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm was tested on both numerical simulations and deep-sea data. In conclusion, this algorithm effectively overcomes two key challenges in complex underwater environments: sound line bending and insufficient time delay information. As a result, it improves AUV positioning accuracy and ensures reliable positioning trajectories."

    "abstract": "With the rapid adoption of blockchain knowledge across various domains, ensuring its security and availability against cyber threats has become a critical challenge. One prominent threats to blockchain networks is Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks, which can overwhelm network nodes, degrade system performance, and disrupt transactional processes. Traditional DDoS detection methods often suffer from high computational complexity, inefficient feature selection, and delayed response times, making them less suitable for real-time blockchain applications. To address these challenges, this study proposes a novel DDoS attack detection framework based on a Stacked Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) model with Lion Swarm Optimizer (LSO)-based feature selection. The LSO algorithm efficiently selects the most relevant features from network traffic data, reducing dimensionality and enhancing detection accuracy. By leveraging its swarm intelligence-based optimization capabilities, LSO improves the feature selection process, ensuring that the most significant attributes are retained while redundant or irrelevant ones are eliminated. This enhances computational efficiency and allows the model to process real-time traffic data with minimal latency. The Stacked ELM model, known for its fast-training speed and generalization ability, is employed as the classification mechanism to distinguish between normal and malicious traffic. By stacking multiple ELM layers, the model achieves deeper feature extraction, leading to improved classification performance. The combination of LSO-based feature selection and Stacked ELM ensures high accuracy, reduced false positive rates, and efficient detection of complex DDoS attack patterns targeting blockchain networks. Extensive experiments are conducted on benchmark datasets to evaluate the proposed framework’s performance in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The results demonstrate that the planned approach significantly outperforms traditional machine learning representations in detecting DDoS attacks with high efficiency and low computational overhead. The study concludes that integrating advanced feature selection techniques with deep learning-based classifiers provides a promising direction for securing blockchain networks against evolving cyber threats."

    "abstract": "Integrated resource allocation across heterogeneous operators is imperative to achieve globally optimal planning in large-scale energy systems, yet faces fundamental barriers of computational intractability and stringent privacy protection requirements prohibiting sensitive data sharing. This paper develops a parallel-distributed framework resolving these dual challenges in large-scale planning-operation problems. Particularly, this complex problem is decomposed into two aspects: capacity optimization and location optimization. For the former, an enhanced equivalent projection (EP) technique handling mixed-integer optimization is employed, which compresses operator data into non-reconstructable proxies, reducing variables and ensuring privacy-essential security. For the latter, the location optimization leverages a tree-parallel Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) algorithm that breaks commercial solvers’ resource utilization bottlenecks through asynchronous distributed computing, enabling previously intractable large-scale planning solutions. These innovations unify within a parallel-distributed framework where hierarchical planning center and operators coordination enables simultaneous privacy preservation through encrypted EP exchanges and computational acceleration via parallel MCTS processing. An illustrative example is presented at the end of this paper. In Part II, we deploy this methodology across integrated electricity-gas-heat systems and transmission-distribution networks, and verify its effectiveness in large-scale system planning."

To get around these constraints, the article proposes a novel system that makes use of decentralized artificial intelligence at the edge and federated learning. Federated learning preserves privacy by sending only model updates, not raw data, whereas decentralized AI lowers latency by executing local real-time analytics.

The results demonstrated that instance reduction significantly reduced the datasets size by approximately 48.8% and 51.63% less than the original datasets without compromising model performance. Feature selection further enhanced the accuracy and efficiency of the models. The combined application of these techniques offers a promising approach to improve the performance and scalability of IDS. This research contributes to the field of cybersecurity by providing insights into effective data preprocessing strategies for intrusion detection systems. Future research may explore the application of these techniques to other datasets and the development of more advanced feature selection and instance reduction methods."

    "abstract": "The evolution of 5G wireless networks demands energy-efficient communication systems while ensuring Quality of Service (QoS). Traditional paging mechanisms in static modes lead to suboptimal energy usage under dynamic traffic conditions. This research proposes a Dynamic Demand Forecasting Framework with ARIMA to predict user activity patterns and optimize real-time paging strategies. By leveraging ARIMA for accurate traffic demand prediction, the framework dynamically adjusts paging intervals, minimizes unnecessary signaling, and reduces energy consumption without compromising QoS. The proposed model integrates ARIMA’s time-series forecasting capabilities to adaptively respond to fluctuations in network traffic, enabling intelligent and energy-efficient paging. The framework is validated using traffic datasets and evaluated against existing static paging strategies. Results demonstrate significant energy savings and enhanced network performance, particularly in dynamic and high-density user environments. This work paves the way for intelligent, adaptive paging systems that align with the sustainability goals of 5G and beyond."

    "abstract": "Frequency-hopping communication is widely employed in modern secure communication systems due to its robust anti-jamming capabilities. Chaotic sequences, recognized for favorable statistical characteristics, are frequently utilized to generate frequency-hopping patterns. Phase space reconstruction of chaotic frequency hopping sequences effectively removes redundant information and preserves only the essential predictive components, thus enabling a clearer characterization of the sequence’s intrinsic dynamics. Leveraging these reconstructed sequences, the Transformer network captures crucial temporal dependencies while filtering out noise, resulting in significantly improved prediction accuracy. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a Transformer-based approach for frequency hopping sequence prediction. By forecasting three representative sequences, our proposed model attains minimal errors in evaluation metrics, and its prediction error distribution exhibits a tighter concentration near zero. This approach demonstrates superior accuracy and stability compared to conventional time series prediction methods, effectively validating its practical value in frequency hopping sequence prediction."

    "abstract": "The Secure Automotive Firmware Upgrade Approach (SAFUA) proposed a hierarchical authentication framework for in-vehicle systems, implementing the Unified Diagnostic Services (UDS) protocol to ensure secure firmware distribution (ECUs) via wireless transmission. However, despite claiming strong cryptographic potential in predicted lab conditions, SAFUA ignored the dynamic nature of real-world vehicular networks, such as latency, packet loss, and concurrent firmware delivery, which pose significant threats to both performance and safety. To explore these neglected dynamics, this research paper conducts a theoretical investigation using CAN-FD based firmware modeling under dynamic network and cryptographic workload conditions. This analysis demonstrates that SAFUA, although secure by design and structurally, turns operationally unreliable and risk prone under dynamic conditions, which reduces its effectiveness in time sensitive applications such as autonomous driving and safety critical ECU updates. Hence, this research recommends the implementation of adaptive key rotation mechanisms and cryptographic load-aware scheduling to improve SAFUA's system stability and address latency related flaws. Our research exposed substantial weaknesses: authentication failed in 23% of sessions under 10% packet loss, 17% of sessions exposed unencrypted retransmissions at risk to man-in-the-middle attacks, and latency surged by 81% during concurrent ECU updates, collectively compromising firmware integrity and delivery timing. Future work will focus on extending this evaluation using simulation tools like NS-3 and examining how SAFUA can integrate with standardized remote update ecosystems such as Uptane for end-to- end integrity assurance."

In this paper, we propose a secure and energy-efficient beamforming design for sensing-centric ISAC systems. Our objective is to maximize the EE of the sensing-centric system subject to constraints on the maximum permissible Cramér-Rao Bound (CRB) for extended target estimation, the minimum required signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) for legitimate users (LUs), the minimum outage probability for a potential passive eavesdropper (PE), and the maximum transmit power. To solve this non-convex fractional optimization problem, successive convex approximation (SCA) and semidefinite relaxation (SDR) techniques are employed after equivalent transformations. Simulation results demonstrate that, compared to conventional energy-efficient beamforming algorithms, the proposed beamforming algorithm achieves a higher secrecy rate, significantly enhances physical layer security (PLS), and exhibits applicability in more complex environments."

    "abstract": "The recent advancement of the automatic speech recognition (ASR) contributes to the voice user interface (VUI), which is broadly embedded into mobile apps. The VUI implemented on modern mobile operating systems like Android naturally involves multiple threads, and brings new race issues and challenges in defining and identifying them. Specifically, when the GUI and VUI (GV) actions both access to the same resource simultanously, the data race named GV-race may occur. GV-race can lead to wrong behavior and even crashes. However, to the best of our knowledge, this problem has not been adequately studied. In this paper, we present the first study of GV-race on Android apps. However, the involvement of the VUI complicates the concurrency model, affects the temporal relationship and brings state space explosion in global analysis. To tackle these challenges, we firstly define <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">primitives</i> and their <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">happen-before</i> rules to abstract GV interaction patterns.

Through static program analysis, Roma extracts GV related call graphs for each pair of conflicting GV actions to reduce the state space, and generates a universal GV interaction graph using our pre-defined primitives.

We apply Roma to analyze 266 apps. Roma finds 52 apps with app-level GV-race and 56 apps with system-level GV-race. We confirm that 101 apps are true positives."

    "abstract": "Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are naturally adapted to asynchronous sparse event stream data generated by neuromorphic visual sensors by exchanging and processing information through asynchronous spikes between spiking neurons. However, SNNs still face the challenges of high memory usage and high computational overhead during practical deployment. Binarized neural networks (BNNs) can drastically reduce computational overhead and storage requirements by limiting the weights and activations to binary values. Based on this, we propose a blurred knowledge distillation-enhanced binarized spiking neural network (BKD-BSNN) for neuromorphic visual data. We construct a lightweight spiking neural network architecture and binarize its weights. In order to compensate for the loss of network accuracy caused by binarized weights, we adopt a distillation mechanism that combines logits-based knowledge distillation and blurred knowledge distillation, utilizing the full-precision spiking neural network as a teacher model for guidance. Compared with the traditional full-precision SNNs, the weights of the whole network are changed from 32 bits to discrete binary, which reduces the memory footprint to 3.125% of the full-precision SNNs and eliminates the multiplicative calculation of the weights. The experimental results show that the accuracy reaches 69.6% and 99.48% on CIFAR10-DVS and N-MNIST datasets respectively, and 98.48% on DVSGesture which even exceeds that of the full-precision SNNs, which fully proves that our proposed method can maintain high recognition accuracy while improving computational efficiency."

    "abstract": "In minimally invasive procedures involving puncture techniques, as robotic-assisted surgical systems continue to evolve, haptic feedback technology has emerged as a critical enabler for enhancing the operator's perceptual capabilities, improving puncture accuracy and reducing the risk of tissue damage. The traditional mechanical haptic feedback may suffer from friction, which affects the haptic interaction experience. In this paper, a magnetic haptic feedback device based on electromagnetic coils is designed, which can dynamically adjust the magnetic field according to the changes in puncture force, thus achieving high-fidelity reproduction of the puncture force. Furthermore, a magnetic haptic feedback algorithm based on three sequential stages—calibration, training, and feedback—is proposed. In the calibration stage, the system obtains the nonlinear mapping between the coil duty cycle and the magnetic force. In the training stage, a residual-connected multilayer perceptron model learns the mapping from force to duty cycle. In the feedback stage, coil currents are dynamically computed according to the target feedback force and current pose, enabling high-precision force reconstruction and real-time magnetic field control. This paper proposes and implements a magnetic haptic feedback system tailored for teleperated robotic puncture tasks, integrating three-dimensional virtual simulation, vision-based servo control for puncture functionality, and a magnetic feedback mechanism based on electromagnetic coils. The system consists of a surgeon-side and a patient-side. The surgeon-side constructs a three-dimensional simulation environment to specify the target puncture point, remotely control the puncture process, and receive real-time force feedback; the patient-side uses a six-degree-of-freedom robotic arm to perform the puncture operation and collects puncture force data during the process, which is then feedback to the surgeon-side. Through phantom experiments and user evaluations, the superior performance of this system in terms of force feedback fidelity and operational immersion has been validated."

These biases are particularly detrimental in educational settings, where they can reinforce stereotypes, influence student performance and engagement, and perpetuate systemic inequalities.

    "abstract": "Low-light image enhancement aims to improve visibility and image quality under challenging illumination conditions by enhancing brightness, contrast, and detail. Deep learning-based methods, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), have shown notable success. However, their limited receptive fields often restrict recovery performance by focusing on local features. In contrast, transformer architectures offer the advantage of capturing global contextual information. By leveraging the self-similarity of image patches, local degradation can be effectively addressed through fusion. To this end, we propose MSHCDI-Net, a hybrid network composed of CNN and Transformer branches. In MSHCDI-Net, Transformer branches take feature map patches as input and utilize the Transformer mechanism to propagate global context among patches. Extensive experiments conducted on public low-light datasets demonstrate that MSHCDI-Net consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art algorithms, achieving superior visual quality in the reconstructed images."

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a shape matching algorithm called PFFM. It is based on PointFlow dynamic contour modeling and Fast Marching. PFFM aims to address the problem that traditional shape matching methods lack robustness under geometric transformations (such as rotation and scaling), local occlusion, and noise disturbances. PFFM innovatively combines two key components. On one hand, it uses the composite vector field-driven edge-tracking mechanism of the PointFlow model. On the other hand, it integrates the integral invariants of the Fast Marching algorithm. This combination helps construct a closed contour matching framework that possesses both geometric invariance and anti-interference capability. Specifically, we first construct a composite vector field. This field consists of a gradient-driven field and an edge-tracking field. We also introduce an adaptive stopping mechanism. These steps significantly reduce noise sensitivity and interference from local deformations. Meanwhile, we design a geometrically invariant energy function based on integral invariants. This function is combined with the optimized correspondence derived from dynamic programming. Together, they ensure the geometric invariance of the shapedistance metric. Experimental results demonstrate the advantages of the PFFM algorithm. In both single-target and multi-target matching tasks, it significantly outperforms classical methods such as SIFT, RIFT, and HAPCG in terms of the average RMSE index. Moreover, PFFM exhibits superior robustness in mixed interference scenarios. Overall, this algorithm provides an effective solution for high-precision shape matching in complex scenes."

For dynamic underwater environments, researchers typically apply deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to design multi-AUV collection schemes for UWSNs. However, these methods suffer from the following issues. 1) <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Overloaded observations</i>. The importance of various observations for an AUV varies over time. Considering all observations equally complicates decision-making for subsequent actions. 2) <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Dynamic scale of AUVs and sensors</i>. Once the number of AUVs or sensors is changed, traditional static neural networks require retraining, lacking scalability across diverse scenarios. To solve the above issues, we propose a Generalizable Attention-based Data collection scheme (GAMD) for Multi-AUV UWSNs, while enhancing AUVs’ collection efficiency. GAMD incorporates the attention mechanism with multi-agent DRL framework, which enables AUVs to prioritize observations more critical for action decisions. Moreover, we propose an adaptive information processing approach, enabling the AUV policy model to seamlessly adapt to various scenarios without retraining. Additionally, we develop a training paradigm with incremental complexity across different scale scenarios to simplify training process and accelerate convergence. Simulation results demonstrate that GAMD alleviates the training cost compared to the state-of-the-art methods, and simultaneously optimizes collection energy efficiency, collection time, and trajectory distance."

    "abstract": "In uplink communications of sensor networks, by utilizing the movable-antenna (MA) array, the access point (AP) can flexibly reconfigure the wireless channel between itself and each sensor to improve the system performance. However, relying solely on the MA technology still cannot achieve overly desirable performance, especially in two extreme scenarios: i) The total antenna span at the AP is relatively small, for which the channel reconfiguration ability is weak; ii) The angle of arrivals (AoAs) to the AP at some sensors are close, for which the correlation between any two of these uplink channels remains strong, no matter how the MA array is deployed. Motivated by these considerations, in this correspondence we propose to simultaneously utilize the MA technology and adjustability of AoAs to sufficiently reconfigure channel conditions. Specifically, we aim to maximize the sum rate by jointly optimizing antenna positions and the receive beamforming at the AP, and concurrently the AoA to the AP at each sensor (which can be adjusted in a certain range by optimizing the deployment of each sensor beforehand). The formulated problem is highly non-convex. To tackle it, we derive the optimal minimum mean-square error (MMSE) receive beamforming given fixed antenna positions and all AoAs, based on which we further adopt the alternating optimization to iteratively handle another two types of variables. We also present the special case of two sensors to reveal insightful conclusions. Finally, we perform simulations to show the potential advantages of our proposed scheme compared to the current MA technology."

However, spatial variations in the delivered scene quality, caused by combining different quality levels, can influence the users’ perceptual experience. While several models and datasets have been developed for 360° video quality assessment (360° VQA), none of the available studies consider the spatial quality variation that arises in multi-quality tiled 360° video streaming. To bridge this gap, conducting subjective evaluation experiments for tiled omnidirectional videos is essential for developing reliable tiled 360° VQA models and optimized streaming algorithms. This paper introduces the STAV360 dataset, a dataset for subjective tile-based assessment of 360° videos. The STAV360 dataset consists of six 360° video sequences, each tiled and encoded using twelve different patterns, along with subjective ratings and tracking data of 27 participants. STAV360 reveals interesting patterns in subjective tiled 360° VQA, paving the way for new research opportunities in tile-based 360° video streaming and objective 360° VQA metric models.

This study presents an improved deep learning methodology that exceeds conventional techniques in assessing the health state of retinal pictures. In order to label retinal images as normal or abnormal, the suggested system was built utilizing the open-source retinal fundus multi-disease image dataset (RFMiD). By combining the Gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) method with contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE), we have been able to improve the images and see which parts of the retina the model finds most interesting.

However, crosssubject generalization remains a fundamental challenge due to individual variability, cognitive traits, and emotional responses. We propose FreqDGT, a frequency-adaptive dynamic graph transformer that systematically addresses these limitations through an integrated framework. FreqDGT introduces frequency-adaptive processing (FAP) to dynamically weight emotion-relevant frequency bands based on neuroscientific evidence, employs adaptive dynamic graph learning (ADGL) to learn input-specific brain connectivity patterns, and implements multi-scale temporal disentanglement network (MTDN) that combines hierarchical temporal transformers with adversarial feature disentanglement to capture both temporal dynamics and ensure cross-subject robustness. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that FreqDGT significantly improves cross-subject emotion recognition accuracy, confirming the effectiveness of integrating frequencyadaptive, spatial-dynamic, and temporal-hierarchical modeling while ensuring robustness to individual differences.

To address this issue, a model-based predictive control method for IPWR based on a proxy model and an improved particle swarm optimization(PSO) algorithm is proposed in this paper. The IPWR proxy model, which takes into account the model deviation caused by faults and performance degradation, is constructed using multi-layer perceptron. The optimal control output is searched for using the PSO algorithm. It is demonstrated by simulation results that the proposed predictive control method can overcome the severe disturbances introduced by faults and ensure the safe and smooth operation of the IPWR."

    "abstract": "Global surface changes are increasingly monitored using multi-temporal remote sensing technologies. As an emerging technology, change captioning can organically integrate the location information of changed regions with the semantic analysis of regional attributes to generate natural language descriptions of changes, providing critical support for the intuitive interpretation of remote sensing monitoring results. However, existing methods have two key limitations: first, single-stream CNNs fail to extract spatiotemporal information sufficiently which leads to the easy omission of subtle changes, while single-stream Transformers suffer from relatively high parameter counts; second, using pixel-level difference information directly causes the model to focus on pseudo-changes induced by illumination or noise, reducing the accuracy of real change characterization and subsequent description. To address these issues, this paper proposes RMNet which is a dual-dimensional difference recalibration-guided CNN-VMamba synergistic network, with two core innovations: 1) a dual-stream architecture adopted that combines the strong local feature extraction capability of CNNs with the powerful global context modeling ability of VMamba, further enhanced by a channel-wise spatial window attention mechanism; 2) a dual-dimensional difference recalibration mechanism that optimizes features by highlighting core changes and suppressing pseudo-changes through dimension-specific enhancement strategies. Extensive experiments on the LEVIR-CC dataset demonstrate significant performance improvements across all evaluation metrics, validating the effectiveness of RMNet in overcoming current limitations in remote sensing change captioning tasks.

Junction less MOSFETs (JL-MOSFETs) came as a different solution to avoid these limitations by eliminating the p-n junctions and introducing a uniformly doped channel to facilitate fabrication and increase device reliability. Of the various JL-MOSFETs, double-gate (DG) structure has demonstrated enhanced electrostatic control, reduced leakage, and better scalability, which makes it extremely competent for sub-10 nm nodes. Here is a review article on DG-JL MOSFETs describing their structural advantages, functioning principles, and key performance indicators like threshold voltage control, subthreshold slope, and ON/OFF current ratio. In addition, advances in semiconductor materials like high-mobility III- V compound and 2D materials like MoS<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</inf> and graphene have also improved the functionality and efficiency of DG-JL MOSFETs. The article further elaborates on modelling methodologies like drift-diffusion models, quantum mechanical simulations, and AI optimization techniques, which enable accurate characterization and design improvement. Though their promise, however, is within grasp, DG-JL MOSFETs are also plagued by challenges in the doping control, thermal management, and accuracy of fabrication, which call for further effort in strain engineering, nanowire architectures, and hybrid JL- TFET designs.

    "abstract": "Accurate prediction of pharmacological activity and associated therapeutic side effects is essential for advancing personalized medicine, particularly in hypertension therapy where patients’ responses vary depending on their health profiles and comorbidities. However, existing machine learning approaches face challenges in minimizing uncertainty specifically when targeting exploiting explainable models for ethical and personalized hypertension treatments. Moreover, pharmacological-hypertension datasets often contain missing and heterogeneous data due to incomplete side-effect reports which consequently reduce likelihood estimation and posterior calibration of the learned models. To address these challenges, a novel uncertainty-aware probabilistic learning framework based on Bayesian Networks (BNs) optimized via the Expectation–Maximization (EM) algorithm is proposed to reduce uncertainties through higher likelihood estimation for hypertension medications. This implementation extends previous EM-based probabilistic models by integrating uncertainty evaluation using influence strength and sensitivity analysis to enhance interpretability and reliability. The BN–EM framework learns dependencies between drug-related attributes such as drug classes, pregnancy categories, and brand names to predict side effects and activity levels. Three probabilistic experiments were conducted to assess the proposed parameter learning approach. The BN–EM model outperformed Tree-Augmented Naïve Bayes (TAN) and Naïve Bayes (NB), achieving the highest micro-averaged accuracy of 97.03%, compared to 95.48% and 89.55%, respectively. These findings highlight the potential of EM-optimized probabilistic modeling to support transparent and clinically interpretable personalized hypertension therapy."

    "abstract": "Electroencephalography (EEG) signals are an integral component of brain-computer interfaces (BCI), as they provide a noninvasive, direct measure of the electrical activity in the brain. However, artifacts in the EEG signal degrade the usefulness of the signal in BCI applications. Common artifacts in EEG signals include ocular artifacts (caused by eye movements) and myogenic artifacts (caused by muscle contractions). Such artifacts are particularly hard to remove because their frequency range overlaps with the frequency range of the EEG signals. Thus, for this task a model is proposed, based on Wasserstein GAN with Gradient Penalty(WGAN-GP) featuring an encoder-decoder architecture for the Generator along with self-attention and cross-attention to capture temporal dependencies while the Critic(Discriminator) ensures realistic output through adversarial feedback. This novel architecture is found to perform better than benchmark deep learning algorithms proposed in [1]."

    "abstract": "The quantum Internet promises to revolutionize computing, communications, sensing, and security by leveraging quantum entanglement. In this context, quantum repeaters play a crucial role by performing entanglement swapping to extend entanglement across distant nodes. However, malicious repeaters can retain entangled pairs, enabling man-in-the-middle attacks that compromise security. Quantum Identity Authentication (QIA) protocols aim to mitigate this threat by verifying the legitimacy of communicating parties. However, existing QIA protocols rely on unrealistic assumptions, such as noise-free environments or static noise profiles, that do not reflect the nature of real-world quantum networks. Such noise can cause benign sessions to be flagged as attacks or allow attacks to go undetected. To address these limitations, we propose a machine learning-enhanced QIA framework designed for noisy quantum environments. The protocol performs random authentications during communication sessions using parameters derived from a shared secret key. These parameters determine the preparation and measurement of authentication qubits, known only to legitimate users. A trained machine learning model analyzes physical-layer information (e.g., entanglement fidelity, routing path) and protocol-level data (e.g., basis selection, encoding bit, and measurement outcomes) to detect malicious behavior under fluctuating noise conditions. We evaluate several attack detection models and identify XGBoost as the most effective, achieving 97.18% accuracy and an F1-score of 0.96. The proposed XGBoost-enhanced QIA protocol detects attacks within the first authentication round, achieving a 100% detection and a 1.7% false alarm rate. This reflects a 16.1% improvement in detection rate and a 92.5% reduction in false alarms compared to the entanglement-based QIA benchmark."

    "abstract": "Face masking in current COVID-19 pandemic seems to be a deceivingly simple decision-making problem due to its multifaceted nature. Questions arising from masking span biomedicine, epidemiology, physics, and human behaviors. While science has shown masks work generally, human behaviors (particularly under influences of politics) complicate the problem significantly given science generally assumes rationality but our minds are not always rational and/or honest. Minding minds, a legitimate concern, can also make masking legitimately confusing. To disentangle the potential confusions, particularly, the ramifications of irrationality and dishonesty, here we resort to evolutionary game theory. Specifically, we formulate and analyze the masking problem with a fictitious pair of young lovers, Alice and Bob, as a Sir Philip Sydney (SPS) evolutionary game, inspired by the handicap principle in evolutionary biology and cryptography figures in computer science. With the proposed Alice and Bob’s dating dilemma (ABD) as an asymmetric four-by-four strategic-form game, 16 strategic interactions were identified, and six of which may reach equilibriums with different characteristics such as separating, pooling, and polymorphic hybrid, being Nash, evolutionarily stable or neutrally stable. The six equilibrium types seem to mirror the diverse behaviors of mask believers, skeptics, converted, universal masking, voluntarily masking, coexisted and/or divided world of believers and skeptics. We suggest that the apparently simple ABD game is sufficiently general not only for studying masking policies for populations (<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">via</i> replicator dynamics), but also for investigating other complex decision-making problems with COVID-19 pandemic including lockdown versus reopening, herd immunity versus quarantines, and aggressive tracing versus privacy protection."

    "abstract": "Confronting the fundamental limitation of subcarrier orthogonality degradation caused by Doppler shifts in high-mobility multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) systems, this paper investigates channel estimation in the delay-Doppler (DD) domain for multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal time frequency space (MIMO-OTFS) modulation systems characterized by quasi-static sparse channels. To overcome the high-complexity constraints, we propose a novel channel estimation network that synergizes the strengths of a residual network with squeeze-and-excitation (SE-ResNet) and a Transformer. This network deeply exploits channel correlation information from both spatial and temporal dimensions, collaboratively enhancing the representation learning of spatial and temporal features for more accurate channel state information (CSI) estimation. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves approximately 17 dB performance gain over traditional algorithms and significantly outperforms existing single deep learning (DL) models in estimation accuracy, effectively addressing the inherent limitations of unimodal architectures by joint spatial and temporal modeling. We also compare the normalized mean square error (NMSE) performance under varying velocities, spatial correlation coefficients and MIMO antenna configurations. This work not only validates the effectiveness of the spatial-temporal cooperative mechanism for enhancing channel estimation accuracy but also provides a low complexity scheme of channel estimation for high-mobility communication systems."

    "abstract": "Resolution is one of the important indicators for radar parameter estimation. Although most of the current research on resolution is focused on single parameter estimation, there have also been some achievements in the research on the resolution of multiparameter joint estimation. However, the problem of the joint resolution limit (JRL) for the direction of departure (DOD) and direction of arrival (DOA) for bistatic Multiple-input Multiple-output (MIMO) radar has not been studied. The study derived the JRL of DOD and DOA for bistatic MIMO radar by combining Shannon’s information theory achievements. Based on the general signal model, we can obtain a explicit formula for scattering information (SI) under two targets condition, reflection its influence factor. We define the DOD interval and DOA interval corresponding to the orthogonal component of SI is 1 bit as the JRL. Meanwhile, the paper also provides closed-form expressions and approximate representations of the DOD resolution limit (DOD-RL) and DOA resolution limit (DOA-RL) by using parameter degradation analysis method. The results indicate that the resolution limit is inversely correlated with the number of radar transmitter and receiver units, the element spacing, the transmit signal frequency, and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). These resolution limits are universal, that is, they are independent of specific algorithm. Finally, MATLAB was used to simulate the research fundings, verifying their accuracy and effectiveness."

In this demo paper, we will show an open-source implementation of a DPP system for managing the lifecycle of second-hand electronic devices such as computers. Our system is oriented towards the use cases of economic actors such as repairers, refurbishers, and the customers of these devices.

    "abstract": "The rise of telemedicine platforms like Altibbi has transformed healthcare access, enabling patients to consult specialists remotely. One vital component of these platforms is medical question classification, which ensures that patient inquiries are efficiently directed to the appropriate specialists. However, these datasets often suffer from class imbalance, leading to biased model performance. This study explores the use of AraBERTv0.2-Twitter embeddings combined with ensemble learning techniques, Bagging and Boosting applied to various classifiers, including Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forests (RF), Decision Trees (DT), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). We evaluate their performance on a dataset of Arabic medical questions from Altibbi under four experimental conditions: (1) Bagging without Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE), (2) Bagging with SMOTE, (3) Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost) without SMOTE, and (4) AdaBoost with SMOTE. This allows us to analyze the impact of synthetic oversampling on classification performance and identify the most effective approach for addressing data imbalance. Experimental results show that Bagging with LR, without SMOTE, achieves the highest Macro F1-score (0.8468) and G-Mean (0.9077). AdaBoost with LR benefits significantly from oversampling, reaching a G-Mean of (0.8921) with SMOTE. Additionally, RF improves G-Mean from (0.8831) to (0.8893) when combined with Bagging and SMOTE. These findings highlight the vital role of ensemble methods in enhancing classification fairness and accuracy. By integrating such strategies, telemedicine platforms can significantly improve the automated classification of medical questions, ensuring patients receive timely and accurate responses from the right specialists."

The most common of which is solar photovoltaic systems, especially in residential applications. Typically, those systems are applied in a relatively small capacity scale to accommodate the power needs of a household. However, usually such systems do not have power storage options like batteries due to excessive initial and running costs and maintenance for hybrid off-grid systems. In this study, an economic comparison is established between two systems for a residential building in Amman, Jordan. The first one is a grid-connected solar photovoltaic system that does not have a battery system. The second one is a hybrid off-grid system that carries a battery pack. Results of the comparison shows that even though the hybrid off-grid system has much higher initial and running costs, the two systems have roughly similar return on investment (ROI) at 13% and payback period of five years. However, results also showed that the hybrid off-grid system has a close-to-zero levelized cost of energy (LCOE) whilst the on-grid system has $0.09/kWh LCOE as opposed to utility tariffs at $0.21/kWh."

    "abstract": "The concept of morphing wings is often incorporated in the design of highly adaptive aircraft. However, the design of dual-mode morphing wing and the research of mode switching method remain insufficiently developed. This article presents a novel dual-mode morphing wing based on the characteristics of multiple modes of metamorphic mechanism. Through the combination of basic 4R mechanisms, we designed a class of line symmetry Bricard mechanisms. A novel self-coupling joint is developed to enable compliant switching between different modes without new actuator. Based on the energy change during movement, we propose an energy-assisted method to realize the mode switching. Ultimately, we constructed a prototype aircraft with two modes: variable anhedral angle for enhanced maneuverability and variable sweep angle for better aerodynamic efficiency. The mode switching experiment shows that the motion state of the joint changes compliantly during the mode switching. The experiments show that the morphing wing can change the anhedral angle (7°–12°) and sweep angle (15°–30°), and can change the mode with the help of flight conditions. The aircraft can fly successfully in both modes, which shows the superiority of the design method. The findings of this study hold significant potential for the design of morphing wings in highly adaptive aircraft."

Different constituents of IoT (like devices, services, users, etc.) are playing a crucial role in providing data to operational technologies such as industrial control systems, remote terminal units, transportation, healthcare, water treatment usages, etc. The constituents of IoT technology require in-depth analysis and design elements to model the possible threats beforehand and work upon the domain-specific vulnerabilities. In this study, a threat modeling framework is proposed to analyze the pattern-based solution for an IoT use case i.e., IoT security patterns. The pattern-based solutions are often specified by using UML Language, that is not a fully formal language. The semi-formal approach requires a thorough analysis. The presented threat modeling framework can identify hidden insecure issues and provides rigorous analysis, which are not found in security pattern notation. The proposed framework is based on a metamodling approach. A specific use case of IoT in the domain of health care is considered to analyze the efficacy of the proposed framework."

So, to identify online false content, our method use an improved XGBoost algorithm. An enhanced jellyfish algorithm that enhances classification accuracy optimally selects the XGBoost weight. Users' devices can be integrated with the models through browser extensions and smartphone applications. The classification representations are accessible through web services and run on a server in cloud. While these models are effective at detecting false news in both English and European Portuguese, the latter is where the emphasis is, due to the dearth of work in this area. In addition to creating the first publicly available dataset for detecting false news in European Portuguese via online scraping, the models outperformed prior work despite training with a substantially larger quantity of data from a broader range of sources."

First, bellow-shaped soft actuators are simplified into hyperelastic cylinder soft actuators with mechanical equivalence. In addition, the overall deformation is decoupled into elongation and bending components to enhance computational efficiency. Based on these two simplifying strategies, the kinetostatic model is developed with absolute nodal coordinate formulation theory. Then, forward and inverse kinetostatic mappings are defined, and the numerical solution algorithm is presented. Finally, the developed model is experimentally validated through configuration simulation and feedforward trajectory tracking. Experimental results demonstrate that the developed model achieves low prediction errors, with configuration simulation errors of 3.43%. Furthermore, with the model-based feedforward controller, a two-segment soft continuum robot can accurately follow desired trajectories with specified bending angles, achieving average position and angle errors of 4.14 mm and 1.58<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$^{\\circ }$</tex-math></inline-formula>, respectively."

These gestures were subsequently mapped to system-level commands like browser tab navigation (Next/Previous), opening applications such as Google Chrome, screen capture, and desktop opening. The system employs a Random Forest classifier trained on the dataset gathered in CSV format, which performs well in separating gesture classes in real-time. The framework proposed is implemented using a Flask-based application to facilitate seamless integration with current desktop environments. The light and scalable design enables real-time inference with little computational overhead, making it ideal for personal computers, smart kiosks, and assistive technologies.

    "abstract": "Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder primarily affecting the elderly, characterized by gradually worsening memory loss, cognitive impairment, and behavioral changes, ultimately leading to the loss of ability to perform daily activities. As global populations age, AD has emerged as a significant challenge in public health. While there is currently no cure, early diagnosis and intervention can substantially improve patients’ quality of life. This study focuses on the temporal cumulative effects during the progression of AD from Cognitively Normal (CN) to Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), and then to AD. We propose a predictive model for the progression of Alzheimer’s disease that takes into account the temporal cumulative effects, which can effectively capture the role of time accumulation in the development process of the disease. Our model was trained using longitudinal data from Alzheimer’s patients to predict disease progression at three future time points. Extensive experiments have shown that the proposed algorithm achieves optimal performance in terms of precision and recall. Over three time periods, the average prediction precision for CN, MCI, and AD is 0.805, 0.812, and 0.812, respectively, while the average recall rate is 0.862, 0.801, and 0.816, respectively."

Therefore, accurate multi-class grading of histopathological images is crucial for early screening and effective treatment of breast cancer. Given the large amount of intra-class variation and inter-class similarity, traditional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) frequently struggle in multi-class grading. To mitigate these challenges, we present MSHFF-Net, an Explainable Multi-Scale Hierarchical Feature Fusion architecture that combines adaptive multi-scale blocks with a feature-fusion stem to simultaneously capture tissue-level patterns and fine-grained cellular structures. The model processes input images of size <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$320 \\times 320$</tex>, preserving spatial resolution to enable detailed feature extraction. MSHFF-Net is trained on the publicly available BRACS benchmark dataset using Leaky ReLU activation and sparse categorical cross-entropy loss function. It achieves an overall accuracy of 73.94%, outperforming several state-of-theart CNN backbones. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of hierarchical multi-scale feature fusion in enhancing automated breast cancer diagnosis from histopathological images. Furthermore, to ensure interpretability, the Explainable AI (XAI) method Gradient-Weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) is employed to visualize the decision-making process of MSHFF-Net, providing greater transparency and clinical trustworthiness."

By leveraging IQR to construct adaptive truncation thresholds and using LOF to filter out strong interference, the proposed method improves the accuracy of background clutter power estimation through maximum likelihood estimation. Simulation results show that LQTS-CFAR outperforms conventional CFAR algorithms in homogeneous, multi-target, and clutter-edge environments. It effectively mitigates the target-masking effect in weak clutter regions and exhibits superior performance in terms of detection probability and false alarm control. The proposed approach significantly enhances environmental adaptability while maintaining acceptable CFAR loss, making it suitable for practical radar signal processing applications."

Although hybrid architectures of CNN and Transformer can extract local features and capture long-range dependencies, they inadequately address information interaction and redundant information elimination during the fusion process, adversely impacting PD-L1 segmentation accuracy. To address this, we propose a W-shaped dual-encoder network (DEW-Net) with novel attention fusion mechanisms. First, a CNN encoder and a Swin Transformer encoder are connected in parallel to extract multi-layer local and global features from pathological images, respectively. Second, a Cross-Attention Fusion (CAF) module is proposed to strengthen information interaction and semantic feature fusion. Additionally, a Channel Attention (CA) is introduced in skip connections to enhance the channel-wise information of shallow features, while a Bilateral-voting Position Attention (BPA) module is further proposed to eliminate positional noise in same-scale shallow features and reinforce position-wise information. We conducted extensive experiments on four datasets. On the PD-L1 segmentation dataset, DEW-Net achieved superior performance, with DSC and IoU reaching 79.93% and 71.27%, respectively. These results demonstrate its strong performance and generalization capability compared to other state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods."

    "abstract": "Stock market trend prediction aims to predict the up/down movement of price change that helps market participants determine the optimal time to open and close their buy/sell positions to maximize profit. Prior studies have typically aimed to predict solely the 1-day up or down price movement, while others have extended to predict other short-term movements, such as 3-days, 7-days, and up to 30 days ahead. This type of prediction across different time frames enables traders to maximize their longer-term market view to strategize their trading positions. In lieu of this, we propose a multi-horizon stock trend prediction approach that predicts buy/sell positions for multiple time frames (1 day, 3 days, 7 days, and 10 days ahead) in a single output. This work proposes a CGTA model that combines layers from a convolutional neural network (CNN), gated recurrent unit (GRU), time distributed layer, and multi-head attention. This model architecture ensures that both class imbalance and long-term dependency in the data are efficiently handled so as to improve classification accuracy. The proposed CTGA model achieves an average accuracy of 82.16% across the different indices taken for the study, outperforming existing benchmark models in terms of classification accuracy and financial evaluations."

    "abstract": "The Graph Coloring Problem (GCP) is a traditional NP-hard problem that is conceptually related to the map coloring problem, which was studied extensively in the 20th century. GCP has been researched extensively over time, and many versions have been created. Although much advance has been made, it is still a subject of research, regularly motivating new strategies for the solution. The primary objective of the Graph Coloring Problem (GCP) is to assign colors to the vertices of a graph in a way that ensures no two connected vertices share the same color. In this study, we explore a variant of GCP in which the chromatic number is predefined, and we propose an innovative solution utilizing the Slime Mould Algorithm (SMA) to address this constraint-driven coloring challenge. The vertex colours are assigned dynamically according to fitness evaluation to strike a balance between exploration and exploitation based on algorithms inspired by the adaptive and oscillatory foraging behaviours of slime moulds. We further embed a fuzzy logic-based mechanism in the coloring process to adapt the coloring problem to the real world with uncertainty. We evaluate our method on the DIMACS benchmark dataset. Synthetics results show that the SMA-based approach yields the best results compared to others. This problem and different solutions have applications in several areas, e.g. scheduling systems, frequency assignment in mobile networks, coloring maps, testing of circuits, and register assignment in compilers."

In this study, we propose a semi-supervised learning framework specifically designed for GPR-based defect detection under heterogeneous subsurface conditions. To address the domain gap, we construct diverse and representative synthetic datasets via stochastic simulations and further validate the framework on real measurement data. Furthermore, a novel data augmentation technique ScanDrop is developed to simulate signal occlusion and structural perturbations, thereby improving model robustness. We also introduce an orthogonal feature selection and similarity ranking mechanism to extract salient features across datasets and enhance model generalization. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, showing consistent improvements over baseline and ablation models, and indicating its potential for more complex GPR-based applications in heterogeneous environments."

    "abstract": "Contemporary stereo optical satellite imagery imposes inherent limitations on the resolution and elevation accuracy achievable in digital surface model (DSM) extraction. To mitigate these constraints, we introduce a novel stereo image pair super-resolution (SPSR) methodology. Existing super-resolution (SR) research primarily focuses on single images and fails to address the geometric model degradation in stereo pairs postprocessing. Furthermore, a rigorous comparison is absent between direct SR application on DSM versus DSM extraction from SR-enhanced stereo imagery. Our solution employs a dual aggregation transformer with multiscale attention (DATMAT) network, which effectively resolves challenges in multiscale information aggregation and computational redundancy for remote sensing imagery. Crucially, by establishing a geometric position mapping model between super-resolved and source imagery, we rectify the loss of geolocational fidelity post-SR. Extensive experiments on WV2, SV1, GF7, and ZY3 datasets demonstrate that DATMAT significantly outperforms representative and recent deep learning methods (e.g., HAT, DAT, and EDSR). Quantitatively, DATMAT improves PSNR by 1.60%–19.08% and SSIM by 0.73%–8.03% over peer models. In terms of DSM vertical accuracy, although the performance gap among deep learning methods is inherently narrow, DATMAT achieves the lowest elevation RMSE across all tested platforms, reaching an optimal 2.46 m on WV2 and 3.78 m on GF7. Compared to the strongest competing Transformer-based models, DATMAT further reduces the elevation RMSE and MAE, while consistently maintaining the highest concentration of low-magnitude errors. These results indicate that DATMAT provides superior geometric model recovery and cross-scene robustness, establishing a high-precision, low-cost framework for satellite-based DSM production, promoting the practical utility of submeter resolution geospatial mapping."

This paper presents an empirical framework for evaluating privacy leakage in DP-trained learning models deployed in communication-intensive environments. In particular, this study study Membership Inference Attacks (MIA), quantify empirical loss via Privacy Loss Random Variables (PLRV), and track privacy degradation using Rényi Differential Privacy (RDP). To enhance privacy risk auditing, further proposed a Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) that integrates theoretical guarantees, leakage metrics, model utility, and query patterns into an interpretable Fuzzy Risk Score (FRS). Our experiments on MIMIC-III and Adult datasets reveal substantial discrepancies between formal and empirical privacy loss in practical deployment scenarios. This study bridges privacy theory with communication-aware security, providing actionable insights for secure learning across distributed systems, including nextgeneration networking, the Internet of Things, and federated Artificial Intelligence (AI) architectures."

    "abstract": "Our research introduces a health-aware dispatching framework for large-scale crowd events, focusing on safety and privacy. It combines (i) Disjoint Set Union (DSU) for efficient group management, (ii) Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) for decentralized coordination, and (iii) Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption (CP-ABE) for secure attribute protection. The DSU allows quick group updates, while the MAS policy forms temporary health-based subgroups and seamlessly reintegrates them. The framework balances throughput and safety with a biobjective dispatch policy, minimizing risks and delays. A JADE simulation with 1,001 agents demonstrates scalability, showing stable monitoring and efficient DSU operations, effectively managing vulnerable subgroups without disrupting flow."

    "abstract": "In recent years, the input-series-output-parallel (ISOP) LLC-DAB converter has been applied to DC microgrids and energy routers. However, the existing control methods still have some limitations, such as a limited range of soft switching, large current stress, and slow dynamic response speed, which restrict the efficiency and dynamic performance of the converter. This paper optimizes the Triple-Phase-Shift (TPS) modulation scheme to achieve full-range soft-switching operation across varying input voltages, while simultaneously optimizing current stress characteristics and improving the converter's efficiency. Meanwhile, a more concise closed-loop control strategy is developed. Then, a direct power control (DPC) strategy based on inductor current stress optimization is presented. This strategy calculates the phase-shift ratio parameters according to the converter's required power transmission. The calculation ensures the transmitted power quickly matches the load power. The approach improves the converter's dynamic performance during input voltage and load variations. The improvement is achieved while maintaining optimized current stress conditions. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy is verified by experimental results of a 2.5kW prototype."

    "abstract": "Water supply and distribution systems are critical infrastructures whose design heavily influences the operating conditions during unexpected demands. Rapid urbanization, increasing leakage and ageing infrastructures are the main factors responsible for poor performance under different scenarios. Water distribution networks have to be designed with the aim of reliability, but also with the need of containing costs. In these last decades, several Evolutionary Algorithms have been proposed for solving such problems, obtaining successful results. The paper aims at comparing the performance of two multi-objective genetic algorithms in solving a relatively simple optimization problem, for which the complete Pareto front has been calculated. The tests have been performed on the problem of designing the pipes of a two-loop water distribution network where the first objective is the minimization of the cost and the second objective is the maximization of the redundancy, expressed as the average pressure surplus above a minimum required value. The performance indices considered keep into account both the exploration and the exploitation capabilities of the algorithms."

This article investigates precoding strategies and heuristic methods to improve coexistence between a primary and a secondary network operating in the same licensed band. A heuristic AP shutdown strategy is proposed for the secondary network, where the APs causing the highest interference - estimated based on available metrics - are selectively deactivated. This approach dynamically reduces interference to the primary network while preserving the secondary network’s performance. Different precoding strategies are analyzed, and the simulation results indicate that the methods based on mimimum mean square error achieve good performance in terms of spectral efficiency. Overall, the proposed combination of AP management and efficient precoding offers a promising solution for spectrum sharing in dense network environments."

This method dynamically adjusts hyperparameters based on the model's performance, eliminating the need for manual hyperparameter tuning, ensuring that the model can more effectively adapt to the dataset's distribution, thereby improving its ability to recognize samples from different classes, especially in cases of imbalanced class distributions. Experimental results show that the dynamic adjustment method outperforms baseline loss functions, with robust performance across datasets like MS COCO14 (image dataset) and PubMed (text dataset). It effectively improves recall for minority classes and maintains overall model stability, particularly for long-tailed distributions. This approach can be integrated with various models based on neural networks and has a broad application potential for other tasks, making it a valuable tool for enhancing model performance."

    "abstract": "In the evolving landscape of cyber threats targeting Automated Teller Machine (ATM) networks, anomaly detection systems must move beyond reactive alerts toward proactive, interpretable, and adaptive defense mechanisms. This study presents a hybrid anomaly detection and mitigation framework that integrates network motif-based traffic analysis, machine learning, blockchain-based forensic logging, and a conceptual self-healing mechanism. Motif patterns were extracted from the CICIDS2017 Friday dataset using NetworkX to reveal latent structural behaviors in network flows. Initially, a One-Class Support Vector Machine (OC-SVM) was applied but yielded suboptimal results due to class imbalance, achieving only 29.6% precision, 59.4% recall, 39.5% F1-score, and 90.92% accuracy. Consequently, the study transitioned to a supervised SVM model. Without SMOTE, this model achieved 96.34% accuracy, 82.01% precision, 48.66% F1-score, and 35.00% recall. To improve minority class detection, SMOTE was introduced, leading to increased recall (81.20%) but reduced precision (27.45%), demonstrating the inherent trade-offs of resampling. Confirmed anomalies were logged immutably on a private Ethereum blockchain via Solidity smart contracts, deployed using Remix IDE, ensuring forensic traceability and tamper-proof records. The framework, called Efficient Self-Healing Secure Framework for Enhanced Cyber-resilience in ATM Networks (Eshsfec-A), includes a semi-automated whitelist-based response mechanism to support healing processes. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) validated the feature separability, and the system flagged over 300 attack vectors in real time. This work demonstrates a viable path toward future self-resilient cybersecurity solutions for financial infrastructures."

We also show that structured mixing models implementing physical knowledge can be integrated, which is demonstrated by two far-field models. With the contrast functions, rapidly converging second-order algorithms are developed, whose performance is first verified through simulations. In the experimental part, we refine iIVE by training models containing unrolled iterations of the developed algorithm. The resulting structures achieve performance comparable to state-of-the-art networks while requiring two orders of magnitude fewer trainable parameters and exhibiting strong generalization to unseen conditions."

    "abstract": "Ring artifacts in CT are caused by uncalibrated variations in detector pixels and are especially prevalent with emerging photon counting detectors (PCDs). Control of ring artifacts is conventionally accomplished by improving either hardware manufacturing or software correction algorithms. An alternative solution is detector autocalibration, in which two redundant samples of each line integral are acquired and used to dynamically calibrate the PCD. Autocalibration was first proposed by Hounsfield in 1977 and was demonstrated on the EMI Topaz prototype scanner in 1980, but details surrounding this implementation are sparse. We investigate a form of autocalibration that requires just two redundant acquisitions, which could be acquired using flying focal spot on a clinical scanner but is demonstrated here with a detector shift. We formulated autocalibration as an optimization problem to determine the relative gain factor of each pixel and tested it on scans of a chicken thigh specimen, resolution phantom, and a cylindrical phantom. Ring artifacts were significantly reduced. Some residual artifacts remained but could not be discriminated from the intrinsic temporal instability of our PCD modules. Autocalibration could facilitate the adoption of widespread photon counting CT by reducing ring artifacts, thermal management requirements, or stability requirements that are present today. Demonstration of autocalibration on a rotating gantry with flying focal spot remains future work."

    "abstract": "Establishing long-term time series of elevation changes using satellite altimetry data enables comprehensive monitoring of the Earth's surface over extended periods. In polar regions, long-term elevation monitoring of ice sheets and ice shelves is crucial to determine their mass balance. This paper introduces the indirect adjustment method (IAM), a novel algorithm for establishing elevation change time series. Through theoretical comparisons and practical calculations of the Ross Ice Shelf (RIS) and Filchner–Ronne Ice Shelf (FRIS) using CryoSat-2 altimetric data, we conducted a comparative analysis of the IAM with previous methods for constructing elevation change time series. A particular advantage of the IAM is its ability to integrate data from a larger number of altimetric cycles, thereby maximizing data utilization. The elevation values in the time series constructed using the IAM have a lower standard deviation, reducing uncertainty caused by data errors and improving the accuracy of determining long-term elevation changes, with an average reduction of about 30% in the annual trend standard error relative to the Fixed Full-Matrix Method (FFM). Notably, even in the case of partial missing data, IAM yields significantly more effective cycles in the resulting elevation change time series compared to other methods. In 5 × 5 km grids of the RIS and FRIS, the time series constructed using the IAM algorithm show more effective cycles, increasing the average number of effective cycles by approximately 34% relative to FFM, improving the spatiotemporal resolution and continuity of the time series. This enhancement allows for more detailed and precise elevation change estimates over time."

This paper presents the GangaFlow - a real-time multimodal deep learning system designed for pollution analysis in the Ganga River using drone imagery. The system integrates YOLOv8 for object detection, U-Net for semantic segmentation, and AlexNet for image classification. The pre-processing steps included the conversion of the RGB colormap to HSV and data augmentation to enhance the models’ performances. The evaluation on the annotated drone image dataset resulted in significant improvements in accuracy, with an IoU of 0.5 for YOLOv8 at least and a 20% increment in IoU when compared to individual models. A 15% increase in F1-scores was signified, which is an indication of the robust detection and classification of pollutants. The scalable AI-driven GangaFlow is expected to make efficient large-scale monitoring of river pollution possible, furnishing policy-informative insights for regulators of the environment. GangaFlow has pioneered a novel real-time river pollution monitoring framework based on AI and has genuine practice relevance to large environmental management purposes."

This research explores how language use mediates conversations about misinformation by analyzing linguistic markers such as in-group cues, readability, and discourse connectives across different topics and communities. Findings indicate that discussions within echo chambers show a higher use of group identity signals and readability, making misinformation more persuasive and easily processed."

This paper proposes a direction of arrival (DOA) estimation structure based on a distributed polarizationsensitive array, which innovatively employs multiple non-coherent sub-arrays that can be flexibly positioned in different spatial locations according to actual application requirements. Through composite rotation transformations, a spatial diversity structure is formed, and by distributing two array elements to constitute a distributed architecture, the virtual array aperture is effectively expanded, thereby enhancing angle measurement performance. When applied to the classical Multiple Signal Classification (MUSIC) algorithm, the distributed polarization-sensitive array not only enables DOA estimation of the azimuth and elevation of incident signals but also significantly improves angular measurement performance and resolution capability."

Furthermore, we found in the research process that when the faulty arrays still maintain the symmetry property, the measurement tensor can be converted to the real-valued domain by the forward-backward averaging technique and the unitary transform technique. The new algorithm we proposed exploits the multidimensional structure of the signal without estimating the signal subspace. Comparing with traditional matrix completion methods, it has better performance in terms of robustness and resolving correlated targets. And the algorithm proposed in this paper does not require angle pairing. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm."

    "abstract": "Modern deduplication-based storage systems employ erasure coding to post-deduplicate data to ensure reliability. In the erasure-coded deduplicated storage systems, existing coding schemes mainly perform erasure coding over a single object (intra-object coding) to address the problems of degraded read performance and storage inefficiency. However, due to intra-object coding, traditional storage scaling schemes need to reorganize and relocate all stored data between the client and storage nodes to support storage scaling, which inevitably incurs substantial data transfer overhead, thereby degrading system scalability. In this paper, we propose a fast scaling scheme called QuickScale for erasure-coded deduplicated storage systems. QuickScale first implements the intra-object coding in a realistic distributed storage environment and verifies that this coding scheme can significantly alleviate the degraded read performance by 35%-67% and save storage space by 24% 30%. Motivated by these results, QuickScale uses a node-to-node scaling approach that avoids repeatedly transferring all stored data between the client and storage nodes during scaling, thereby improving the scalability. Experimental evaluations using six real-world datasets demonstrate that QuickScale achieves better scaling performance (in terms of scaling time during scaling) over the state-of-the-art scaling schemes by up to 63.5%-76.4%."

The formulation considers not only control settings of conventional VVO devices, e.g., voltage regulators, capacitor banks, and on-load tap changers, but also optimal settings for volt-var droop curves of distributed energy resources (DERs), compliant with the IEEE 1547-2018 standard. Instead of including the power flow equations in the optimization problem which makes it nonlinear and nonconvex, a power flow solver is utilized and the problem is solved by blackbox optimization (BBO). The feasibility of the derived solution is improved by using unbalanced power flow simulations. The solution is effective under various demand and DER generation scenarios such that device settings are not frequently changed, making it practical for in-field implementations. Through numerical simulations on IEEE test feeders, we illustrate the performance of the solutions of our proposed approach on both in-sample and out-of-sample scenarios. We show that our approach outperforms a benchmark reinforcement learning method, and is also scalable to large-scale distribution networks."

To improve the computational efficiency of the proposed method, the solution process using the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) is derived. Simulation results within a PD airborne radar context validate the effectiveness of the proposed methodologies."

    "abstract": "The Proof of Stake(PoS) consensus procedure has become a largely embraced option to the energy-demanding Proof of Work (PoW) contract, guaranteeing the integrity, reliability, and decentralization in the latest Blockchain programme. In a PoS system, staking procedures, validator and delegation functions, reward distribution processes, and governance control operations must be implemented accurately to maintain the system's security. This paper represents the formal verification and validation of Stake Manager key features, as verification of validators and delegators, setting staking tokens, reward evaluation and distribution, and authentication of the owner. This formal model is evolved using the Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP#), and this model is verified concerning critical safety and liveness properties defined in Linear Temporal Logic formula (LTL). The Process Analysis Toolkit (PAT) model checker is used to check these properties, containing accurate reward distribution and exclusion of deadlocks. This verification mechanism ensures that all processes work properly in all feasible execution states. The results ensure the reliability and security of the Stake Manager Contract and emphasize the efficacy of formal verification in securing the PoS blockchain structure."

    "abstract": "In recent years, Machine Learning (ML) models have been introduced across diverse scientific fields, due to their strong predictive performance. However, in many applications the demand for interpretable models often surpasses the need for mere accuracy. Symbolic Regression (SR) offers a solution with its concise and explainable formulas, yet it typically falls short in accuracy when compared to other ML models such as Random Forests. This paper proposes a novel two-step ensemble approach, inspired by the student-teacher model in knowledge distillation. Initially, a Gradient Boosting Model (GBM) is trained to harness its high accuracy; this model acts as the ‘teacher.’ Subsequently, an SR ’student’ model is trained on the output of the gradient boosting model, effectively distilling the knowledge into a form that combines interpretability with enhanced performance. We perform an extensive evaluation of this method across three different SR models and 10 regression datasets. Our findings show that the proposed method exhibits a consistent improvement of 3.3-6.7% in accuracy compared to standard SR models. Furthermore, this process serves as an explainability framework that helps to uncover and interpret the decisions of complex ML models."

    "abstract": "In this letter, we propose a strategy of engineering an ultralow-profile folded transmitarray (FTA) with low radar cross section (RCS). The architecture integrates a frequency selective rasorber (FSR), a transmissive-reflective metasurface (TRM), a focusing polarization-conversion metasurface (FPCM), and a feed horn. Two operation modes are engineered to simultaneously achieve high-gain radiation and low observability. For radiation, spherical waves from the feed are transformed by the TRM and FPCM into a high-gain beam. Therein, two asymmetric reflections are employed achieving an ultralow profile of 1/7 the focal length. For invisibility, out-of-band and in-band RCS reduction are achieved by FSR absorption and TRM scattering, respectively. For verification, a proof-of-concept prototype is numerically and experimentally characterized, indicating a measured peak gain of 24.6 dBi with a corresponding aperture efficiency of 26% at 14.1 GHz. In addition, a relative bandwidth of 10 dB RCS reduction is reached as 95.5% and 87.1% for co- and cross-polarized incident waves, respectively. Such a highly integrated stealth meta-FTA exhibits strong potential for stealth communication systems."

    "abstract": "Neural solvers for partial differential equations (PDEs) have shown remarkable potential across scientific computing and physics-informed learning. However, their performance often hinges on fragile feature dependencies, leading to poor generalization and vulnerability to input noise or domain shifts. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective trainingtime perturbation scheme that improves generalization by injecting structured, semantically irrelevant signals into the input space. Specifically, we randomly replace small, localized regions of the input with constant values, thereby compelling the model to focus on predictive patterns that remain stable under partial information loss. We formally analyze the learning dynamics and show that such perturbations induce an implicit feature selection mechanism, which we term Perturbation-Induced Implicit Focus (PIIF). This mechanism arises as the model progressively suppresses unstable or co-dependent input dimensions and prioritizes those that consistently yield informative gradients across masked configurations. Applied to neural PDE solvers, our method improves both cross-domain generalization and robustness to partial corruption, without requiring architectural changes or auxiliary supervision. The results suggest that structured irrelevance serves as an effective inductive bias, guiding neural solvers to discover physically meaningful and resilient representations."

However, SNN models are inherently difficult to train and require a large amount of labeled data to achieve satisfactory performance. To reduce the reliance on large labeled datasets, active learning and transfer learning methods have been introduced in the field of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). However, their application to SNNs remains in the early stages of exploration. In this paper, we propose ATSNN, an active transfer learning method for SNNs, which effectively addresses both domain adaptation and the scarcity of labeled samples during model training. First, we design a joint domain adaptation loss function to enhance transfer learning within the SNN architecture. Second, an active learning strategy is employed to provide higher-quality labeled data for the target domain, further improving transfer learning performance. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that ATSNN improves SNN performance in the target domain while requiring fewer labeled samples."

    "abstract": "In the domain of real-time data processing, challenges such as network hopping—where communication nodes switch frequently—frame loss caused by link congestion or interference, and data duplication from redundant transmissions often disrupt the stability of real-time data comparisons, leading to inconsistent or unreliable results. To address these issues, this study proposes a dual-constraint calculation method that limits both the time range and the number of comparison points. Specifically, it dynamically adjusts the time window to focus on relevant data segments and selects key comparison nodes to balance density and efficiency, ensuring neither excessive computational load nor critical data omission. The algorithm integrates real-time time alignment, employing timestamp synchronization and interpolation techniques to calibrate misaligned or delayed data onto a unified timeline, aligning disparate data streams accurately despite network delays. It further incorporates outlier-resistant calculations through robust statistical approaches, effectively identifying and mitigating anomalies caused by frame loss or interference, such as extreme value deviations. When applied to data comparison software, experimental results demonstrate that the new algorithm significantly reduces the adverse impacts of network instability and data outliers. This enhancement ensures reliable data analysis and supports informed decision-making in dynamic network environments."

    "abstract": "As digital design methodologies and tools are evolving to higher abstraction levels, teaching the low-level concepts of digital electronic system design is becoming increasingly challenging. The raise of the design abstraction level and, more recently, the ability of AI -assisted automated design is pushing the interest of students away from the lower-level details of the digital world. Nevertheless, digital electronic systems are (still) made of transistors, gates and flip-flops, and people do need to keep this basic knowledge to be able to build efficient circuits, understand them and develop the essential electronic design automation tools. For learning these subjects, hands-on experimentation, and learning by doing, is proven to be an effective tool, and when students finally see and feel the results of their designs, motivation raises rapidly. This paper presents the technical aspects of a platform created in the DECEL project to support an FPGA-based remote laboratory based on a commercial single-board computer that can be located somewhere in the Internet. This computer runs a Linux operating system and is based on an AMD/XILINX device that integrates in the same chip an ARM Cortex A9 CPU and a region of FPGA programmable logic. The user develops a digital circuit using standard hardware-description languages (Verilog or VHDL) and runs the implementation tools for the target FPGA using a very simple web interface running in a remote server."

    "abstract": "A wideband, compact monopolar patch antenna with an inherent filtering response is presented in this paper. By employing a slot-assisted mode-tailoring technique, the field distributions of several higher-order modes at the patch center are engineered to produce a stable monopolar radiation pattern with enhanced bandwidth. The closed-form analysis indicates that increasing the current intensity at the central region can transform the conventional TM<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">22</sub> mode into one that exhibits a monopolar pattern. This concept is realized by incorporating four slanted slots at the corners of the patch, which constrain the surface current toward the patch center. Besides, these slots also excite an additional slot mode, which serves as a second resonance. At higher frequencies, the slots continue to confine the current distribution of the original TM<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">33</sub> mode to a small central region and thereby forming a quasi-TM<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">01</sub> monopolar radiation. By combining the three engineered resonances, the proposed single-layer patch achieves a significantly improved bandwidth. (The simulated and measured impedance bandwidths (S11 < -10 dB) are 26.9% and 27.1% respectively). More importantly, the proposed antenna preserves a stable radiation pattern even when the ground-plane size changes. This robustness arises from the slot-assisted mode-tailoring scheme, which strongly confines the current distribution to the central region of the patch. The small-footprint prototype realizes peak gains of 6.92 dBi in simulation and 6.42 dBi in measurement. To ensure the application of the proposed antenna on a vehicle, a large-scale simulation has been performed to verify the wide impedance bandwidth, realized gain and consistent radiation patterns when the antenna is positioned on the roof of a car. While good in-band results are obtained. Radiation nulls are observed near the band edges, resulting from the mutual cancellation of radiated fields. With its broad bandwidth, stable monopolar radiation, and built-in filtering (stopband gain not exceeding 0 dBi), the proposed antenna offers an attractive solution for modern wireless platforms demanding compact form factors and robust interference immunity."

    "abstract": "Objective: To reduce variability in chest radiography (CXR) from acquisition and post-processing, and assess whether harmonization improves image quality and down-stream diagnostic performance. Methods: A generative adversarial network (GAN) was trained exclusively on virtual images produced by a Virtual Imaging Trial (VIT). The model maps non-harmonized CXRs to noise-free, unprocessed references using a dual U-Net with contrastive loss. Evaluation spanned virtual, physical-phantom, and clinical data using generic (GIQMs) and chest-specific (CIQMs) metrics. A phantom benchmark compared the method with ComBat harmonization and a conventional denoising algorithm. Clinical generalization was tested on VinDr-CXRs, examining feature compactness via Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP). We also assessed NIH-CXRs, quantifying diagnostic accuracy with bootstrap uncertainty. Results: Compared with non-harmonized images, harmonized CXRs yielded approximately 89% lower NRMSE, 50% higher PSNR, and 86% higher SSIM. On phantom data, CIQM variability fell from 0.255 to 0.026 and was reduced more consistently than with ComBat or denoising. Clinical analyses on VinDr-CXRs showed tighter UMAP clusters for harmonized features, indicating suppression of acquisition-related variability. On NIH-CXRs, training and testing a classifier in the harmonized domain improved diagnostic accuracy over the non-harmonized domain and lowered cross-domain sensitivity; pleural and cardiac categories showed consistent gains, while texture-dependent labels exhibited task-dependent effects. Conclusion: VIT-guided training enables a GAN to harmonize CXRs toward a raw reference, improving quantification variability and harmonizing image representations across systems. Significance: The proposed virtual-to-clinical strategy is scalable and generalizable, offering a practical path to standardized CXR appearance and reliable downstream detection across institutions."

    "abstract": "Seizure prediction is of paramount clinical importance for optimizing interventions and improving patient quality of life. Recent advancements in ECG-based seizure prediction have garnered attention due to their potential for portability and ease of data collection. However, existing methods primarily focus either on heart rate variability (HRV) to capture ECG trends or on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for local feature extraction, but often fail to effectively combine both global and local information, limiting the prediction performance. To address this challenge, we propose the Progressive Feature Fusion Mamba (PFFMamba) network for ECG-based seizure prediction. PFFMamba enhances prediction accuracy in two key ways. First, it utilizes Mamba’s selective scanning mechanism to focus on important historical data while discarding irrelevant information, enabling the model to effectively capture subtle local variations and the long-term dependencies among them. Second, we introduce a progressive feature fusion structure to overcome Mamba’s limitation in combining parallel features and align with the hierarchical nature of features at different stages. This structure integrates frequency channels in the shallow layers, feature channels in the intermediate layers, and HRV representations in the deep layers, ensuring robust feature interaction throughout the network. By combining these strategies, PFFMamba extracts features that embody both long-term dependencies and multi-perspective representations. We evaluate our approach through seizure prediction experiments and demonstrate that PFFMamba achieves a sensitivity of 96.7%, a false prediction rate of 0.548/h, an AUC of 0.775 on the USTC Epileptic ECG database and a sensitivity of 95.9%, a false prediction rate of 0.641/h, an AUC of 0.724 on the Siena database, surpassing current state-of-the-art methods."

    "abstract": "Traffic accidents are a major public safety issue, causing widespread harm and economic losses due to factors like human error, adverse weather, and vehicle malfunctions. Unintentional collisions between cars or between cars and pedestrians are known as traffic accidents, and they frequently cause serious injuries, fatalities, and substantial property damage. Usually, bad weather, inadequate road infrastructure, distracted or intoxicated driving, and driver error are the causes of these events. Drivers must follow safety precautions to reduce these dangers, such as following traffic laws, keeping their cars in good condition, wearing seat belts and helmets, and avoiding distractions while operating a motor vehicle. Predicting traffic accidents accurately is essential for putting preventative safety measures into place, lessening the demand on emergency services, and eventually saving lives. In order to predict the severity of traffic accidents, we provide a deep learning-driven method in this study that blends Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with conventional machine learning models, such as Random Forest (RF), Logistic Regression (LR), and XGBoost. High-level spatial features are extracted from raw traffic data using CNNs and then fed into machine learning classifiers to provide precise predictions. According to our experimental findings, the CNN + XGBoost model outperformed CNN + RF (93%) and CNN + LR (92%), achieving an accuracy of 95%. This integrated strategy demonstrates how deep learning and machine learning may be combined to improve prediction performance and offer insightful information for managing traffic safety."

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant utility in a wide range of applications; however, their deployment is plagued by security vulnerabilities, notably jailbreak attacks. These attacks manipulate LLMs to generate harmful or unethical content by crafting adversarial prompts. While much of the current research on jailbreak attacks has focused on single-turn interactions, it has largely overlooked the impact of historical dialogues on model behavior. Although recent studies have explored multi-turn jailbreak attacks, they generally assume that the attacker can only manipulate the user prompt. In contrast, we highlight that an attacker can also control the model’s previous outputs. To this end, we introduce DIA, a new paradigm that leverages fabricated dialogue history to enhance jailbreak effectiveness. DIA operates in a black-box setting, requiring only access to the chat API or knowledge of the LLM’s chat template. We propose two methods for constructing adversarial historical dialogues: one adapts gray-box prefilling attacks, and the other exploits deferred responses. Our experiments demonstrate that DIA achieves state-of-the-art attack success rates on recent LLMs, including Llama-3.1 and GPT-4o. Additionally, we show that DIA can bypass 6 different defense mechanisms, highlighting its robustness."

    "abstract": "The geometry-based point cloud compression algorithm achieves efficient compression and transmission for LiDAR point clouds with high sparsity. However, the low-bitrate mode results in severe geometry compression artifacts, which involve both point reduction and coordinate offset. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to directly enhance the geometry quality for compressed LiDAR point cloud (CLGE) in a post-processing manner. Our proposed method consists of two branches: cylindrical densification and adaptive refinement. The former adopts a multi-scale sparse convolution framework to effectively extract spatial features in the cylindrical coordinate system and generate dense candidate points quickly. Large asymmetric sparse convolution kernels are also designed to capture the shapes of different regions and objects. The latter branch refines the candidate points through several MLP layers, which takes the neighborhood features between the candidate points and the input points into account. Finally, the designed ring-based farthest point resampling serves as an effective alternative for achieving the target number while maintaining the geometry distribution. Extensive experiments conducted on several datasets verify the effectiveness of our approach under different compression artifact levels. Furthermore, our method is easily extended to upsampling and is robust to noise. In addition to the geometry signal quality improvement, the point cloud enhanced by our proposed method alleviates the performance degradation in object detection task due to compression distortion."

    "abstract": "Telemedicine has the potential to enhance both the accessibility and quality of healthcare services. Patients can access telemedicine through various modes, one of which is via applications. Evaluating the task–technology fit (TTF) of telemedicine applications is essential to ensure that they effectively meet user needs and, in particular, support physicians’ tasks in delivering remote healthcare services. However, no instrument has been specifically developed to assess the TTF of telemedicine applications from the physician’s perspective. This study, therefore, aimed to develop and validate a questionnaire-based instrument for evaluating the TTF of telemedicine applications from the physician’s perspective. A mixed-methods approach was employed, consisting of two phases. In the first phase, the instrument was developed through a literature review, interviews, and expert feedback. In the second phase, the instrument was validated through assessments of content validity, face validity, construct validity (convergent and discriminant), reliability (internal consistency), and predictive validity. Content and face validity were assessed by six experts and ten physicians, respectively. Construct validity, reliability, and predictive validity were evaluated using data from 185 physicians and analyzed with Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM). The final TTF instrument, named Telemedicine Application Task–Technology Fit Questionnaire (TATTFQ), comprises 36 items across nine dimensions. The findings indicate that the developed TTF instrument has adequate relevance, reliability, and validity, making it suitable for evaluating the TTF of telemedicine applications from the physicians’ perspective. This instrument has strong potential for widespread use in evaluation and development programs aimed at optimizing telemedicine applications."

However, models and parameter estimation methods for bifacial modules remain limited largely due to varying interpretations of rear irradiance effects. An approach to address that issue is the standardization of models in line with the IEC TS 60904-1-2 standard. This study proposes a bifacial module model based on that standard featuring two current sources, each representing front and rear irradiances, and introduces bifaciality coefficient as a new parameter to be estimated. A conventional half-cell bifacial photovoltaic module with 655 W was tested in a solar simulator, and the resulting data were used for simulations and parameter estimation of the proposed model by a mean–variance mapping optimization algorithm. According to the results, the model can effectively estimate the parameters and represent the bifacial photovoltaic module comprehensively due to its low error rates and a strong fit to <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$I$</tex-math></inline-formula>–<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$V$</tex-math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$P$</tex-math></inline-formula>–<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$V$</tex-math></inline-formula> curves.

Existing solutions, including watermarking, statistical analysis, stylistic detection, and machine learning-based approaches are promising for detecting AIGT. Still, When it comes to combating text obfuscation techniques such as adversarial attacks and other strategies intended to mislead text origin, these methods often encounter significant obstacles. This survey focuses on the effectiveness of current detection methods in the presence of attacks such as paraphrasing. We investigate the limitations of existing detectors, their robustness against adversarial strategies and the changing field of detection methods. We also explore the role of datasets in developing robust detectors and the challenges they face in simulating real-world scenarios. From recent research work, we aim to provide insights to improve detection methods on post-attack text, identify gaps in the current state-of-the-art, and offer actionable recommendations for future work. Our study highlights the need to advance detection solutions to ensure trust and responsibility in AI-generated text systems."

The time-frequency analysis graph of the signal is treated as an image for processing. Firstly, a convolutional neural network (CNN) is utilized to determine the SNR of the mixed signal. Then, an Auto-Encoder (AE) is improved by adding an encoding layer to enhance its ability to extract signal features. Subsequently, network parameters corresponding to different SNR conditions are obtained through training. Finally, based on different SNRs, the corresponding network parameters are loaded to achieve the recognition and de-noising of noisy signals. Through simulation experiments and algorithm comparisons, it can be concluded that the method proposed in this paper has significant advantages in signal recognition and parameter acquisition."

Considering the dynamic nature of wireless communications, e.g., the varying number of accessing users and the changing rate requirements, we propose a scalable and adaptive approach by integrating graph neural network (GNN) with meta-learning. In particular, the problem of maximizing the achievable uplink sum rate is formulated by optimizing the beamforming matrix of each access point (AP), while accounting for the requirement of user rate. To tackle this non-convex optimization problem, we develop a joint-Reptile-enhanced GNN approach. Therein, the uplink CF-MIMO network is modeled as a heterogeneous graph with cooperative node features, and the joint-Reptile approach is employed to obtain adaptive and generalizable meta-parameters, enabling rapid adaptation to dynamic CF-MIMO networks. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach exhibits better adaptability compared to conventional initialization benchmarks. Moreover, it can achieve higher sum rate performance across various signal dimensions, while maintaining scalability."

The testbed comprises 24 spatially distributed transmission point (TP) units, each with 2 antenna ports, centrally coordinated by a baseband unit (BBU). Orthogonal pilot signals are transmitted from all TP units, enabling each user equipment (UE) to perform downlink channel estimation and provide explicit channel state information (CSI) feedback to the BBU. The centralized unit then aggregates these channel vectors into a full CSI matrix and computes a zero-forcing precoder which is applied to both demodulation reference signals and user data. An adaptive modulation algorithm is employed that selects the modulation order for each UE in every subframe based on a pre-defined performance metric, allowing the system to adapt to varying channel conditions. Using this architecture, our testbed spatially multiplexes 17 single-antenna UEs in real time and achieves an average per-user spectral efficiency of 2.94 bits/s/Hz/UE, significantly outperforming existing implementations. All the findings are supported by extensive real-world experimental evaluations conducted using the testbed."

Despite their potential, training SNNs with Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) incurs substantial memory overhead owing to temporal dependencies. Recent studies have explored online learning algorithms for SNN training, which update network weights using temporally local information and thus circumvent the high memory demands of BPTT. However, during inference, the discrepancy in output spike distributions across different time steps compromises the reliability of the final average spike rate when calculating instantaneous loss. To address this, we introduce a divergence term (Kullback-Leibler Divergence) into the instantaneous loss function, minimizing inter-time-step output distribution variations. Experiments on both static and neuromorphic datasets demonstrate that the proposed loss function achieves competitive performance."

We propose an infrared-guided adaptive gamma correction framework that enhances RGB images by leveraging an IR visibility prior to regulate target luminance, and preserve structure. Building on local adaptive gamma correction, our method integrates variance gating, spatial smoothing, and a highlight-protection mechanism that progressively attenuates enhancement in bright regions. To improve generalization, we further use the correction as probabilistic data augmentation so detectors learn invariance to enhancement. Evaluated on the multi-modal dataset from the “Multi-modal Low Slow Small Target Detection Competition,” the approach improves performance on two architectures, yielding higher recall and notable gains. Our submission ranked first on the official leaderboard, indicating strong real-world applicability. The results show that IR-guided, artifact-aware enhancement coupled with augmentation is an effective recipe for reliable anti-UAV detection under challenging conditions."

    "abstract": "The YOLO series exhibits unique advantages in remote sensing image target recognition tasks due to its end-to-end efficient inference mode and real-time detection capabilities. However, it still struggles to fully address the inherent challenges of remote sensing target detection. For instance, the traditional Spatial Pyramid Pooling (SPP) module lacks explicit feature enhancement, resulting in the loss of small target information. Additionally, attention mechanisms inadequately model the long-range dependencies between targets and complex backgrounds in remote sensing scenes.To tackle these issues, this paper proposes a You Only Look Once network based on Channel and Spatial Multi-scale Fusion (CSMF-YOLO), which integrates the SPPF_Fusion and Spatial - Channel Collaborative Attention(SCCA) modules. Experimental results on the DOTA remote sensing dataset demonstrate that this method improves the mean average precision (mAP) by $4.8 \\%-7.8 \\%$ compared to the original YOLOv8, with particularly significant performance improvements in small target detection and complex background scenarios. The innovations of this paper lie in constructing a hierarchical processing framework of “feature enhancement -multi-scale fusion - attention optimization.” It is the first to combine multi-scale pooling with explicit feature enhancement to handle the scale variations of remote sensing targets. By using adaptive branch attention, it resolves the problem of weight allocation in small target feature fusion. Moreover, it enhances the global contextual understanding ability through the collaborative modeling of spatial and channel attention, providing a superior technical solution for small target detection in remote sensing images."

The root cause of the FLL-induced adverse effects is first examined, revealing that, despite the symmetrical structure of the SOGI-FLL, it introduces asymmetrical dq-frame coupling terms into the VSC control. This results in significant sequence impedance coupling and negative resistance behaviors. To this end, a nonlinear synchronization phase compensation factor is designed to balance the uncovered asymmetrical coupling terms, thereby minimizing the FC. Additionally, to address the negative resistance issue, an impedance phase compensation function with two degrees of freedom is further proposed to regulate the impedance phase and effectively narrow the frequency range of negative resistance. Last, experiments are conducted to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach."

As per the literature, recently, EAs have been extensively used to design optimal digital FIR filters, for various applications. The design task is to evaluate the best filter coefficients so as to satisfy the desired criteria and constraints, if any. To design a digital FIR filter using EA, the design task is formulated as a cost function (error function), which is optimized (minimized) to solve for the coefficients of the digital FIR filter. This paper presents a comparison among the design of digital FIR filters, such as low-pass, high-pass, band-pass and band-stop, using different EAs. The EAs considered in this work are Genetic Algorithm (GA), Particle Swarm optimization (PSO), Simulated Annealing (SA), Artificial Bee Colony (ABC), Ant Colony Optimzation (ACO), Teaching-Learning Based Optimization (TLBO), Cuckoo Search Optimization (CSO), Jaya Algorithm (JA), Bat Algorithm (BA), Fire Fly Algorithm (FF) and Cat Swarm Optimization Algorithm (CSA).

Sentiment scores were combined with structured features to train Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost classifiers. Random Forest achieved the highest performance (F1-score: 0.8440). SHAP explainability highlighted key features like lead_time, adr, and Sentiment_Score. The framework enhances prediction accuracy and supports real-time deployment in hotel CRM systems for proactive cancellation mitigation."

    "abstract": "Due to the inherent intermittency of solar energy, photovoltaic (PV) microinverters (MIs) often operate under prolonged light-load conditions. To improve energy utilization, this paper proposes a novel online iterative trajectory optimization (OITO) strategy for the single-stage series resonant dual-active-bridge (DAB) MI to enhance the light-load efficiency. Through the zero-voltage switching (ZVS) condition analysis, the all-switch ZVS constraint is constructed. On this basis, a ZVS-constrained real-time iteration algorithm is developed to optimize inductor RMS current, with particular emphasis on minimizing the RMS current under light loads. By analyzing the constraint priorities and iteratively solving boundary equations with switching-frequency limits, the optimal trajectory of degrees of freedom (DOFs) is derived. Compared with conventional DAB MIs, the proposed strategy achieves a wider ZVS range while producing reduced inductor RMS current, which improves the light-load efficiency of the MIs. Accordingly, a GaN-based MI prototype is built, and the proposed strategy is validated, achieving a peak efficiency of 97.21%."

    "abstract": "Sampling-based Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT) / RRT* algorithms are widely used to solve motion planning problems and have been improved and developed over the decades. However, most of the algorithmic improvements result in only near-optimal paths for their generation. To overcome this problem, this paper proposes improved algorithms, Optimized Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (O-RRT*), which can truly optimize the paths to the optimum in finite time. First, ORRT * applies the attraction effect to obstacles to form partial optimal vertices. Then, the path is optimized by creating a new parent node through the combination of dichotomy and attractive potential field. Next, the goal-bias strategy expansion is used to reach the goal area quickly when no obstacle between vertexes and the goal. All tree node expansion processes are affected by the attractive potential field. In the comparison experimental results with the state-of-the-art algorithms Quick-Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (Q-RRT*) and Flexible Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (F-RRT*), it can be concluded that O-RRT* not only outperforms the other algorithms in terms of initial solution and convergence, but also truly succeeds in converging to the optimal path in finite time."

Traditional navigation systems often focus on saving time, neglecting the safety aspect of travel. This study addresses this gap by proposing a solution that incorporates crime data into pathfinding algorithms to recommend safer routes for commuters. To achieve this, we turn to data-driven techniques that allow us to understand and map urban risk more effectively. We leverage K-Means clustering to group crime points and identify crime hotspots. Additionally, our approach introduces a new metric: the Danger Index, which quantifies the risk of each cluster based on crime count and severity. These values are integrated into the cost function of the pathfinding algorithm. Through a comparative analysis of A*, Graph Neural Networks (GNN), and Dijkstra’s algorithm, we found A* to be the best fit as it effectively balances safety, distance, computational efficiency, and memory usage. Specifically, A* reduced danger exposure by around 25-30% compared to its alternatives, making it a practical choice for real-time, safety-focused navigation."

    "abstract": "This paper is concerned with the data-driven state baseline modeling and fault detection problem for aero-engines. Long-term operations can result in performance degradation of aero-engines, which naturally causes the state baseline being varied at different stages of performance degradation and further increases false alarm and missed detection rate of fault detection. To tackle this problem, a deep neural network is first designed to learn the state evolution behavior and generate state baseline. Moreover, a multi-step reciprocal prediction method is developed to characterize the state prediction error and enhance the accuracy of state baseline modeling. Then a fault detector is designed by means of the state baseline to perform fault detection. Furthermore, a variable period state baseline update mechanism combining fuzzy logic system and periodic update is proposed to match the performance degradation so as to ensure the accuracy of fault detector and reduce false alarm. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed state baseline modeling and fault detection method is verified through an aero-engine example. Numerical results show that the proposed method reduces the prediction error by an average of 42.8% compared with other advanced methods, while achieving a fault detection accuracy of 98.0% without performance degradation and 96.0% with 2% performance degradation."

This study introduces the concept of Trustworthy Dataset Proof (TDP), which tackles the significant challenge of verifying the authenticity of training data as declared by trainers. Existing dataset provenance methods, which primarily aim at ownership verification rather than trust enhancement, often face challenges with usability and integrity. For instance, excessive operational demands and the inability to effectively verify dataset authenticity hinder their practical application. To address these shortcomings, we propose a novel technique termed Data Probe, which diverges from traditional watermarking by utilizing subtle variations in model output distributions to confirm the presence of a specific and small subset of training data. This model-agnostic approach improves usability by minimizing the intervention during the training process and ensures dataset integrity via a mechanism that only permits probe detection when the entire claimed dataset is utilized in training. Our study conducts extensive evaluations to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed data-probe-based TDP framework, marking a significant step toward achieving transparency and trustworthiness in the use of training data in deep learning."

    "abstract": "The JT-60 Super Advanced (JT-60SA) was built as part of a project aimed at the early realization of fusion energy. The JT-60SA is used to support and complement work for ITER and to develop young fusion scientists and engineers. The superconducting coil system of the JT-60SA includes the toroidal field (TF) coils, equilibrium field (EF) coils, and central solenoid (CS) modules. Each TF coil is monitored by the quench detection voltage (QDV) system, which compares voltages at adjacent TF coils using a bridge circuit. The EF coils do not produce a voltage in the TF coils because, ideally, the TF coils are orthogonal to the EF coils. However, when the EF coils are energized, the QDV in the TF coils sometimes exceeds the threshold, falsely detecting quenches, which leads to the discharge of a TF current. It is believed that a magnetic flux from the EF coils passing through the TF coils may occur due to coil misalignment during installation and inadequate clearance design. As a result, an induced voltage could be generated in the TF coils. To understand how other coils influence the TF QDV system and to ensure the stable operation of the JT-60SA, it is crucial to investigate the cause of the induced voltage in the TF coils. In this study, a coil misalignment model was developed using finite element analysis software. This model was used to calculate the mutual inductance between the TF and EF coils. Furthermore, a circuit simulation model of the TF QDV system was created to quantitatively analyze the induced voltage caused by the misalignment of superconducting coils."

This study explores how women in Pakistan's software industry are treated in comparison to their male counterparts, and how this affects their mental health. It specifically examines three key stress factors (stressors) and six types of stress responses (strains). The study captures the frequency of experiences related to each stressor and strain from 337 Pakistani software professionals. Survey results and analysis reveal that women in the software sector experience significantly higher levels of stress than men, with burnout being the most prominent outcome. As working women play a vital role in both the global and Pakistani economies, it is crucial to understand and address their unique challenges in order to enhance their mental well-being and overall productivity."

    "abstract": "Few-shot recognition in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery remains a critical bottleneck for real-world applications due to extreme data scarcity. A promising strategy involves synthesizing a large dataset with a generative adversarial network (GAN), pre-training a model via self-supervised learning (SSL), and then fine-tuning on the few labeled samples. However, this approach faces a fundamental paradox: conventional GANs themselves require abundant data for stable training, contradicting the premise of few-shot learning. To resolve this, we propose the consistency-regularized generative adversarial network (Cr-GAN), a novel framework designed to synthesize diverse, high-fidelity samples even when trained under these severe data limitations. Cr-GAN introduces a dual-branch discriminator that decouples adversarial training from representation learning. This architecture enables a channel-wise feature interpolation strategy to create novel latent features, complemented by a dual-domain cycle consistency mechanism that ensures semantic integrity. Our Cr-GAN framework is adaptable to various GAN architectures, and its synthesized data effectively boosts multiple SSL algorithms. Extensive experiments on the MSTAR and SRSDD datasets validate our approach, with Cr-GAN achieving a highly competitive accuracy of 71.21% and 51.64%, respectively, in the 8-shot setting, significantly outperforming leading baselines, while requiring only ~5% of the parameters of state-of-the-art diffusion models.

    "abstract": "This article deals with the correction of cross-scan errors in polygon mirror (PM)-based laser scanning systems by active error compensation (AEC) using a fast-steering mirror (FSM). However, AEC is susceptible to sensor noncollocation errors since the FSM is typically controlled via an internal angular sensor. This sensor error can be evaluated by position measurements of the scanning laser, but these measurements are not always feasible due to the inherent duty cycle of PM-based scanning systems. Image-based iterative AEC (II-AEC) is proposed to use partial measurements to address the sensor noncollocation error, thereby improving the precision of PM-based scanning systems. II-AEC consists of a cascade structure where the inner loop employs iterative learning control for the FSM using the internal sensor, and the outer loop iterates the inner loop reference based on the laser positions measured by a complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) sensor. II-AEC has been implemented and evaluated on a PM-based stereolithography apparatus, resulting in a 40-fold printing precision improvement compared to the uncompensated apparatus."

    "abstract": "Influence maximization has been extensively studied in the context of social networks. In recent years, increasing attention has been paid to ensuring fairness in the diffusion process, aiming to prevent underrepresentation or systematic disadvantage of certain groups. However, existing approaches typically rely on hand-crafted heuristics or meta-heuristics, which often require substantial expert knowledge and computational resources. Meanwhile, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in reasoning, optimization, and knowledge generalization across various domains. Despite their success, there is still a lack of research leveraging LLMs to guide influence maximization, particularly under fairness constraints. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that integrates an LLM-informed surrogate model into a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm for Fair Influence Maximization (FIM). This approach jointly optimizes influence and group fairness while reducing computational burden with an LLM-assisted evolution process and a Kriging-based surrogate. Experimental studies on real-world datasets show the competitiveness of the proposed method in achieving a balanced trade-off between influence propagation and fairness."

Traditional EEG-based seizure prediction methods rely on high-density electrode configurations, which limit their applicability due to complexity and poor wearability. This study aims to develop an epileptic seizure prediction and detection system based on limited EEG channels that enhances usability while maintaining effective performance. The proposed method implements a three-class classification for seizure prediction, seizure detection and normal state identification. It incorporates three key components: (1) an adaptive overlapping EEG data segmentation module using sliding windows to mitigate class imbalance, (2) a dual-branch neural network model that separately extracts and fuses time domain and frequency-domain features, (3) a patient-specific adaptation mechanism to optimize system performance. The entire system operates using only four EEG channels located at the forehead and behind the ears to maintain wearability. Finally, it achieves an average sensitivity of 86.2% for seizure prediction and 98.3% for seizure detection, with a false prediction rate of $0.1 / \\mathrm{h}$ at the event level on the CHB-MIT dataset. In conclusion, the proposed system can effectively offer a practical solution for home-based epilepsy monitoring and mobile healthcare."

Specifically, the angle of target is random and unknown, while its prior information can be leveraged for radar waveform design. To utilize this, we first derive a posterior Cramér-Rao bound (PCRB) as a theoretical lower bound for direction-ofarrival estimation error, and then formulate a PCRB-oriented waveform optimization problem under transmit power and peak-to-average-power ratio constraints. To simplify exploitation, we further propose a novel beampattern metric, probability weighted mainlobe level (PWML), and formulate a PWML-oriented waveform design problem that maximizes the lowest PWML. Efficient algorithms are proposed for these formulated waveform design problems. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed waveform optimization algorithms. It also yields practical guidelines for selecting appropriate waveform design strategies based on the characteristics of prior information: the PCRBoriented design is more effective under low prior uncertainty, while the PWML-oriented design performs better with high prior uncertainty."

    "abstract": "Super-enhancers (SEs), comprising clusters of transcriptional regulatory elements, play essential roles in gene expression regulation and cell fate determination. Current computational methods for identifying SEs from genomic sequences face challenges in prediction accuracy and cross-species generalizability. This study introduces TransSE, a deep learning framework combining convolutional and recurrent neural networks with cross-species transfer learning for SE prediction. TransSE employs a two-phase strategy: pre-training on combined human and mouse data to learn conserved regulatory features, followed by species-specific fine-tuning to capture organism-specific patterns. Evaluation on human and mouse datasets demonstrates that TransSE achieves superior accuracy compared to existing methods including SENet, DeepSE, and transformer-based models (DNABERT, Enformer), with AUC values of 0.828 (human) and 0.832 (mouse). Ablation studies confirm that convolutional blocks are essential for feature extraction, while transfer learning and recurrent layers provide meaningful performance improvements. Feature analysis reveals that TransSE distinguishes SEs from typical enhancers based on learned sequence representations, achieving 10.4-fold improvement in clustering metrics. The model demonstrates effective cross-species prediction capability, maintaining AUC <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\gt $</tex-math></inline-formula> 0.79 when trained on one species and evaluated on another. Conservation pattern analysis shows that TransSE integrates both evolutionarily conserved and species-specific regulatory features, enabling robust performance across organisms with limited training data.

Case studies using experimentally validated SEs demonstrate the tool's utility for investigating regulatory elements and prioritizing functional variants in disease-associated genomic regions. TransSE advances the investigation of gene regulatory mechanisms and facilitates identification of disease-associated variation in enhancer regions."

    "abstract": "The prediction of thyroid cancer recurrence is a critical task in clinical decision-making, yet traditional machine learning models face significant challenges, particularly around data privacy, model generalization with huge datasets, and interpretability. In healthcare, patient data is sensitive and sharing it across institutions for model training raises privacy concerns. This research addresses these issues by utilizing federated learning (FL), a decentralized machine learning approach that allows institutions to collaboratively train a model while ensuring patient data remains private. FL enables local model training at each institution, with only model updates shared across participants, safeguarding sensitive data. Alongside federated learning, the study incorporates Explainable AI (XAI) techniques to enhance the transparency of predictions, enabling clinicians to interpret and trust the model’s decision-making process. By combining multiple machine learning models in an ensemble approach, the research improves the prediction accuracy and robustness of thyroid cancer recurrence, even with limited data. The method is evaluated using a cohort dataset of thyroid cancer patients, with synthetic data augmentation addressing data scarcity. The results demonstrate that the approach outperforms traditional models while addressing critical challenges of data privacy and model interpretability. This proposed model outperforms previous methods, significantly higher than the best result on same dataset from prior work. Additionally, our model shows superior performance even when trained on larger datasets, confirming its generalizability and robustness."

    "abstract": "Transferable adversarial examples (AEs) are visually indistinguishable from benign images, but can successfully mislead unknown deep neural networks. However, existing AEs normally vary considerably from benign images in the feature space, making them hard to pass label checking and adversarial detection. Therefore, how to make AEs camouflaged, disguising as benign images during detection is still an open problem. In this paper, we propose a novel camouflaged adversarial attack (CAA), which produces camouflaged adversarial examples (CAEs) for the first time. Our main idea is to make CAEs’ adversarial properties keep “dormant” state until the target model inadvertently triggers the “activated” state. To this end, we craft <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">attack</i> and <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">camouflage</i> perturbations, so that CAEs are visually and feature/label-wise indistinguishable from benign images at first, but will implicitly turn into AEs once being triggered. Specifically, we exploit two common preprocessing operations, image scaling and JPEG compression, as the trigger, and propose a two-stage optimization strategy. As the preprocessing details of target models are unknown, the first stage trains a well-designed generative adversarial network under varying scaling/compression parameters to enhance the robustness of attack perturbations. The second stage uses feature (dis)similarities and contrastive distances to improve the transferability of camouflage perturbations. Extensive experiments on ImageNet dataset validate the effectiveness of CAA. Especially for robust models, the average fooling rate after preprocessing could reach 96.3% outperforming the state-of-the-art adversarial attack by 13.5%."

    "abstract": "Plants are very necessary and important for humans and their lives. Therefore, it is very necessary to identify and understand the plant's disease in order to cure it. Due to the growing problems in agriculture, timely and accurate detection of diseases has gained popularity in recent times. Most existing models for plant disease classification generally focus solely on maximizing accuracy. However, they neglect or do not consider efficiency on low-resource devices. Additionally, they often fail to reliably handle rare disease classes or field-acquired images. Therefore, this study aims to develop an efficient, accurate, and interpretable deep learning model capable of overcoming these limitations in practical deployment scenarios. In this work, InceptionV3, a lightweight convolutional neural network, was fine-tuned using transfer learning on the comprehensive “New Plant Diseases Dataset” comprising over 87,000 labeled images of healthy and diseased plants. The reliability of the model was improved by expanding the data for a specific class. It was therefore evaluated based on real-world scenarios, such as images with noise, motion blur, and challenging lighting conditions. The results of the experiments show that Inception V3 is accurate and comparable to deeper networks such as Inception-ResNet-V2. Despite this, it also significantly reduces computational complexity and inference time. Our visualization using Grad-CAM gives us consistent results and, moreover, highlights areas that show disease damage. This improves interpretability. Our model creates an affordable and effective plant disease detection system that is highly suitable for use in agricultural settings and does not require a lot of resources."

    "abstract": "The cyberthreats faced by power cyber–physical systems (CPSs) have become increasingly serious. However, existing cyberattack detectors still cannot resist them effectively due to the data imbalance, the high false alarm rate (FAR), and highly covert cyberattacks. To address the issues, this article proposes a novel data-driven cyberattack detector based on deep learning for power CPSs. The proposed detector is equipped with two Wasserstein generative adversarial networks (WGANs), which overcome the data imbalance issue in existing detectors by synthesizing adequate abnormal samples involving cyberattacks. Moreover, a novel substation-level detector with a modified light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM) and a maximal information coefficient (MIC) unit is introduced into the proposed detector. It captures differences between abnormal sampled values caused by cyberattacks and natural faults, thus reducing the FAR. Furthermore, a novel overall-level detector based on an improved graph convolutional neural network (IGCNN) is built for the proposed detector. It performs spatial–temporal topology mining on complete power CPS graphs to fully extract more comprehensive attack-related features than existing detectors, thus realizing exhaustive detection sensitive enough to highly covert cyberattacks. Finally, the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed detector are verified by experimental research on actual power data from China."

However, the performance of electrohydraulic discharge load faces challenges including large breakdown delay and jitter, complex multi-physical coupling, etc. Here, an underwater surface load utilizes carbon-foil triple-junction (TJ) points to trigger kV-level discharges and pressure waves. The optimized load offers key advantages: largely-reduced electric breakdown delay and phenomenal reproducibility in repetitive operation. This study systematically investigates the effects of current density, load length, and stored energy on discharge characteristics, acoustic performance, and bubble pulsation. Results show that increasing foil length from 5 mm to 20 mm (at 2 J) elevates the voltage peak from 0.93 kV to 1.37 kV and improves energy deposition efficiency from 1.47 J to 1.85 J. Furthermore, the acoustic performance is highly controllable: peak pressure rises with stored energy, reaching up to 43.1 kPa (corresponding to a sound pressure level of approximately 212.7 dB re 1 μPa @ 20 cm), while the discharge pressure waveform before material failure is closer to a strong shock wave. Additionally, four distinct bubble regimes are identified in varied tests: merged double bubbles, non-merging double bubbles, triple bubbles, and multi-bubbles. These findings may deepen the understanding of underwater discharge physics and demonstrate its advantages in related applications."

    "abstract": "Deep Learning-based Social Engineering Attack (SEA) detectors have shown promising results in identifying malicious content. However, these models remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks, where carefully crafted inputs can significantly impact their performance. This paper presents a novel defense mechanism that leverages model diversity and randomization to counter black-box adversarial attacks. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on a single model with fixed parameters, our method automatically utilizes multiple base model variants during inference, each trained on different data distributions with distinct settings. We use a random selection method from these variants for the final predictions, adding an element of unpredictability that increases the difficulty for attackers in creating successful adversarial examples. Our experimental results across various transformer-based architectures demonstrate that our approach maintains robust performance while effectively defending against 12 different types of black-box attacks targeting words, sentences, and characters. The proposed method achieves an average performance improvement of 2-3% over existing defense mechanisms on clean data and a significant 17% improvement in resistance to adversarial settings. It outperforms existing approaches by 13-44% in accuracy under adversarial attacks, all without substantially increasing computational complexity or compromising clean data performance. This work enhances the reliability and trustworthiness of SEA detection systems while addressing practical challenges in deploying robust defense mechanisms."

    "abstract": "Internet security, and more particularly the prevention of harmful traffic on the increasingly popular Internet of Things (IoT) devices, has recently attracted a lot of attention. Such threats are hard to spot, which is why a sophisticated intrusion detection system (IDS) is required. As a smart IDS, machine learning (ML) shows promise in many domains, including the IoT. Features extraction models, however, should be used to extract data from the IoT environment so that ML models can use it. These models are crucial for the detection rate and accuracy. A number of network intrusion detection methods based on machine learning have been developed to successfully thwart these attacks on IoT networks. These methods typically employ feature extraction or feature selection techniques to reduce the dimensionality of input data before feeding it into machine learning models. This study employs a normalization pre-process on the IEEE Dataport input data and a synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) approach to select imbalanced data instances. Next, the Vortex Search Optimization Algorithm (VSA) is used to increase the classification accuracy by optimally selecting various features that have been extracted. The last step is for the input samples to be classified using a Fine-tuned based Support Vector Machine (FT-SVM). In order to determine how well the model works, it is compared to a standard data set. The experimental findings demonstrated the superior characteristics of the given model on the utilized dataset."

To address this challenge, this study proposes an intelligent machine learning (ML) framework designed to improve the efficiency of ASD screening for toddlers aged 12 to 36 months. The framework integrates several key techniques: Gaussian Noise Up-Sampling (GNUS) to mitigate class imbalance, MaxAbsScaler for feature scaling, and Extra Trees (ET) for feature selection, ensuring that classification models receive optimized input data. Six distinct ML algorithms— Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), Random Forest (RF), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Naïve Bayes (NB), Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA), and Support Vector Machine (SVM)—were evaluated on a cross-cultural ASD toddlers dataset. The results reveal exceptional classification performance, with XGB and SVM achieving perfect 100% scores in accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-measure when utilizing features selected by the ET algorithm. To enhance interpretability and transparency, eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) was incorporated through Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), providing insights into the decision-making processes of the top-performing models. By combining robust predictive modeling with explainability, this study contributes to advancing early detection tools for ASD, ultimately fostering better developmental outcomes for affected children."

This study proposes a deconvolution framework for underwater targets through a hybrid regularization combining total variation and L1-norm constraints. The comprehensive validation demonstrates superior performance in continuous structural reconstruction, with experimental results showing an improvement in the structural similarity index compared to other deconvolution methods. Field tests conducted in marine environments further validate the framework’s ability to suppress sidelobe artefacts while maintaining contour integrity, thus establishing its potential for high-precision underwater detection and mapping applications."

    "abstract": "Pine wilt disease (PWD), referred known as “pine cancer,” is incurable and highly contagious, with a high mortality rate, posing a serious threat to global pine resources. Early detection, localization, and clearance of infected trees remain the only effective control strategies. However, the subtle physiological alterations occurring in early-stage infected trees are scarcely discernible in visible-light imagery, rendering detection through conventional computer vision techniques extremely challenging. This study demonstrates the feasibility of hyperspectral remote sensing for the early detection of PWD-infected trees. Targeting the weak pathological spectral responses characteristic of early infection, we develop a novel adaptive subspace partitioning (ASP) mechanism that adaptively identifies pathology-sensitive spectral bands while reducing hyperspectral data redundancy. This approach enables the refined extraction of subtle but diagnostically significant spectral cues, providing a new methodological framework for early detection of PWD-infected trees. Furthermore, to enhance spectral feature learning, a spectral reconstruction network integrating a multi-attention mechanism with a CNN–ViT architecture is introduced, enabling joint mining of spatial–spectral contextual information and precise modeling of infected-tree spectral properties. By combining the spectral reconstruction network with the ASP mechanism, the PwdBSNet model for hyperspectral band selection of PWD-infected trees is constructed. Experimental results demonstrate that, PwdBSNet consistently outperforms mainstream band selection methods including GPCBS and FNGBS. Compared with baseline models, PwdBSNet achieves improvements of 8.35% in OA, 9.91% in AA, and 0.11 in Kappa, offering a novel and effective approach for hyperspectral band selection in PWD detection."

Existing AUV-assisted solutions remain constrained by periodic return requirements for storage offloading, failing to meet real-time demands, while conventional path-planning algorithms are prone to local optima. To address these issues, this paper proposes a multi-Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) cooperative data collection system specifically designed for the shoal-and-reef environment of the South China Sea. A hybrid hierarchical communication architecture integrating acoustic, optical fiber, and blue-green laser links is developed, enabling peripheral AUVs to collect sectorial data and relay it in real-time to a central AUV. This is complemented by a mobile AUV that facilitates near-realtime cross-medium transmission. Furthermore, to resolve the complexity of AUV path planning within this framework, we introduce an information entropy-enhanced Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm. This approach incorporates a dynamic parameter adaptation mechanism and multi-agent cooperative optimization strategy, significantly accelerating convergence speed and enhancing robustness. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms existing methods in path optimization, energy efficiency, and delay control, achieving an average path length reduction of $15.7 \\%$ and reducing total node energy consumption by $42.3 \\%$. These improvements effectively extend network lifetime and enhance resource utilization balance, validating the system’s efficacy for long-term, large-scale underwater data acquisition missions."

The key challenge of selecting the best H-IRS is tackled by choosing the channel link with the maximum sum-rate achieved by the users. To achieve this, we jointly optimize the base station (BS) beamforming vector and H-IRS phase shifts under dual power constraints (BS transmit power and active H-IRS element power). We solve this problem semi-optimally using a combination of fractional programming (FP), majorization-minimization (MM), and alternating optimization (AO) techniques. The performance analysis is done using sum-rate and bit error rate (BER) parameters, and it is observed that BER performance improved when the number of H-IRS panels increased from 1 to 5. Also, an improvement in the sum-rate and spectral efficiency (SE) of 17% and $15 \\mathrm{bps} / \\mathrm{Hz}$ is observed."

The recommended method identifies kidney stones in ultrasound images with the help of the advanced object identification algorithm YOLOv8. The program gives hope in detecting anomalies once trained on a specific set of annotated ultrasound images. The results of the system are bounding boxes, class predictions (stone vs. normal), and confidence scores that can assist medical professionals visually and quantitatively.

    "abstract": "We consider an optimization problem with continuous variables, where the objective function must be evaluated via simulation. Our interests specifically focus on the situation where limited simulation observations (e.g., one or two) at each solution vector can be obtained, even though each observation includes random noise. To solve the problem, one may employ existing surrogate-assisted algorithms that typically update their surrogate models whenever a new observation is obtained. However, this updating process can face challenges such as out-of-memory issues, high computational costs, or imbalanced data due to excessive exploitation. In this study, we introduce a new algorithm called <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">S</i>tochastic <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">K</i>riging-assisted <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">C</i>ontrolled <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">R</i>andom Search <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">(SKCRS)</i>. At each iteration, it employs a controlled random search to sample multiple vectors and uses a stochastic kriging model to select the most promising candidate solution vector from those sampled vectors. If the model fails to provide useful information to identify a suitable solution vector, the algorithm defaults to functioning as the original controlled random search without using the model. We tested our algorithm and compared it with existing algorithms using numerical functions and a case study in semiconductor manufacturing. The results demonstrate that our algorithm empirically outperforms existing algorithms regarding computational efficiency and estimation accuracy."

    "abstract": "In this paper, a multiwindow hierarchical rangespread target detection method is proposed to address target detection in complex oceanic scenes. The adaptive range-spread generalized likelihood ratio test linear threshold detectors (GLRTLTDs) with multiple range integration windows are employed cooperatively to address the detection of different radial sizes targets, which significantly reduces the mismatch loss of range windows. The detection results from wider windows are used as prior scene information to obtain pure clutter reference cells and reduce the interference from other targets. The hierarchical exploitation of the scene greatly improves detection performance of small targets around moderate or large targets. Moreover, the measured data with the test small target and simulated rangespread targets validates the effectiveness of the proposed method."

    "abstract": "Body-brain optimization of embodied agents is known to be a difficult task, as the two components may interact in non-trivial ways. This holds particularly in the case of modular robots, as bodies can be as complex as brains. When optimizing the agents through evolutionary computation (EC), this difficulty impacts on the design of the genetic representation which has to allow for mutually compatible body and brains. While the common approach is to “split” the representation in two distinct parts, one for the body, one for the brain, previous studies and biology suggest that pleiotropy may be beneficial. In brief, pleiotropic representations are those where one gene can affect more than one trait, possibly belonging to different components (body vs. brain). In this work, we experimentally study the effects of pleiotropy in genetic representations for body-brain evolvable robotic agents. We design a generic representation allowing for pleiotropy and instantiate it for two cases of different complexity: navigation of simulated differential-drive robots and locomotion of voxel-based soft robots (VSRs). Our results suggest that there is little interplay between evolutionary pressure, i.e., fitness, and pleiotropy. Pleiotropy tends to settle to some “natural” level mostly dictated by the representation."

    "abstract": "Reconstructing neurons from large electron microscopy (EM) datasets for connectomic analysis presents a significant challenge, particularly in segmenting neurons of complex morphologies. Previous deep learning-based neuron segmentation methods often rely on pixel-level image context and produce extensive oversegmented fragments. Detecting these split errors and merging the split neuron segments are non-trivial for various neurons in a large-scale EM data volume. In this work, we exploit multimodal features in the full workflow of automatic neuron proofreading. We propose a novel connection point detection network that utilizes both global 3D morphological features and high-resolution local image context to extract candidate segment pairs from massive adjacent segments. To effectively fuse the 3D morphological feature and the dense image features from very different scales, we design a proposal-based image feature sampling to improve the efficiency of multimodal cross-attentions. Integrating the connection point detection network with our connectivity prediction network which also utilizes multimodal features, we make a fully automatic neuron segment merging pipeline, closely imitating human proofreading. Comprehensive experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed modules and demonstrate the robustness of the entire pipeline in large-scale neuron reconstruction.

Given the potential reuse of such systems in future health crises, ensuring their correctness, reliability and fairness is crucial, especially when they govern mobility and access to essential services. Conventional testing often fails to detect subtle errors in these complex, data-driven applications. This work applies formal verification, using probabilistic model checking, to model QMS functionality and analyze its behavior under diverse infection rates and user behaviors. We verify properties such as deadlock freedom, reachability, fairness, and reliability with the PRISM model checker. Results highlight the value of formal methods in building trustworthy digital health technologies and guiding improvements in both system design and public policy."

Using the Toeplitz structure of the range-averaged covariance matrix generated by the relative motion between the source and the array, this paper innovatively introduces a covariance matrix fitting-based aperture extension method into the wavenumber estimation problem. This method effectively doubles the number of array element and then increases the aperture. Numerical simulations conducted in a typical shallow water waveguide environment demonstrate that the proposed method significantly enhances the resolution capability and estimation accuracy of normal mode horizontal wavenumbers. The estimation performance improves with increasing distance of relative motion between array and source, demonstrates superior performance compared to the nonextended method across different signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs)."

    "abstract": "Human speech emotion recognition has emerged as a crucial technology in domains such as AI-driven applications, healthcare, and human-computer interaction. Speech signal emotion detection improves user experience and makes systems more adaptive. Most speech emotion recognition systems rely solely on acoustic features, ignoring linguistic context. This work bridges this gap by integrating natural language processing techniques with speech signal analysis. This study presents a hybrid speech emotion recognition approach that synergistically blends acoustic features (MFCCs, pitch, and spectral features) with contextual NLP embeddings using an optimized deep learning architecture. It employs both machine learning and deep learning models to predict emotions like happiness, sadness, anger, and fear from vocal expressions. The system detects important speech features like pitch, tone, energy, and amplitude using ML-based classifiers. Furthermore, NLP methods like sentiment analysis and word embeddings are used to increase classification accuracy by incorporating contextual knowledge. According to preliminary results, deep learning models perform better than conventional machine learning techniques, providing increased accuracy and an emphasis on lowering background noise. The proposed hybrid model reduces bias in emotion classification (e.g., anger vs. sadness) by combining vocal and textual cues."

    "abstract": "In general, sea subbottom parameters can be rapidly estimated using the $\\tau-p$ relation of sediment-bottom reflected (sBR) arrivals derived from the bearing time records (BTR). However, when the sediment layers are thin, it becomes challenging to distinguish sBR arrivals from arrivals travelling only through the water, particularly when using a bandwidth-limited source. The inaccurate estimation in such scenarios consequently degrades the subbottom profiling performance. To address this issue, we propose applying a two-dimensional deconvolution technique to enhance the sediment raypath separation in the beam-time-delay domain. This method improves the resolution of BTR by deconvolving the known response patterns of conventional beamforming and matched filtering. As a result, the accuracy of the $\\tau-p$ relation is improved, giving rise to more reliable estimates of both the number of sediment layers and their corresponding thicknesses. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated using both the simulated and realsea experimental data, where the resulting subbottom profiling manifests itself as promising priors to further improve the matched-field geoacoustic inversion."

This research presents a novel application of Facial Emotion Recognition (FER) using web cameras and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to enhance classroom and laboratory settings. The system is designed to monitor students’ emotional states in real time, enabling educators to adapt learning environments for improved engagement and well-being. Initially, an image dataset was collected through web cameras placed in classrooms, capturing students' facial expressions during lectures and activities. The dataset was preprocessed to account for variations in lighting, facial orientations, and occlusions. A CNN-based model was developed and trained to classify emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, and neutrality. Hyperparameter tuning and data augmentation techniques were employed to optimize model performance. The model was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure its effectiveness across diverse conditions. Additionally, the system was optimized to handle real-time emotion detection in varying classroom environments. This real-time FER system allows continuous monitoring of students' emotional states, providing actionable insights for educators to create more supportive and adaptive learning environments. The results demonstrate the potential of FER technologies to transform educational environments by fostering a deeper understanding of student emotions and promoting well-being. This research offers a foundation for the integration of AI-driven tools in modern education to enhance learning experiences."

The purpose of this research is to assess the knowledge, awareness, and attitudes of healthcare students regarding AI and its use in medical education. Methods: A web-based survey was distributed through email and WhatsApp to 247 health students at the International Islamic University Malaysia (IIUM). Demographics, Knowledge, Attitude, and Practice (KAP) questionnaire answers, and perceived healthcare education barriers for AI adoption were collected. Associations between variables were analyzed. Results: Of the respondents, 66 (26.7%) were male, and 181 (73.3%) were female. The majority demonstrated a high level of knowledge (72.5%), a strong positive attitude (96.8%), and frequent AI-related practices (80.6%). Most students recognized that AI requires extensive labeled data for learning, and over half emphasized the importance of understanding AI's ethical implications. The most common AI-related activity was exam preparation. Despite their overall positive attitude, many students do not actively engage with AI tools, indicating potential barriers such as limited access or training. Conclusion: This study highlights a generally positive perception of AI among healthcare students at IIUM Kuantan Campus. However, the gap between positive attitudes and practical engagement suggests a need for improved AI training and accessibility in medical education."

The antenna has an overall size of 0.86×0.86×0.077λ₀³ (λ₀ is the free-space wavelength at the center frequency) and is fabricated on two F4B-TMS220 substrates with a dielectric constant of 2.2. Parasitic patches are introduced around the main radiator to excite multiple resonant modes and achieve impedance bandwidth enhancement. Meanwhile, the AMC layer provides an in-phase reflection response within the operating band, which improves the radiation condition, increases the effective permittivity, and shifts the resonance toward lower frequencies. Simulation results indicate that the proposed antenna achieves a 33% impedance bandwidth (4.9–6.83 GHz), a peak gain of 8.3 dBi, and a 35% 1-dB gain bandwidth (4.6–6.65 GHz), while maintaining a total efficiency higher than 92% across the operating band. Furthermore, the fabricated prototype exhibits good agreement with simulations, validating the effectiveness and application potential of the proposed design in broadband and high-gain antenna systems."

    "abstract": "Visual anomaly detection plays a critical role in industrial quality inspection. Traditional knowledge distillation approaches often employ similar or even identical architectures for student-teacher models, limiting their ability to represent anomalies in diverse ways. Effectively transferring knowledge between teacher and student networks remains a significant challenge. To address these issues, we propose a novel knowledge distillation framework based on deep supervision for industrial surface anomaly detection. Specifically, we leverage the rich semantic information from the highest feature layer of the teacher network to guide the learning process at multiple levels within the student network. To facilitate this hierarchical knowledge transfer, we design multiple projection modules to bridge the feature spaces between the teacher and students. Furthermore, we integrate CBAM attention modules into the teacher-student architecture to enhance feature extraction and mitigate limitations posed by structural similarity. The proposed distillation approach is structurally simple yet demonstrates strong performance. We evaluate our method on two benchmark datasets, MVTec AD and BeanTech AD. Experimental results show that our model achieves impressive average AUROC scores of 98.69% and 94.58%, respectively, surpassing state-of-the-art methods."

    "abstract": "Ultrapure water (UPW) is indispensable in semiconductor manufacturing, where it serves as the foundational input for wafer cleaning, chemical dilution, and rinsing steps. As device geometries shrink below 5 nm, even parts-per-trillion (ppt) levels of contaminants can compromise yield, reliability, and compliance with industry standards such as SEMI F63 and ASTM D5127. Emerging contaminants (ECs) including per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), chemical mechanical planarization (CMP) organics, and micro/nanoplastics pose new challenges for membrane-based UPW treatment systems, especially under evolving regulations like the EPA PFAS Rule (2024). This PRISMA-guided meta-analysis evaluates 31 peer-reviewed studies (2002–2025) to quantify how reverse osmosis (RO), nanofiltration (NF), and ultrafiltration (UF) membranes perform under EC exposure. RO consistently achieved >99% rejection for long-chain PFAS and PPCPs but showed lower efficacy (93.8–99.2%) for short-chain compounds. NF demonstrated variable rejection (86–98%) depending on compound characteristics but offered energy savings in suitable contexts. UF was effective for microplastics but suffered significant flux decline (15–45%) with CMP-related organics. These findings offer critical, data-driven insights for semiconductor facilities seeking to maintain compliance, reduce operating costs, and optimize yield amid stricter water quality demands."

    "abstract": "Target tracking in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) platforms faces significant challenges due to high maneuverability-induced appearance variations, including abrupt scale changes, viewpoint shifts, and non-rigid deformations. Existing trackers suffer from two critical limitations: (1) fixed-interval sampling strategies fail to capture nonlinear state transitions, and (2) error accumulation in dynamic reference updating degrades long-term robustness. To address these issues, we propose a novel dynamic spatio-temporal perception framework with error suppression. Our approach introduces two core innovations: First, the Spatio-Temporal Anchors Module employs the Wasserstein-1 distance to quantify feature distribution evolution, enabling geodesic-equidistant sampling of representative reference frames that uniformly cover target transition trajectories. This distribution-aware mechanism adaptively balances update density during stable phases and critical transitions. Second, the Key Feature Enhancement Module conducts attention-driven fusion of candidate regions and historical references, dynamically propagating spatially salient features—identified through attention response analysis—via a cascaded architecture to mitigate error accumulation. Extensive evaluations on UAV123, UAVTrack112L, DTB70, and LaSOT benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with notable improvements in occlusion scenarios and deformation resistance, confirming its practical viability for aerial observation systems."

Existing acoustic and deep learning–based approaches are majorly based on spectral or temporal representations that provide limited insight into the underlying physiological behavior of the vocal folds. This work introduces a novel and accurate Recurrence Plot (RP) –based framework that models sustained vowel phonations as nonlinear dynamical systems. This enables direct characterization of vocal fold oscillatory patterns through Recurrence Plots and Recurrence Quantification Analysis (RQA). The proposed method facilitates robust multiclass classification of three common voice disorders such as hyperfunctional dysphonia, laryngitis, and vocal fold polyp. Using the publicly available Saarbrücken Voice Database (SVD), the proposed method achieves a mean classification accuracy of 90.2% and shows superior disease-specific performance. Compared to a state-of-the-art CNN-based temporal feature method, the proposed work showed a relative improvement of 32% for laryngitis and a 32.4% improvement for Vocal Fold polyp, while the performance for hyperfunctional Dysphonia remains comparable. These improvements indicate that modeling speech as a nonlinear dynamical process provides richer and more discriminative representations than traditional linear methods. Thus, by integrating physiological interpretability and strong diagnostic performance, this study presents a clinically meaningful and explainable solution for pathological voice assessment"

In addition, the simultaneous reconstruction of three-phase currents is not possible, and unaligned sampling points introduce reconstruction errors that degrade rotor position estimation accuracy. To address these limitations, a new pulse-width modulation (PWM) technique is proposed to enhance rotor position estimation accuracy, and an alternating <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">dq</i>-axis injection method is adopted to avoid current immeasurable regions.

    "abstract": "The concept of morphing wings is often incorporated in the design of highly adaptive aircraft. However, the design of dual-mode morphing wing and the research of mode switching method remain insufficiently developed. This article presents a novel dual-mode morphing wing based on the characteristics of multiple modes of metamorphic mechanism. Through the combination of basic 4R mechanisms, we designed a class of line symmetry Bricard mechanisms. A novel self-coupling joint is developed to enable compliant switching between different modes without new actuator. Based on the energy change during movement, we propose an energy-assisted method to realize the mode switching. Ultimately, we constructed a prototype aircraft with two modes: variable anhedral angle for enhanced maneuverability and variable sweep angle for better aerodynamic efficiency. The mode switching experiment shows that the motion state of the joint changes compliantly during the mode switching. The experiments show that the morphing wing can change the anhedral angle (7°–12°) and sweep angle (15°–30°), and can change the mode with the help of flight conditions. The aircraft can fly successfully in both modes, which shows the superiority of the design method. The findings of this study hold significant potential for the design of morphing wings in highly adaptive aircraft."

To tackle this limitation, this study introduces S²TA-Fuse, a transformer-based solver named <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Semantic-Superpixel Tokenized Attention for Fusion</i>, which preserves the efficiency of superpixels while removing the need for explicit segmentation. The central design lies in a semantic attention mechanism that adaptively organizes pixels into deformable and content-aware semantic groups. Pixels sharing similar latent states are softly aggregated and encoded as compact tokens, upon which attention is computed to capture intricate long-range dependencies. This formulation endows the model with an inherent ability to accommodate scale variations while maintaining linear computational complexity with respect to the number of pixels. On top of the semantic backbone, two complementary components are devised. The Local Spectral Pyramid enhances the representation of multi-scale spectral cues in the spatial domain, whereas FreqNet supplements global information by modeling frequency-dependent variations through amplitude and phase decomposition. Comprehensive experiments on widely used benchmarks for spatial–spectral fusion demonstrate that S²TA-Fuse consistently surpasses the state of the art both in quantitative accuracy and visual fidelity."

This algorithm achieves complementary advantages through a bidirectional closed-loop architecture. The forward channel utilizes the target state estimates output by GM-CPHD as enhanced measurements input into the MHT module, optimizing trajectory generation. The feedback channel leverages high-confidence trajectories generated by MHT to inversely estimate clutter density, dynamically updating the clutter parameters within the GM-CPHD model. Extensive 200-run Monte Carlo experiments conducted under unknown clutter intensity demonstrate that, compared to traditional methods, the proposed algorithm exhibits significant advantages in tracking error reduction and can accurately estimate clutter density."

In clinical practice, deep learning models are often not accepted by doctors and patients due to their lack of diagnostic reasoning capabilities. Moreover, ultrasound imaging data contain significant noise and artifacts, making deep models vulnerable to interference, which frequently leads to misclassification. To address this issue, this study leverages fuzzy logic to achieve fault-tolerant perception of image content and employs a fuzzy trustworthy brain-inspired reasoning framework for diagnostic decision-making. In the fast-thinking module, we innovatively introduce the fuzzification of deep classification probabilities and construct a fault-tolerant perception set based on medical feature classification information. In the slow-thinking module, we establish a tensor decomposition-based knowledge graph, where medical feature information and membership degrees from the fault-tolerant perception set are jointly embedded to form a trustworthy factor matrix. The reasoning space reconstructed under this matrix guides the reasoning process from medical features toward the correct diagnostic outcome. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed model, we conducted diagnostic experiments on thyroid nodules and breast tumors, achieving AUC scores of 0.9549 and 0.9751, respectively. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach exhibits outstanding diagnostic performance on real-world ultrasound data."

Existing methods are deficient in key feature extraction and policy interpretability, which limits their performance capability in high-risk scenarios. In this paper, we propose an attention mechanism based on reward perception, which utilizes reward feedback information to guide the model to focus on key regions in the image that are highly relevant to the decision-making outcome, thus improving the model's attentional selectivity and strategy robustness. Based on this mechanism, an end-to-end visual reinforcement learning automatic driving control framework is constructed, where the system takes vehicle front-view images as inputs, fuses basic visual features with key reward features, and generates state vectors to be inputted into the reinforcement learning agent to make action decisions. Meanwhile, a reward function fusing traffic rules and passing efficiency is designed to regulate vehicle behavior. The experiments are carried out on the CARLA simulation platform, and a complex scenario containing key traffic elements such as pedestrians, obstacle vehicles, downhill turns and tunnels is constructed. The results show that the method in this paper outperforms traditional reinforcement learning methods in terms of learning efficiency, strategy stability, and attention visualization and interpretation effects, demonstrating the effectiveness and application prospects of reward-driven mechanisms in improving the safety and interpretability of autonomous driving systems."

Firstly, the framework uses YOLO11 to perform real-time target detection and rule filtering on the monitoring video stream, and then transmits the key frames and detection results to Qwen2.5VL-7B. The customized Prompt is used to understand multi-modal graphics and text and judge abnormal data, realize the semantic understanding and early warning of abnormal events, and generate video summary and abnormal event work order. Experimental results show that the proposed framework achieves an abnormal event detection accuracy of 89.3% on the data set of the self-built railway station waiting hall, and the false alarm rate is lower than that of the traditional method, which verifies the effectiveness of the multi-modal fusion architecture in complex scenes."

    "abstract": "Addressing the significant challenges posed by nonlinearity, time-varying dynamics, and modeling errors in crystal diameter regulation during Czochralski (CZ) silicon single crystal growth, this paper proposes a Knowledge-Data Fusion Model Predictive Control (KDD-MPC) method incorporating Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based knowledge transfer. The method introduces a GAN module in the offline phase. Through adversarial training on key process variables such as crystal diameter and crystal lift rate, the GAN extracts deep structural knowledge, which is then migrated to a Radial Basis Function (RBF) neural network, significantly enhancing the generalization capability of the prediction model. Building upon this, an MPC control framework incorporating knowledge transfer is constructed, forming a data-driven control strategy guided by structural knowledge. During online operation, the proposed method continuously refines and updates model parameters based on real-time error feedback, achieving high-precision and robust online control. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms traditional approaches in crystal diameter tracking performance, exhibiting superior dynamic response capability and stability. This provides a novel solution for modeling and controlling nonlinear complex industrial processes."

    "abstract": "With the proliferation of interconnected sensor devices, the Internet of Things (IoT) is rapidly becoming one of the most significant global technological developments. The transition from a human-centric to a \"Things\" network is taking place without a hitch, allowing everyday items to establish wireless connections with one another. There is a correlation between the IoT routing protocol's power consumption and the longevity of the network. Also, because small sensors are typically difficult to recharge after deployment, the enormous amount of data generated by the IoT will lead to transmission collisions, security problems, and energy loss as a result of increased data redundancy. In order to conserve energy, data aggregation typically puts some nodes into sleep mode while others remain active, reducing data redundancy at each node. As a result, employing the fuzzy matrix to cluster nodes with very comparable data is crucial. After that, a fuzzy similarity matrix is used to cluster the data that has been received from the member nodes at the Cluster Head (CH). After clustering, the following step is to select a subset of nodes from each group to serve as redundant nodes. Data duplication, network congestion, and transmission expenses are all mitigated by implementing the sleep scheduling technique. In order to reduce power consumption, to offer a blockchain-protected Energy-Efficient Data Aggregation Mechanism (EEDAM) that aggregates data at the cluster level. Quantum based Draf Mongoose Optimization Algorithm (QDMOA) is used to pick the fuzzy logic parameter allocation in the best possible way. When blockchain technology is linked into cloud servers, it verifies the edge computing, allowing for the provision of secure, on-demand services to the IoT with little latency. To concluded by simulating the proposed mechanism's operation and comparing its results to those of more traditional energy-saving techniques. Extending the wireless sensor network (WSN), reducing data amounts, and ensuring suitable IoT security are all achieved by the proposed structural design, according to the simulation results."

Conversely, advanced adaptive methods are typically too computationally expensive for real-time field operation. To overcome this trade-off, we propose a higher-order non-linear beamforming method using the Delay-Multiply-and-Sum (DMAS) technique with Coherence Factor weighting, specifically adapted for in-air microphone arrays. By leveraging Newton-Girard binomial expansion, we reduce the complexity of <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">n</i>-th order DMAS to O(<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">N</i>), enabling GPU-accelerated, real-time performance on embedded platforms, with the implementation also made available as open-source. Through validation against simulated and real-world data, we demonstrate that the proposed 5th-order DMAS with CF achieves a dynamic range improvement of nearly 40 dB over DAS, alongside significantly higher image SNR and artifact suppression. We demonstrate real-time viability on various GPU platforms, establishing this approach as a practical, high-performance solution for 3D in-air sonar and industrial acoustic imaging."

    "abstract": "Predicting protein–protein interaction (PPI) patterns from primary sequences constitutes a complex pattern recognition task that demands advanced and explainable deep learning frameworks, as PPIs underpin critical cellular and pathological mechanisms.We propose PEPpip, a deep learning framework for binary sequence-based PPI prediction that also derives interaction maps via explainable-AI (XAI) methods. PEPpip encodes sequence pairs into 3D image-like feature maps using three pre-trained protein language models(PLMs). To learn PPI patterns, it applies two vision-based classifiers—ResNet and Vision Transformer( ViT)—whose predictions are fused through a novel Post-hoc Inference Combiner(PIC) leveraging their complementary strengths. In addition, PEPpip uniquely generates PPI maps by combining XAI-based interaction maps from integrated gradients and ViT attention, further refined through a modular noise-cleaning pipeline. We introduce a novel residue-residue interaction-aware, class-discriminative attention map(RiaCdAm) mechanism that embeds biological priors into ViT attention, improving interpretability and contact relevance. PEPpip achieves state-of-the-art AUPR (Area Under Precision-Recall curve) scores across species—91.1%(Mouse), 89.1%(Fly), 87.7%(Worm), 68.1%(Yeast), and 71.9%(E.coli)—outperforming existing methods by 2–3%. It also performs strongly on Human-PPI tasks. While its sequence-driven, XAI-based PPI map approach is not directly comparable to structure-based learners, PEPpip surpasses competing sequence-based classifiers in interaction map estimation, exceeding the next-best method by over 5% in top-L/10 and top-L/5 categories (<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">L</i>: shorter protein-length in the pair).

    "abstract": "Under an internet of thing (IoT)-based framework, a power grid monitoring system can collect real-time transmission line data, which can then be used to predict the cascading failure risks within the grid. This study proposed a two-stage cascade failure prediction (CFP) model that integrated deep learning techniques with supervised classification algorithms to identify transmission lines susceptible to cascading failures, thereby preventing large-scale power system collapses. In the first-stage, the CFP model utilizes historical transmission line data to predict lines at risk in the next time step. In the second-stage, it assesses whether the predicted at-risk lines could trigger system instability or power outages. Three deep learning-based algorithms were employed in the first-stage, whereas three binary classification algorithms were utilized in the second-stage. The proposed CFP model was evaluated using an IEEE 39-bus system, where 2,000 cascading failure events were simulated through a real-time digital simulator (RTDS). Experimental results demonstrate that the two-stage CFP model, particularly when combining a deep neural network with a binary classifier, can accurately identify potential risk lines in the test grid with an accuracy ranging from 97.5% to 98.3%. Moreover, the CFP model exhibits strong robustness against noisy and erroneous data. These predictive results provide valuable insights for power companies in formulating preventive safety strategies against cascading failures."

    "abstract": "The rapid advancement of aerospace technology and proliferation of low earth orbit (LEO) satellite density enable space-based distributed radars. However, existing 3D radar imaging algorithms, such as interferometric inverse synthetic aperture radar (InISAR) and back projection (BP), face a trade-off between resolution and computational efficiency. The former suffers from angular glint effects causing scattering point displacement or loss, while the latter incurs an impractical complexity, hindering real-time processing. To address the above challenges, we propose a computationally efficient and glint-resilient 3-D fusion imaging framework for space-based distributed radars. The method first employs InISAR pre-localization to coarsely locate scattering centers. Then, through point-wise 3-D BP, angular-glint artifacts are identified. Subsequently, real scattering points are recovered within height domains constrained by an oriented bounding box (OBB). This method markedly reduces computational load while preserving high-resolution and effectively suppressing angular-glint distortions under sparse target observation scenarios."

    "abstract": "Outdoor mobility can be a severe challenge for people with vision impairment (PVI). Significant researchers have proposed assistive technologies (ATs) to enhance PVIs' mobility activity. However, rarely are there ATs that have been reliably adopted in the daily life of PVI. This is partly due to a lack of AT developers to consider three essential user factors: PVIs' outdoor behavior, challenges, and requirements for AT. Accordingly, this study aims to identify these three factors from experts' perspectives. We have chosen this path since many previous studies focused on PVIs' perspectives while ignoring expert opinions. We further argue that experts possess comprehensive knowledge about PVI needs, as their main task is improving their quality of life. We conducted semi-structured interviews with six experts. Our findings highlight the PVIs' behaviors to correlate with safe outdoor mobility. In addition, the requirements and challenges may illuminate some uncovered aspects of possible AT improvements. One interesting finding is the significance of the complementary between the white cane and AT, which overcomes cane limitations. Based on this outcome, we encourage the developers to propose ATs that complement the white cane and do not substitute it for successful and safe outdoor mobility for PVI."

An important part of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) framework, the replacement layer uses an 8 × 8 S-Box to make it non-linear and make it more resistant to cryptographic analysis methods because S-Boxes on FPGA platforms have a much greater implementation cost compared to other components, optimizing them for efficient resource utilization is essential. In order to minimize hardware resource utilization, this research looks at different ways to construct S-Boxes for AES encryption, with a specific focus on an 8 × 8 S-Box that uses an alternate irreducible polynomial. Even in resource-constrained settings, the proposed approach maintains the same degree of cryptographic security while increasing gate efficiency. Vivado 2020.2 was designed with the AES architecture in mind, with an emphasis on measuring performance according to silicon area, encryption speed, and power economy. Real-Time encryption and minimal latency operations are essential for safeguarding information in embedded systems, industrial automation, and the Internet of Things (IoT).

The use of FRA for rotating electrical machines is nowadays a prominent research area. In previous works, the use of FRA for synchronous machine field winding diagnostics has been studied, but some key factors remain uncertain in this application. The moisture content is one of the uncertainty factors that could be envisaged as potentially influential. Therefore, the influence of moisture content on the FRA response of poles of synchronous machines is addressed in this paper. For this purpose, numerous experimental tests have been carried out on an extracted pole of a 40-MVA hydro-generator, with different moisture contents, considering healthy state, ground faults, and interturn faults. The main contribution of this work is to prove that, in contrast to what occurs in ordinary insulation testing, the moisture content does not have a significant influence on the FRA response of the pole, discarding this method for moisture diagnostics. However, this fact makes FRA very interesting for in-situ inspection, as it is independent of the moisture content. This way, it is not required to dry the machine before testing."

Most existing research focuses on static planning or single risk factor analysis, which finds it difficult to comprehensively address market uncertainties and the complex interactive effects among crops. To this end, this paper proposes an integrated decision-making framework that combines constrained optimization, stochastic programming, and dynamic programming. In particular, a profit maximization model is established using the <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\epsilon$</tex>-constraint method, and a Monte Carlo simulation is introduced to quantify the impacts of random variables such as prices and yields. Moreover, the Pearson correlation coefficient is employed to characterize the substitution and complementary relationships among crops. Experimental results show that the proposed model increases profit by 14%, reaching 79.34 million yuan, surpasses uncertainty-only models by nearly 10 million yuan, and keeps revenue volatility within 18%, confirming its effectiveness in complex agriculture."

    "abstract": "Traditional ensemble learning approaches often struggle to effectively model complex interdependencies among features, limiting their capacity to capture underlying data patterns. While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel at modeling relational structures, their reliance on predefined graph topologies poses a significant challenge for tabular data, where meaningful feature interactions are typically latent and not known a priori. To address these limitations, we propose the Adaptive Graph Structure Learning Cascade Forest (AGCF), a novel algorithm that integrates graph structure learning within an ensemble learning framework. A core contribution is a feature graph structure learning module. This module dynamically infers implicit feature relationships by optimizing an adjacency matrix through gradient-based learning, thereby generating enriched feature representations adapted to the specific dataset. Furthermore, AGCF employs a feature importance-guided graph updating mechanism, establishing a bidirectional feedback loop between the forest ensemble models and the evolving graph structure. This interaction enables the forest models to inform the graph learning based on feature importance, while the learned graph structure, in turn, provides relational context to enhance the forest's representations and predictions. Extensive experiments on diverse industrial and medical datasets demonstrate that AGCF achieves superior classification performance compared to a range of baseline methods."

    "abstract": "A low Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) antenna with enhanced radiation efficiency and improved gain is proposed for further improvement of long-range biological monitoring systems within IoMT platforms. A unidirectional uniform current distribution form with high radiation efficiency and low SAR values was first theoretically calculated and proved, which is the current distribution with a ratio coefficient N. Subsequently, we achieved the desired current distribution by ingeniously utilizing the higher-order mode currents of the meandering dipole. The simulation current distribution in each section of this third-order mode dipole agrees with the theoretical calculations. The antenna operation frequency covers the ISM 2.45 GHz band (2.4-2.48 GHz), and the antenna has a peak SAR of 155.5 and 59.2 W/kg for 1-g and 10-g of tissue, respectively. The measured radiation efficiency is more than 2.4% in the band, the peak efficiency is more than 3%, the gain is more than -10.27 dBi in the band, and the peak gain is -8.53 dBi. In addition, based on the communication link budget analysis, it can be confirmed that the proposed antenna can establish a reliable communication link up to distances of 15 m (78 Mb/s) and 20 m (10 Mb/s) at 2.45 GHz, for transferring high data rate information."

    "abstract": "Monocrystalline silicon fabricated via the Czochralski (CZ) technique serves as the predominant material for integrated circuit production. Nevertheless, the inherent complexity and pronounced nonlinearity of the CZ process render it vulnerable to instabilities, including thermal field oscillations, mechanical perturbations, and system degradation, often manifesting as critical abnormalities like crystalline diameter drift. Such deviations can disrupt the stability of the solid-liquid interface, impair the structural integrity of the ingot, and ultimately diminish manufacturing yield. To mitigate these issues, this work introduces a novel hybrid monitoring framework that synergistically combines Slow Feature Analysis (SFA) with Stacked Denoising Autoencoders (SDAE). The objective is to facilitate proactive fault identification via an intelligent system, thus circumventing the latency and subjectivity inherent in manual oversight. Within this framework, SFA is initially applied to isolate the most gradually evolving features from temporal sensor data, effectively capturing the foundational trends governing crystal growth. Subsequently, these slow features are processed and refined through a multi-layer SDAE architecture, which bolsters representational robustness and discriminative capacity via nonlinear mapping and noise suppression. Leveraging this enhanced feature set, a dual-indicator detection scheme—integrating the Squared Prediction Error (SPE) and Hotelling's <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$T^{2}$</tex> statistic—is established to reliably discern anomalous process states. Experimental results validate the efficacy of the proposed approach, confirming superior detection accuracy and operational stability, which underscores its suitability for real-world industrial deployment. Consequently, this research contributes a substantive theoretical foundation and a practical methodology toward intelligent supervision and enhanced control of Czochralski silicon crystal growth."

    "abstract": "The demand for healthcare continues to promote the importance of intelligent systems that could effectively assist medical experts in disease diagnosis. However, discrepancies and errors are often caused by subjective interpretation by radiologists of medical X-ray images, hence creating a dire need for more accurate and automated diagnostic tools. The work Multi-Class Classification of Medical X-ray Images addresses this challenge by providing a comprehensive solution for the analysis of medical X-ray images using advanced deep learning technologies. Unlike previous studies that usually focus on a single disease, this project tackles multiple diseases simultaneously, including tuberculosis, pneumonia, and osteoarthritis, offering a more versatile and scalable diagnostic tool. The system utilizes CNNs for the detection and classification of these diseases with high accuracy. This project compares three deep learning architectures: Custom CNN, VGG-16, and ResNet on a diverse set of medical X-ray datasets, which yields an overall accuracy of 94.48% with the VGG-16 model, outperforming both Custom CNN, which has an accuracy of 92%, and ResNet, which has an accuracy of 87%. It also does pretty well in precision, recall, and F1-score, particularly for normal X-rays (F1-score: 0.99 for VGG-16) and diseases like pneumonia (F1-score: 0.93) and tuberculosis (F1-score: 0.93). The difference of this work with the related works is the multi-disease approach and the comparative evaluation of several models. Whereas most of the previous works generally dealt with single diseases, the proposed system gives a holistic approach to multiple conditions, hence finding extreme applicability in realistic clinical scenarios. Advanced preprocessing techniques that were used in this study included grayscale conversion, resizing, and normalization, accompanied by fine-tuning and augmentation of the data to ensure each category of the diseases showed very high performance. The system further outperforms other approaches by being able to handle class imbalance problems and showing much better performance on the detection of complex cases like moderate osteoarthritis. The result is saving much precious time taken by health professionals in diagnosis and also helping patients with more complete and timely information about their condition. This indeed averts much-undue anxiety among patients and improves the overall healthcare outcome. This project really shows how AI can improve the experiences of patients seeking healthcare with a reliable, efficient, and correct diagnosis capable of dealing with many diseases in a single framework."

    "abstract": "Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a prevalent head-and-neck malignancy in Southern China and Southeast Asia, where accurate prognostic prediction is essential for individualized treatment. Recently, multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has shown superior performance over conventional clinical tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) staging for NPC survival prediction. However, most existing models process the entire MRI volume even though lesions occupy only a small fraction of voxels, thereby allowing background to swamp prognostic signals. Therefore, we propose Segmentation-Guided Survival Prediction from Multimodal MRI (SGSP-MRI), comprising two tightly coupled modules: Lesion Localization Segmentation Module (LLSM), based on an improved 3D U-Net, that precisely localizes the tumor and generates a high-confidence probability map to focus predictions on the lesion and peritumoral tissue; TargetGuided Cascaded Survival Module (TGCSM), which fuses this map with the original multimodal MRI in a guided early-fusion manner and applies cascaded multi-scale feature extraction to capture both fine-grained lesion morphology and global context. Extensive experiments on the Pearl River Delta Multicenter MRI Dataset for Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma (PRD-NPC-MRI), our self-collected multicenter dataset ($n=1,769$), demonstrate that SGSP-MRI achieves strong, reliable prognostic performance and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods."

A classical sliding-mode controller with boundary layer (SMC-sat) is compared against a backstepping sliding-mode variant (BS-SMC-sat), in which the sliding surface is shaped through a first-order backstepping step and augmented with proportional damping. Both controllers employ an identical allocation-aware anti-windup mechanism, which is a leaky back-calculation driven by the allocation shortfall Δτ returned by the thruster allocator. The BlueROV2 (Heavy) heave/yaw slice is used as a realistic benchmark with smooth multi-step reference commands. Three operating scenarios are examined: nominal, matched step disturbances, and a parameter-mismatch/tight-actuation condition (reduced thruster ceilings and perturbed inertial/damping offsets). Under nominal conditions, both controllers achieve comparable tracking performance with negligible control effort and a saturation duty of < 3%. Under disturbances, BS-SMC-sat reduces depth RMSE by ≈ 66% and heading RMSE by ≈ 65% relative to SMC-sat, while cutting yaw effort by ≈ 10%. Under parameter mismatch and tighter actuation, BS-SMC-sat remains robust, lowering RMSE by ≈31% (depth) and ≈72% (heading) with effort essentially unchanged. The results highlight that (i) allocation-driven anti-windup is essential when limits are active and (ii) modest backstepping shaping of the sliding surface markedly improves disturbance rejection and robustness without increasing control activity."

    "abstract": "The conventional signal sorting method of airborne warning radar equipment can only sort conventional signals with fixed or combined pulse repetition intervals, such as fixed pulse repetition interval and staggered pulse repetition intervals. For linear sliding signals, since the pulse repetition interval is not a fixed value or combination, traditional methods are difficult to directly sort, and it is necessary to rely on signal timing analysis to draw conclusions about pulse repetition interval variation. This paper deeply studies the characteristics of linear sliding signals, combines the actual engineering requirements, and proposes a pulse sorting method for linear sliding signals. First, it carefully analyzes linear sliding signals, clarifies that their pulse repetition intervals show a linear pattern, the first-order time-of-arrival difference is not a fixed value, but the second-order time-of-arrival difference is a fixed value, meeting the requirements of histogram statistics; then it uses parameters such as direction of arrival, radio frequency, and pulse width, and adopts the density method for three-dimensional spatial clustering to sparse the high-density pulse stream; then it uses the histogram method to estimate the possible pulse repetition interval values and the second-order difference values; finally, through sequence search, according to the theoretical stability of the pulse repetition interval difference values, it determines whether the pattern of possible pulse repetition interval values conforms to the linearly varying pattern, and obtains the exact pulse repetition interval value. Simulation experiments show that this method can successfully sort out the pulse repetition interval values and types, with an error of about 0.1 us, meeting the engineering requirements, and providing an effective means for solving the problem of pulse sorting."

    "abstract": "The periodic operation pattern of high-speed train (HST) grants the immense potential for iterative learning control (ILC) approach regulating the displacement and velocity, but the non-repetitive uncertainties caused by carrying loads, random disturbances, etc., may weaken the capability of controller. Further, the typical operating situations of rail transit, e.g., station entrance/exit, slowdown sections, can compress the safety margin of HST, increasing the difficulty of precise tracking. In this paper, an adaptive ILC scheme is proposed for HST subject to the safety constraints, where the unknown iteration-varying parameters and the modeling inaccuracies are handled deliberately. Our technical route could be divided into two phases. The transformation mechanism of tracking errors, that can convert the control problem of constrained systems into an unconstrained form, is first established to guarantee that HST is always located within the safety zone. On this basis, the iterative learning controller is devised through integrating the hyperbolic tangent function and iteration-related sequence, where the neural network is leveraged to approximate the unmodeled lumps. The main innovative features lie in that, the iteration-dependent terms of control system are evolved into the parametric compensation components of controller and the iterative convergence parts, while the nested structure of control law is built to accommodate the iteration-variation of loads. As a result, the proposed approach can theoretically achieve the zero-error tracking of HST in the presence of the non-repetitive uncertainties and safety constraints, which indicates the better performance and practicability than the existing ones."

    "abstract": "Radar has emerged as a pivotal technology for detecting low-altitude unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) targets owing to its all-day and all-weather operational capabilities. To address the challenges posed by low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in multi-UAV target echoes and multipath interference within elevation beams, this study proposes a novel radar system methodology incorporating the long-time coherent integration (LTI) with reweighted atomic norm (RAM). The SNR enhancement achieved through LTI delivers dual operational benefits. First, the improved SNR enables reliable extraction of targetassociated Range-Doppler cells and subsequent echo filtering, which effectively decomposes mixed coherent/incoherent source swarms into separable neighboring coherent source groups. This decomposition directly mitigates hardware-imposed resolution limitations. Second, the SNR gain provides inherent compensation for RAM’s well-documented sensitivity to noise contamination. To overcome the computational inefficiency of conventional convex optimization (CVX) toolboxes in solving semidefinite programming (SDP) problems under RAM frameworks, we implement the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm. This adaptation achieves significant computational complexity reduction while maintaining performance fidelity comparable to conventional solvers. Simulation results demonstrate the method’s efficacy in achieving simultaneous multi-UAV target detection and high-precision localization under multipath scenario."

    "abstract": "This paper explores the challenge of optimal routing for a mobile robot navigating a dynamic and shared human environment. The primary goal is to minimize the risk of performance degradation during motion, such as delays in completing tasks due to the need for safe or acceptable human robot encounters. The problem is formulated as a graph whose edge costs become progressively known only as the robot moves through the environment. We model this problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), enabling an offline evaluation of the expected cost of alternative routes based on statistical information about human spatial distributions and possible observations at each intersection. This compact state representation scales linearly with the number of intersections in the map. Since the memoryless property of the MDP may induce loops during online execution, we compute an offline policy and introduce an online policy adaptation mechanism to prevent cyclic behaviors. Exten sive simulations across environments of different complexity, and using data collected from real-world experiments, demonstrate that our approach outperforms reactive and advanced state-of the-art planners in terms of either performance or scalability."

    "abstract": "In infrastructure-deficient environments-such as tunnels, remote military zones, and mountainous emergency sites-wireless connectivity is often disrupted by blocked Line-ofSight (LoS) and sparse coverage. This paper proposes a unified downlink framework, combining UAV-mounted base station with passive reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS), and powerdomain NOMA, to restore communication in such scenarios. We formulate a mixed-integer problem to jointly optimize UAV placement, RIS phase shifts, analog beamforming, physical resource block (PRB) allocation, and power control, balancing throughput and energy efficiency. Our proposed solution algorithm comprises two phases: (1) joint configuration of beamforming, RIS tuning, PRB scheduling and UAV location using convex approximations; and (2) power tuning via geometric programming. Under realistic channel conditions, our method achieves up to 25% higher throughput and 18% lower power consumption over an orthogonal-access baseline, and around 6% higher throughput and 7% lower power over a zero-forcing benchmark with particle swarm optimization."

The model includes a pressure location coefficient and a pressure distribution coefficient to define the distribution of the bonding pressure. Expression of wafer deflection and strain energy is derived by the thin-plate theory. The wafer bonding process with different pressure distributions is analyzed and the bonding results are predicted. The results show that the extreme value of the contact radius occurs when the pressure location coefficient is about 0.9, and the contact radius is positively correlated with the pressure distribution coefficient. In comparison to uniform pressure, alterations in contact radius at non-uniform pressures exhibit considerable discrepancies. Finally, the correctness of the proposed model is verified by finite element simulation. This study can provide a reference for the design of wafer bonding pressure distribution in industrial applications."

Parameterizing electroencephalography (EEG) into periodic and aperiodic spectral components effectively dissociates rhythmic neural oscillations from arrhythmic background activity, permitting more precise delineation of oscillatory features and cognitive-state dynamics. Such methods have been widely applied in many fields. This study investigated the modulation of periodic brain activity induced by SSVEP through spectral parameterization of EEG. We propose a novel framework that integrates periodic EEG power spectra with a recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture. By eliminating the influence of aperiodic cortical activity embedded in SSVEP-related EEG signals with enhanced power spectrum, SSVEP decoding accuracy and decoding rate are improved. Our findings provide a robust computational foundation for advancing the reliability of SSVEPbased non-invasive BCIs."

Traditional centralized machine learning approaches to PD detection raise concerns around patient privacy and data security, especially when handling sensitive medical data such as voice recordings. This paper presents a federated learning-based model and Neural Network Architectures designed for early detection of PD using sound data, preserving data privacy by training across distributed devices rather than a central repository. By leveraging acoustic features known to correlate with early PD symptoms, such as vocal tremor, pitch variation, and articulation changes, our model captures these early indicators without compromising patient confidentiality. We evaluate the performance of the model across diverse datasets and show its potential to achieve accurate, privacy-preserving early diagnosis. The results indicate that federated learning is a viable approach for healthcare applications where data privacy is paramount, laying a foundation for non-invasive, scalable, and secure PD screening tools."

The proposed method is based on an approximate measurement of the spurious term affecting the BOFDA measurements, and its subsequent subtraction from the acquired data. The accuracy of the method is first verified numerically, and then through a number of experiments carried out over properly prepared FUTs."

    "abstract": "Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) aims to promote sample efficiency and reduce the number of interactions with the true environment, via learning an environment dynamic model, compared with model-free reinforcement learning (MFRL). However, the success of MBRL heavily relies on two key aspects: model learning and planning. The former refers to learning an accurate model, and the latter aims to improve the behavior policy. In this article, we investigate these two aspects further with model ensemble learning. We design a deep residual attention U-Net (RauNet) with fewer neurons (or weights) than the widely used shallow neural network as our base models and further apply the Hilbert–Schmidt independence criterion (HSIC) as a regularization term to pursue model diversity explicitly for the model ensemble. Furthermore, we propose an adaptive trust region policy optimization (TRPO), in which the parametric Rényi alpha divergence substitutes for the Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence for measuring the difference between two successive policies, and the alpha value can be adaptively adjusted during TRPO training iterations. This method is called diversity-driven model ensemble adaptive TRPO, or simply diversity-driven model ensemble adaptive trust region policy optimization. Our detailed experiments on six benchmark environments show that our proposed approach is optimal, compared with five state-of-the-art RL techniques."

Con-ventional educational approaches frequently prioritize syntax at the expense of logical reasoning and provide minimal per-sonalized feedback. This paper outlines the design and initial assessment of FlowBro, an AI-driven educational tool intended to enhance algorithmic thinking in early programming education. The tool integrates a flowchart visualization, sequential code simulation, and an intelligent assistant that offers contextual hints, debugging tips, and educational support while maintaining a focus on minimalism by not disclosing complete solutions. The system enables students to engage with Python code, follow its execution, and obtain tailored assistance aligned with their specific objectives. A qualitative evaluation with educators in the field revealed the tool's potential advantages, especially in large classes and self-directed learning contexts, while also pointing out challenges concerning the reliability of AI feedback and the necessity for more extensive testing. This study presents a streamlined framework for merging AI with visual learning in programming education, while also suggesting pathways for its future enhancement and empirical testing."

However, numerous challenges, such as low search precision and slow convergence, are imposed on traditional EAs due to high-dimensional expensive optimization problems (HEOPs) in the real world. To address these issues, a surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithm based on variational autoencoder (SAEA-VAE) is proposed in this paper, whose search phase is divided into global search and local search to balance exploration and exploitation. Specifically, a VAE-based dimensionality reduction technique is employed in global search to effectively reduce the search space dimensionality and maintain solution consistency between the latent and original spaces. Experimental evaluations on seven benchmark HEOPs with dimensions ranging from 50 to 200 demonstrate that SAEA-VAE outperforms other benchmark algorithms in terms of both optimization performance and computational efficiency. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of the VAE-based dimensionality reduction, while parameter sensitivity analysis further validates the robustness of SAEA-VAE."

Electric vehicles (EVs) present a sustainable alternative by reducing emissions, noise, and costs. Yet, range anxiety, the fear of battery depletion—remains a key barrier to EV adoption. This study introduces a data-driven AI framework to alleviate range anxiety through accurate prediction of remaining EV range via precise estimation of state of charge (SOC) and state of energy (SOE). Using real-world datasets that include speed, power usage, road gradient, environmental factors, and driving behavior, the system employs a multilayered machine learning model to capture complex relationships and enhance prediction accuracy. Hierarchical modeling integrates SOC and SOE estimates into range forecasting, supported by preprocessing steps like normalization and outlier removal. Validation on real-world EV trip data shows a substantial drop in prediction error, with SOC MAE at 5.96 and validation loss falling from 25.0 to 7.0 over 175 epochs. The MLP model achieves a low MAE of 5.0 in range estimation, outperforming other models. This robust AI framework can boost EV user confidence, improve energy planning, and support the transition to sustainable transport."

This study systematically records annual bus-wise fuel consumption and kilometre-wise route mapping for students commuting to K.R. Mangalam University during the 2022–23 academic session. Using real-time data, carbon emissions were calculated, and artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) models, including Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, were employed for predictive analysis. Comparative analysis of carbon emissions from bus vehicle models was performed, leveraging regression-based modeling to assess CO<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</inf> levels. The results indicate that deep learning-based LSTM models outperform ARIMA in long-term forecasting, providing more accurate insights into emission trends. The study proposes multiple strategic recommendations to the university management for reducing carbon footprints, including policy reforms, sustainable transportation alternatives, and afforestation initiatives. The work highlights the institution’s role in promoting environmental consciousness, fostering carbon-conscious practices, and achieving net-zero emissions. The study also outcome with student-incubated project on route optimization and real-time student tracking to enhance transportation efficiency. Discussing the technical challenges and shifting towards AI-driven sustainable solutions in academia can work as a scalable model applicable to broader industrial sectors, including logistics, FMCG, and mining, for efficient environmental management."

In this article, a multiobjective logistics scheduling model is formulated, which simultaneously optimizes the total length of delivery routes and the fairness of workload distribution among delivery employees. In addition, real-world traffic data is incorporated into the proposed model to enhance its practicality. To deal with the proposed model, an ant colony system approach with local search (ACS-LS) is proposed. The ants in ACSLS schedule the delivery routes of each employee and mainly optimize the total length of delivery routes. An archive is used to store the nondominated solutions found during the search process. To balance the working time among employees and optimize workload fairness, a local search strategy is designed in ACS-LS to adjust the assigned customers among delivery employees. 28 instances are constructed based on real-world traffic data in Guangzhou, China and the experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed ACS-LS approach."

    "abstract": "Recently, iterative adaptive approach (IAA) has received enthusiastic attention as a super-resolution direction of arrival (DOA) estimation algorithm based on the weighted least squares (WLS). However, this algorithm is computationally intensive and can only estimate the targets located on the predefined discrete angular grids. As a result, this paper proposes an alternating descent weighted least squares (ADWLS) algorithm to estimate the angles of off-grid targets. Under the assumption of spatial sparsity, this algorithm utilizes Taylor expansion to approximate the real steering vectors of the offgrid targets. Subsequently, using the weighted least squares as the cost function, the sparse offsets of the targets and the reconstructed dictionary matrix are alternately updated at each iteration. Afterwards, the real angles of the on-grid or off-grid targets are accurately estimated by several iterations until convergence. Compared with IAA, the novel proposed algorithm ADWLS has less computational complexity and can accurately estimate the DOAs that mismatch the predefined discrete angular grids. The simulation results show that the estimation performance of the proposed algorithm is better under certain circumstances, especially compelling in the cases of single snapshot and correlated sources."

    "abstract": "On-chip cache resources play a crucial role in determining the performance of multi-core processors. However, certain cache resources of multi-core processors may be underutilized in a few scenarios. The rigid cache hierarchy poses an obstacle to leveraging these underutilized cache resources to benefit cache-sensitive applications. Additionally, modern processor designs tend to deepen cache levels, and share out last-level cache (LLC) capacity to individual upstream caches, resulting in fewer available LLC resources per core and potentially more underutilized cache resources. To tackle this challenge, we introduce Homonoia, a technique that reinvents underutilized cache resources, disregarding inherent constraints of cache hierarchies, and expands LLC capacity with these resources for cache-sensitive applications. The key idea of Homonoia is to allow LLC evictions with high reusability to be deposited in on-chip caches instead of being directly written back to off-chip memory. Moreover, Homonoia incorporates a reinforcement learning-based predictor to accurately forecast the reusability of LLC evictions under diverse workload scenarios. A novel coherence protocol feature called DEPOSIT is proposed to ensure the efficiency of depositing behavior and transparency to software. Our experimental results demonstrate that Homonoia significantly improves the performance of baseline multi-core processors by an average of 20% in several cache-sensitive applications."

Experimental results demonstrate notable improvements over baseline methods: a 7.1% higher Recall@10 for retrieval tasks, a 5.8 BLEU point improvement in low-resource translation, and a 6.1% increase in hate speech detection accuracy. Interestingly, the disparity in accuracy between Black and White demographic subgroups drops from 12.3% to 4.7%.

For each study, we examined key aspects including the AI technique employed, the type of input data used, reported performance, and stated limitations. We found that most approaches focused on early detection, particularly through medical imaging and deep learning models. While many systems achieved accuracy comparable to that of clinical experts, limitations were frequent, including small sample sizes, lack of external validation, and reduced effectiveness in post-eradication cases. Only a minority of works addressed explainability or assessed model performance across diverse populations. These findings reveal both the promise and the current barriers of AI-based tools for H. pylori, emphasizing the need for more robust, generalizable, and interpretable solutions."

Since the optimization criterion with respect to sampling positions constitutes a nonconvex problem, a two-stage optimization strategy is employed. First, a recursive formulation of the objective function is derived, enabling the iterative selection of sampling positions that minimize the incremental increase in the cost function. This leads to a greedy yet effective selection of near-optimal sampling locations. The sampling positions obtained from the greedy algorithm are then used to initialize the population of a genetic algorithm, which further refines the sampling configuration through global optimization. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, showing improved performance compared to the approach initialized using rank-revealing QR factorization."

We formulate a distributionally robust optimal control (DRO) problem by modeling the weight uncertainty via a Wasserstein-type ambiguity set. The resulting non-convex min-max problem is shown to be equivalently transformed into a tractable, deterministic Semidefinite Program (SDP) by leveraging duality theory and convex lifting techniques. The standard nominal (non-robust) controller can fail to satisfy terminal constraints under plausible worst-case weight distributions within the ambiguity set. In contrast, the proposed DRO controller successfully guarantees constraint satisfaction in these scenarios, demonstrating its improved robustness."

    "abstract": "Heat pumps have the capability for fast adjustments in power consumption with potential connections to large heating inertia district heating networks, and are thus a very impor tant resource for providing frequency support in low-inertia power systems. Nevertheless, the coupling of power networks with district heating systems renders the underlying dynamics much more involved. It is therefore important to ensure that system stability and appropriate power sharing are maintained. In this paper, we consider the problem of leveraging district heating systems as ancillary services for primary frequency control in power networks via heat pumps. We propose a novel power sharing scheme for heating systems based on the average temperature. This enables an optimal power allocation among diverse energy sources without requiring load disturbance information. We then discuss two approaches for heating systems to contribute to frequency regulation in power networks. We show that both approaches ensure stability in the combined heat and power network and facilitate optimal power allocation among the different energy sources. We also discuss how various generation dynamics can be incorporated into our framework with guaranteed stability and optimality. Finally, we conduct simulations that demonstrate various tradeoffs in the transient response and the practical potential of the proposed approaches."

Group activity recognition focuses on modeling the interactions and coordinated actions among multiple individuals, going beyond isolated person-level analysis to capture socially aware, contextrich patterns. Accurate recognition of collective group activities in crowded scenes remains a critical challenge in computer vision due to complex inter-person interactions and occlusions. This work proposes an integrated framework that emphasizes socially aware modeling by combining advanced techniques for segmentation, feature extraction, and deep learning-based temporal attention mechanisms. A diverse set of handcrafted appearance features; including ORB, Texton, ridge patterns, and local binary patterns-is extracted from segmented silhouettes to enrich descriptive capacity. Dimensionality reduction is performed using t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE), preserving local data structures for efficient representation. Classification is achieved through a hybrid model that integrates a ResNet backbone with a SpatialTemporal Attention Network, enabling effective modeling of inter-person dependencies and collective group behaviors over time. Experimental evaluation on the Collective Activity Dataset (CAD) demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed framework, achieving an overall recognition accuracy of 89.60 %, underscoring its suitability for real-world group activity analysis tasks."

To address these two issues, this paper proposes a constraint-aware Transformer Architecture Search framework in latent space, named LatentTAS, that leverages a variational autoencoder (VAE) to map discrete architectures into a continuous latent space. A multi-objective surrogate is introduced to jointly predict the feasibility, performance indicator, and computational complexity of latent representations. To further ensure that the search converges efficiently within the feasible range, a dynamic feasibility threshold mechanism is designed, providing adaptive constraint control during both generation and selection stages in the evolutionary search. Comprehensive experiments conducted on the ImageNet under different parameter budgets demonstrate that the proposed method can consistently discover competitive and efficient Transformer architectures while adhering to resource constraints, outperforming various representative handcrafted and automated baselines. Overall, this work presents a new perspective for modeling discrete structures within a latent space and introduces a constraint-aware evolutionary search paradigm, laying a methodological foundation for practical and deployable neural architecture automation."

    "abstract": "Wi-Fi channel state information (CSI) enables lowcost, privacy-preserving indoor localization, but current solutions’ accuracy drops with temporal and environmental changes, especially in single access point (AP) setups. This is mainly because CSI is underutilized when treating the amplitude and phase separately or using simple fusion methods, such as concatenation, which causes cross-mode information loss. Existing domain adaptation techniques to address such drifts often assume multi-AP setups or require fine-tuning in the target domain, further widening the gap. This paper introduces DATSIL, a source-only, single-AP indoor localization framework that combines Wi-Fi CSI amplitude and phase into compact tensor fingerprints, learns multilinear projections, and aligns features before support vector regression. Using commodity hardware, this paper also contributes a real-world dataset: two collection campaigns in a large, cluttered office six months apart with significant layout changes. On this dataset, DATSIL achieves a mean localization error of 1.80 m and $8-14 \\%$ improvement over the strongest baselines, with tighter low-error tails in the cumulative error distribution. Collectively, DATSIL offers a robust, low-maintenance solution for single-AP deployment in real environments."

To address the issue of channel allocation in these networks, graph theory is applied to analyze the features of the wireless channel from a macro viewpoint and applies the graph coloring in wireless channel allocation from a microscopic perspective. In our study spectrum coloring induced by threshold issue fixes the number of colors available and seeks to minimize the disruption threshold for a given spectrum.

    "abstract": "Recent entrepreneurship education advancements include case studies, guest speakers, business plan development, simulations and games, team-based discussions, seminars, problem-solving, individual and role-playing, group projects, lectures, and guest lecturers. Despite student-centered approaches that encourage active participation, lectures are generally teacher-centered. The facts show that occasionally a variety of strategies is needed. DMs K-means clustering method is used to develop an analytical model for assessing entrepreneurship education initiatives because making judgements in unexpected business environments, especially functional domains, is difficult. The study found no effective Neural Architecture Search (NAS) technique for attention-based models. NASSA, an attention-based network Neural Architecture Search technique, solves this. For better performance, NASSA eliminates undefined components like attention layers and cells from attention-based models. The NASSA framework greatly improves attention-based architectural search in trials. The model outperforms previous attention-based neural network optimization methods with 97.33% accuracy. Entrepreneurship programs should use many training methods to tackle business unknowns, according to the report. NASSA improves attention-based networks by searching neural architectures systematically. They foster education and DL research and development."

The proposed system realizes a long propagation path of 16.61 m through 26 internal reflections within a compact chamber, thereby simultaneously overcoming the spatial constraints of existing long-path experiments and the sensitivity limitations of small cells. Measurement results in the 330–490 GHz band under precisely controlled relative humidity (20–90%, ±0.5%) showed high agreement with the ITU-R P.676-13 model and demonstrated that stable measurements are possible even at high attenuation levels, which are difficult to implement in open environments. With its structural flexibility and precise environmental control capabilities, the CMC platform is expected to serve as a key tool for future 6G channel modeling and atmospheric propagation research."

Internet of Things (IoT) device security is already a major concern because to large amounts of data produced by communication between devices besides the presence of imbalanced data from network traffic. There is hope that AI technologies, chiefly machine learning and deep learning, might identify and counteract these security risks to IoT networks. For the purpose of making predictions, this research suggests creating a TSTN, or Temporal-based Swin Transformer Network. The LSTM and the Swin Transformer are the two primary components of TSTN. To learn extremely expressive representations and encode remote dependencies, the Swin Transformer uses the attention mechanism. For time-related data extraction, the LSTM is the way to go. It can learn long-range dependencies. To further ensure that the input dataset is balanced, the study employs the optimal Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) model. To improve classification accuracy, the Horse Herd Optimization Algorithm (HHOA) ideally selects the SMOTE sample rate. Lastly, the suggested prototypical is put through its paces using a publically available dataset for intrusion detection, the CIC IOT 2022 dataset. And by quickly responding to security issues in IoT networks, the representations may even improve intrusion detection in such networks."

For wideband signals, an improved signal subspace focusing technique is designed to convert multifrequency observations into an equivalent narrowband model.

To address registration challenges in feature-sparse regions, a dual-path parallel feature fusion module is proposed, which combines local geometric embeddings (LGE) with Neighbor-to-Point (N2P) attention. An adaptive multi-mechanism loss function (AMLF) is developed to enhance registration robustness in low-overlap scenarios. For defect detection, a two-stage cascade approach is employed: the Curvature-Normal Plane Analysis and Detection (CNPAD) algorithm identifies defect cores, while the Multi-Radius PCA Growing Algorithm (MRPGA) ensures complete defect extraction. A Curved Trajectory Neck Constriction Defect Measurement Algorithm (CT-NCDMA) is introduced for precise quantification of arbitrarily shaped defects. Experimental results on the 3DMatch dataset demonstrate a registration success rate of 95.4%, with relative rotation error (RRE) of 5.827° and relative translation error (RTE) of 0.152m. On industrial validation samples, the method achieves RRE of 1.169°, RTE of 0.257mm, and 100% registration success rate. Defect detection accuracy reaches 98.30% with an F1-score of 0.9592. Measurement errors for length, width, and depth are reduced to 17.39%, 27.37%, and 40.29% of baseline methods, respectively. This method provides an effective solution for automated quality inspection of stamped components."

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate promising capabilities in natural language understanding and reasoning with enormous parameter spaces and vast amounts of training data. These attributes have facilitated their deployment into diverse application domains. However, the underlying parameters implicitly assume decision-making boundaries, resulting in a significant number of decision spaces not covered by training data. This makes them susceptible to adversarial manipulations through carefully crafted inputs. To illuminate the vulnerabilities of LLMs, we propose a unified token-level jailbreaking attack that makes victim models generate responses for potentially harmful queries. Specifically, we propose an evolutionary algorithm to evolve perturbation sets, utilizing gradient-based and crossover-based operators to enhance performance under multiple scenarios. Furthermore, we develop a repository for reusing past perturbations and conduct an analysis of token sensitivity within LLMs, facilitating zero-shot attacks with convergence. Extensive benchmark experiments validate the effectiveness of our method on three different models, achieving increases of 62.36%, 57.89%, and 64.81% in attack success rates compared to baseline methods under white-box scenarios. In addition, the evaluation experiments demonstrate our method is effective for multiple scenarios and different size of models. This research reveals vulnerabilities of LLMs, provides theoretical foundations for developing more robust defense strategies, and contributes to building more reliable AI systems."

The proposed design methodology is applied to a 22 kW EESM with fixed core dimensions. The process involves: 1) deriving the required torque-speed profile based on the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC); 2) conducting parametric analyses to evaluate key motor performance characteristics; and 3) satisfying terminal voltage constraints by optimizing stator winding configurations, including the number of turns and parallel paths, while targeting high-efficiency operating points. The rotor field winding parameters are determined based on voltage level constraints, which are influenced by the design of the contactless power supply (CPS) system that supplies the power the field winding.

This method estimates changes in surface dielectric properties by analyzing backscatter ratios between consecutive acquisitions, under the assumption that soil moisture fluctuates more rapidly than vegetation and/or roughness changes. The inversion scheme integrates ancillary data, namely a coarse-scale soil moisture product, soil texture maps, and field capacity, to constrain the solution and minimize outliers. The influence of key parameters, including the inversion window size, was examined. Additional corrections are introduced to handle limitations arising from crop type or measurement depth, including a seasonal adjustment model. The approach is validated using in situ soil moisture data from multiple test sites in Denmark. Results show that the STCD method achieves strong agreement with ground-based observations, yielding an overall correlation of R = 0.72, low bias (-0.26%), and an RMSE of 4.32%. These findings support the potential of short-term SAR change detection for scalable, high-resolution soil moisture monitoring in agricultural landscapes where backscatter variability is well characterized."

    "abstract": "Super-enhancers (SEs), comprising clusters of transcriptional regulatory elements, play essential roles in gene expression regulation and cell fate determination. Current computational methods for identifying SEs from genomic sequences face challenges in prediction accuracy and cross-species generalizability. This study introduces TransSE, a deep learning framework combining convolutional and recurrent neural networks with cross-species transfer learning for SE prediction. TransSE employs a two-phase strategy: pre-training on combined human and mouse data to learn conserved regulatory features, followed by species-specific fine-tuning to capture organism-specific patterns. Evaluation on human and mouse datasets demonstrates that TransSE achieves superior accuracy compared to existing methods including SENet, DeepSE, and transformer-based models (DNABERT, Enformer), with AUC values of 0.828 (human) and 0.832 (mouse). Ablation studies confirm that convolutional blocks are essential for feature extraction, while transfer learning and recurrent layers provide meaningful performance improvements. Feature analysis reveals that TransSE distinguishes SEs from typical enhancers based on learned sequence representations, achieving 10.4-fold improvement in clustering metrics. The model demonstrates effective cross-species prediction capability, maintaining AUC <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\gt $</tex-math></inline-formula> 0.79 when trained on one species and evaluated on another.

    "abstract": "Human body dynamics, as a temporal variation pattern of pose sequences in 3D skeleton-based human motion prediction, has been extensively studied in spatial-temporal dependent modeling of deep learning. However, designing an effective modeling approach that fully harnesses physical principles to enhance algorithmic performance remains a challenge. Existing approaches prioritize displacement information, processing deterministic physical parameters via standard neural networks while modeling rotation motion through simplified angular constraints. Such physical approximation methods neglect the high-dimensional and dynamic characteristics of Dynamics variables, undermining the integrity and diversity of human motion feature representations. To alleviate these limitations, we propose an Adaptive Multi-scale Lagrange Dynamics Spatial-Temporal Network (AMLD-STNet), which directly embeds learnable neural network modules within physical equations to activate multi-scale dynamic physical feature modeling of human motion. Specifically, A Lagrange Dynamics Network (LD-Net) is constructed, which designs a set of joint force adjacency matrices to analyze the mechanical correlation between the velocity and acceleration of each joint motion through the Lagrange Dynamics equation. Subsequently, the Lagrange Dynamic Spatial-Temporal Network (LD-STNet) is established, which utilizes LD-Net to extract multi-perspective high-dimensional features of human displacement and rotational motion represented by Dynamics pose variables. To capture the mechanical correlation of joint node groups, we design a multi-scale streams LD-STNet, which can realize adaptive scale transformation according to the joint force adjacency. Additionally, Euler angle loss is employed to enforce rotational consistency constraints, thereby enhancing physical realism during network training. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted on three popular benchmarks, such as Human 3.6M, AMASS, and 3DPW, among which AMLD-STNet achieved state-of-the-art results with a smaller model size."

In the proposed method, the weighted sum of cyclic frequency sidelobes is used as the LPI performance metric based on cyclostationary spectrum analysis (CSA). Under the power and ACF-PSLR constraints, the LPI radar waveform design is formulated as a non-convex quartic optimization problem. By introducing auxiliary variables, it is transformed into multiple quadratic subproblems with independent variables and linear inequality constraints, which can be efficiently solved via the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Simulation results verify that the proposed method can achieve better LPI performance while satisfy the demand of target detection."

Conventional IDS cannot identify new attacks, since detection depends on predefined specific rules, and has poor capabilities for detecting new attacks. Such systems usually rely on common machine learning algorithms that do not detect hidden indications of cyber-physical attacks. In this research study, a TL framework with a Transformer-based structure is proposed to build an effective attack detection model in EVCS, better than LSTM-based models due to scalability. In contrast to prior recurrent frameworks, the proposed framework employs three state-of-the-art transformer architectures, RoBERTa, T5, and DeBERTa, which operate on significant volumes of information and improve the ability to identify intrusions in EVCSs. The process includes data normalization and min-max scaling during preprocessing, followed by finetuning on the CICEVSE2024 dataset (EVSE-A and EVSEB). The evaluation framework uses a training and testing approach, measuring performance through various metrics such as accuracy, validation accuracy, loss, and ROC-AUC. The results show that the transformer models achieved accuracies of 98.90%, 98.95%, and 98.99% for RoBERTa, T5, and DeBERTa, respectively. These findings demonstrate that the TL framework provides high precision and robustness, offering an effective defense against a wide range of cyber-physical attacks on EVCS."

This study proposes a deep learning framework integrating YOLOv8 for food detection, EfficientNet-B3 for classification, and USDA-based regression for calorie estimation. Using the Food-101 dataset, reformatted for YOLO training, the model was trained with data augmentation and evaluated on multiple metrics, including mean average precision (mAP), F1-score, and mean absolute error (MAE). The YOLOv8 detector achieved 76.7% mAP@0.5, surpassing the 75% practical benchmark, while EfficientNet-B3 fine-tuned with ImageNet pretraining improved classification accuracy by 19.5% compared to training from scratch. Calorie estimation achieved an MAE of 48.2 kcal, with USDA integration reducing error by 14.3% relative to vision-only baselines. Robustness tests under occlusion and lighting variations revealed less than 8% mAP drop, confirming resilience to real-world noise. However, cross-dataset validation on UECFOOD100 revealed a 12.6% accuracy gap for Asian cuisines, highlighting the cultural bias of Western-centric datasets.

Future directions include depth-based volume estimation and mobile optimization for real-world deployment."

    "abstract": "Gunshot Detection Systems (GDS) are increasingly deployed in public, institutional, and protected areas to enable rapid, real-time response to firearm incidents. Conventional acoustic-only solutions suffer from high false-alarm rates, limited adaptability to dynamic environments, and restricted spatial awareness. Recent advances in Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies have enabled intelligent GDS capable of context-aware detection, firearm classification, and shooter localization through multi-modal inputs including audio, video, and infrared data. These systems can adapt to background noise, time-of-day conditions, and deployment context, improving detection reliability while reducing latency. This survey focuses on sensor-driven, IoT-enabled gunshot detection pipelines that involve on-site sensing, edge or cloud-based inference, and operational deployment, and it does not address internet-only information collection or general crime analytics frameworks. This survey analyzes 156 peer-reviewed studies published between 1998 and 2025, organized into six analytical dimensions: detection and modeling approaches, application contexts, hardware and deployment infrastructure, communication and security frameworks, environmental and spatial adaptability, and performance evaluation. Across these, we identify persistent challenges spanning both technical and operational domains, including accurate detection in noisy or reverberant environments, reliable localization in GPS-poor or complex terrains, low-latency multimodal fusion, scalability under resource constraints, dataset scarcity, privacy and ethical considerations, vulnerability to spoofing or suppressors, and secure, real-time communication for rapid response. By consolidating technical advances and mapping them to these open problems, the review provides actionable insights for designing scalable, energy-efficient, and trustworthy GDS suitable for diverse real-world deployments."

    "abstract": "Securing image data is crucial in today’s fast-paced digital world, particularly for sensitive applications like medical imaging, military systems, and surveillance. By combining encryption using common cryptographic techniques, such as Data Encryption Standard (DES) or Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), with picture augmentation using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), this research presents a revolutionary two-stage framework for safe image transmission. PSO improves image quality in the initial stage by maximizing visual qualities like sharpness, contrast, and brightness. The objective function was developed to retain important visual characteristics and ensure adequate clarity. The improved image undergoes symmetric encryption in the second stage using DES or AES to guarantee the confidentiality of the data during transmission and storage. This hybrid approach suits real-time applications and offers strong security and visual integrity. Experiments conducted on typical benchmark photos consistently improved encryption quality and visual qualities. This is demonstrated by the high entropy value, minimal pixel correlation, and high level of security against various cryptographic attacks. The advantages of using meta-heuristic optimization techniques in conjunction with conventional cryptographic algorithms for secure image transmission are presented in the well-considered framework that has been suggested."

The dataset, which was selected for its large number of food classes, consists of 101,000 real-world food images divided equally between 101 class labels. The proposed model is designed in a two-stage methodology using a general model trained on all classes to obtain a heuristic value followed by use of a specialized sub-model for fine-tuned classification. In the first stage, a general model groups and adds up the predictions by cluster, providing a confidence value for each cluster. In the second stage, the model for the cluster with the highest confidence value is used for the final classification. Each cluster model is trained on a small subset of classes, reducing time and cost along with improving the performance. The study evaluates whether using smaller label subsets in sub-models leads to better classification performance in comparison to the general model while keeping training time manageable. The sub-models reach over 95 percent accuracy after training for 30 epochs, while the general model achieves 82 percent after 50 epochs. Therefore, the sub-models outperform the general model on the specific label subsets they were trained on, and take converge faster."

Traditional machine learning-based intrusion detection systems (IDS) often fall short in effectively identifying complex and evolving cyber threats. To address this challenge, we propose a robust deep learning-based IDS framework tailored for IoMT environments, incorporating novel bio-inspired optimization techniques. The framework begins with preprocessing the dataset using Z-score normalization, followed by feature selection using the slime mould algorithm (SMA) to identify the most relevant features and reduce dimensionality. These features are then input into a customized stochastic weight averaging convolutional neural network (SWA-CNN) designed for accurate intrusion detection. To further optimize the model's performance, hyperparameters are fine-tuned using the Sperm Whale Optimization (SWO) algorithm. Experimental validation on the benchmark UNSW-NB15 dataset demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach, achieving an accuracy of 99.28%, precision of 98.21%, recall of 99.01%, and F1-score of 98.61%. The proposed SMA-SWO-SWA-CNN framework shows superior performance compared to conventional models and offers a promising solution for enhancing cybersecurity in IoMT applications."

To address this issue, this paper proposes a grating lobe suppression method based on the joint processing of amplitude-phase coherence factor (AM-PCF). This method first utilizes the amplitude characteristics of the back projection (BP) imaging grid to generate a threshold screening mechanism, which retains significant scattering areas and suppresses low amplitude interference areas. Subsequently, the phase coherence factor is calculated within the screened areas. Finally, the corresponding PCF is used to weight the screened BP imaging results to achieve suppression of grating lobes. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to traditional PCF weighting methods, the pro- posed method is more effective in suppressing grating lobes in MIMO array radar imaging."

The communication bottlenecks, the single points of failure, and the limited scalability are the reasons why centralized control is not appropriate in dynamic or communication-constrained environments. In order to solve these problems, the authors introduce SCOPE (Scalable, Communication-free Offset-based Path-planning and Estimation), which is a new and fully decentralized swarm formation strategy. The SCOPE framework marks the crucial contribution that allows small autonomous robots to create and keep up exact geometric formations without any robot communication or a main controller. Each TurtleBot3 robot works separately in its own ROS namespace and employs a modular control stack: Adaptive Monte Carlo Localization (AMCL) for probabilistic pose estimation, Navfn for global path planning, and the Dynamic Window Approach (DWA) for real-time obstacle avoidance. To compute relative formation positions without a central controller or leader, the authors introduce a new virtual target offset method. The simulations demonstrated that the proposed system is effective by accomplishing 92% of the obstacles avoided, 89% of the formation accuracy, 95% of the shortest path adherence, and 91% of the path-following precision. In simulations, four TurtleBot3 Burgers were used, and three were used in hardware (limited availability) dynamic formation control. These outcomes strengthen the idea of the proposed decentralized architecture being suitable for real-world scenarios such as warehouse automation, decentralized logistics, and autonomous material handling."

In this work, we present a novel technique to suppress range migration using millimeter-wave radar. The proposed approach combines fast-time spectrum peak detection for motion compensation with slow-time autoregressive modeling to reconstruct the signal corrupted by range migration, and further leverages the acceleration characteristics to extract the target heart rate from motion-suppressed phase data. Both simulations and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, enabling reliable and precise heart rate measurement using an Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave radar system."

    "abstract": "With the development of 5G technology, the demand for large language models (LLMs) in private network operation and maintenance is growing. These models enhance the intelligence and efficiency of network management through deep learning techniques. However, the application of LLMs for 5G private network operation and maintenance faces the dual challenges of data security and resource limitations. To address these challenges, we propose SQLLM, which is an integrated framework dedicated to detecting abnormal user query-based network attacks and performing high-quality compression on large language detection models for network attacks. Specifically, leveraging the powerful representational capacity of large language models, we utilize the LoRA fine-tuning technique to identify normal questions and three types of attack questions, thus avoiding behaviors that attempt to disrupt or obtain sensitive information. Moreover, this research innovatively adopts the static quantization technique to compress LLMs for private network operation and maintenance. Unlike traditional static quantization that uses fixed parameters and uniform granularity for activations, our optimized strategy introduces a dynamic smoothing factor α to transfer outlier variance from activations to weights and adopts a hybrid per-tensor/per-token granularity tailored to 5G O&M data, thus avoiding the challenge of the sharp decline in the inference ability of the quantized LLM caused by outliers, enabling it to adapt to resource-constrained and multi-user concurrent usage environments. Finally, we validate four types of questions and evaluate the performance of the quantized model on key performance indicators such as accuracy, VRAM consumption, and inference time. The experimental results demonstrate that the SQLLM model achieves excellent performance on all test indicators. This achievement proves the security and feasibility of the efficient deployment of LLMs for private network operation and maintenance in the 5G private network environment with network attacks and resource limitations."

    "abstract": "To solve the dilemma that the interference suppression number of traditional uniform linear based beamformer is limited by the number of elements and is sensitive to the angle error, this paper proposes a design method of optimal sparse array based on robust multiple interferences suppression beamforming, which realizes the super-degree of freedom interference suppression in the presence of angular errors. When the angle of the signal is roughly known, this method first takes the minimization of the $l_{1}$ norm of the weight vector of the array as the objective function, and the degree of suppression in each interference direction is used as a constraint condition to construct the original optimization problem. The paper solves the optimization problem based on the iterative weighted $l_{1}$ norm method, and then the static beamforming weights is converted into the adaptive beamforming weights by combining with the data covariance matrix of the actual received signals, so as to further improve the output signal-to-interference-to-noise ratio (SINR). The simulation results show that the sparse array designed by this method can save 1/4 of the array elements compared with the uniform linear array under the same design objectives, and has strong robustness to the angle estimation error of the signal."

Specifically, double-summation operations, including adjacent sum and prefix sum, are defined to construct the SDCA via interelement spacing (IES) set. According to this, existing MISCbased sparse arrays can be converted into their corresponding SDCA versions, which, however suffer from a relatively short maximum consecutive sum-coarray (SCA). By contrast, the proposed array, termed Ex-MISC, has a longer consecutive SCA, and has no overlapping virtual sensors between its maximum consecutive segments of difference coarray (DCA) and SCA, resulting in higher number of available DOFs. Simulation results validate the superiority of the proposed Ex-MISC array, highlighting its potential for improving the direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation performance."

In this research, we propose a novel AI-powered framework that fuses deep learning and natural language processing to automate the psychological interpretation of children’s HTP drawings. The system employs ResNet-34, a convolutional neural network (CNN), for advanced image analysis to detect and interpret nuanced visual patterns in the drawings. These patterns are then transformed into coherent, human-like psychological insights using a transformer-based language generation model, specifically BART. Unlike static, template-driven systems, our approach dynamically generates rich, context-aware psychological narratives that align with clinical reasoning. This interdisciplinary methodology presents a significant step forward in augmenting traditional psychological evaluation with scalable, interpretable, and data-driven intelligence."

    "abstract": "Effective epidemic control depends on understanding how individuals respond to multi-source information. However, existing research often treats two key behavioral responses—compulsory regulating and adaptive rewiring— separately, overlooking the co-evolution of network topology with the individual states. To address this, we propose a novel Unaware-Aware-Unaware and Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (UAU-SIS) model that integrates these dual behavioral mechanisms, driven by cognitive and official information. Our model's framework, where the network topology is regenerated at each discrete timestep, is a key simplification for mathematical tractability. Within each step, however, the connection process is highly adaptive, governed by state-dependent rules rather than pure randomness. This setup, analyzed via the microscopic Markov chain approach (MMCA), enables us to analytically derive the epidemic threshold under their combined effects. Experimental results reveal their complementary properties: adaptive rewiring excels at preventing outbreaks by raising the epidemic threshold, whereas compulsory regulating is vital for mitigating prevalence during an ongoing epidemic. Importantly, strong adaptive rewiring can substantially suppress epidemic spread even under weak compulsory regulation. Furthermore, we validate the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed model on diverse real-world networks. Overall, this study provides a rigorous theoretical framework for understanding information-behavior-epidemic co-dynamics, offering critical insights for designing effective hybrid intervention strategies."

The latter make possible the disassembly of switching cells by keeping low electrical resistance and inductance inside the package. Thus, static and dynamic experimental characterizations are carried out to evaluate their impact compared to copper interposers. Static measurements show that the electrical resistance of the package is in the range from 3 to 4 mΩ. Dynamic characterizations demonstrate that the stray inductance of the switching cell is close to 3 nH. With results obtained with copper interposers close to the ones obtained with foams, the material used for the electrical interconnection have low impact on the electrical performances of the power module. However, the modification of the pressure distribution in the power module induces a modification of the resistance and stray inductance. This dependency is more important for copper interposers because they are non-deformable."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a low-frequency metasurface that generates a highly focused magnetic field when excited by an actively fed transmitting coil for long-range resonant inductive wireless power transfer. A theoretical framework based on magnetic dipole theory is derived to calculate the optimal currents required to shape the magnetic field into a confined hotspot at a target working distance. The optimization process maximizes the correlation between the desired field distribution and the combined contributions of the metasurface and transmitter. To verify the design methodology, practical considerations are deployed to effectively design the metasurface unit cell, an asymmetrically twisted double-layer spiral, able to maximize inductance while maintaining the ohmic losses low. Then, a 5×5 metasurface array, covering an overall area of 22 cm × 22 cm and operating at 4 MHz, undergoes validation through numerical simulations and experimental testing. Simulations revealed a 40 mm diameter hotspot (~λ/1800) at a distance of 10 cm from the transmitter, with experimental results from a PCB prototype confirming these findings and estimating a power transfer 18 dB higher in the focusing region with respect to no metasurface configuration. Besides, the system demonstrated robustness by maintaining focus despite variations in the metasurface-to-transmitter distance. This work provides a practical, scalable solution to address distance limitations in magnetic near field focusing, eliminating the need for guiding structures such as ferrites and simplifying design for WPT applications."

The approach of using planar arrays with more sensors in DOA estimation has high resolution in detection. Notably, active array architectures such as MIMO configurations employed in DOA estimation offer distinct advantages in passive target detection, with their inherent sum co-array characteristics significantly improving estimation accuracy. Consequently, the development of planar sparse active array configurations emerges as a new research direction for achieving compact system dimensions while maintaining high-resolution performance. This study proposes a new planar sparse MIMO array geometry specifically designed to amplify the benefits of advanced signal processing techniques.

The asymmetric potential formed under an applied electric field of 7.6 kV/cm and a bias of -3 V results in discrete energy levels, which were determined using both analytical Airy function solutions and validated by Finite Difference Method (FDM)-based numerical simulations. The close agreement between the two approaches confirms the accuracy of the model, with an energy separation of approximately 93.7 meV between the first two subbands, corresponding to an infrared detection wavelength of around 13.2 μm. In this study, we have examined optical response parameters, such as the absorption coefficient and refractive index change, using susceptibility-based modeling and the density matrix formalism. Results showed a strong dependence on incident optical intensity, ranging from 0 to 0.6 MW/cm<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>. This demonstrates the nonlinear behaviors of the photodetector, including saturable absorption and refractive index modulation. The third-order nonlinear susceptibility was observed to counteract the linear term, resulting in a net decrease in absorption and refractive index change at higher intensities. The originality of the present work is the dual-method investigation of a narrow TQW structure under precise control of intersubband transitions and intensity-dependent optical effects. The outcome demonstrates the potential of TQWs as high-speed, tunable terahertz and infrared photodetectors, making them applicable in high-speed THz communication devices."

In this paper, we propose a two-stage decoding method called Dynamic Cognitive Reconciliation Decoding (<monospace xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">DCRD</monospace>), to predict and mitigate context-memory conflicts. <monospace xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">DCRD</monospace> first analyzes the attention map to assess context fidelity and predict potential conflicts.

    "abstract": "The dielectric reliability of transformer oil is essential for the secure operation of high-voltage transformer in power systems. However, streamer discharge behavior can be significantly impacted by inservice contamination from micro-impurities, especially non-spherical particles like metal flakes, cellulose fibers, and aging by-products, which can cause premature insulation breakdown. This study uses a 2D axisymmetric model built in COMSOL Multiphysics to investigate how non-spherical micro-impurities affect streamer discharge behavior. Electrostatics, charge transport, and heat transfer have been used in the simulation to study the electric field distribution, space charge density, and steamer morphology in the presence of spherical and non-spherical particles. The results demonstrate that non-spherical particles, which act as secondary ionization centers and drive streamer branching, produce localized electric field enhancements due to their sharp edges and uneven surfaces. Spherical particles, on the other hand, exhibit slower and more consistent discharge behavior due to their finer field interactions. Sharp-edged impurities encourage greater space charge accumulation and electron concentrations, leading to hotspots that raise the risk of dielectric breakdown. This morphology-driven dynamic raises questions regarding the reliability of transformer insulation and significantly affects pre-breakdown procedures. This paper highlights the necessity of realistic impurity geometries in modelling for accurate investigations of streamer dynamics in liquid dielectrics. In order to increase grid reliability and asset longevity, the manufacturers may also utilize these findings to create robust insulating systems that are more resilient to particle-induced deterioration in power transformers."

However, the hard-to-measure process variables poses challenges for online monitoring of batch processes. Soft sensor technology overcomes the limitations of traditional sensors and online instruments in measuring hard-to-measure variables in real time, and has become a key approach for the online prediction of these variables. To ensure the accuracy of online predictions by soft sensor models for batch processes, this study proposes an online calibration method of soft sensor for batch processes using just-in-time learning based on multi-similarity measurement. First, considering the temporal feature of data in batch processes, we introduce the sliding time window, and a calibration triggering strategy is constructed based on the changes in causal effects between the online and offline time windows to accurately identify calibration timing. Then, multisimilarity measurement is employed to calculate the similarity between different time windows, and historical time windows belonging to the same mode as the current time window are selected. Finally, these historical data are used to update the soft sensor model parameters online, enabling calibration of soft model for batch processes. Experimental results on the penicillin fermentation process verify the effectiveness of the proposed method."

However, uncertainties are prevalent in multimodal systems, posing challenges for the construction and validation of simulation models. Furthermore, the involvement of multiple stakeholders introduces conflicting optimization objectives. Effectively balancing these objectives to maximize overall benefits has become a critical issue that requires resolution. For the multimodal transport route optimization problem in hybrid uncertainty environments (e.g., there are uncertainties in transportation demand, transportation time, and transfer time), this study constructs a multiobjective optimization model based on fuzzy numbers. The complexity of the model is reduced by introducing the chance-constrained programming theory. To solve the model, a data-driven multi-objective evolutionary algorithm is designed, integrating Monte Carlo simulation with surrogate models to effectively reduce the computational cost of uncertainty estimation. Furthermore, a constraint prioritization strategy is developed to handle multiple conflict objectives, and complex constraints efficiently. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm exhibits excellent performance across networks of varying scales, providing robust decision support for multimodal transportation decision-making."

The proposed method uses discontinuous pulse width modulation (DPWM) in the region where the NP voltage balancing control capability of CBPWM is insufficient to achieve NP voltage balancing control in the whole region. In the DPWM method, the switching state of one leg remains unchanged during a single sampling period, the switching state of the other leg is switched twice, and the switching state of each of the remaining two legs is switched once, which ensures that the total number of switching transitions of the four legs is four during a single sampling period.

Through emulating a shallow CNN on the ARM Cortex-M4 architecture in respect to detecting ECG anomalies, we evaluate how well different models perform along with different latency, energy, and accuracy limits. Findings demonstrate that model size can be minimized by ~83%., energy use by ~65%., as well as latency by~61.” Compared to current compressed deep learning models, our results match them and are even better, which demonstrates the feasibility of shallow TinyML models in realistic edge-based healthcare systems that have low latencies, low power, and high accuracy.

    "abstract": "Downward continuation is an effective technique that enhances anomaly resolution and details. However, high-frequency noise is amplified with increasing continuation depth, which adversely affects data interpretation. A novel stable downward continuation network (SDCNet) model has been proposed to enhance the noise robustness and stability of downward continuation. By incorporating fully convolutional networks (FCN) and Transformer to introduce topographic features and depth information, the model achieves stable downward continuation of magnetic anomaly from a surface to arbitrary target plane or surface, which improves the flexibility of existing intelligent continuation methods. Tests on the synthetic model demonstrate that the proposed method maintains continuation stability while exhibiting noise robustness compared to conventional methods. For noisy data, the maximum reductions in relative error (RE) and root mean square error (RMSE) reach up to 78%. Real data application over the Decorah complex in northeastern Iowa, U. S. shows that the continuation results align well with the distribution of the rock mass, further validating the effectiveness and practicality of the SDCNet in downward continuation."

    "abstract": "In recent years, several parts of the world have experienced increasingly severe wildfires, causing extensive dam-age to forested areas and multiple casualties. The RAT_EOS_PC project, promoted by a consortium that includes CICYTEX and UA, aims to develop a low-cost forest fire monitoring and early warning system, based on wireless sensor network principles. The communication infrastructure is built around the LoRa Wanprotocol, which connects sensor nodes to gateways, and sub-sequently to network and application servers. Prior to sensor deployment, a study was conducted to determine the optimal placement of gateways. The system's IT infrastructure integrates a range of technologies, including Apache Kafka, Mosquitto, Logstash, Elasticsearch, ElastAlert, N8N, Kibana, and Nginx. To evaluate system performance, a prototype was implemented using a limited number of physical sensors, a set of simulated (virtual) sensors, and publicly available meteorological data via APIs. The results show that the system processes incoming data with response times that meet the standards required for emergency communication systems."

Usually, PCOS ultrasonic images are characterized by stubborn noise in background and delicate boundaries between follicles making it difficult to effectively denoise and segment the image. A novel image segmentation technique called “salt segmentation technique” is introduced that effectively segments the follicles being robust to background noise. The method is an effective preprocessing step for further steps like classification of ovaries as infected with PCOS or not, determining follicle count, examining shape and size of follicles, categorization of cysts and determining a woman's fertility based on number of follicles. The effectiveness of our proposed techniques is proved by running machine learning models on raw and segmented images. We attained an accuracy of 99.48 % for SVM model to categorize it as infected ovaries or non-infected ovaries."

In this paper, an online joint estimation method for state of charge (SOC), 3-dimensional state of temperature distribution (SOTD), and state of health (SOH) of batteries based on an electro-thermal-aging coupled model is proposed. Firstly, three well-chosen charging durations are leveraged as the aging features to achieve SOH estimation with the assistance of the extreme learning machine (ELM). Secondly, SOT is estimated through a lumped parameter thermal model (LPTM) and adaptive extended Kalman filter (AEKF), and SOTD is reconstructed using a well-designed fractal theory method (FTM) derived from the iterated function system (IFS) method and a Lindenmayer system (L-system), which ensures precise thermal state monitoring. Then, based on the parameter updating mechanism, the parameters of the equivalent circuit model (ECM) are adjusted in real time according to the accurate SOT and SOH, and the SOC is estimated by the AEKF. Subsequently, the proposed method is validated under different dynamic conditions and different temperatures, the validation results show that the proposed method can achieve accurate SOC-SOTD-SOH co-estimation with an error of no more than 2.14%, 1.37°C, and 1.26%, respectively. Lastly, the investigation of the SOT and SOH influence on SOC estimation reveals the important significance of the co-estimation framework."

    "abstract": "Multi-object tracking (MOT) in aerial videos presents unique challenges due to the complex nature of UAVcaptured scenes, including frequent occlusions, target density, scale variation, and dynamic backgrounds. Traditional tracking approaches often struggle under these conditions, and they rely heavily on shallow appearance or motion features, which leads to identity switches and fragmented trajectories. To address these issues, GraphTrack-UAV, a robust object association framework based on message-passing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) is proposed. The proposed method constructs a spatio-temporal graph where nodes represent candidate detections across frames, and edges encode inter-object dependencies. A spatio-temporal graph pruning strategy is employed to ensure sparsity and computational efficiency. The message-passing mechanism enables the network to capture long-range dependencies, while feature fusion and node aggregation modules enhance robustness against occlusion and appearance variation. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on UAV aerial video datasets validate the superiority of our method in terms of accuracy, robustness, and generalization. Visualization results further illustrate the enhanced trajectory consistency and reduced identity switching achieved by GraphTrack-UAV."

A unified optimization framework has been proposed for simultaneous image reconstruction, pose estimation, and 3D reconstruction. To achieve high-precision joint estimation, effective modeling of spike stream data is crucial to capture the intricate spatiotemporal characteristics. However, existing framework employing stacked convolutional architectures neglects multi-scale data properties inherent in the scene, leading to information loss. To address this deficiency in spatial modeling, we introduce a multi-scale feature architecture into the reconstruction network, leveraging convolutional kernels of varying sizes to explicitly enhance multi-scale modeling capabilities. Furthermore, to refine temporal modeling of the spike stream, an explicit temporal representation is integrated into the network architecture, augmenting overall temporal modeling capacity. Experimental results demonstrate that our method improves the PSNR by 0.628 compared to the baseline."

However, deploying multiple UAVs in realtime to meet dynamic, non-uniform traffic demands remains a significant challenge, especially when aiming to optimize network throughput and resource utilization. In this paper, we propose the Efficient Multi-UAV Traffic-Aware Deployment (EMTAD) algorithm, a scalable algorithm that jointly minimizes UAV count and optimizes 3D positioning based on real-time user distribution and traffic demand. In contrast to prior works that assume static user patterns or fixed UAV counts, EMTAD dynamically adapts UAV deployment to maximize spectral efficiency and satisfy userspecific Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. Simulation results demonstrate that EMTAD reduces the number of UAVs required and achieves superior aggregate throughput compared to baseline approaches."

A novel S-shaped hexapole magnet structure was proposed in 2016, which simplifies the distribution of Lorentz interaction forces in ECRIS superconducting magnets and facilitates achieving the required axial field. However, the fabrication of S-shaped hexapole poses significant challenges. Based on this design, we developed a superconducting S-shaped hexapole prototype for a 14.5 GHz microwave frequency using NbTi. A former with slotted ends was designed to enable the S-shaped winding. A small prototype of S-shaped hexapole used only one cable to realize winding, achieving a continuous uninterrupted winding both from the inside to the outside and from the outside to the inside. During 4.2 K cold testing, the coil attained a self‑field of 1.5 T at a current of 480 A. Under an 8 T background field, it carried 232 A with only a single quench, reaching 98.22% of its load line."

    "abstract": "The hybrid electric counter-rotating compressor (CRC) has the potential to improve power-specific fuel consumption in aircraft engines. However, due to its cascaded structure, a reduction or loss of driving power in a single compressor stage can significantly degrade the overall compressor performance. A short-circuit fault is a typical electrical failure in an electric motor that can lead to a complete loss of driving power. One innovative post-fault operation strategy is to utilize the braking capability of the failed motor at low speed to lock its corresponding compressor stage. In this way, the failed stage can function as a stator stage, still providing degraded flow-guiding capability and preventing reverse rotation. This article investigates the short-circuit protection strategy and post-fault operation of dual three-phase permanent magnet synchronous motors (DTP-PMSMs) for hybrid electric CRC applications. Analytical models are developed to characterize the post-fault behavior of the DTP-PMSM. Key design factors are defined, and their influence on post-fault performance is analyzed. Critical post-fault operating points are identified to evaluate and compare different protection strategies. Based on these results, an optimized short-circuit protection strategy is proposed for DTP-PMSMs in CRC applications. Finally, the analytical findings and the proposed strategy are validated through simulation."

The proposed lightweight models enable real-time leaf disease detection with minimal resources. The performance is evaluated on two agricultural datasets: Cotton Leaf Disease (seven classes) and Corn Leaf Disease (four classes). Experimental results show that the modified DenseNet outperforms the original ResNet, DenseNet, and MobileNet models regarding accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, achieving 97% accuracy on the corn dataset and 96% on the cotton dataset. Additionally, it demonstrated improved training efficiency with fewer parameters and layers.

However, BUS images present challenges such as low contrast, speckle noise, irregular morphology, and indistinct boundaries, which hinder automated analysis. Existing multi-task learning frameworks that utilize shared encoders often suffer from inadequate task-specific features and interference between objectives, resulting in suboptimal performance. To address this issue, we present MDFANet, a novel multi-task learning network designed to optimize tumor segmentation and classification in BUS images. The segmentation network incorporates a Feature Enhancement Aggregation (FEA) module, which enriches semantic representations by fusing multi-scale features from both encoder and decoder stages. Moreover, we introduce a distance auxiliary branch to facilitate accurate tumor boundary localization by integrating hierarchical features with spatial contextual cues. To balance the optimization of segmentation and classification objectives, we further employ a sample-adaptive joint loss function that dynamically adjusts task contributions based on the consistency of cross-task predictions. Experimental results on a BUS dataset demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches in both segmentation accuracy and classification reliability."

    "abstract": "Episodic memory is a core component of the human brain, and how information is stored and learned in the neural system is closely related to the representation of memory. Synaptic plasticity, an important mechanism for memory formation, allows the strength of synaptic connections between neurons to vary with the timing of spiking neurons, thus enabling neurons to learn and remember information efficiently. Inspired by the way the brain encodes and processes information, spiking neural networks (SNNs) have been widely used to model memory formation due to their biological plausibility. In this paper, we propose an episodic memory model based on synaptic plasticity and a temporal feedback connection, aiming to simulate the process of memory storage and recall in a biological neural system. In this process, the model incorporates a soft K-Winner-Take-All mechanism within the perceptual memory layer, enabling the selective activation of neurons. Simultaneously, synaptic plasticity is employed to dynamically adjust the synaptic weights connecting the perceptual memory layer and the response memory layer, thereby implementing the storage of information. Subsequently, through generated synapses, the cued information is integrated through the time-step feedback connection, gradually recovering the complete memory content. Experimental results demonstrate that our model successfully achieves the memory storage and recall processes with superior recall performance even when the recall cues are disturbed. In addition, we validate the critical role of the soft K-Winner-Take-All mechanism in enhancing recall performance."

This paper formulates this challenge as a multi-objective optimization problem and provides a comparison between Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) and Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). We implement and evaluate a Genetic Algorithm (GA), NSGA-II, NSGA-III, and an agent trained with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). Using a case study from a real-world risk map, we assess performance on mission duration, connectivity, and the speed of visiting priority and deadline-constrained regions. The results show that while EAs are computationally faster and effective for smaller grids, the PPO agent achieves superior performance, significantly reducing mission time while adjusting their trajectories for prioritized regions. Our analysis demonstrates the trade-offs between these methods and highlights the potential of MARL to develop more adaptive and effective disaster response systems."

Despite significant advances, optimal donor selection remains a multifactorial challenge due to complex interactions between clinical, biological, and immunogenetic variables. This study explores the application of machine learning and deep learning techniques to enhance donor selection and predict donor availability within the context of HLA-haploidentical transplantation. By leveraging structured data from national and international donor registries, key demographic, behavioral, and clinical features, including age, registry duration, health history, donor engagement, and survey responses—are extracted and modeled using algorithms such as support vector machines (SVM), gradient boosted machines (GBM), and deep neural networks (DNN). The analysis evaluates transplant outcomes, response probabilities to confirmatory typing (CT) requests, and post-transplant complications such as graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), integrating additional variables like donor telomere length and cytogenetic markers. SHAP value interpretation aids in understanding feature contributions to model predictions. Comparative analyses between haploidentical and HLA-identical sibling transplants are also presented to assess clinical effectiveness. The study demonstrates that data-driven approaches can significantly improve donor selection strategies, enhance prediction accuracy, and inform real-time clinical decision-making, ultimately aiming to improve patient survival and transplantation success."

    "abstract": "Agriculture plays a vital role in global economic growth, but unsustainable practices are degrading soil health and threatening food security. Soil nutrient depletion adversely affects crop yields, underscoring the need for reliable predictions of crop types and soil fertility. This study addresses uncertainty in agricultural predictions by applying Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA), which combines the outputs of multiple Machine Learning (ML) models to improve prediction accuracy. In agricultural environments, uncertainty arises from complex data and varying soil conditions. Rather than relying on a single model, BMA integrates predictions from multiple models, weighting them by performance for more robust results. BMA accounts for model uncertainty by assigning posterior probabilities, reflecting each model’s reliability. This offers probabilistic predictions that quantify uncertainty and improve decision-making. In this work, environmental parameters like nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall were used, employing advanced models such as Extra Trees Classifier (ETC), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Nu Support Vector Classification (NuSVC) for crop prediction (ETC achieving the highest performance: mean precision, recall, and F1 score of 0.994). For soil fertility prediction, Logistic Regression(LR) outperformed other models (mean precision, recall, and F1 score of 0.99). By incorporating uncertainty, BMA enhances predictions for crop selection and soil management, contributing to Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 2: Zero Hunger."

    "abstract": "The shift from 5G to the new 6G paradigm is defining a watershed moment in the history of wireless communication. The future of 6G networks will be shaped by improvements in system architectures and technology brought about by this transformation. A potential new approach to improving wireless communication performance in ever-changing surroundings is Cognitive Radio Networks (CRNs) aided by Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS). But, because wireless channels are complicated and dynamic, optimizing and allocating spectrum in real-time is still difficult. To offer a new framework that combines the Adaptive Manta-Ray Foraging Optimization (AMRFO) algorithm for dynamic spectrum allocation and optimization with a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) network to tackle this difficulty. The BiLSTM model leverages its ability to capture long-range dependencies in both forward and backward temporal sequences, enabling accurate prediction of spectrum availability and optimal allocation strategies. To further enhance the decision-making process, the AMRFO algorithm is employed for fine-tuning, ensuring an optimal balance between exploration and exploitation while adapting to varying network conditions. The proposed approach dynamically adjusts RIS phase shifts and spectrum allocation to maximize spectral efficiency, minimize interference, and improve overall network performance. Extensive simulations validate the effectiveness of our method, demonstrating superior adaptability, lower computational complexity, and enhanced spectral efficiency compared to traditional optimization techniques. The results highlight the potential of the BiLSTM-AMRFO framework for real-time spectrum management in RIS-assisted CRNs, paving the way for future advancements through hybrid deep learning models and advanced metaheuristic optimization techniques for intelligent wireless communication systems."

PET image reconstruction and noise reduction play a crucial role in enhancing medical image analysis and diagnostic accuracy. This study presents HybridResIncepNet, a deep-learning model that integrates ResNet50V2 and InceptionV3 for PET image classification and noise reduction. The methodology involves pre-processing PET facial expression images, dataset is split into training and testing, with one-hot encoding applied to labels. When training the model, the Adam optimizer is used together with an Early Stopping method to avoid overfitting and categorical cross-entropy loss. Results on standard metrics demonstrate a 97% accuracy rate on testing data and a 100% accuracy rate on training data, which is a substantial improvement over ResNet50 and DenseNet-121. The model achieves near-perfect precision, recall, and F1score, demonstrating its robustness for PET image classification.

    "abstract": "Virtual reality is becoming increasingly popular, and modern haptic equipment, such as vibrotactile suits, haptic gloves, and force-feedback controllers, offers new means of interaction within virtual environments, significantly enhancing user experience. When interacting with virtual objects, combined visual and haptic feedback simulates the physical sensations of grasping, lifting, or moving real objects. This sensorimotor feedback is essential for inducing a sense of presence and agency, yet it remains challenging to reproduce in the absence of reliable haptic cues. In this study, we design and evaluate several haptic metaphors using combinations of vibrotactile design parameters to simulate the lifting effort associated with light to heavy objects. These parameters include primitive signals, intensity, spatial density, propagation, and temporal density. Our contribution is threefold. First, we propose a method for modulating perceived physical effort by extending signal intensity with spatial and temporal density, which together reflect the effort required to lift an object. Second, we present a user study in which participants compared haptic effects and ranked them according to perceived lifting effort, comfort, and confidence, allowing us to assess the influence of each parameter. Third, we report the results of a second study in which participants evaluated vibrotactile effects when lifting different virtual objects. The findings confirm the importance of intensity and spatial density, as well as the influence of graphical representation on perceived effort. This research provides practical insights for designing haptic-enabled virtual reality systems and offers guidance for developers seeking to create more expressive and believable vibrotactile interactions."

First, a database of the local pulse wave propagation along a segment of carotid artery in 4374 virtual adults with different hemodynamic parameters was built. Second, the texture energy features calculated from the time-frequency images of the pulse waves were combined with such parameters as age and heart rate used as the multi-source dataset, and then fed into the following methods for the CLPWV estimation: multilayer perceptron (MLP), Gradient Boost Regression (GBR), Support Vector Regression (SVR), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). To investigate the impact of the noise and frame frequency on the CLPWV estimation accuracy, various data sets were created in the different noise and frame frequency conditions. The results showed that the MLP model performed the best overall and was less affected by noise and frame frequency with an average root mean squared error of 0.201, the SVR model second. These research findings are expected to provide both a theoretical foundation and technical support for the early and precise clinical assessment of the local carotid arterial elasticity in healthy people."

Traditional bone cements, such as pure poly methyl methacrylate (PMMA), are widely used in orthopedic applications; however, they often exhibit limitations including brittleness, low fracture toughness, and poor fatigue resistance, which may compromise long-term implant stability. This study aims to address these limitations of traditional bone cements, such as pure poly methyl methacrylate (PMMA), including brittleness, low fracture toughness, and poor fatigue resistance, which may compromise long-term implant stability. by investigating the mechanical enhancement of PMMA through nanoparticle (NPs) reinforcement using advanced finite element analysis (FEA).

    "abstract": "In modern electronic warfare, developing adaptive jamming strategy generation methods targeting multifunction radars (MFRs) is critical. However, the high flexibility of MFRs, coupled with the complexity of countermeasure environments, results in incomplete and uncertain radar information, thereby significantly increasing the difficulty of learning effective jamming strategies. To tackle this challenge, we formulate the sequential decision-making process in radar countermeasures as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) and propose a jamming strategy generation method based on action-dependent contrastive predictive coding. Specifically, we incorporate a belief representation module into the conventional reinforcement learning (RL) framework. This module, independent of the strategy learning, employs self-supervised contrastive learning to construct the belief representation of radar states, thereby providing more effective information support for the jamming strategy. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms existing RL-based methods in terms of jamming performance."

    "abstract": "Financial institutions and individuals alike are vulnerable to the growing number and sophistication of fraudulent operations in today’s digital financial ecosystem. The most recent research from the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) estimates that global financial crimes in 2023 caused damages of $31 trillion. The integrity and equity of the international monetary system are gravely endangered by these transgressions, which encompass embezzlement, tax evasion, illicit trade, and money laundering. Governments and financial institutions have tried to limit these activities, but criminals still use developing technology like cryptocurrencies and intricate financial networks to avoid discovery. Using the CatBoost algorithm that has been fine-tuned in conjunction with the Cat Swarm Updated Black Widow (CSU-BW) optimisation model, this study suggests a hybrid fraud detection approach to tackle these difficulties. For reliable and scalable fraud detection, the CatBoost algorithm is used as the main classification model because of its proficiency with categorical data. The CSU-BW fine-tuner is a bio-inspired hybrid optimisation method that optimises hyperparameters and improves feature selection to promote classification accuracy. It is introduced to enhance performance. To compare the suggested model to more conventional machine learning algorithms and test it on datasets of actual financial transactions. A number of important performance metrics, score, were outperformed by conventional methods in the experiments conducted by CSU-BW on the CatBoost model. Confusion matrix analysis adds credence to its credibility as a technique for detecting financial fraud by confirming its high true positive rate and low false positive rate. This research introduces a high-performance, scalable fraud detection model that can adjust to new fraud trends by combining bio-inspired optimisation with sophisticated ensemble learning. Increased confidence in digital financial transactions, reduced risk of financial loss, and improved security are all goals of the suggested approach. Additional ways to enhance financial institutions’ fraud protection tactics can be investigated in future studies through the use of adaptive learning mechanisms, blockchain integration, and real-time fraud detection."

This approach initially estimates the target locations by each single array to obtains the spatial lines separately. Subsequently, the suboptimal target locations is obtained based on the geometric relationship between the spatial lines. Finally, through solving the equation constructed by the shortest distance between suboptimal target locations based on the least square method and obtains the optimal target location is obtained.

    "abstract": "With the proliferation of new technology, having access to the internet has become an absolute necessity for a wide range of services. The unauthorised acquisition of personal information, passwords, and identifiers is just one of many security risks that arise with an internet connection. If an attacker wants access to a user's personal information, they will employ a phishing website. In social engineering assaults, the perpetrator creates a website that looks and feels authentic, entices the victim to visit it, and then uses that information to send them to the genuine site. The development of a powerful detector capable of filtering out phishing websites and preventing their online activity is imperative, given the critical nature of this problem. In order to identify the phoney URLs in the publically available dataset, an optimised Convolutional neural network is employed. The Mantis Search Algorithm (MSA) is used to fine-tune the CNN's parameters, which in turn enhances the classification accuracy. The classifier receives the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) as input in order to ensure that the input data is balanced. The suggested detector has been shown to be resilient in a series of experiments, which achieved excellent detection accuracy on the test set. Also, the suggested detector worked wonderfully when tested with random URLs. Incorporating the MSA mechanism into the CNN model enhanced its efficiency and detection accuracy for phishing website detection, according to the reported results."

However, empirical studies have revealed that zero-cost proxies exhibit inherent biases, leading to performance degradation in complex scenarios. To alleviate this limitation, this paper proposes the Multi-Proxy Multi-Population Evolutionary Algorithm (MMEA) that integrates the strengths of multiple complementary proxies to improve search effectiveness. Specifically, each sub-population is associated with a distinct zero-cost proxy that serves as its optimization objective for approximating the performance of candidate architectures. Subsequently, multiple high-performance architectures are evolved within each sub-population under the guidance of their respective proxies. Furthermore, the Low-Fidelity Adaptive Proxy Selection Mechanism (LAPSM) is proposed to identify the most promising architecture by leveraging limited training resources to effectively select the most suitable proxy. Experimental results on the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet16-120 datasets. The result demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art NAS algorithms."

We assume the data is generated by rollouts of stochastic nonlinear dynamics, under a single state or output feedback law and initial condition but distinct noise realizations, to robustly satisfy underlying constraints despite worst-case noise outcomes. We encode the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions of this robust optimal feedback control problem within a feasibility problem to recover constraints consistent with the local optimality of the demonstrations. We prove that our constraint learning method (i) accurately recovers the demonstrator’s policy, and (ii) conservatively estimates the set of policies that ensure constraint satisfaction despite worst-case noise realizations. Moreover, we perform sensitivity analysis, proving that when demonstrations are corrupted by transmission error, the inaccuracy in the learned feedback law scales linearly in the error magnitude. Empirically, our method accurately recovers unknown constraints from simulated noisy, closed-loop demonstrations generated using dynamics, both linear and nonlinear, (e.g., unicycle and quadrotor) and a range of feedback mechanisms."

The proposed approach integrates semantic parsing, visual recognition, and physical constraint validation to enable high-precision consistency analysis of human actions in digital twin applications. At the semantic layer, large language models (DeepSeek) parse natural language instructions and generate structured semantic vectors. The visual layer leverages Qwen2VL for frame-level action recognition and temporal feature modeling, while the physical layer incorporates standardized ergonomic databases and dynamic models to validate physical feasibility. Experiments on two representative tasks—object retrieval from the ground and overhead lifting—demonstrate that the integration of multimodal large models enhances semantic-visual and semantic-physical consistency, achieving overall consistency scores of 0.73 and 0.76, respectively. The results highlight the framework's effectiveness in reducing semantic ambiguity and improving alignment between task descriptions, motion recognition, and physical validation.

    "abstract": "Generating full-body humans in 360° has broad applications in digital entertainment, online education and art design. Existing works primarily rely on coarse conditions such as body pose to guide the generation, lacking detailed control over the synthesized results. Regarding this limitation, sketches offer a promising alternative as an expressive condition that enables more explicit and precise control. However, current sketch-based generation methods focus on faces or common objects, how to transfer sketches into 360° full-body humans remains unexplored. We first propose two straightforward strategies: adapting sketch-based 3D face generation to full-body human or lifting sketch-based 2D human generation to 3D format through a two-stage approach. Unfortunately, both methods result in unsatisfactory degradation of generation quality. To bridge this gap, in this work, we propose Sketch2Avatar, the first generative model to achieve 3D full-body human generation from hand-drawn sketches. Our model is capable of synthesizing sketch-aligned and 360°-consistent full-body human images by leveraging the geometry information extracted from sketches to guide the 3D representation generation and neural rendering. Specifically, we propose sketch-guided 3D representation generation to model the 3D human and maintain the alignment between input sketches and generated humans. Our transformer-based generator incorporates spatial feature guidance and latent modulation derived from sketches to produce high-quality 3D representations. Additionally, our designed body aware neural rendering utilizes 3D human body priors from sketches, simplifying the learning of articulated body poses and complex body shapes. To train and evaluate our model, we construct a large-scale dataset comprising approximately 19K 2D full-body human images and their corresponding sketches in a hand-drawn style. Experimental results demonstrate that our Sketch2Avatar can transfer hand-drawn sketches into photo-realistic 360° full-body human images with precise sketch-human alignment. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of our design choices. Our project is publicly available at: https://richardchen20.github.io/Sketch2Avatar"

    "abstract": "Track foreign object intrusion severely compromises train operational safety. Timely detection of objects on or near the track is crucial for ensuring operational security and preventing accidents. However, existing models suffer from issues such as excessive parameter counts and poor performance in identifying small-sized targets. To address these challenges, this study designs a lightweight railway track foreign object detection model based on YOLOv5. Firstly, Ghost lightweight convolutions replace traditional convolutions in the backbone network to reduce model complexity. Secondly, in the neck network, a bidirectional feature pyramid replaces the original unidirectional feature pyramid to achieve efficient fusion of features at different scales. Finally, the CBAM convolutional attention mechanism is incorporated into the backbone network to improve feature extraction for foreign objects of varying sizes. We applied the designed model to a laboratory-built dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that the model achieves an mAP of 88.5%, representing a 1.5% improvement over the original YOLOv5 model. Compared to the original YOLOv5 model, our model reduces computational complexity, parameter count, and model size by <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$31 \\%, 25.7 {\\%}$</tex>, and 24.8% respectively, validating its effectiveness."

    "abstract": "Breast palpation is a widely accepted preliminary exam for early tumor detection. However, it carries substantial risk of incorrect assessment, due to its operator-dependent nature. Tactile imaging (TI) techniques has recently emerged as a promising alternative, capable of mapping the spatial distribution of force (F) and identifying localized variations in tissue stiffness associated with potential abnormalities. This study presents a novel multi-sensor tactile imaging system based on fiber Bragg grating sensors (FBGs) for breast cancer detection. A 3x3 sensing matrix was designed and integrated within a compact and ergonomic 3D-printed probe, enabling high spatial resolution, high F sensitivity, and simultaneous multi-point measurements. The system was tested on a patient-specific breast phantom derived from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data, under both controlled loading and examiner-driven palpation scenarios. In both testing conditions, tumor-containing areas exhibited higher median F and reduced F variability compared to tumor-free areas. Tactile images extracted from the recorded F signals at varying indentation depths revealed distinguishable F distributions in the tumor areas across both testing scenarios. The results demonstrated the system’s ability to measure F distributions at contact areas, highlighting its potential for tumor identification. These promising findings lay the foundation for further optimizations toward applications in real-world clinical scenarios."

While recent studies have shown large language models (LLMs) can produce consistent human-like moral judgments, their ability to capture human inter-individual variability-especially in highdisagreement scenarios-remains unexplored. To explore this, we propose a variability-based assessment framework that evaluates human-AI moral alignment through inter-individual disagreement. We curated a diverse set of <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{6 0 0}$</tex> moral dilemmas spanning domains such as harm, fairness, and loyalty. Using a unified experimental paradigm, we collected binary moral decisions and confidence ratings from over 100 LLM-based agents and 100 human participants. For each scenario, we quantified interagent disagreement (AI uncertainty) and inter-human response variability (Human uncertainty). Our results reveal a fundamental misalignment that AI uncertainty fails to predict human disagreement levels (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$r=0.01, p=0.73$</tex>). Paradoxically, agents exhibiting greater moral consistency diverge further from human variability patterns. This suggests current alignment strategies overlook key dimensions of moral ambiguity, risking brittle ethical AI systems."

    "abstract": "Remote sensing image change captioning is an innovative human-computer interaction for understanding appeared changes in bi-temporal remote sensing images (RSIs), which provides a natural language description for changes or non-changes. Current methods typically adopt a bi-temporal feature extraction, change localization and followed by a change captioning model. Most approaches aim to improve the accuracy of change recognition and description with complex network modules, lacking prior judgments on whether there are salient changes between image pairs. This deficiency can lead to inaccurate or erroneous descriptions. To alleviate this problem, a novel salient difference awareness network is designed to describe the differences between RSI pairs. Generally, the change area accounts for a relatively small proportion in a RSI, the salient changeaware module filters the redundant information in RSI scene, which benefits change localization by attaining better change perception. In addition, we propose multilayer aggregated module to sufficiently utilize the salient change features from different change awareness layers, further capturing relevant change details. Then, the Transformer decoder guarantees semantic descriptions by change-to-sentence translation. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed method on the LEVIR-CC dataset with four metrics, showcasing its superior performance compared to several state-of-the-art techniques."

    "abstract": "The embedding layer in deep learning recommendation models (DLRM) is highly memory-bound and exhibits skewed, irregular access patterns. These characteristics lead to severe load imbalance and performance bottlenecks in processing in memory (PIM) architectures. We propose TRAM (Two-level Reduction Accelerator for Memory), a heterogeneous accelerator that integrates High Bandwidth Memory based PIM architecture (HBM-PIM) with conventional dual in-line memory modules (DIMMs) to accelerate batched embedding vector reductions. TRAM reduces redundant hot-vector accesses and employs a host-side scheduling mechanism that overlaps bank-PIM operations inside DRAM banks with logic-PIM operations, where processing units are located in the buffer die. This overlap eliminates command-bandwidth stalls and compute-bound delays. In addition, metadata-aware optimizations reduce row/column access overhead by reusing contiguous address patterns within each bank. Evaluation on six recommendation datasets and three embedding dimensions demonstrates that TRAM achieves up to 2.8× speedup and 3.0× energy reduction compared to state-of-the-art heterogeneous memory systems, while preserving full compatibility with the standard DRAM interface."

    "abstract": "The interactions between the autonomic and the motor systems in the case of stress have been complicated to analyze, and their coordination under fear is not adequately explored. The study will combine the three-dimensional Force Plates and impedance cardiography (ICG) to categorize the response to stress in a controlled Virtual Reality (VR) setting. Fear-inducing virtual reality roller coaster was experienced by 10 healthy adults while standing on a PASCO force plate. ICG signals were used to extract cardiac parameters, such as Pre-Ejection Period (PEP), stroke volume and cardiac output. At the same time, the swaying postural and balance were monitored by the force plates. The findings revealed strong shortening of PEP during VR scare events, which means experience of a high sympathetic activity even without significant changes in sway. Measurements taken by a force plate indicated freeze reactions with an increase in stiffness and decreased sway accompanied by continued cardiac excitation. The cardiac and biomechanical features trained on impedance cardiac and force plate data yielded more than 90% accuracy in classifying the stress states, compared to the single modalities. These results emphasize the importance of multimodal physiological recording for differentiating between states of stress and show how fear is generated both in physiological dynamics and motor behaviour and how it reflects the other body systems. This combined tracking has a potential application in mental well-being tests, virtual-reality treatments and tracking the stress rate in physically challenging conditions."

To achieve efficient detection and accurate segmentation of ore impurities, this paper proposes a segmentation method based on improved YOLOv8. Regarding the problems of the original YOLOv8, such as insufficient small target recognition accuracy and low feature utilization, this paper makes improvements from three aspects: First, introduce the RRG attention mechanism with multi-scale fusion to enhance the model's ability to express features of different scales. Second, add a high-resolution segmentation head on the basis of the original segmentation head to improve the detection and segmentation capabilities for small target impurities. Third, replace the bounding box regression loss from CIOU to GIOU to obtain a more stable bounding box fitting effect. Experimental results show that compared with the original YOLOv8 segmentation model, this method has achieved significant improvements in mAP and small target recall rate on the self-built ore impurity dataset, providing an efficient and robust solution for ore impurity recognition."

The proposed approach uses machine learning algorithms to identify blackhole attacks in Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANETs). During the attack, we observe that the performance of the network becomes worse than usual. In this paper, machine learning models are used to detect blackhole attacks based on network traffic. The proposed approach uses the network traffic history for all nodes to train machine learning algorithms.

Current systems often prioritize technical accuracy over contextual understanding, struggling to preserve regional dialects or resolve semantic ambiguities. This paper introduces SAHDA, a hybrid framework that bridges computational methods with human linguistic expertise. By combining rule-based error detection, neural semantic analysis, and collaborative human-AI refinement, SAHDA addresses both structural errors and meaning-based ambiguities in written Arabic. Key innovations include context-aware dialect preservation to maintain regional linguistic diversity and adaptive learning techniques that enable efficient customization for specialized domains. Evaluations demonstrate SAHDA’s ability to resolve ambiguous terms and dialectal variations more effectively than existing approaches while minimizing overcorrection of valid regional expressions. As an open-source tool, the framework advances inclusive language technology by harmonizing standardization with dialectal richness— a critical advancement for supporting Arabic’s diverse written traditions in the digital age."

    "abstract": "The classical passive coherent location (PCL) processing makes use of at least two antennas and is based on a calculation of cross-ambiguity function (CAF) between reference (REF) and surveillance (SURV) signals. In the modern approach, which is dedicated to communication signals with orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) and known as an OFDM radar, the REF signal can be reconstructed from the SURV one. Then, the channel frequency response (CFR) is estimated, and information about moving targets is extracted from it. Such an approach enables building a simple, single physical channel passive radar, which requires relatively low computational power compared to the classical, two-channel CAF approach. This paper shows what signal processing operations should be added to a standard digital audio broadcasting (DAB) receiver to obtain the PCL functionality. Several field tests confirm the correctness of the described enhancement. Two low-cost software-defined radio (SDR) devices were used in the hardware setup, i.e., RSPduo and RTL-SDR, to detect airplanes of different sizes flying at various altitudes, in outdoor and indoor receive scenarios. The investigated DAB-based PCL radar's operating range has been also estimated based on a reference from ADS-B data. The opportunity of a single-channel PCL radar design, operating with minimum hardware and just one omnidirectional antenna, opens up the possibility of deploying a network of small and inexpensive PCL sensors."

    "abstract": "In recent years, extensive research efforts have been dedicated to the application of deep learning in EEG classification, yielding a plethora of proposed methods. Nonetheless, the majority of these methods have failed to comprehensively consider the information of EEG signals across the three essential dimensions, namely spatial, frequency band, and temporal domains, in a simultaneous manner. To this end, this paper proposes a Mamba-Enhanced Spatial-Channel Recombination Temporal Network (SCM-NET), using a four-dimensional EEG signal that has undergone DE cross-entropy as input. Firstly, the spatial-channel recombination module is exploited to recombine the spatial and frequency band features in accordance with the pre-configured activation threshold. This procedure effectively augments the spatial interactive feature information across different frequency bands. Subsequently, a lightweight convolutional neural network is harnessed to accentuate the most valuable information within the feature set. Finally, the Mamba network is applied to extract high-level temporal information features. We evaluated its performance using DEAP, MEEG, SEED, and SEED-VIG datasets and achieved recognized accuracy rates of 71.48%, 97.47%, 88.31%, and 99.89%, respectively, which outperformed the current state-of-the-art technology compared to existing methods.

However, in real-world open environments, existing technologies still face numerous challenges, such as ineffective identification capabilities for unknown categories. To address this issue, we propose a novel method that utilizes supervised contrastive learning to compress the feature space of known categories, coupled with an energy score-based open-set recognition approach to achieve high-accuracy identification of unknown categories. Specifically, we leverage supervised contrastive learning to obtain a feature space distribution with strong intra-class cohesion and inter-class separation. This compression method for known-class feature spaces expands the open space belonging to unknown classes, thereby enhancing the distinguishability between known and unknown classes. Additionally, the energy score-based open-set recognition method models the entire feature space distribution globally, amplifying confidence differences between known and unknown classes through nonlinear mapping, further enhancing the generalization capability and reliability of the openset recognition model. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in relevant domains, effectively solving the radar model open-set recognition problem and providing new solutions for the development of electromagnetic target model identification technology."

We review four advances, organ-level growth models that allocate resources among leaves, stems, and fruit (e.g., GreenLab), whole-tree models linking physiology and form (e.g., L-PEACH), plant microbe models for nitrogen fixation (e.g., AMIGO), and AI workflows from high-throughput phenotyping to protein-structure prediction (e.g., AlphaFold). For each topic, we outline the core equations in plain terms, state key assumptions and identifiability limits, and give practical validation steps using open datasets, standard metrics, and simple ablations. We also clearly separate the survey from a forward-looking idea mimicking plant metabolism, which we present as future work, not a finished result. We end with concrete next steps: calibrating across scales, quantifying uncertainty, testing models across species and sites, and sharing reproducible pipelines that connect simulations with AI. Our aim is a tighter, clearer guide for both method builders and applied researchers. To bridge plant science and computer science, we suggest modeling plant metabolism mathematically. Such models mirror biochemical pathways, deepen biological insight, and open new avenues for algorithm design in computational biology. We argue that the convergence of computational biology and AI will advance plant science and, more broadly, benefit medicine, ecology, and environmental science.

    "abstract": "Diffusion models have made tremendous progress in generating visually realistic images. However, these images are statistically different from the real images, which could be accurately classified by carefully designed detectors. To evade detection, researchers have proposed various adversarial example generation schemes for AI-generated images. Despite the progress, most of these schemes have the tendency to post-process the images and the distortion is inevitable. In this paper, we propose an Adversarial Diffusion Model (ADM), which is able to directly generate high quality and undetectable images from scratch on top of a pre-trained stable diffusion model. In the ADM, an adversarial denoising U-Net is proposed for searching an adversarial latent. This latent is helpful for generating a prompt consistent adversarial example which is able to deceive the detector. Then, we propose a latent compensation module to make the adversarial examples have a similar reconstruction error to that of the real images. We further propose an adversarial decoder to minimize the difference between the high-frequency components of the real and adversarial examples. Comprehensive experiments are carried out to demonstrate the advantages of our ADM in generating adversarial AI-generated images."

    "abstract": "Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have established them as promising candidates for natural language planning tasks. However, existing approaches often fail to address two critical challenges: 1) the effective alignment of LLM-generated plans with human preferences, and 2) the dynamic enforcement of diverse constraints inherent in planning scenarios. To bridge these gaps, we propose a constraint-aware human-preference alignment framework for natural language planning. Our contributions are threefold. First, we design a process reward model that aligns LLM outputs with human preferences through step-by-step feedback, facilitating efficient and interpretable preference learning. Second, we develop a constraint-aware mechanism integrated into the rewriting strategy, which dynamically penalizes violations of task-specific constraints at each reasoning step. Third, we introduce a unified adaptive metric enabling a multifaceted assessment of planning quality. We validate our framework through experiments on planning benchmarks, demonstrating improvements in success rate with constraints and human preference alignment over baselines."

    "abstract": "Accurate positioning in wireless ad hoc networks (WANETs) critically depends on precise time synchronization among distributed nodes. However, pulse detection is prone to false alarms and missed detections under complex environments characterized by low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and multipath fading. This challenge significantly impedes parameter estimation for time-hopping direct sequence spread spectrum (TH-DSSS) signals. To address the limitations of existing algorithms in terms of robustness and convergence efficiency, we proposed a Maximum Likelihood-based Robust Interval-Matching Strategy (ML-RIMS) for precise estimation of the initial frame index (IFI) in TH-DSSS signals. Specifically, the approach constructs TH interval sequences, employs a bidirectional combinatorial matching strategy for error tolerance, and integrates a trendconsistent likelihood scoring model to improve resilience against structural mismatches. Furthermore, mechanisms for burstfailure termination and signal correlation verification are incorporated to boost both accuracy and computational efficiency in path selection. Numerical results demonstrate that ML-RIMS significantly outperforms existing algorithms in overall estimation performance across varying SNR and false alarm conditions."

However, power consumption has always been one of the significant challenges in present power-aware applications. Here, a low-power AMBA APB protocol design with an efficient clock gating approach has been proposed. Clock gating is a very common power-saving technique that eliminates dynamic power by not supplying the clock signal to idle modules. Clock gating at more than one level is included in the proposed design, which makes it power-frugal during inactive periods without decreasing performance or reliability. The design disables the clock signal for idle modules selectively, actually minimizing redundant switching activity while master-slave communication remains uninterrupted. Simulation results show that power dissipation is decreased from 0.682 mW to 0.567 mW."

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative fine tuning of pre-trained language models (PLMs) across user devices by aggregating locally trained model parameters rather than raw data, exhibiting great potential in privacy-sensitive natural language processing (NLP) applications. However, the inherent tendency of model parameters to memorize training data puts existing efforts at risk of disclosing raw data. Knowledge distillation (KD) offers a privacy-preserving alternative for knowledge transfer between the cloud server and user devices by exchanging lightweight model predictions associated with a public proxy dataset. Nevertheless, a desirable proxy dataset may not always be available in practice as its construction requires careful deliberation and even prior knowledge about the private domain to ensure satisfactory performance, which conflicts with the privacy-preserving principles of FL. To tackle this challenge, this paper proposes FedSTG, a privacy-preserving FL framework empowered by synthetic text generation of large language models (LLMs), which combines the exceptional generation capability of a pre-trained LLM deployed on the cloud server with the domain specific understanding capabilities of local PLMs distributed across user devices to generate high-quality synthetic text for knowledge transfer, facilitating the integration of KD and FL without the need for publicly available proxy data. Extensive experiments across a wide range of benchmark tasks demonstrate that FedSTG achieves superior performance without requiring any prior knowledge about the private domain, delivering a privacy-preserving FL solution for NLP."

Existing ECI models predominantly rely on supervised methodologies, suffering from dependence on large-scale annotated data. Although large language models (LLMs) enable zero-shot ECI, they are prone to causal hallucination—erroneously establishing spurious causal links. To address these challenges, we propose MEFA, a novel zero-shot ECI model based on multisource evidence fuzzy aggregation. First, we decompose causality reasoning into three main tasks (temporality determination, necessity analysis, and sufficiency verification) complemented by three auxiliary tasks. Second, leveraging meticulously designed prompts, we guide LLMs to generate uncertain responses and deterministic outputs. Finally, we quantify LLM's responses of subtasks and employ fuzzy aggregation to integrate these evidence for causality scoring and causality determination. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate that MEFA outperforms second-best unsupervised baselines by 6.2% in <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$F1$</tex-math></inline-formula>-score and 9.3% in precision, while significantly reducing hallucination-induced errors.

CPS uses real-time data from distributed sensors, drones, and edge devices to monitor and manage important agricultural elements.

In several key application areas, such as precision irrigation to minimize water waste, yield prediction for effective resource allocation, pest and disease detection to minimize the need for pesticides, smart crop rotation to preserve soil fertility, and adjusting to climates for proactive planning. CPS and FL work together to produce sustainable outcomes. We present FedAgri, a federated, sensor-aware learning algorithm designed for resource-constrained and diverse agricultural environments that can achieve these objectives. FedAgri uses client selection, adaptive learning, and model compression techniques to improve scalability and reduce communication overhead. By addressing the issues of data management and environmental sustainability, the proposed framework promotes efficient, adaptable, and intelligent agricultural practices."

    "abstract": "Metabolic Syndrome (MetS), which affects approximately one-quarter of the global population, significantly increases the risk of numerous chronic conditions, including type II diabetes mellitus. As a result, early detection and timely intervention are essential in managing this syndrome. MetS is conventionally diagnosed through blood tests performed in clinical settings. However, the condition is often underestimated, resulting in significant unmet healthcare needs among affected individuals. In this study, we aimed to diagnose MetS using non-invasive physiological data and unstructured narrative descriptions of personal physical activities, both of which can be easily collected. We collected data from 40 volunteers in a nursing home and developed a deep learning framework that integrates natural language processing (NLP) with physiological data using a feature fusion approach for MetS classification. The optimal model achieved strong results, with an AUROC of 0.806 and a recall of 76.3%. Feature importance analysis indicated that textual descriptions and daily minimum heart rate were the most influential factors in classifying MetS. These findings demonstrate the potential of leveraging easily accessible daily life data for the early detection of MetS, which may help lower the costs associated with screening and management for at-risk populations."

The focus is to improve the quality of these cry recordings by decreasing the background electronic noise while preserving the necessary cry signal information. Further, various traditional noise reduction techniques like Spectral Subtraction, STFT, Wavelet Transform, Triangular Filter, and Band Reject Filter are compared on SNR basis for background noise removal.

    "abstract": "Using neuromorphic computing for robotics applications has gained much attention in recent year due to the remarkable ability of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) for highprecision yet low memory and compute complexity inference when implemented in neuromorphic hardware. This ability makes SNNs well-suited for autonomous robot applications (such as in drones and rovers) where battery resources and payload are typically limited. Within this context, this paper studies the use of SNNs for performing direct robot navigation and obstacle avoidance from LIDAR data. A custom robot platform equipped with a LIDAR is set up for collecting a labeled dataset of LIDAR sensing data together with the human-operated robot control commands used for obstacle avoidance. Crucially, this paper provides what is, to the best of our knowledge, a first focused study about the importance of neuron membrane leakage on the SNN precision when processing LIDAR data for obstacle avoidance. It is shown that by carefully tuning the membrane potential leakage constant of the spiking Leaky Integrate-andFire (LIF) neurons used within our SNN, it is possible to achieve on-par robot control precision compared to the use of a non-spiking Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Finally, the LIDAR dataset collected during this work is released as opensource with the hope of benefiting future research."

Facilitated by an analytical surrogate directivity model of realistic embedded elements in an arbitrary planar array, such scalable aperiodic layouts are inversely-designed for several element counts and representative cosine element patterns. It is seen that the proposed topology can operate over a wider bandwidth and field of view (FOV) than counterpart periodic arrays, yet with similar maximum gains across more than an octave of operation. Moreover, use of the surrogate directivity model in the inverse-design of these arrays bears out, for the first time, the importance of considering an array’s embedded element pattern during the design process, not just after. It is shown that this process, which represents a significant break from the traditional optimization approaches, can yield array designs with superior performance."

This study synthesizes prior research on innovation measurement and 67 interviews with innovation experts across six cities to derive a concise and pragmatic set of measures. The measures are pragmatic and dashboard ready because the measures recommended by the experts could be matched to organisation for economic co-operation and development (OECD) and other readily available data sources.

    "abstract": "Reducing the number of antenna elements within a fixed aperture while maintaining low sidelobe levels is a key challenge in sparse array design. Although various sidelobe suppression techniques exist, most are tailored for large-scale arrays and are not directly applicable to small-scale sparse arrays. This paper addresses a critical gap in array design for small sparse arrays with low sidelobes using mechanical rotation and time-averaging techniques. By continuously rotating the array and time-averaging radiation patterns, the mainlobe remains coherent and stable, while the rapidly varying sidelobes are effectively averaged out and suppressed. An analytical model is developed to determine the required integration time, optimize element placement, mitigate Doppler effects, and enhance time-selective radiation pattern strategies. Experimental validation using a four-element circularly polarized array with 0.74λ spacing demonstrates a PSLL reduction of 11.5 dB compared to a conventional non-rotated array, and can be further reduced by 4.7 dB through time-selected pattern optimization. The proposed method has many potential applications, such as passive remote sensing using rotating UAV swarm arrays, making it a flexible and low-cost solution for precision agriculture and environmental monitoring applications."

Using an end-to-end Dual Decoder Network (DDN), medical consumers are grouped into clusters by data similarity, with cluster-specific models optimized locally and aggregated through intra-cluster volume-weighted and inter-cluster contribution-based strategies. Experiments on the Chest X-ray14 and CheXpert datasets show that the proposed CFFL improves diagnostic accuracy by 6.2% on average compared to baselines and achieves performance close to centralized learning while ensuring privacy. These results underscore the framework potential for secure, efficient, and scalable distributed consumer medical image analysis."

The existing research mainly focuses on active interference recognition, but there may be passive interference such as corner reflector in actual scenes, so this study focuses on the perception of active and passive interference scenarios. Based on the existing recognition methods, this paper proposes an interference recognition method based on entropy features under the combined control of linear frequency modulation and phase-coded waveform (LFM-PE). In this method, the interference signals under the two types of waveforms are obtained by simultaneously transmitting two types of waveforms with different frequency points, the interference signals under the two types of waveforms are extracted, and the support vector machine classifier under the particle swarm optimization (PSO-SVM) model is used for classification. Among them, the recognition accuracy of the five types of interference under the combined control of linear frequency modulation and phasecoded waveform is significantly improved compared with that without this method, and the recognition accuracy of the entropy features under the LFM-PE control method is higher than that of the original under the jamming-to-noise ratio from -10dB to 20dB."

    "abstract": "As the applications of brain-inspired computing become increasingly complex, the efficient hardware implementation of spiking neural networks faces two critical challenges: the lack of specialized hardware architectures for simulating spiking neuron behaviors and the absence of dedicated toolchains for mapping SNN algorithms to neuromorphic hardware. To address these limitations, we propose a reconfigurable FPGA-based computing platform featuring specialized computational cores optimized for spiking neuron behavior simulation, incorporating multiple hierarchical storage units, a <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{1 6}$</tex>-parallel spiking processing array, and a dedicated instruction set. Additionally, we develop a comprehensive deployment toolchain that enables the combination of the PyTorch model with our dedicated instruction set, facilitating efficient end-to-end deployment of brain-inspired algorithms on neuromorphic hardware. Spiking-YOLO network has been implemented on this platform and achieves a peak processing speed of 20 FPS, achieving an optimal balance between computational efficiency and resource utilization."

These platforms were initially targeted for underwater volcanic locations but offer a broader application potential for ocean research. Three main technologies were developed and tested: underwater monitoring probes for real-time water quality assessments in geothermal springs, deep-sea probes for vertical ocean profiling and autonomous drift-phase monitoring, and a surface buoy for rapid-response environmental monitoring. Field deployments in diverse locations, including the Ponta da Ferraria (S. Miguel, Azores), Banco D. Joao de Castro (Atlantic Ocean), and the Cumbre Vieja volcanic eruption site (La Palma, Canarias), demonstrated the operational feasibility of these systems. Despite challenges in deep-sea operation and deployment conditions, the results highlight the potential of these platforms for scientific studies, environmental monitoring, and emergency response. Their adaptability and modularity make them valuable tools for a wide range of oceanographic applications beyond their initial focus. Ongoing efforts to improve marine communication reliability, sensor integration, and resilience to extreme ocean conditions hold the potential to further expand the role of these technologies in marine exploration."

    "abstract": "Industrial failures pose a serious threat to the safety of life and property. Therefore, it is necessary to identify the fault's initial point promptly and perform accurate fault diagnosis. However, industrial signals are often cluttered and subject to various disturbances, which makes it difficult to identify the fault' s initial point promptly. In addition, fault signals are frequently accompanied by environmental noise and exhibit disorder, which adversely affects diagnostic accuracy. To address these pressing challenges, this paper introduces an intelligent industrial fault diagnosis framework, referred to as MDAG-CNN, which integrates three key components: the dynamic MS-Dynp algorithm, the adaptive window greedy Gaussian segmentation (AW-GGS), and a multi-CNN classification architecture. Specifically, the proposed dynamic MS-Dynp algorithm, developed on the basis of Dynp and enhanced with multivariate statistical parameters, is designed to detect the fault initiation point with high accuracy and robustness. Subsequently, the AW-GGS algorithm is applied to effectively normalize and standardize the collected signals, thereby alleviating the adverse effects of noise and amplitude variations. Finally, a multi-CNN structure is employed to perform precise and high-resolution fault classification. Experiments conducted on the widely used XJTU-SY bearing dataset demonstrate that MDAG-CNN achieves a remarkable diagnostic accuracy of 96.250%, which convincingly validates both the effectiveness and the practical applicability of the proposed framework."

Varying working conditions and the occurrence of label noise make it difficult to learn patterns from complex data distribution. In this work, loss function named sigmoid symmetric cross entropy in modern temporal convolutional network (SGSCE-MTCN) is proposed to solve the rotating machinery fault diagnosis with noisy labels under multiple working conditions. Vibration data is first preprocessed to time-frequency sequence. Then, MTCN leverages depthwise separable convolution to extract cross-variable and cross-feature information after capturing long-term time series features. An adaptive loss is designed to improve model’s robustness to label noise, the probability of the predicted output processed by sigmoid function is taken as the dynamic parameter for adjusting the loss weight. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on two datasets with multiple working conditions, the proposed MTCN model outperforms other methods and reaches an accuracy over 95%, experiments with label noise indicate that SGSCE enables the model to perform fault classification under varying levels of noise."

Thirty-two participants performed the time up and go test, and their movements were measured using both markerless and marker-based motion capture. We proposed formulas for feasible stability regions and conducted age-related statistical analyses. The results showed that our image-based 3D position method is consistent with state-of-the-art marker-based techniques. Age-related differences were significant. The elderly group exhibited significantly smaller changes in knee extension, hip extension, and ankle plantarflexion moments than the younger group ($\\mathbf{p}\\lt0.05$) during chair rising. The normalized CoM velocity in the elderly group was significantly smaller than in the younger group ($1.492 \\pm 0.166$ vs $1.415 \\pm 0.117$). The normalized CoM acceleration in the elderly group was significantly larger than in the younger group ($-0.388 \\pm 0.086$ vs $-0.433 \\pm 0.108$) while walking 3 m.

Compressive sensing (CS) methods are widely utilized to reconstruct ISAR images from sparse echo. Combined with deep learning, unfolding nets based on different CS methods are proposed to obtain higher reconstruction accuracy in the SA case. However, these nets are not applicable for the sparse echo under low SNR, the denoising threshold is difficult to set appropriately for the balance between noise removal and structure preservation. To achieve the issue above, we proposed a random fields-based alternating direction method of multipliers net (RF-ADMM-Net). We design a segmentation method for the intermediate ISAR image based on random fields (RF) model, which can operate efficiently with better migration, robustness and stability to noisy ISAR images. Further, the segmentation is taken to assist for the denoising layers in distinguishing the target region from the background area. The denoising layers set different thresholds for target and noise regions to retain more information of target while thoroughly denoising. Experimental results based on both simulated and measured data, indicate the applicability and robustness of the RF-Net to noisy ISAR images suffer from SA and low SNR, and show high reconstruction accuracy for ISAR images under SA and low SNR of the RF-ADMM-Net."

    "abstract": "Increasing global demand in poultry meat and poultry meat products prompted the broiler industry to use genetic selection and improved feeding practices to achieve significant gains in broiler size and growth rate. However, fast-growing and heavier weight broilers induced myopathies such as woody breast (WB), which affect the meat quality and cause significant economic losses. A radiofrequency method based on measurement of the dielectric properties at microwave frequencies was developed for rapid and nondestructive detection of woody breast disorder found in chicken breast meat. Dielectric measurements were performed with an open-ended coaxial probe connected to PNL-N5235B vector network analyzer for normal and defective (WB) fresh chicken breast meat for frequencies ranging from 200 MHz to 20 GHz and a meat temperature of about 7 °C. Spectra obtained for the normal and severe WB chicken breast show similar trends with frequency, with values of dielectric properties slightly higher for the WB chicken breast meat. At a given frequency (500 MHz), there exists correlations between the dielectric properties and composition of chicken breast meat (water content and protein content) that can be used to discern between normal and fillets with severe WB. Results show potential for rapid and systematic detection of the woody breast condition from measurement of the dielectric properties at a single microwave frequency."

The feature representation capability is enhanced by introducing the multi-head attention module, and the watermark embedding and extraction are realized by using an end-to-end network architecture. The introduction of the multihead attention mechanism significantly enhances the watermark feature representation capability and maintains the structural integrity of the image through feature space manipulation. Experimental results show that the model improves the accuracy of watermark extraction while ensuring the image quality."

The resulting algorithm, termed by VB-MTT-MM, works with a newly designed likelihood function that allows each measurement to be associated with arbitrary number of measurements. Besides, data association events are parameterized into the likelihood function so that they can be explicitly computed. Leveraging the variational Bayesian method, the multi-target posterior can be efficiently computed with satisfactory accuracy. The performance of proposed algorithm is verified via simulations."

    "source": "IEEE",
    "abstract": "Due to purity deficiency of frequency source, radar may not completely remove strong clutters in traditional moving target detection (MTD) or pulse Doppler (PD) modes. To address this problem, we propose an adaptive clutter cancelation method which leverages the insensitivity of data-dependent adaptive filtering to system model errors. The proposed method essentially employs adaptive Doppler filters instead of the traditional window-weighted discrete Fourier transform (DFT) in suppressing clutters. Due to the large number of pulses in MTD/PD modes, it is difficult to collecting sufficient independent identically distributed (i.i.d.) samples for covariance matrix estimation and computational burdened to inverse the covariance matrix. To address this challenge, this paper implements dimension reduction by conducting adaptive processing in Doppler space, i.e. collecting the target channel and a limited number of strong clutter channels to perform adaptive processing. This approach significantly reduces the demand for i.i.d. samples and also lowers computational complexity. Numeric results illustrates that the proposed method can effectively suppress the strong clutter which otherwise leakages using traditional Doppler filters under spectral purity deficiency."

    "abstract": "Sick Building Syndrome (SBS) refers to symptoms that building occupants can experience due to poor indoor environmental quality, such as respiratory problems, headaches, and fatigue. These symptoms are often associated with factors such as inadequate ventilation, insufficient humidity and temperature control, and contaminants in the air. The complexity of SBS requires advanced decision-making approaches, especially in scenarios involving multiple criteria evaluation. This article proposes applying the fuzzy COPRAS (Complex Proportional Assessment) method as a robust tool for deepening knowledge about SBS in built environments to mitigate its effects. The fuzzy methodology makes it possible to deal effectively with uncertainties and subjectivity, characterizing the weights of design resources and sub-resources in linguistic terms generated from triangular fuzzy numbers. Five alternatives and six factors related to indoor air quality, promoting occupant well-being, humidity and temperature control, advanced ventilation systems, and the implementation of indoor green spaces were evaluated. The COPRAS fuzzy model made it possible to rank these alternatives according to their relative effectiveness in mitigating SBS. The results indicate that internal green spaces and chemical and materials management policy are priorities, highlighting the importance of careful planning in choosing the most appropriate solutions to improve the health and well-being of building occupants."

    "abstract": "Video inpainting aims to reconstruct missing or corrupted regions in video frames, with applications in video editing, restoration, and special effects. Current deep video inpainting methods rely on optical flow to guide the propagation of effective features and spatiotemporal attention mechanisms to model relationships between frames. However, as an explicit motion representation, the optical flow extracted offline in preceding steps often suffers from instability and errors during estimation. These errors accumulate during subsequent content hallucination, resulting in artifacts and blurring. Meanwhile, although traditional spatiotemporal attention effectively captures frame relationships, its dense computational nature introduces redundant information, disrupting inpainting tasks and reducing efficiency. To address these issues, we propose an implicit motion-guided approach for efficient video inpainting. Instead of relying on optical flow, our method uses implicit motion in the latent feature space to guide the dual-domain propagation of images and features end-to-end, avoiding error accumulation from the independent optical flow estimation process. Additionally, we introduce a self-correcting module that enables feedback between image and feature propagation, reducing errors during propagation. Furthermore, we design an adaptive sparse video attention mechanism to focus on highly relevant regions, minimizing the impact of irrelevant information. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches both qualitatively and quantitatively, while also delivering superior efficiency."

A 6×6 array prototype was fabricated and experimentally evaluated. The measured total efficiency remains above 50% in the 2.51–2.595 GHz band and above 35% in the 5.68–5.8 GHz band, with peak values reaching 53% and 42.2%, respectively. Moreover, the proposed RMS maintains stable performance under varying polarization conditions. As the main advantages, the second-order response is firstly designed for broader bandwidth and improved frequency selectivity. As a result, the proposed RMS shows strong potential for application in energy harvesting systems, where it can significantly improve the frequency robustness of the rectification efficiency."

    "abstract": "Traditional intelligent fault diagnosis methods for rotating machines are constructed on vibration signals. Such sole reliance on a single signal limits comprehensive extraction and analysis of process information, leading to unsatisfactory accuracy. For example, signal attenuation trends of rotating machines are easily neglected. To enhance fault diagnosis accuracy, we propose a Siamese-based multi-source information fusion method. In this framework, we employ multiple feature extractors for diverse-source feature extraction, including vibration, acoustic, temperature, and current signals. Each feature extractor integrates a Siamese network with slow feature analysis (SFA) for signal attenuation trend extraction. Specifically, the principle of SFA is embedded into training loss of supervised Siamese networks, which employs adjacent samples as pairs to guide the network in learning representations that change minimally. Multiple features are then fused for rotating machine fault diagnosis. Effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by a bearing fault case from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology. According to results, compared to conventional single-source approaches, the proposed method significantly enhances the fault diagnosis accuracy and demonstrates superior robustness under high-speed operating conditions."

Traditional centralized optimization algorithms suffer from high computational complexity, poor adaptability to nonconvex mixed-integer constraints, and limited robustness in nonstationary environments. In this paper, we propose a novel multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework based on Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) modeling and a Modified Multi-Task Multi-Agent Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (Mod-MTMATD3) algorithm. Through a hierarchical state space design, joint action space optimization, and a composite reward mechanism, this framework achieves joint optimization of power allocation, task scheduling, and topology coordination in multi-satellite collaborative communication scenarios. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves over 40% improvement in convergence speed and a 63.6% increase in final reward value compared to traditional methods. Under extreme conditions where the inter-satellite distance is extended to 400 kilometers, it maintains a broadcast success rate of 96.2%, representing an 11.2% enhancement over benchmark algorithms. Additionally, the algorithm reduces energy consumption by 30%, significantly improving system energy efficiency.

A hybrid meta-heuristic algorithm is introduced, combining the strengths of Simulated Annealing (SA) and the Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA). Key performance indicators such as node density, energy distribution, ambient temperature, remaining battery power, and a defined cost function are employed to identify the most efficient CHs. Experimental results show that the proposed hybrid method outperforms existing algorithms, including WOA, Adaptive Gravitational Search Algorithm (AGSA), Genetic Algorithm (GA), and Artificial Bee Colony (ABC)."

    "abstract": "Early detection of colorectal polyps is crucial for clinical screening and cancer prevention, where accurate and efficient automatic segmentation plays a pivotal role. However, colonoscopy images often suffer from low contrast, blurred boundaries, and scale variations, making segmentation challenging. Existing encoder-decoder networks (e.g., U-Net) suffer from asymmetric supervision and feature redundancy, which in turn lead to semantic inconsistency and loss of fine details. While deeper or hybrid designs alleviate these issues, their high complexity and computational burden limit feasibility in real-time clinical practice. To address these challenges, we propose a lightweight segmentation framework, Hierarchical Contextual Attention Network (HCA-Net), consisting of the Redundancy-Suppressed Dual-Path Downsampling (RS-DPD) module and the Boundary-Aware Semantic Alignment Upsampling (BA-SAU) module, applied to the encoder and decoder, respectively. RS-DPD suppresses redundancy while preserving fine-grained details through a dual-path design, whereas BA-SAU leverages cross-layer contextual attention to enforce semantic consistency and enhance boundary sensitivity. Both modules are built upon our proposed Hierarchical Contextual Attention (HCA) mechanism, which combines convolutional projection with pooling-based compression to achieve efficient global modeling and accurate local boundary restoration. In addition, a composite boundary-aware loss function is designed to improve pixel-level accuracy, structural consistency, and robustness in low-contrast and boundary-ambiguous regions. Extensive experiments on public colorectal polyp datasets demonstrate that HCA-Net achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) segmentation accuracy with significantly improved efficiency, while maintaining robustness under low-contrast and blurred-boundary conditions."

    "abstract": "Security is the predominant challenge from past few years and still gaining attention in cryptographic devices. Cryptographic algorithm stand alone cannot fulfill this need because of the presence of side channel attacks. Due to the emission of power, electromagnetic field, time, sound and various kind of other glitches it seeks the attacker attention. To obfuscate the side channel attack various countermeasure has been proposed in literature and evaluated on various crypto graphic algorithms i.e. AES, Present, SIMON, SM4 etc. As no countermeasure fully obfuscate the attack but to increase the time and resources of attacker makes the counter measure efficient. The primarily focus of this paper is power analysis attack and at some places touches the electromagnetic attack as electromagnetic attack is ensued because of the power emission. This survey classifies the recent counter measures as hardware and software counter measure then highlight the scheme, also insight the overhead argument of each scheme. Additionally, we consider these approaches based on efficacy, power overhead, and area constraints, offering an equalized perspective on their practical deployment. Finally, the paper defines key research challenges and future directions, aiming to guide upcoming researchers in advancing the field of cryptographic security against side-channel threats."

Importantly, we design a normalized gradient learning rule for updating the mixing parameter, which narrows the range of the learning rate significantly as compared to the non-normalized gradient-based learning rule. Furthermore, to make the transition between convergence and steady-state stages smoother, a novel weight vector transfer strategy is developed. By using the realistic speech input, simulation results have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in contrast with its counterparts."

Participants were followed up to natural sleep onset in sleep-deprived conditions to allow an opportunity to enter a sleep state under controlled conditions. Rapid eye movement was monitored by EOG signals, which constitute a main indicator of REM sleep that is often accompanied by dreaming. EMG was applied to measure atonia in muscles during sleep to observe the state of the autonomic nervous system, and ECGs were analyzed to calculate heart rate variability (HRV), which provided information about the state of the autonomic nervous system in dreams.

Given the rising concern over audio deepfakes, particularly in biometric authentication systems, developing robust ASV methods is increasingly critical. The research evaluates Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs), linear predictive cepstral coefficients (LPCCs), and Gammatone cepstral coefficients (GTCCs) against wav2vec2-based SSL features, utilizing a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. Experiments were conducted on a newly developed Urdu deepfake audio dataset that includes both authentic and spoofed samples generated using Tacotron and VITS text-to-speech models. Results reveal that while LPCCs and GTCCs perform competitively among handcrafted features, wav2vec2 embeddings significantly surpass all traditional methods, achieving an equal error rate as low as 0.01 when employing the radial basis function kernel. These findings emphasize the advantages of SSL-based representations in capturing speakerspecific traits and effectively resisting spoofing attacks in Urdu."

    "abstract": "Super-enhancers (SEs), comprising clusters of transcriptional regulatory elements, play essential roles in gene expression regulation and cell fate determination. Current computational methods for identifying SEs from genomic sequences face challenges in prediction accuracy and cross-species generalizability. This study introduces TransSE, a deep learning framework combining convolutional and recurrent neural networks with cross-species transfer learning for SE prediction. TransSE employs a two-phase strategy: pre-training on combined human and mouse data to learn conserved regulatory features, followed by species-specific fine-tuning to capture organism-specific patterns. Evaluation on human and mouse datasets demonstrates that TransSE achieves superior accuracy compared to existing methods including SENet, DeepSE, and transformer-based models (DNABERT, Enformer), with AUC values of 0.828 (human) and 0.832 (mouse). Ablation studies confirm that convolutional blocks are essential for feature extraction, while transfer learning and recurrent layers provide meaningful performance improvements. Feature analysis reveals that TransSE distinguishes SEs from typical enhancers based on learned sequence representations, achieving 10.4-fold improvement in clustering metrics. The model demonstrates effective cross-species prediction capability, maintaining AUC <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\gt $</tex-math></inline-formula> 0.79 when trained on one species and evaluated on another. Conservation pattern analysis shows that TransSE integrates both evolutionarily conserved and species-specific regulatory features, enabling robust performance across organisms with limited training data.

Given the fluid and multifaceted nature of the IoT environment, it is not possible to perform comprehensive testing of all scenarios. This prompts the need for selecting test cases that provide the needed validation for resource expenditure. It looks into major software testing purposes, functionality, and reliability, as well as robustness on all levels of testing - unit, integration, system, and acceptance testing. Particular emphasis is put on white-box methods, for instance, control flow and dataflow testing IoT software components, which are most capable of detecting faults. Further, the paper analyzes research gaps in combinatorial testing, IoT security, and software automation, underlining their shortcomings. The gaps correspond with the existing knowledge that automated and combinatorial testing while improving coverage and efficiency, are difficult to adapt in IoT ecosystems with high interconnectivity. It could be deduced that further studies should concentrate on adaptive testing frameworks for smart IoT homes to scale with the proposed intelligent techniques for security and reliability."

    "abstract": "To address the clinical demand for precise detection of hemorrhagic stroke, this study proposes an ultra-wideband (UWB) microwave localization method based on confocal imaging. A preconstructed 3D brain model incorporating electromagnetic properties of seven tissue types was employed, with a 5 mm -radius hemorrhagic lesion embedded. The finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method was utilized to simulate electromagnetic wave propagation within the model. A 13-antenna array and a 0.73-3.27 GHz Gaussian pulse served as the excitation source to acquire multi-channel scattered signals. A dual-matrix differential processing scheme was designed to effectively suppress system noise and extract lesion-specific scattering features. Combined with a wave velocity model based on the average dielectric constant of brain tissue and signal interpolation techniques, a time-domain confocal imaging algorithm was applied to achieve 3D spatial energy back-projection reconstruction. Experimental results demonstrate that the reconstructed lesion coordinates (93, 93, 27) successfully localized the preset hemorrhagic site (90, 90, 30), with localization errors confined to the millimeter scale (maximum localization error: $\\mathbf{3 ~ m m}$). This study validates the feasibility of microwave imaging for detecting intracranial microbleeds and provides a theoretical foundation for developing portable diagnostic devices for stroke."

    "abstract": "Underwater optical wireless communication (UOWC) is an emerging technology vital to provide highbandwidth connectivity underwater. However, inhomogeneity of the inherent optical properties of the stratified seawater column and interference from sunlight in the euphotic zone can negatively affect optical communication links. In such environment, longer-wavelength (yellow) spectra are preferable for close-range, low-power communication links, whereas short-spectrum transmissions (blue) can support high-powered, long-distance links. Here, we assess the possibility of using modified, dual-color differential signaling (DS) with complementary detection and spread spectrum to mitigate solar interference in diffused line-of-sight links. We discuss the utility of a dual-color direct-sequence spread-spectrum scheme (DSSS), and show that among purely monochromatic on-off keying (OOK) types, 465 nm performed the worst under sunlight ($\\mathbf{B E R} \\approx \\mathbf{3. 1} \\times \\mathbf{1 0}^{-3}$ for a 1 W output, 10 m link at 25 m depth in clear, S1 ocean water), but the best below the subsurface chlorophyll maximum (BER $\\lt2.8 \\times 10^{-7}$ for 465 nm, at below 120 m). The 2-level DS-OOK (2LDS-OOK) schemes outperformed the monochromatic OOK, particularly under strong sunlight ($B E R\\lt4.5 \\times 10^{-7}$ at 25 m). Their performance can be further enhanced through iterative, multiplicative signal combination ($\\operatorname{BER}\\lt1.3 \\times 10^{-7}$ at 25 m). We conclude that adopting multi-wavelength strategies may enhance UOWC in dynamic, time-varying environments."

    "abstract": "Sophisticated risk management systems are essential for lowering credit risk in financial operations, particularly in the current unpredictable economic environment. Credit risk, or the possibility that a borrower won't fulfill their responsibilities, poses a serious threat to the stability of the financial system. Traditional methods for assessing and managing credit risk, such as credit scoring and historical data analysis, are insufficient given the complexity of today's financial markets. Modern risk management tools can assist identify, assess, and reduce credit risk more effectively. A significant advancement in this field is the integration of machine learning algorithms with big data. By sorting through mounds of data from multiple sources, financial institutions can gain additional insight into economic indicators, market trends, and borrower behavior. Machine learning algorithms enable more precise default probability forecasts, opening the door for risk-reduction strategies. Additionally, real-time risk monitoring solutions have become more and more common. These tools enable banks to monitor loan portfolios continuously, spot warning signs that can point to a default, and take prompt action. A novel approach to redefining the concept of a \"default\" in the context of the often-present severe class disparities is proposed in this paper, which deals with the assessment of credit risk in solidarity economy firms. The objective of creating and assessing credit scoring models is to enhance risk management by identifying default risk using both internal and external data. Machine learning models and statistics are evaluated using a one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The first design use hyper-parameter learning in conjunction with an optimization method known as the hybrid bat algorithm to learn crucial features for classification. To prevent overfitting and maintain a consistent predictive capacity of the model, the second architecture uses an attention mechanism on top of the deep network and evaluates it using the Balanced Accuracy metric and the holding power of the performance. A balanced sample within a class size is essential for improving prediction performance."

    "abstract": "Mental health diseases like depression, anxiety, and schizophrenia affect worldwide healthcare systems. Traditional diagnostic methods are subjective, thus data-driven methods are needed. EEG, a non-invasive brain activity measurement method, reveals neural patterns related with mental health disorders. EEG data processing is now automated thanks to deep learning, boosting mental disease classification and detection. This study introduces a hybrid deep learning framework that leverages both Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)—specialized in detecting spatial patterns—and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)—suited for modeling temporal dynamics. This paper provides a Hybrid CNN-RNN Deep Learning Framework that uses CNNs for spatial feature extraction and RNNs for temporal relationships in EEG signals. The proposed approach uses Explainable AI (XAI) for clinical interpretability and an attention strategy to improve feature learning. After testing on benchmark EEG datasets, the suggested method outperformed CNN and RNN models with 88.9% accuracy. Despite promising results, dataset variability, class imbalance, and real-time processing persist. Future research should focus on multimodal data fusion, privacy-preserving federated learning, and real-time wearable EEG-based mental health monitoring. This study shows how deep learning might improve mental health diagnostics and enable clinically viable AI-powered treatments."

Traditional fetal health assessment methods such as cardiotocography (CTG), ultrasound imaging, and clinical evaluation, though effective, often suffer from interpretability issues, episodic monitoring, and dependency on expert judgment. This study proposes an advanced machine learning-based framework to classify fetal health status into normal and abnormal categories using CTG data, aiming to enhance diagnostic accuracy and clinical reliability. A comparative analysis was conducted using ensemble-based models—XGBoost and LightGBM—as well as support vector machines (SVM). Among these, XGBoost achieved the highest performance with 94.2% accuracy, 0.93 precision, and 0.94 recall. LightGBM followed closely, offering comparable results with faster computation. Furthermore, the study integrates explainable AI techniques to improve model transparency and facilitate trust among healthcare practitioners. The results demonstrate the potential of interpretable machine learning models to support obstetric decision-making, especially in settings lacking specialized medical expertise. This approach not only enhances fetal health classification but also lays the foundation for intelligent, data-driven prenatal care systems."

A \"microgrid\" is a distribution level grid that is linked to a range of small-scale power generating devices, such as micro-turbine generator, solar panels, wind turbines, and fuel cells, as well as new accumulation devices, such as flywheels and ultra capacitors and battery bank. The weather affects the capacity to produce electricity from renewable energy-based power plants, such as wind and solar photovoltaic systems. Variations in load dynamics, wind speed, and sun intensity all cause a considerable decline in microgrid performance, especially frequency. The frequency oscillation degrades the microgrid performances and it requires an immediate action for obtaining steady and constant frequency. To acquire a stable system frequency performance under various conditions, this work has employed a unique Type-II Fuzzy power system stabilizer (T2-FPSS) controller. This research forum also made a performance related comparison analysis of the projected PSS-FFO controller over Fuzzy-PID and standard PID controllers. This work also planned a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II) to tune the relative gains of the implemented controllers."

These different technologies infrastructure implemented in different areas and has different coverage area makes the situation complicated. The most challenging situation in this scenario is to provide seamless communication and enable the user to connect the best available networks among the multiple available networks. To confront this situation, network ranking is intended on the basis of user's provided service quality. For that, multi attribute decision making (MCDM) algorithms namely AHP (Analytical Hierarchy Process) and TOPSIS was applied. AHP evaluates weight of each criteria in networks and TOPSIS ranks each network according to different network characteristics. But here we will use these algorithm combined to avoid the ranking abnormalities when executing TOPSIS. Because TOPSIS determine entropy as an objective weight for networks attributes which eliminate the arbitration and subjectivity problem while executing AHP algorithm. The algorithms use relative relationship of business types and network performance attributes to determine the subjective weights calculated by AHP and objective weights by TOPSIS algorithm and then combined these weights to form an integrate weights. Choosing this AHP-TOPSIS algorithm to perform optimum network ranking in HetNets can rank the networks correctly and select the best suitable network for the required business requirement."

This translates to collaborative robots typically integrating overt shutdown procedures activated if and when danger is detected for workers, tying with production and other equipment damage issues. Moreover, human focus is both intrinsically tied with safety judgement and manifestable in variable bio-signalling, of which some can be captured via brain-computer interface technologies. This short paper advocates for the evaluation of worker bio-signalling to avert danger, by instead adapting robot operation. It presents the monitoring of human attention as a by-product of single channel electroencephalography waves, to modulate robot functioning to complete its task, track its human colleague while they do their part, or halt. Implications and limitations are pondered for usage in real-life industrial scenarios."

    "abstract": "Conventional Parallel Decision Feedback Decoder (PDFD) for $\\mathbf{1 0 0 0}$ BASE-T transceivers, using Register Exchange Architecture (REA) in the Survivor Memory Unit (SMU), inherently suffers from high dynamic power consumption since the requirement to store and shift symbols for all possible paths at every decoding step, leading to massive register bit-flipping activity. To address this critical inefficiency, this paper leverages path pruning with the $\\mathbf{T}$-algorithm to reduce the power consumption in SMU. The core innovation lies in integrating the T-algorithm to discard paths dynamically and deliver the enable signal to the ACSU (Add Compare Select Unit) and SMU. In SMU, these enable signals are used to gate the clock of SMU registers, effectively preventing the storage and unnecessary switching activity associated with pruned paths. These signals are also used in ACSU to eliminate redundant addition operations for discarded paths. Crucially, this power reduction is achieved without effecting BER performance. Synthesized with a 28 nm CMOS standard cell library, the results demonstrate that the proposed decoder achieves a significant 21% reduction in power consumption compared to a conventional PDFD."

    "abstract": "Industrial Control Systems (ICS) are essential to critical infrastructure, from manufacturing and transportation to power generation. Among their communication protocols, Modbus/TCP remains widely deployed due to its simplicity and interoperability, but its lack of built-in security makes it vulnerable to spoofing, packet injection, and replay attacks. To address these vulnerabilities, deep learning models have emerged as powerful tools for intrusion detection. Yet, their “black-box” nature raises challenges of trust and interpretability in high-stakes industrial environments. This paper presents a comparative study of two deep learning approaches for Modbus/TCP traffic classification: a baseline Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and an Attention-enhanced CNN. Using a dataset of 6,690 labeled Modbus traffic samples, both models were trained and evaluated for accuracy, robustness, and interpretability. The baseline CNN achieved perfect classification accuracy but displayed overconfidence and reliance on a narrow set of packet bytes. In contrast, the Attention-CNN slightly reduced accuracy but provided more calibrated outputs and richer interpretability. Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) were applied to both models, showing that the CNN focused on a few dominant features, while the Attention-CNN distributed importance more broadly across packet fields. The findings underscore the trade-off between predictive performance and explainability. While the baseline CNN demonstrates flawless accuracy on the dataset, the Attention-CNN offers insights more aligned with expert reasoning, making it better suited for real-world deployment where transparency and trust are as critical as detection accuracy."

    "abstract": "Indoor scene synthesis is essential for creative industries, recent advances in scene synthesis using diffusion and autoregressive models have shown promising results. However, existing models struggle to simultaneously achieve real-time performance, high visual fidelity, and flexible scene editability. To tackle these challenges, we propose MaskScene, a novel hierarchical conditional masked model for real-time 3D indoor scene synthesis and editing. Specifically, MaskScene introduces a hierarchical scene representation that explicitly encodes scene relationships, semantics, and tokenization. Based on this representation, we design a hierarchical conditional masked modeling architecture that enables parallel and iterative decoding, conditioned on both semantics and relationships. By masking local objects and leveraging the hierarchical structure of the scene, the model learns to infer and synthesize missing regions from partial observations, enabling rapid construction of 3D indoor environments that more accurately reflect real-world scenes. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, MaskScene achieves 80× faster generation speed and improves scene quality by 10%, while also supporting zero-shot editing, such as scene completion and rearrangement, without extra fine-tuning. Our project and dataset will be public."

    "abstract": "In this paper, a harmonic current controller based on the multiple synchronous reference frame (MSRF) is proposed to achieve stable harmonic current control in an interior permanent magnet synchronous motor (IPMSMs) at dynamic response. The structure of the controller consists of complex vector PI controllers that control the current of each frequency component connected in parallel. To ensure a stable dynamic response, controller is designed to achieve pole-zero cancellation between the plant and the resonant controller. In this process, the controller structure and gains are determined by considering the saliency and flux saturation of the plant. To consider saliency, the controller gains are applied before performing the rotational transformation into each harmonic reference frame. Additionally, considering flux saturation, the controller gains are designed with dynamic inductance and apparent inductance. The proposed controller can be applied with the same structure even to motors without saliency like SPMSMs. Experiments were conducted on a 17 kW IPMSM including 6th harmonic components, and the improvement in controller performance was verified through dynamic current response analysis."

Traditional modeling methods are difficult to effectively capture the structural characteristics of such high-dimensional data. In order to improve the soft measurement prediction accuracy of key quality variables, this paper proposes an end-to-end modeling framework that integrates component long short-term memory network (cLSTM) and residual graph convolutional neural network (ResGCN). This method constructs the input graph structure for the graph neural network using the sparse adjacency matrix obtained from the cLSTM. The hidden states output by the cLSTM are employed as node features fed into the graph convolutional module, enabling spatiotemporal joint modeling. To enhance the deep representation capability of the graph neural network, this paper introduces residual connections to mitigate over-smoothing issues. A composite loss function combining mean squared error and structural sparsity regularization terms is designed to guide the model toward learning more distinctive graph structures. Experiments on Tennessee Eastman process data demonstrate that this method exhibits outstanding performance in prediction accuracy, structural modeling capability, and robustness, showcasing strong application potential in modeling complex industrial processes."

The system supports smoke, heat, and flame sensing through distributed transmitter nodes, each incorporating a built-in self-test button for routine functional verification and maintenance. A dual power strategy combines standard main home power supply with a rechargeable lithiumion backup battery, using a dedicated charging module for safe replenishment when mains power is available and a P-channel MOSFET to ensure seamless automatic switchover to battery power during outages, thus maintaining uninterrupted operation. To avoid communication collisions in multi-node environments, the design employs unique addressing and timesliced transmission, improving reliability in dense sensor deployments. Experimental validation confirmed fast detection-to-alert response, with alarm triggering well within NFPA 72 recommendations and a high wireless packet success rate despite typical home interference. Wireless architecture also enables a substantial reduction in new copper wiring, decreasing installation effort, cost, and embodied carbon compared to fully wired fire alarm systems. This sustainability aspect aligns with multiple United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by reducing material use and supporting resilient, adaptable infrastructure. The proposed system offers a scalable, costeffective, and environmentally conscious fire safety solution suitable for residential, commercial, and light industrial buildings, while providing a foundation for future features such as wireless fire alarm control panels (FACP), remote notifications, and enhanced security."

While extensive research has been conducted in this field, the challenge of coordinating multiple robots to flow collectively from one side of the map to the other—such as in crossing missions through obstacle-rich spaces—has received limited attention. This paper focuses on this directional traversal scenario by introducing a real-time scheduling scheme that enables multi-robot systems to move from edge to edge, emulating the smooth and efficient flow of water. Inspired by network flow optimization, our scheme decomposes the environment into a flow-based network structure, enabling the efficient allocation of robots to paths based on real-time congestion levels. The proposed scheduling planner operates on top of existing collision avoidance algorithms, aiming to minimize overall traversal time by balancing detours and waiting times. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in achieving fast and coordinated traversal. Furthermore, real-world flight tests with ten drones validate its practical feasibility. This work contributes a flow-inspired, real-time scheduling planner tailored for directional multi-robot traversal in complex, obstacle-rich environments.

The TF-IDF feature-set baseline classifiers ensemble voting, Random Forest, and XGBoost classifiers derive competitive performance. Word2Vec DL models significantly improve capturing the syntactic structure of URLs. Other transformer-based architectures prevail over other approaches to the problem due to contextual token encoding and DL self-attention mechanisms. The advanced model showcases an incredible 97.06% accuracy on the test set, indicating effective performance on obfuscated and adversarially modified URL samples. A detailed assessment of the model's scalability, overfitting, and performance optimizes the computational cost.

It aims to control the voltage, current, and surface temperature of a typical PV panel through the in-body integration of a graphene-paraffin composite (in 5 wt. % and 10 wt. %) as a passive cooling solution. Overheating of the surface of PV panels is one of the significant challenges which impact the efficiency and durability of PV panels. In view of this, the high thermal conductivity of graphene is utilized in this work to obtain better heat removal in combination with the latent heat storage performance of paraffin. An IoT system with temperature, voltage, and current sensors linked to a cloud-based dashboard provides real-time data acquisition and monitoring. It is found that the adding effect of graphene-paraffin composite can remarkably enhance the power of PV panels, especially as the (10wt. %) the highest concentration providing the best temperature control and electrical output stability. The surface temperature was decreased by (G10P) upto 4% as compared to without material, and similar increments were observed in the voltage and current. The novelty of this integration consists in the combination of novel nanomaterials and IoT -assisted smart energy management of solar panels in real time, which represents an important leap toward intelligent renewable energy solutions.

    "abstract": "Business Process Mining has become crucial in optimizing operational efficiency by analysing event logs to discover process bottlenecks and predict future behaviours. However, traditional techniques mainly focus on internal process attributes, often overlooking external factors that significantly impact performance. This research addresses the gap by investigating the influence of IT infrastructure performance metrics, specifically within the telecommunications industry, on business process execution. Leveraging event logs combined with infrastructure anomaly data, we employ One-Class Classification methods (OneClassSVM and Isolation Forest) to identify process deviations related to infrastructure issues such as hardware failures and network congestion. Our methodology aligns time-series event logs with concurrent infrastructure anomalies, revealing how these external events affect order-processing workflows. The OneClassSVM yields a recall of 0.81 and an F1 score of 0.70 for class 1, and a recall of 0.93 and an F1 score of 0.95 for non-class 1. The Isolation Forest attains a recall of 0.80 and an F1 score of 0.73 for class 1, while it achieves a recall of 0.94 and an F1 score of 0.96 for non-class 1. Results demonstrate the efficacy of integrating exogenous IT features, improving predictive accuracy, anomaly detection, and facilitating more robust process monitoring. Both methods in our model attain elevated recall and F1 scores in predicting both classes. While acknowledging limitations such as empirical labelling of data and class imbalance issues, this study highlights the importance of external contextual data in refining process mining techniques and contributes practical insights for predictive maintenance, root-cause analysis, and customer experience optimization within telecommunications. Future research will focus on enhancing data labelling accuracy and incorporating additional order-level features for more precise analysis."

    "abstract": "Event cameras are widely used in high-speed, lowexposure scenarios due to their high dynamic range and high temporal resolution. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), with their event-driven and energy-efficient characteristics, are particularly suitable for training on event data. However, compared with frame-based image datasets, the labeled event data is insufficient for training SNN models with comparable performance. Existing research typically addresses this issue by optimizing the architecture and training process of SNN models, rarely considering the physical properties of event data. Specifically, compared to detailed texture information, frame-based images and event data share higher structural similarity. Therefore, we propose a Structural Decoupling-Based Spiking Transfer Learning Method (SDSTL), which leverages frame-based structural knowledge to assist in training SNNs on event data. We achieved a notable improvement in classification accuracy on two neural datasets compared to the baseline."

The main goal is to reduce operational expenses, which is critical during the continuously increasing cost of electricity. At Fermilab, several HTS accelerator magnets were built and successfully tested. The paper described a variant of the double-aperture dipole magnet that could be suitable for future Lepton Colliders. A single short-circuited HTS coil of 3.8 kA generates a homogeneous magnetic field of 57 mT in both magnet gaps of 84 mm. The short model magnet was designed, built, and successfully tested at liquid nitrogen temperature. This magnet works in a persistent current mode, which provides additional cost savings when used in particle storage rings operated at a stable magnetic field. The results of design, fabrication, and tests are presented and discussed. The magnet demonstrated a high magnetic field stability in both apertures, efficiency of correction coils, and primary powering circuit."

    "abstract": "The emerging advances in mobile technology, along with the anticipated global increase in the blind and low-vision population, emphasize the importance of introducing this community to such technology as an effective and low-cost communication tool. Aiming to enable blind and deaf-blind individuals to use mobile devices, many tactile-based methods and systems have been presented in literature over the last decade. Although these methods are well-regarded, their limitations include the need for object localization on mobile devices’ embedded touchscreens and the requirement to apply multiple gesture types, often involving several fingers from both hands. Addressing these limitations, this work presents a framework offering a new tactile-based communication method for blind individuals on mobile devices, with a touchscreen cover as a core component. The invented cover splits the touchscreen into eight equally-sized cells — six for data entry and two for control input — and provides an effective solution to localization and navigation challenges faced by blind individuals on touchscreens. In particular, the proposed framework enables Braille-based character entry. An Android app has also been developed to identify entered characters and save them for further processing. The proposed framework was tested at a foundation providing care for blind and low-vision individuals. Two-phases experiments, preliminary and final, were designed and conducted with ten participants. Experimental analysis based on measuring data entry time and input error indicates that the proposed framework performs well. Furthermore, two participant surveys were conducted prior and post the experiments to justify the calculated performance measures, asses cognitive load, and verify the usability and learnability of the proposed framework."

DC-GHZ keying partitions the swarm into entanglement clusters, generates fresh symmetric keys each epoch, and monitors quantum bit error rate (QBER) as an intrinsic spoofing and eavesdrop detection signal. CTQW is applied over a waypoint graph whose potential encodes a multi-objective cost field combining distance, threat intensity, and congestion, while altitude is selected via separation-risk minimization and UAV motion is updated under bounded velocity, acceleration, and climb-rate limits. Our simulation shows that the quantum layer achieves mean QBER values of 0.1152 and 0.1089 across two GHZ clusters and raises intrusion alarms in seven of eight epochs, whereas the routing layer maintains stable average costs in the range 0.2771-0.3740 and the consensus process drives variance to near 10<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">–3</sup> after initial transients.

Fast k-Nearest Neighbor’s (k-NN) with SARSA (State-Action-Reward-State-Action) is the machine learning methodology that breaks the model training for the prediction of flares into seven biological features. The first task to be undertaken is concerned with rescaling practitioners' needs in order. Example: all features can be on the same lexical scale. After the Rescaling, the features undergo a ranking as a process of determining the most useful ones for prediction tasks. Then, the features of the fast-kNN training model are used to perform fast training of kNN to allow easy data classification. Lastly, the three steps of SARSA learning, that is, one that shows that data expectation changes and the ordinary expectation of the data can be used to change the prediction model. SARSA learning is used in this situation for the stimulation of SARSA prediction to make the data interactions better for the prediction model explanation. The results suggest that a better combination of Fast-kNN and SARSA can improve the predictions of the target. It may address the need for a better early warning for a flare-up, allowing for better management of the autoimmune disease and treatment."

To address this challenge, we propose a Feature Enhancement Aggregation Network (FEANet) that effectively models local dependencies using a Local Feature Enhancement Block (LFEB) and further enhances and fuses global and local features with the help of a Spatial Channel Aggregation Block (SCAB) to achieve advanced super-resolution performance. Specifically, we design a Local Feature Enhancement Block (LFEB) and a Spatial Channel Fusion Block (SCFB). We use the LFEB module to help enhance the image features extracted by Mamba, enhancing the ability to capture local features while maintaining computational efficiency. SCFB, as a substitute for a Feed-Forward Network (FFN), effectively refines deep features through partial convolutions and channel interactions, and SCFB also achieves the fusion of global and local features. Experiments show that our method achieves excellent performance while maintaining model complexity."

Drawing upon official surveillance data from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), we examine the temporal and directional relationships between public search behavior and influenza epidemic indicators across multiple time scales and platforms. Using correlation analysis, lagged cross-correlation, and Granger causality modeling, we identify both synchronous co-movements and predictive lead-lag structures between BSI and surveillance-based indicators. Influenza A, Swine, and Avian Influenza consistently emerge as early signals of rising public concern, with Swine and Avian strains often showing directional influence on broader influenza-related search trends. In contrast, Influenza B remains peripheral, with weaker and less interconnected public attention. Our findings highlight a post-pandemic amplification of influenza awareness during the 2023–2024 season, marked by historically high search volumes and the re-establishment of predictive lag structures, particularly at Lag = 2–3 weeks. Regional disparities are evident: southern provinces exhibited more resilient BSI-CDC coherence during the pandemic, while northern regions showed delayed recovery. These results underscore the utility of search engine data for real-time infodemiological surveillance and early warning. From a policy perspective, integrating BSI into national influenza monitoring frameworks can enhance the timeliness and responsiveness of public health interventions. This study provides actionable insights for designing adaptive, multi-scale digital surveillance systems in the post-pandemic era."

    "abstract": "Super-enhancers (SEs), comprising clusters of transcriptional regulatory elements, play essential roles in gene expression regulation and cell fate determination. Current computational methods for identifying SEs from genomic sequences face challenges in prediction accuracy and cross-species generalizability. This study introduces TransSE, a deep learning framework combining convolutional and recurrent neural networks with cross-species transfer learning for SE prediction. TransSE employs a two-phase strategy: pre-training on combined human and mouse data to learn conserved regulatory features, followed by species-specific fine-tuning to capture organism-specific patterns. Evaluation on human and mouse datasets demonstrates that TransSE achieves superior accuracy compared to existing methods including SENet, DeepSE, and transformer-based models (DNABERT, Enformer), with AUC values of 0.828 (human) and 0.832 (mouse). Ablation studies confirm that convolutional blocks are essential for feature extraction, while transfer learning and recurrent layers provide meaningful performance improvements. Feature analysis reveals that TransSE distinguishes SEs from typical enhancers based on learned sequence representations, achieving 10.4-fold improvement in clustering metrics. The model demonstrates effective cross-species prediction capability, maintaining AUC <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\gt $</tex-math></inline-formula> 0.79 when trained on one species and evaluated on another.

It is common to fabricate such proteinaceous microstructures by adhering them to glass. However, when we perform so-called free-form fabrication, without any substrate adhesion, we observe size changes during the fabrication process. This study quantified the in-precursor size changes to increase predictability. We also evaluated a potential mechanism for these changes by examining the role of protein hydration shells. These findings are expected to contribute to the fabrication of desired designs and promote the use of this technology."

There is a paradigm shift in network from earlier generations to 5G. The Fifth generation of mobile networks is inclined towards providing communication for-high node density, high data rate, high security (in terms of channel spoofing) and high mobility for achieving uninterrupted and seamless communication. For achieving 5G features like-network with high speed, least delays and dense nodes over MANETs, they are tested by simulating in a computer tool i.e. ns-3 under various conditions of 5G mobile environment and analysed for the performance. After several testing, by varying 5G environment conditions like node speed and node density. Performance parameters has been traced out and analysed for two different routing protocols in MANETs that are AODV and DSDV. The simulation results have shown that AODV achieves a low packet loss ratio, particularly in larger networks, due to its on-demand routing mechanism. However, it experiences higher end-to-end delays, which increase significantly as the number of nodes grows. In contrast, DSDV demonstrates more stable delays and higher throughput, owing to its proactive routing strategy. However, this comes with the downside of higher packet losses and power consumption due to periodic updates. These findings highlight the trade-offs between reactive and proactive routing protocols, with AODV being more suitable for delay-tolerant applications, while DSDV is better suited for scenarios that require consistent throughput and lower delays. This study contributes to the optimization of MANET routing architectures by providing a detailed performance evaluation based on simulation results. Hence, Conclusion has been made stating that AODV is a preferred communication protocol which is suitable for 5G environment and provides 5G features. [1]"

By analyzing the spectral properties of OFDM signals derived from the transmitter system model and elucidating the mechanism of inter-symbol spectral leakage, we introduce an innovative approach for symbol length estimation. This method leverages existing signal detection algorithms to estimate the number of symbols by extracting spectral leakage features from the time-frequency energy distribution of the received signal, subsequently using the ratio of these features as the estimated symbol length. The proposed technique does not rely on the CP, thereby partially overcoming the challenges associated with blind estimation of symbol length in short CP and no-protection interval OFDM systems. Simulation results demonstrate that, at an in-band SNR of 15 dB and when the ratio of CP length to effective symbol length is less than or equal to $3 / 32$, the new method outperforms traditional estimation techniques in accuracy. Furthermore, with an increasing number of received symbols, the Normalized Root Mean Square Error of the symbol length estimate achieved by this approach can reach levels as low as $10^{-4}$ or below."

    "abstract": "Chaos-Based communication systems have emerged as one of the promising solutions for secure and robust wireless communications because of their inherent randomness and resistance to interception. Even those, however, are still susceptible under jamming attack mechanisms that may seriously degrade the quality of a signal and render reliable data transmission impossible. Traditional anti-jamming methods, such as Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS) and Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum (FHSS), although resistant to interference, face some serious problems, including high computational overhead, reduced spectral efficiency, and the threat of being vulnerable to intelligence jammers. This paper proposes an Adaptive Chaos-Based Jamming Mitigation System (ACJMS) based on Recurrent Neural Network-Assisted Chaotic Signal Processing (RNN-CSP) that allows dynamic detection and mitigation of jamming attacks. The adaptive learning mechanism in the proposed system optimizes chaos-based signal reconstruction, making the system resilient against different jamming strategies. In the comparison of results with conventional methods, ACJMS improves key performance parameters a Signal-To-Interference Ratio (SIR) improvement of 0.28%, Bit Error Rate (BER) reduction improvement of 0.35%, and spectral efficiency improvement of 0.22%. This new approach guarantees a much more secure and efficient chaotic communication framework, suitable for next-generation wireless networks."

Traditional methods to maintain privacy, including anonymization, have been found to be inadequate against more advanced AI- powered attacks. As deep learning models become more sophisticated, the risks associated with this phenomenon become ever more complex, making the need for adequate privacy-preserving mechanisms all the more pressing. We explore the nature of the challenges posed by the PII exploitation threat in the domain of ML systems, highlighting existing frameworks, showcasing their shortcomings, describing a series of threats, and finally examining alternative approaches to mitigate those threats through the use of federated learning, encryption, differential privacy (DP), and other methods. It further stresses user-focused approaches, such as data minimization and informed consent, to enhance privacy protections.

    "abstract": "Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) has garnered considerable attention across disciplines such as science, digital forensics, and literature. Advanced large language modeling systems (LLMs), including ChatGPT and Large Language Model Meta AI (LLaMA), have become essential tools in digital forensics due to their sophisticated Natural Language Processing (NLP) capabilities. These systems enable efficient processing of extensive text datasets, sentiment analysis, and real-time threat detection. This research explores the effectiveness of AI-driven methods in digital forensics by conducting comprehensive tests on various applications, such as artifact comprehension, evidence search, and incident response. The results confirm the transformative role of ChatGPT in enhancing the speed and accuracy of investigation, as the study showed that the system can analyze data and images related to crimes and provide comprehensive reports. Not only does he process evidence, but it can also extract complete conversations related to crime, determining when it occurred and whether it was planned. The system meticulously analyzes the data sent to it to provide additional details such as possible motives and behavior of suspects. It provides investigators with an in-depth understanding that can be used at various stages of the investigation, and even in the courts as credible evidence. This approach reflects the importance of responsible adoption of the system while offering guidelines for its responsible adoption and future development."

    "abstract": "We propose a novel framework that integrates multi-modal multi-objective optimization evolutionary algorithms (MMOEAs) with Pareto Set Learning (PSL) to more effectively address multi-modal multi-objective optimization problems (MMOPs), which are characterized by multiple Pareto sets corresponding to the same Pareto front. In the proposed framework, evolutionary search is first employed to obtain a diverse set of initial solutions. These solutions are then used to construct a dataset of preference-solution-label triplets, which guides the pre-training of a Pareto set model. Following this stage, the model is further fine-tuned using the PSL methodology. To better capture the diversity of solutions in the decision space, we adopt a backbone network with multiple output heads. The resulting model is capable of generating multiple continuous Pareto sets. Preliminary experiments on benchmark MMOPs show that our method can successfully learn all major Pareto sets, outperforming both PSL and its improved variant in terms of decision-space diversity and coverage completeness.

To overcome these challenges, this study presents a novel three-stage image enhancement framework integrating global histogram equalization (HE), contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE), Frangi vesselness filtering, and gamma correction. A <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$3 \\times 3$</tex> median filter is first applied to suppress impulse noise while preserving vascular boundaries. Then, a weighted combination of HE and CLAHE (7:3 ratio) is used to enhance both global contrast and localized vessel detail. The result is further refined by multi-scale Frangi filtering to accentuate tubular vascular structures. Finally, gamma correction adjusts luminance distribution, revealing lowintensity anatomical features. This framework is validated on a proprietary NIR forearm vascular dataset, demonstrating notable performance improvements. Specifically, contrast increases by a factor of 1.8, information entropy improves by 0.6, and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) rises by 5.2 dB. These results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method in generating highfidelity, diagnostically valuable images and highlight its potential clinical applications in thrombus detection and vascular access evaluation."

However, due to the limited computing power of radar terminal equipment, the current deep learning algorithm parameter model is huge, and the operation efficiency on radar terminal equipment is low. In view of the above problems, this paper uses data enhancement methods and constructs a lightweight neural network to realize the lightweight of the model while ensuring the recognition accuracy. In terms of model training, this paper selects the classic network represented by ResNet18 and the specially designed lightweight network represented by MobileNetV3 as the objects, and adds the attention mechanism to the ResNet18 structure to obtain the ResNet18-SE model to improve its performance. In terms of model lightweight, this paper first performs five channel prunings with different pruning rates on ResNet18-SE and MobileNetV3 to reduce the number of parameters and explore the maximum pruning rate. Secondly, the accuracy is restored by fine-tuning, and the knowledge distillation method is used to realize the transfer of knowledge.

    "abstract": "Most of the existing works on low-light image enhancement focus either on dealing with multiple unknown parameters of physical model via hand-crafted priors, or assumptions; or on designing supervised image enhancement networks that heavily rely on paired ground-truth images. These methods are less practical and generalizable in real-world settings. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised enhancement network based on degradation priority attention module (DPAM) and cross-level feature aggregation module (CFAM) to enhance low-light images, called DPFANet. Specifically, DPAM uses unbalanced attenuation of $R, G$, and B channels to roughly estimate attenuation degree of the image, and pays additional attention to regions with stronger attenuation. Then, CFAM first extracts attention-guided features, and spatial-extended features, and then fuses these features with encoding features to simultaneously capture low-level details and high-level semantic knowledges from the input image, which provides a helpful support for enhancing overall structure and maintaining natural appearance. Besides, we synthesize a remotesensing image dataset including 650 samples of different remotesensing scenes. Extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic image datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in low-light image enhancement. Moreover, our method shows a good generalization capability for enhancing underwater images."

To address the limitations of existing monitoring methods, this study proposes a novel CO estimation framework that integrates phonocardiogram (PCG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) signals, focusing on CO dynamics during post-exercise recovery. ECGderived cardiac cycles enabled precise heart rate measurement and the extraction of discriminative features from PCG signals, including sample entropy, total power, systolic duration, diastolic duration, root mean square (RMS) and standard deviation (STD) of the first heart sound amplitude. Using impedance cardiography (ICG)-derived CO as the reference, multiple regression models were developed for CO prediction. Gradient Boosting Regression achieved the best performance under leave-one-subject-out crossvalidation, yielding a mean absolute error of $0.622 \\mathrm{~L} / \\mathrm{min}$ ($R^{2}=0.883$), with sample entropy identified as the most influential predictor. Collectively, these findings validate the feasibility of PCG-ECG fusion for non-invasive CO monitoring and establish a technical foundation for cost-effective, portable health monitoring systems suitable for home-based care and clinical rehabilitation."

    "abstract": "Despite significant progress in Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA), particularly with methods based on Transformers and Attentions, three major issues remain unresolved. First, existing unimodal representation learning methods overlook the noise and redundancy present within unimodal sequences. Second, current methods ignore the uneven distribution of emotional information across different modalities and fail to consider the highest contribution of text. Third, they neglect the issue of inter-modal noise redundancy in modal interactions. To address the aforementioned issues, this paper proposes a Text-Centric Sparse Interaction Fusion Network with a Modality Calibrating Module (TC-SIFN-MCM). A Modality Calibrating Module (MCM) is introduced during the unimodal representation learning phase to suppress noise within modalities. A Text-Centric Sparse Interaction Fusion Network (TC-SIFN) is designed to guide the learning of resource-poor non-text modalities with the resource-rich text modality, fully leveraging the highest contribution of the text modality. A Top-K Sparse Attention Transformer is utilized as a means of modal inter action, suppressing inter-modal noise generated during modal interactions. We conducted extensive experiments on the CMU MOSI, CMU-MOSEI, and SIMS datasets, and the results show that our TC-SIFN-MCM model outperforms current methods, with a notably impressive Acc-2 score of 86.07% on the MOSEI dataset."

Establishing a vision for future communications is crucial at this point in order to guide that research. This paper proposes a novel Fog-based Radio Access Network (F-RAN) architecture integrated with full photonic technology, called Photonics Radio Access Network (P-RAN), aiming to address critical limitations in conventional fog deployments, namely excessive power consumption, ultra-high speed, low latency, and constrained energy efficiency. In particular, the integration of photonic components and the use of technologies like Photonics Integrated Circuit (PIC), Radio Frequency Over Fiber (RFOF), and Electro-absorption Modulated laser (EML) significantly alleviate the Power Consumption (PC) or Energy Efficiency (EE) and latency bottlenecks associated with dense fog node deployments. The proposed architecture establishes a robust and scalable 6 G radio access network framework. It sets a new standard for next-generation mobile systems by offering a superior trade-off between PC performance and latency. A comprehensive performance evaluation uses advanced mathematical modeling to assess key metrics such as power consumption (PC) and latency. The energy-efficient deployment potential of P-RAN is demonstrated by its 18% reduction in power consumption at 25 photonic baseband units (P-BBU) and 16% reduction in latency at 100 photonic remote radio heads (P-RRH) compared to traditional F-RAN. All findings show that the P-RAN is ideal for time-sensitive 6 G applications, not only improving spectrum and energy efficiency but also dramatically reducing latency."

However, existing CML-based rainfall estimation methods face several challenges. These include difficulties with complex spatiotemporal precipitation patterns, fixed parameter dependencies, poor regional adaptability, and systematic underestimation of heavy rainfall events. To address these challenges, we propose CD-TA-RTM, a dual-pathway deep learning architecture which exploits Convolutional Downsampling (CD) for spatial pattern extraction, Temporal ion (TA) for multi-scale temporal dynamics, and Raw Temporal Modeling (RTM) for preserving original sequence information. To balance contributions of imbalanced rainfall intensities during training, we also introduce an Adaptive Rainfall-Intensity Weighted (ARIW) loss function that dynamically addresses underestimation bias during heavy precipitation events with small proportion in the dataset. Experiments based on dual-frequency E-band CML data demonstrate that our approach achieves excellent prediction performance across the entire test dataset with PCC of 0.8915 and $\\mathbf{R}^{2}$ of 0.7805 while maintaining remarkable robustness to noise."

By analyzing technical and content attributes from a dataset of 14,465 Search Engine Results Page (SERP) items collected from a homogeneous commercial discount domain comprising 500 queries, we aim to characterize observable associative patterns between resource attributes and ranking outcomes. The dataset includes Lighthouse performance metrics and advanced content features, such as Sentence-BERT-based semantic similarity. Using K-Means clustering, we identify five resource profiles representing emergent optimization archetypes. The analysis revealed that content-related factors had a higher aggregate importance for both systems (Google: 70.1%, Bing: 61.8%) than technical factors. Specifically, Random Forest feature importance analysis highlighted that for Bing, content volume was a dominant predictor, whereas for Google, semantic relevance signals outweighed pure keyword targeting. We further contextualize these findings within an \"Authority–Optimization Trade-off\" framework, suggesting that Google’s negative associations for certain on-page optimization signals likely reflect a ranking function that heavily weights latent domain authority over explicit on-page compliance. These findings highlight how modern learning-to-rank systems may differentially weight explicit content features and latent authority signals when balancing relevance, diversity, and quality."

Questions arising from masking span biomedicine, epidemiology, physics, and human behaviors. While science has shown masks work generally, human behaviors (particularly under influences of politics) complicate the problem significantly given science generally assumes rationality but our minds are not always rational and/or honest. Minding minds, a legitimate concern, can also make masking legitimately confusing. To disentangle the potential confusions, particularly, the ramifications of irrationality and dishonesty, here we resort to evolutionary game theory. Specifically, we formulate and analyze the masking problem with a fictitious pair of young lovers, Alice and Bob, as a Sir Philip Sydney (SPS) evolutionary game, inspired by the handicap principle in evolutionary biology and cryptography figures in computer science. With the proposed Alice and Bob’s dating dilemma (ABD) as an asymmetric four-by-four strategic-form game, 16 strategic interactions were identified, and six of which may reach equilibriums with different characteristics such as separating, pooling, and polymorphic hybrid, being Nash, evolutionarily stable or neutrally stable. The six equilibrium types seem to mirror the diverse behaviors of mask believers, skeptics, converted, universal masking, voluntarily masking, coexisted and/or divided world of believers and skeptics. We suggest that the apparently simple ABD game is sufficiently general not only for studying masking policies for populations (<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">via</i> replicator dynamics), but also for investigating other complex decision-making problems with COVID-19 pandemic including lockdown versus reopening, herd immunity versus quarantines, and aggressive tracing versus privacy protection."

In this article, we proposed an ultrarobust adaptive oscillator (AO) (URAO) method for predicting the kicking phase for the flutter kick and breaststroke kick, two main underwater motion patterns in diving activity. The URAO works without the need for data collection or training and can adapt to different users, motion patterns, and rapid changes in kicking frequency, offering greater precision than methods previously utilized for land-based exoskeletons. Eight participants were tested while performing fluctuating-frequency flutter and breaststroke kicks in indoor and outdoor swimming pools.

In this study, the permanent magnet in the HTS dynamo benchmark model is replaced with a bulk superconductor of similar size. A two-dimensional finite-element model is developed in COMSOL Multiphysics to evaluate the open-circuit voltage of the bulk-based dynamo under different trapped field assumptions corresponding to different bulk operating temperatures. The results show that the bulk-based HTS dynamo can generate significantly higher output voltage than conventional designs, increasing approximately linearly with the trapped field strength.

    "abstract": "Most existing constrained multi-objective evolutionary algorithms primarily rely on heuristic search and empirically designed operators, often overlooking the underlying causal relationships between decision variables and objective functions. This limitation reduces their ability to avoid deceptive regions in the search space and increases the risk of premature convergence, particularly in problems with complex feasible regions. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel causalityguided adaptive dual-population evolution for constrained multi-objective optimization algorithm (named CAD-CMOEA). The proposed CAD-CMOEA first employs an information-geometric causal inference method to model causal effects between decision variables and objectives, identifying the positive or negative influence of each variable. Based on this insight, a causality-aware genetic operator is developed by integrating competitive cooperative optimization strategies with Gaussian perturbation, enabling guided and directional variation to produce high-quality offspring. To further balance convergence and diversity, we propose a new dual-population co-evolution mechanism: one population explores high-quality solutions within the feasible region, while another population investigates promising areas near the infeasible boundary, thereby strengthening global search capabilities. Experimental results on LIR-CMOP1-14 benchmark problems demonstrate that CAD-CMOEA outperforms eight state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of IGD and HV metrics, confirming its effectiveness in causal modeling, search efficiency and solution quality."

Traditional filtering algorithms suffer from fixed parameters and poor adaptability, while deep learning-based denoising approaches often involve excessive training parameters and high model complexity, resulting in high hardware requirements. This work proposes a wavelet convolutional neural network (WCNN) for denoising multi-source physiological signals. In the preprocessing and coarse-grained processing stages, signals contaminated by motion artifacts are converted into signals with only frequency-overlapping noise. By exploiting the ability of wavelet transforms to capture highfrequency features, the convolutional layers of a conventional CNN are replaced with wavelet transform layers, enabling precise separation of physiological signals. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed full-process WCNN improves the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of multi-source physiological signals by 12.96 dB and achieves effective denoising under frequency overlap conditions. This algorithm holds significant potential for denoising tasks in multi-source physiological signals and for applications in MLLM."

To address this limitation, we propose an enhanced single-snapshot Direction of Arrival (DOA) estimation method based on compressed sensing. Our improvement involves replacing the fixed step size in the steepest descent process with an optimal step size derived from exact one-dimensional search. This modification enables more accurate iterative solutions through optimal step sizes and descent directions. Comprehensive simulation results confirm that our proposed algorithm not only achieves effective DOA estimation but also significantly outperforms the conventional SL0 approach in terms of estimation accuracy and convergence performance."

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a deep learning framework based on multi-task learning for the automated ultrasound diagnosis of cervical lymph node metastasis (CLNM) in papillary thyroid carcinoma before surgery. To address the challenges of low contrast, significant noise in ultrasound images, and the heavy reliance of diagnosis on physicians’ experience, existing methods are mostly limited to a single classification task or fail to effectively fuse global and local features. In this study, a dual-branch encoder-decoder architecture is designed, which can simultaneously achieve accurate segmentation of lymph node regions and classification of metastatic status. The model extracts local features via convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and global dependencies via Transformers in parallel, and realizes multi-scale feature fusion by integrating a feature alignment module. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves a Dice coefficient of 0.7526, an intersection over union (IoU) of 0.8589, and a classification accuracy of 80.63%. Its performance is significantly superior to that of existing single-task methods and mainstream segmentation networks, which proves its application potential in clinical auxiliary diagnosis."

The inner loop is the attitude control loop, incorporating an ESO to estimate the system's total disturbances. The outer loop is the height control and horizontal speed control loop. Fuzzy PID control is adopted to improve the high-dimensional nonlinearity problem caused by the large flight envelope, wide load and wide rotational speed of the helicopter. This paper demonstrates the superiority of the controller proposed in this study through detailed simulation results. The controller enables the helicopter to track control commands effectively, while the system exhibits excellent stability and robustness."

Regression analyses on a sample of 207 Italian-speaking were conducted, participants revealed that the AI literacy “engagement” factor, that is, the ability/interest towards actively participating in AI projects development, predicts more autonomous forms of motivation for using these technologies.

    "abstract": "Recently, instruction-driven image editing methods have demonstrated promising capabilities, requiring only a brief text to guide image modifications. However, most of them often yield suboptimal results for object editing in complex scenes, due to two major defects: (1) Over-editing, where unintended regions of the image are inadvertently altered; (2) Inability to precisely adhere to instructions, particularly in scenes with numerous elements. To resolve these issues, we propose a Single object Editing scheme, termed SoEdit, which distills complex editing tasks into single-object editing within cropped regions through a pipeline that integrates task parsing, object localization, editing, and context blending. This approach minimizes interference from irrelevant areas, ensures proper object size and placement, and ultimately enhances model performance. Furthermore, we introduce a lightweight <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Spatially-Adaptive Mixture of Experts (SAMOE)</i> to better model spatial heterogeneity, enabling tokenwise adaptive processing and further enhancing the overall editing capability with minimal additional parameters. Moreover, we introduce a large-scale object-centric dataset to further optimize the model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SoEdit outperforms existing methods, especially in precise responses to fine-grained editing requirements, such as multi-action and quantity-sensitive object editing."

    "abstract": "Remote sensing of aerosols by infrared hyperspectral radiation has become an emerging research frontier in recent years. In current infrared hyperspectral remote sensing of aerosol, only the aerosol type and effective radius (<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">R<sub>eff</sub></i>) are considered, while the width of the aerosol size distribution (Geometric Standard Deviation, GSD) is simplified as a constant, neglecting its impact on infrared radiative transfer. Is this simplification physically justified? To clarify this issue, an infrared hyperspectral radiative transfer model considering the variation of GSD of aerosol particles was established, and the impacts of GSD on both upwelling and downwelling radiances are investigated. It can be found that radiance discrepancies attributed to variations of GSD exceed those caused by effective radius up to 70%. The downwelling radiance demonstrates far greater sensitivity to GSD compared to its upwelling counterpart. Furthermore, the sensitivity of infrared radiance to GSD will be amplified with the increase of Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD). Finally, to further validate the necessity of considering GSD in aerosol remote sensing, both triple-parameter (AOD, <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">R<sub>eff</sub></i>, and GSD) and dual-parameter inversions (AOD and <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">R<sub>eff</sub></i>) were performed by using machine learning methods respectively.

While time-division duplexing (TDD) is often regarded as superior in today's terrestrial networks, its viability in future LEO SatCom systems remains unclear. This article details how the long propagation delays and high orbital velocities exhibited by LEO SatCom systems impedes the adoption of TDD, largely due to challenges involving the frame structure and synchronization. We then present potential approaches to overcome these challenges, which vary in terms of spectral efficiency and operational/ device complexity and thus may likely be application- specific. We conclude by assessing the performance of these proposed approaches, putting into perspective the tradeoff between complexity and performance gains over FDD. Overall, this article aims to motivate future investigation into the prospects of TDD in LEO SatCom systems and solutions to enable such, with the goal of enhancing future systems and unifying them with terrestrial networks."

However, its imaging quality is often degraded by severe spatially variant phase errors resulting from range-azimuth coupling. To address this issue, this paper introduces a high-precision echo signal model and a novel correction method aimed at spatially-variant error compensation. The proposed approach first achieves range-azimuth decoupling using dechirp processing combined with the Keystone transform. A key contribution is the application of a series expansion-based phase compensation method that effectively eliminates residual spatially-variant errors. Finally, azimuth focusing yields a wellfocused SAR image. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves image quality and validates its effectiveness in spatially-variant error correction."

    "abstract": "When the high-voltage direct current-connected offshore wind farm (HVDC-connected OWF) participates in grid frequency support, excessively high frequency controller gains may exacerbate the electromagnetic oscillations within system. Therefore, it is essential to study the stability region for frequency controller gains of HVDC-connected OWF, thus ensuring the grid secure operation during frequency events. Currently, numerical methods are used to analyze the operational stability region of HVDC-connected OWF. However, these methods involve exhaustive calculations to obtain the stability region, resulting in a significant computational burden. To address the issue, this work proposes an analytical stability region identification method for HVDC-connected OWF when it participates in the grid frequency support. Specifically, a comprehensive small signal model, tailored for analyzing frequency support-induced oscillation, is first developed by considering both the frequency regulation characteristics and the power converter dynamics. Further, using the Padé approximation technique, the reduced order equivalent model is derived while preserving its accuracy. With this equivalent model, the mechanism underlying frequency support-induced oscillation is qualitatively elucidated, and the stability region for frequency support is also analytically derived. Finally, the analysis results are validated through electromagnetic transient simulations."

We analyze the authors, keywords, organizations, studies, and citations from 2020 to 2024. Our proposal in this paper is a two-layer multilayer system. To anticipate the patient's heart rate and blood pressure during the following three hours, we start by analysing past vital data.

Along with other metrics like vital signs, lab results, imaging reports, etc., it contains patient data like age, weight, and height. To estimate a patient's heart rate and blood pressure, we suggest a technique that uses a Multitask multilayer LSTM_GRU model to extract signal and statistical information from the patient's vital signs.

This measurement system uses infrared sensors to record phase-shifted signals, allowing it to determine the direction of rotation in addition to precisely measuring rotational speed in revolutions per minute (RPM). The RPM values acquired by the developed system have been calibrated using a commercial tachometer DT-2235 and it has been observed that values recorded by the system are accurate.

In this study, a novel biologically plausible dendritic learning network (pDL) is proposed that integrates dendritic computation with Hebbian learning. Unlike conventional models based on McCulloch-Pitts neurons and backpropagation (BP), the pDL leverages dendritic structures for nonlinear information processing and adopts a local, biologically inspired Hebbian learning rule that incorporates both local and global error signals. This architecture not only enhances the network's computational capacity but also mitigates common limitations associated with BP, such as gradient explosion and vanishing gradients. Experimental results show that the pDL outperforms traditional multilayer perceptron in classification tasks and effectively extracts discriminative features through dendritic processing. Furthermore, the use of plausible Hebbian learning significantly improves inter-class feature separation, thereby increasing the confidence coefficient in classification outcomes. Overall, the proposed method offers an effective and interpretable alternative to conventional deep learning approaches, bridging the gap between artificial and biological intelligence."

Existing models are primarily designed for single-IRS systems and face limitations when applied to multi-IRS configurations. To address this challenge, we propose to formulate the channel predictions in multiIRS systems as a deep transfer learning (DTL) problem. The DTL algorithm employs a two-phase methodology, beginning with the pretraining of a neural network on source tasks, followed by fine-tuning for target tasks. In the pretraining phase, the fully connected neural network (FNN) is trained to predict downlink cascaded channels based on their uplink counterparts from prior IRS systems. In the fine-tuning phase, this pretrained model is adapted to target tasks by transferring the pre-established channel knowledge to new IRS scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed DTL model achieves satisfactory channel prediction accuracy with reduced training overhead in multi-IRS assisted communication systems."

So the best solution is, it should be get predicted. Then only the patient can avoid this situation. The best ways to predict the epilepsy seizure is the main aim of this research. There were already researched and found much prediction methods for epilepsy seizures. The main challenge is that it is need to propose the best and accurate method with latest technologies. The technique can be a new algorithm or new technology or new method with existing algorithm. The study of epilepsy seizure can be done by electroencephalogram recordings of epilepsy patients. So that we can only use existing recordings to design a method by comparing the recordings of non-epileptic patients. The recordings can be represented by time domain and frequency domain. We are here trying to propose a method by using deep learning for prediction of epilepsy seizure. This work then suggests mainly the latest convolutional neural network for best result.

Secondly, we apply a comparison algorithm based on the similarity between the attributes of the user’s face and the faces of celebrities in the database to recommend the four most suitable hairstyles. Finally, the new hairstyles will be quickly and accurately rendered on the user’s face using the HairFastGAN model. We conduct experiments by applying our recommendation algorithms on the SCUT-FPB5500 dataset, using a SEResNeXt50 backbone combined with ComboLoss to score the input and generated images to determine an effective recommendation strategy. The experimental results indicate that our recommendation method improves the average beauty score by 7.69% for the faces in the filtered SCUT-FBP5500 dataset, with the best PC metric of approximately 0.96."

    "abstract": "This letter proposes a new low-complexity blind carrier frequency offset (CFO) estimator for orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) systems in vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications. The estimator leverages the statistical properties of the element-wise modulus vector of OTFS symbols in the delay-Doppler (DD) domain. It is shown that, under ideal CFO compensation, the variance of this vector reaches its minimum while the expectation reaches its maximum. Based on this finding, the objective function for CFO estimation is formulated. Moreover, to reduce complexity and meet the real-time requirement of V2X communications, the expectation of the objective function is approximated as its mean via the law of large numbers. Simulation results demonstrate that, for sufficient signal lengths, the proposed estimator achieves lower complexity while achieving higher estimation accuracy under low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions compared with existing estimators."

    "abstract": "Quaternions adaptive filtering has become a defacto standard in multidimensional signal processing, however, challenges remain regarding in the balance between convergence speed and stability. To this end, we propose a novel quaternion least mean square algorithm with quasi-hyperbolic momentum (QLMS-QHM), which incorporates a quasi-hyperbolic momentum mechanism to adaptively integrate historical gradient information, thereby accelerating convergence and improving robustness in noisy environments. Theoretical analysis establishes step size bounds for asymptotic convergence, along with comprehensive evaluations of both mean and mean-square behaviors. Simulations demonstrate that the QLMS-QHM algorithm outperforms the classical QLMS, particularly in scenarios requiring rapid adaptation and interference suppression. Practical applications in quaternion-valued adaptive beamforming validate the effectiveness of the QLMS-QHM algorithm under dynamic interference conditions. Overall, the QLMS-QHM algorithm provides a unified framework for incorporating momentum mechanisms into quaternion adaptive filtering, enhancing the design and application of filters in real-world scenarios."

However, the performance of STAP is commonly restricted by range ambiguity. It is confirmed that Frequency diverse array (FDA) can address range ambiguity by providing range-related degrees of freedom. Therefore, FDA-STAP becomes popular for rejecting range ambiguous clutter. Nevertheless, the existing FDASTAP commonly performs poorly while the number of training samples is small. This paper develops a novel FDA-STAP, which realizes range ambiguous clutter cancellation by constructing orthogonal subspace of clutter subspace according to the platform and radar system parameters. The proposed method is not restricted by samples and has significant performance advantages when system parameters are known accurately."

Traditional methods for IncRNA classification and Ribonucleic Acid (RNA)-protein interaction prediction rely on handcrafted feature engineering, which is labor-intensive and suboptimal. We propose a novel approach leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for sequence-based feature extraction to automate IncRNA analysis. We address two key bottlenecks: (1) classifying IncRNAs into categories (LincRNA, Antisense, Exonic, Sense No Exonic) using sequence data alone, and (2) predicting IncRNA-protein interactions. Our framework integrates fine-tuned RNA Foundation Model (RNA-FM) and Evolutionary Scale Modeling (ESM) models with multi-head attention pooling and Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) for end-to-end prediction. We then built two different datasets: Lnc-4 (458,104 sequences) and LncPI-180k (<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$\\mathbf{3 5 7, 4 3 8}$</tex> pairs). Results show our model outperforms baselines (CORAIN and RPITER) in both tasks, achieving significant improvements in accuracy, F1-score, recall, and Area Under the Curve (AUC), while reducing computational time by over 90%. This study establishes a robust, scalable framework for IncRNA functional annotation. We release the code at https://github.com/kelly159951/LLMs-LncRNA"

Conventionally, equivalent circuit model (ECM) parameter identification is per formed through offline testing, which results in costly downtime, or through online perturbation-based methods, which disturb the grid undesirably. In contrast, this paper proposes a method for online ECM parameter identification in modular multilevel cascaded converter (MMCC)-based BESSs that introduces no disturbances into the electrical grid. The proposed technique injects controlled current harmonic perturbations into the battery terminals while using a novel control strategy to cancel the net effect of these harmonics at the grid interface. This is enabled by leveraging the inherent interleaving capability of the MMCC-based BESS. This control-based solution eliminates the need for oversized buffer capacitors or extra hardware, and can be integrated seamlessly within existing control schemes. Validation is performed using a 3.84-kW/3.46-kWh lab prototype under various grid conditions, demonstrating accurate real-time ECM parameter estimation via recursive least squares without distorting the grid current."

However, the literature on methods to ensure a comprehensive health evaluation with a focus on prioritized correlation analysis is limited. In this context, this work proposes a framework for evaluating the performance of power transformers using 15 diagnostic attributes. The model is designed with Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), Grey Relational Analysis (GRA), and Technique for Order Performance by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS). The diagnostic attributes are initially normalized, and then prioritized based on closely related characteristics and finally grouped into three specific health degrees using the proposed systematic hybrid decision-making approach. The three health degrees are further coupled with a technical fuzzy rule base to derive the actual health status of power transformers. The hybrid model is validated using known health conditions of 200 transformers collected from Himachal Pradesh State Electricity Board, India, and compared with recent similar health prediction methods published in the literature. The comparison reveals the superiority of the model with 97% accuracy. Moreover, the following are the main advantages of the model over the existing health assessment methods: prioritization among closely related attributes, assessment of samples with respect to positive and negative ideal solutions, no dependency on training data, less complexity, and consideration of visual inspection and maintenance parameters. Furthermore, it facilitates an appropriate alert system for conditional maintenance."

To address this issue, we propose a physics-constrained self-supervised halo-free network (PC-SHFN) using Gaussian-approximated noise modeling and physical constraints, which can effectively eliminate halo effects without sacrificing phase accuracy by utilizing digitally simulated training data for robust generalization.

However, the ambiguity problem in magnetic pose estimation has been long overlooked that could result in inaccuracy and even divergence of pose tracking. This article is devoted to fundamentally investigating the ambiguity issue in 6-DoF electromagnetic pose estimation systems. Magnetic ambiguity is formally defined, and its existence and impacts on pose estimation are analyzed for single-magnet and dual-magnet tracking systems, then generalized to multiple-magnet systems. It is found that there are different types of ambiguity, each with distinct influence on pose estimation. Efficient algorithms are proposed to systematically identify all ambiguous poses in a workspace. The ambiguity in typical configurations of dual-magnet systems is identified and discussed. It is found that ambiguity can be completely eliminated by using at least THREE magnetic sources. An unambiguous tri-magnet system is proposed by combining the collocated and parallel dual-magnet systems and validated by tracking a continuum robot. This article lays the foundation for optimizing configurations of magnetic sources and designing compact, energy-efficient, but unambiguous magnetic tracking systems with minimum number of magnetic sources."

    "abstract": "Lidar-based 3D perception systems are critical for autonomous vehicle (AV) navigation, yet they remain vulnerable to spoofing attacks that can create false detections (ghost objects) or hide real obstacles. Despite significant advances in object detection, existing methods remain highly susceptible to adversarial attacks. Furthermore, existing research has largely overlooked the impact of weather conditions on both attacks and defenses. No existing study provides a systematic analysis on how the rain effect affects spoofing and hiding attacks. Motivated by this critical gap, we propose a novel rain-aware threat model in this article, focusing on lidar spoofing attacks involving object insertion (ghost objects) and removal (hiding attacks). We review state-of-the-art attack implementations and emphasize how rain increases attack feasibility and stealth, enabling attackers to achieve effective spoofing with significantly fewer perturbed points. We call this a reduced attack budget (AB). Formally, we define the AB as the minimal number of spoofed points (and corresponding laser returns) needed to meet attack success (ghost insertion: high-confidence false positives; object hiding: low-confidence false negatives)."

A novel shared-control structure is established with an explicitly defined and dynamically adjustable weights mechanism, enabling smooth authority transitions across control modes and consistent task execution. A neural near-optimal adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) framework firstly applied to uncertain teleoperation eschews the conventional dependence on precisely known dynamics to deliver near-optimal control. Moreover, a prescribed-time exponential disturbance observer (PPTEDO) featuring a rigorously designed continuous switching function, thereby overcomes the inherent instability and chattering pitfalls associated with discontinuous PT schemes. Under the impedance control layer, a reset regularized exponentiation sliding mode (RRESM) surface is designed to ensure fast transient-state response while elevating system transparency and improve human-robot interaction fluency. Additionally, the absolute stability of the closed-loop teleoperation system is rigorously proved via establishment of Lyapunov candidate function. Finally, experiment results are presented to demonstrate the practical availability of the designed algorithm."

    "abstract": "Computational pathology has become an indispensable component of cancer survival analysis, yet state-of-the-art multimodal pipelines still depend heavily on paired whole-slide images (WSIs) and in situ genomic or immunohistochemistry (IHC) profiles. In practice, however, IHC and high-throughput sequencing are costly, tissue-consuming, and frequently unavailable, creating a critical performance gap for cases lacking molecular data. To bridge this gap, we introduce HMSP (Hierarchical Multimodal Survival Prediction), a framework that leverages richly structured pathology reports as a flexible linguistic surrogate for missing genomic information. Concretely, HMSP formulates WSIs, free-text pathology narratives, and (when present) genomic features as a three-level hierarchy of visual, lexical, and molecular semantics. We enforce hierarchical consistency with a Tri-Modal Ranking Contrastive Loss and a Cone-Based Hyperbolic (H-Cone) regulariser, enabling (i) fine-grained alignment between image regions and report phrases and (ii) high-level alignment between report embeddings and genomic biomarkers. Once trained, the report encoder alone can act as a plug-in genomic proxy, allowing robust survival prediction even when molecular assays are absent. Extensive experiments on five public cohorts demonstrate that HMSP not only surpasses previous multimodal baselines under full-data settings, but also maintains state-of-the-art performance when genomic channels are wholly ablated—highlighting the practicality of text-driven surrogates in real-world resource-constrained scenarios. Code and pretrained weights will be released upon publication."

    "abstract": "The precise classification of white blood cells (WBC) plays a crucial role in the prompt diagnosis of a range of health conditions. However, current methods face significant challenges including overfitting, reliance on trial-and-error strategies for model selection, and suboptimal performance, particularly in scenarios involving diverse and complex datasets. To address these challenges, we propose the Multi-Scale State Transition Optimization-based Ensemble network (MS-STO-Net). Initially, we selected three deep learning (DL) models named MobileNetV1, DenseNet169, and DenseNet201 due to their exceptional performance on a specified blood cancer cells dataset. These models are used to extract robust features from blood cell images. To further enhance feature extraction at various scales, we integrate a Naive Inception Block (NIB) with each of these selected DL models and considered them as base models for the building the proposed method. The significant advantage of using NIB lies in its ability to efficiently capture multi-scale features without a significant increase in computational complexity. In prior studies, manually assigned weightage in weighted ensemble approaches restricted the full contribution of base models. To overcome this, we use the State Transition Algorithm (STA) to optimize the contribution of each base model by dynamically adjusting their weightage for improved performance. The inclusion of STA allows the method to dynamically find the optimal set of weightage vector for each base model, thus maximizing the ensemble performance. To evaluate the proposed method, we utilized the publicly available Kaggle BCCD WBC dataset consisting of five distinct classes. The proposed MS-STO-Net model achieved an impressive accuracy performance of 98.86% by outperforming prior studies and individual base models. Additionally, Grad-CAM visualizations were used to demonstrate the decision-making capability of the models, and the ROC curve was also incorporated to further validate the performance of models."

Existing reviews have introduced various methods. However, they often lack comprehensive coverage of data sources across all these modalities. This academic review aims to address that gap by examining publicly available datasets used in multimodal machine learning for depression detection. It systematically analyzes the characteristics, strengths, and limitations of datasets involving different modalities, including textual, auditory, visual, and EEG signals. Integrating multiple data modalities holds promise for improving the accuracy and reliability of depression diagnosis. Despite significant progress, several key challenges remain unresolved.

The finite-time back-stepping formation controller is constructed to accelerate the convergence speed of the formation for the CLFH strategy. Considering communication redundancy between controller and actuator, fixed and time-varying thresholds are designed to reduce communication frequency, resulting in communication cost savings. The unknown model and unknown time-varying disturbances are taken into consideration, adaptive fuzzy logic estimator is estab lished to evaluate model uncertainty and external disturbances. Time-varying Lyapunov function is designed to avoid collisions between USVs. The Lyapunov theory for CLFH framework proves that the line of sight range error and bear angle error can converge to a tiny neighborhood near zero.

    "abstract": "Functional electrical stimulation (FES) is commonly used in clinical practice to induce muscle contractions for rehabilitation therapy. However, the collected electromyography (EMG) under FES is a mixed signal containing voluntary electromyography (VEMG), which is generated by neural system recruited motor units, and FES response, which is composed of initial spikes generated by current passage and M-waves generated by stimulation recruited motor units. To realize close-loop control of FES system or to reveal the mechanism of FES through EMG signal, it is necessary to separate the three components from mixed signal. Based on the assumption that signal sources of initial spikes and action potentials related signals (VEMG and M-waves) are independent of each other, this study presents a novel mixed FES signal decomposition algorithm termed FastICA-Comb. Specifically, in order to achieve high-quality separation of VEMG, M-waves and initial spikes, the algorithm is designed as a unique scheme combining one-stage comb filtering and two-stage fast independent component analysis (FastICA) decomposition and classification. To evaluate the proposed algorithm’s effectiveness, FES data collection experiment was conducted on 6 healthy subjects. The experimental results confirm that the FastICA-Comb algorithm has better VEMG and M-wave extraction capabilities than the classical methods including comb filter, GS-PEF, EMD-notch and blanking window in both simulated and real mixed FES signal. Therefore, the research findings provide an effective signal analysis tool for exploring the therapeutic mechanism of FES."

    "abstract": "Objective: Accurate visualization of interventional devices, such as medical needles, in relation to the procedural target is critical for the safe and effective guidance of interventional procedures. Ultrasound (US) imaging is widely used for guiding percutaneous needle interventions, but the 2D nature of most clinical US probes limits accurate 3D localization, particularly of the needle tip. In this work, we introduce a novel system that combines both volumetric US imaging and 3D needle tracking. Method: The proposed novel system integrates a fiber-optic hydrophone (FOH) into the needle and employs a 2D sparse spiral US array with 256 active elements. Real-time volumetric US imaging was achieved by plane-wave imaging with the sparse array, while 3D needle tip tracking was enabled through communications between the US probe and the FOH. Results: The system achieved spatial resolutions (mean ± standard deviation) of 2.06 ± 0.29mm (lateral), 2.26 ± 0.23mm (elevational), and 0.69 ± 0.12mm (axial) at depths ranging from 10 to 40mm. The tracking accuracy was better than 0.30 ± 0.21mm. The clinical potential of the system was demonstrated using a nerve block training phantom. Conclusions: This study presents a proof-of-concept for an integrated solution that enables simultaneous volumetric anatomical imaging and precise 3D needle tip tracking. Significance: The proposed system holds strong potential to enhance the efficacy and safety of image-guided interventional procedures by providing real-time 3D anatomical visualization and accurate needle tracking."

    "abstract": "Online visual object tracking fundamentally constitutes a continual learning challenge, demanding persistent adaptation to target variations within dynamic video streams, while preserving critical features to prevent forgetting. Existing template-based trackers are particularly vulnerable to severe target deformation and drastic background changes in real-world scenarios. Recent explorations enhance adaptability through local update strategies—such as dynamic templates, appearance tokens, and parameter fine-tuning—to address rapid appearance variations. However, these methods inherently propagate target appearance changes without explicit modelling and prioritise short-term adaptation over long-term global representation. Consequently, they fail to balance initial target features with current observations, leading to tracking failure in long-term scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we propose DG-Track, an adaptive continual learning framework leveraging Grassmannian manifold geometry. Specifically, we represent target appearance within a Grassmannian affine subspace and perform continual adaptation via incremental learning. Compared to Euclidean geometry, the Grassmannian manifold captures nonlinear appearance representations, yielding more compact and geometrically consistent temporal dynamics modelling. Furthermore, an adaptive forgetting module dynamically regulates the interplay between the current observed subspace and the initial template, ensuring stable long-term tracking. DG-Track is a plug-and-play solution for online tracking, adding no learnable parameters. Comprehensive experiments with diverse baseline trackers on LaSOT, GOT-10k, TrackingNet, and UAV123 validate the efficacy of our continual learning framework and Grassmannian manifold geometry in enhancing visual object tracking performance.

    "abstract": "The shallow water low-frequency acoustic channel is characterized by evident inter-modal and intra-modal frequency dispersion, which seriously affect the accuracy of conventional channel estimation methods. To address this challenge, a channel estimation algorithm based on timefrequency (TF) analysis is proposed. The algorithm utilizes time warping technique to transform the complex global channel into a linear combination of multiple single-modal channels, and effectively reduce the impact of channel extension length and multipath effects on estimation accuracy through mode decomposition. On this basis, the separated single-modal channels are estimated independently. After the estimation is completed, the reconstruction is performed to obtain accurate estimation of the global channel. The validity of the proposed algorithm is substantiated by simulation results. Compared with the conventional method, the normalized mean square error (NMSE) of channel estimation is greatly reduced. Furthermore, the equalizer based on the proposed algorithm attains a lower bit error rate (BER) in the context of shallow water low-frequency communication system."

Herein, the potential of RIS-assisted UAV architectures are discussed, focusing particularly on their role in supporting Backscatter Communication (BackCom)— a low-power paradigm suitable for passive IoT devices — which remains little explored. To fill this gap, two representative paradigms are introduced: (i) UAV-empowered RIS-enabled BackCom and (ii) UAV-assisted RIS-enabled BackCom. These use cases are analyzed through a structured framework based on Concepts of Operation (ConOps), mission-level attributes, and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), offering a comprehensive assessment of their performance, scalability, and deployment feasibility. In addition, a theoretical throughput-oriented performance analysis is developed, deriving closed-form rate (R) and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) scaling laws as a function of the number of RIS elements and UAV transmit power. The analytical results highlight the quadratic SNR scaling behavior under ideal conditions and clarify the fundamental trade-offs between RIS aperture size and power beacon requirements. The findings demonstrate that UAV–RIS–BackCom architectures can achieve scalable, low-power, and rapidly deployable connectivity in infrastructure-limited environments, while also revealing practical limitations related to hardware impairments, control overhead, and channel dynamics.

Federated Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (FedPEFT) has emerged as a promising solution to address privacy and efficiency challenges in distributed training for PLMs on resource-constrained local devices. However, our measurements reveal two key limitations of FedPEFT: heterogeneous data across devices exacerbates performance degradation of low-rank adaptation, and a fixed parameter configuration results in communication inefficiency. To overcome these limitations, we propose FedARA, a novel Adaptive Rank Allocation framework for federated parameter-efficient fine-tuning of language models. Specifically, FedARA employs truncated Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) adaptation to enhance similar feature representation across clients, significantly mitigating the adverse effects of data heterogeneity. Subsequently, it utilizes dynamic rank allocation to progressively identify critical ranks, effectively improving communication efficiency. Lastly, it leverages rank-based module pruning to automatically remove inactive modules, steadily reducing local computational cost and memory usage in each federated learning round. Extensive experiments show that FedARA consistently outperforms baselines by an average of 6.95% to 8.49% across various datasets and models under heterogeneous data while significantly improving communication efficiency by 2.40×. Moreover, experiments on various edge devices demonstrate substantial decreases in total training time and energy consumption by up to 48.90% and 46.95%, respectively."

Furthermore, with the goal of capturing long-range dependencies and address non-uniform degradation, the framework incorporates an improved channel-spatial hybrid attention mechanism, including a Multi-scale Feature Fusion Transformer (CMSFFT) for dynamic feature weighting and a Global Feature Modeling Transformer (SGFMT) for spatial attention. The results of experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art techniques on multiple metrics, including Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), Structural Similarity (SSIM), and Underwater Image Quality Measure (UIQM). Notably, it achieves a 1.21 dB higher PSNR than FUnIE-GAN and a $10 \\times$ faster inference speed than WaterNet.

    "abstract": "Machine learning models often make predictions based on biased features such as gender, race, and other social attributes, posing significant fairness risks, especially in societal applications, such as hiring, banking, and criminal justice. Traditional approaches to addressing this issue involve retraining or fine-tuning neural networks with fairness-aware optimization objectives. However, these methods can be impractical due to significant computational resources, complex industrial tests, and the associated CO2 footprint. Additionally, regular users often fail to fine-tune models because they lack access to model parameters. In this paper, we introduce the Inference-Time Rule Eraser (Eraser), a novel method designed to address fairness concerns by removing biased decision-making rules from deployed models during inference without altering model weights. We begin by establishing a theoretical foundation for modifying model outputs to eliminate biased rules through Bayesian analysis. Next, we present a specific implementation of Eraser that involves two stages: (1) distilling the biased rules from the deployed model into an additional patch model, and (2) removing these biased rules from the output of the deployed model during inference. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach, showcasing its superior performance in addressing fairness concerns in AI systems."

Unlike previous works, this research analyzes how model performance varies across different geographic regions, using four distinct districts in Portugal as test locations. The models are trained and tested under multiple dataset configurations to assess their generalization capability and adaptability to unseen wildfire occurrences. Results indicate that deep learning models (LSTM and BiLSTM) achieve a more consistent performance across regions, particularly in southern Portugal, where wildfires are harder to predict. Additionally, results also show that using region-specific data improves performance for certain areas, highlighting the importance of more localized training strategies."

By utilizing the CICDDoS2019 dataset, we cleaned, down-sampled, normalized and reduced dimensionality using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The PCA reduced the number of features from 86 to 30 which helps reduce the training complexity. Seven different ML models are investigated and analyzed with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The widely used dataset CICDDoS2019 was applied for training and testing of these models.

Despite their impressive performance, machine learning models are often perceived as “black boxes,“ making their adoption difficult. This is the case of health care area, where the lack of trust is undoubtedly a barrier to the application of those models in daily clinical practice. While metrics like accuracy, sensitivity, specificity are valuable to assess the global performance of a model, they provide little insight at the individual instance level (single patient). This highlights the importance of pointwise reliability assessment, evaluating whether a model can be reliable to classify a specific instance. This work aims to develop a systematic method for comparing a machine learning model pointwise reliability provided by different methods. Besides error rate quantification, this framework comprises t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding visualizations. Thus, different data driven methods for assessing pointwise reliability are compared. These methods address the problem based on two different perspectives: i) density principle; ii) local fit principle. The validation was performed in the context of cardiovascular secondary prevention supported by a real patient dataset (N=1544). The findings show that approaches integrating both density and local fit principles tend to surpass single principle methods, associating lower error rates to more reliable predictions."

    "abstract": "The presence of adversarial examples can cause SAR image classification systems to produce incorrect predictions, severely compromising their accuracy and robustness. However, existing adversarial example generation methods for SAR images often suffer from limited physical interpretability, low perturbation energy utilization, and insufficient perturbation stealthiness. To address the above issues, this paper proposes SAR-PMAE, a phase modulation-guided adversarial example generation method for SAR images. Specifically, to tackle the lack of physical interpretability, a phase modulation strategy based on the point target scattering model is employed, coupling adversarial perturbations with the EM scattering mechanism to enhance their physical interpretability; to improve perturbation energy utilization, a local focusing strategy is adopted, in which foreground targets are precisely segmented and centered via a watershed algorithm combined with morphological operations, concentrating perturbations in strong response regions and avoiding redundant energy dispersion into background clutter; and to enhance perturbation stealthiness, constraints are applied separately to the phase in the complex coherent domain, thereby maximally preserving SAR speckle statistics and improving perturbation concealment. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves an average untargeted attack success rate of 55.53% and a targeted attack success rate of 20.92% across ten classifiers based on CNN and Transformer architectures, while exhibiting strong attack transferability.

Specifically, a preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) method is used to accelerate matrix inversion in the linear estimation stage. Simulation results show that the PCG-OAMP detector provides better bit error rate (BER) performance compared to traditional detection methods in doubly selective channels."

    "abstract": "Terahertz (THz) communication has emerged as a critical technology for next-generation wireless communication systems due to its exceptionally wide bandwidths and ultrahigh data rates. However, channel estimation in THz bands faces severe challenges, especially in near-field regions where planarwave assumptions break down. Conventional compressive sensing (CS) and machine learning (ML) based channel estimation methods often struggle with near-field intricacies and large-scale antenna arrays, necessitating novel estimation techniques. Motivated by the success of autoencoder-based channel estimation approaches in end-to-end system design, this work proposes a novel deep neural network (DNN)-based THz channel estimation technique tailored for near-field THz communication systems with a large-scale Widely-Spaced Multi-Subarray (WSMS) architecture. By exploiting near-field properties and leveraging the spatial diversity provided by WSMS and large-scale arrays, the proposed framework achieved a $\\mathbf{6 ~ d B}$ improvement in normalised mean square error (NMSE). Simulation results confirm that this technique outperforms state-of-the-art channel estimation schemes, thus paving the way for more efficient and accurate near-field THz channel estimation in future wireless communication systems."

    "abstract": "Precise stability criteria are essential for vehicle handling control, but conventional methods based on tire adhesion limits or linear models often lack robustness across diverse scenarios. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel lateral stability criterion fusing phase plane analysis and RBF neural networks. The approach begins with an analysis of the vehicle’s stable state using the phase plane, followed by the division of the vehicle stability region employing the diamond method to generate a phase plane stability region database. Subsequently, the proposed phase plane-RBF stability criterion is constructed by leveraging the RBF neural network for nonlinear fitting of the stability region data, which is further refined through multiple rounds of optimization. Compared to traditional tire force and linear single-track model criteria, the proposed criterion demonstrates superior accuracy in identifying extreme conditions and enhanced adaptability across operational scenarios."

The model, designed without paper insulation, is based on a configuration of four stacked transformer core plates that enable the controlled simulation of fault scenarios over a temperature range from 200 to 800 °C through direct thermocouple measurements. Thus, core faults such as inter-lamination short circuits caused by circulating currents, as well as mechanical issues like a loose bushing bolt, can be emulated. Experimental validation was carried out using mineral oil, a liquid with well-established behavior and extensive field experience, ensuring that the model generates fault conditions consistent with real operational environments. A case study with a soybean-based natural ester further demonstrates the model’s adaptability to alternative insulating liquids. The proposed model offers a robust, scalable platform for advancing transformer fault diagnosis and supports the development of improved diagnostic techniques in the field of Dissolved Gas Analysis (DGA)."

    "abstract": "India is an agricultural dominated country where agriculture contribute major source of income and livelihood for people. Agriculture contributes major factor to the India’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP). However, the crop yields per hectares is very less if we compare it to international standard. It can be due to various reason as India is also a country which suffer natural calamities and flood every year which affect the crop production which indirectly or directly leads a huge loss for farmers which leads to increase suicide case of most of the farmers in India. So, deciding the correct crop in correct time with a correct amount of fertilizer can help the farmers to come out of difficulties. If farmer can predict the crop in advance, then it will be easy and beneficial to farmer. Government can also take proper planning and action if they can know the crop yield in advance. Government has various types of data available in terms of soil type, rainfall, natural calamities predictions which can be used to decide a proper recommendation system which can help the farmer to decide which crop will be beneficial for him based on the various deciding criteria like soil colour, pH, Nitrogen, Phosphorous, Potassium etc. For collecting the real-time data related to soil like composition of soil, humidity content of soil, temperature of the soil and nutrient available in the soil, system can utilize various sensors like FC-28 sensor, DHT11 sensor and JXBS-3001 sensor [6]. Along with the real time data from the field, system can also use data available on government like rainfall, calamities prediction to predict the best suitable crop for that soil condition This research paper summarizes the results obtained by various machine learning algorithm which are most commonly used method to predict the crop with their accuracy and suggested the best recommendation system."

GPS spoofing attacks, however, are a realistic threat with the potential to mislead drones in estimating incorrect positions, thus inducing navigation failures, illegal landings, and security intrusions. This study experimented with the vulnerability of drones to GPS spoofing attacks and examined various mitigation and detection strategies. A laboratory-controlled setup with hardware equipment, such as GPS receivers, software radio (SDRs), and machine learning techniques, was used for anomaly detection. The Drone Flight Path Controller interface was used for the real-time observation and evasion of GPS spoofing attacks. The resultant system accurately identified spoofed signals with 97% detection performance and initiated a return-to-home (RTH) mode with an average of 2.3 seconds of detection latency. The outcomes emphasize the need to integrate high-level security solutions to protect drones against GPS-based cyberattacks, along with enabling safe and reliable autonomous operation."

    "abstract": "Resonant Pressure Sensors (RPS) are key for high-precision MEMS pressure measurement, but traditional Off-Chip Temperature Sensors (OFTS) suffer heat conduction lag under rapid temperature change, limiting accuracy in aircraft rapid maneuvering. To address this bottleneck, this study proposes a novel RPS scheme integrating resonant and diode temperature-sensitive structures. By combining an On-Chip Integrated Temperature Sensor (OCITS) and a frequency-temperature dual-parameter 4th-order polynomial compensation algorithm, high-precision pressure measurement under rapid temperature change is achieved. A COMSOL multi-physics model compares OCITS and OFTS responses at 0.1 to 10 °C/min: at 1 °C/min, OCITS exhibits ≤50 ms delay (vs. 946 s for OFTS) with ≤0.3 °C tracking error; at 10 °C/min, OCITS maintains synchronization while OFTS loses validity (error >62.4 °C). Prototypes were fabricated via the DRIE bulk silicon process and tested under dynamic temperature-pressure conditions. Experiments show: OCITS achieves synchronous response at 10 °C/min， within −55 °C to 100 °C and 3.5 kPa to 285 kPa, comprehensive accuracy reaches 0.0038% full scale (FS) which is 3.68 times higher than that of OFTS (0.014% FS). This work addresses the pressure measurement bottleneck of aircraft during rapid maneuvering, providing a reliable solution for high-precision MEMS sensors in aerospace."

To this end, in collaboration with a prominent national-scale mobile network operator, we conduct, for the first time, a demand characterization and forecasting study that is based on multi-year and nationwide region-level mobile network traffic data. Specifically, we analyze the demand characterization of mobile and fixed wireless access (FWA) services at national and regional scales. Crucially, we introduce a clustering-driven methodology for national and regional mobile network demand forecasting at a yearly timescale. Our results highlight the significant diversity in region-level traffic characterization as well as differences between mobile and FWA services. Differently from prior work studying the effect of COVID-19 on mobile network traffic, we do not find any observable effect due to COVID-19 on region-scale traffic characterization. Our proposed clustering-driven methodology, besides being scalable, is shown to yield significant gains in accuracy around an order of magnitude relative to the baseline approach for both mobile and FWA service demand forecasting."

The proliferation of smart meters can alleviate this issue by providing abundant measurements at customer-end points in low-voltage (LV) networks; however, their voltage measurements cannot be directly incorporated into the MV-DSSE. This paper proposes a novel neuro-physics hybrid SE model for MV networks, incorporating smart meter voltage measurements from LV networks into MV-DSSE. In our approach, the physical SE model is adopted for the MV network, while a neural network (NN)-based model is trained to represent the relationship between the MV state variables and the LV network voltage measurements. The hybrid SE model does not require the LV network model, which is often unavailable to utility operators. The test results demonstrate that the proposed model enhances the accuracy and robustness of MV-DSSE by incorporating smart meter voltage measurements in LV networks."

    "abstract": "Under the influence of factors such as seasons, a mixed layer with a positive sound speed gradient will be formed near the sea surface of the deep ocean. In presence of this mixed layer, a surface duct is capable of achieving long-distance propagation of acoustic signal. In the surface duct, sound rays with small elevation angles can transmit over a longer distance with lower transmission loss than the bottom reflected rays. Bearing estimation error of the horizontal linear array will be generated when the incident acoustic signal has a steep elevation angle. Signal with small elevation angle can effectively reduce such error. When there is no mixed layer, as soon as the target enters the bottom reflected zone, the bearing estimation error increases rapidly. Moreover, the error will significantly increase as the target bearing becomes larger, seriously affecting the bearing estimation. However, when both the target and the array are located within the mixed layer, bearing estimation results will not significantly deviate from the true bearing when propagation range gets larger. Thus, the existence of the mixed layer can provide accurate and stable bearing estimation results within the bottom reflected zone."

Specifically, novel learning laws facilitate the rapid online updating of network weights, where the critic network approximates the value function while the actor network optimizes the control policy to minimize control cost. The proposed framework effectively compensates for disturbances and filtered error effects, ensuring that all tracking errors converge within a predefined time. Rigorous analysis establishes the predefined-time stability of the closed-loop system. Finally, comparative simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy."

Accurate estimation of these system parameters is essential for enabling real-time condition monitoring, high-efficiency operation, and advanced model-based control of LLC resonant converters. However, due to strong parameter coupling, high system nonlinearity, and unobservable topology transitions, performing accurate multi-parameter estimation for LLC converters remains considerably challenging, and has rarely been effectively solved in existing works. To address this issue, this study proposes a topology-cognizant machine learning (TCML), which explicitly embeds the converter’s discrete-time topology-dependent dynamics into a neural network architecture. In contrast to conventional PINN, TCML introduces a semi-supervised data reconstruction mechanism to infer system states at unobservable topological transitions, enabling consistent supervision across discontinuous dynamic regimes. This physics-guided structure compels the network to jointly satisfy observed data consistency and converter-specific physical laws, thereby achieving high-accuracy multi-parameter identification under a data sampling configuration compatible with commonly used microcontroller units (MCUs). Furthermore, the proposed method offers additional advantages, including reduced reliance on accurate parameter pre-estimation, nanosecond-scale digital twin capability, and online implementation, The effectiveness is verified through both simulations and experiments."

To enhance the stability of the grid-connected system, an optimization control strategy based on the sequential impedance model of virtual synchronous generator for grid connection was proposed. By improving the control strategy, the system is able to adapt to the changes in the grid state in real time. Compared with the traditional control method, the grid-forming system’s stability margin is greatly increased by the enhanced control technique, which also raises the phase in the low frequency range. The experimental findings demonstrate that the enhanced control approach can guarantee the system’s stable functioning and prevent unstable oscillations from occurring."

During phase one, 30 industrial software developers provided data over a period of 5 to 12 days as they worked, contributing 627 experience sampling responses and 207 end-of-workday survey responses. To gain further insight into their work, we interviewed 22 of these developers. During phase two, 131 additional professional developers responded to a survey to explore whether and how the results from phase one are seen across a larger population. Our analysis of the data found that (1) the ability of GenAI to help answer low-level technical questions in a timely way enables developers to see GenAI as a technical mentor, providing opportunities for developers to turn to tools rather than teammates; (2) developers perceive that GenAI can help them experience more focus and experience fewer flow disruptions; (3) GenAI can help developers pursue more meaningful conversations with their colleagues by shifting human interaction towards clarification, joint reasoning, and exploring alternative perspectives; and (4) in the presence of GenAI, developers report still seeking human-to-human interaction for contextual expertise, mentorship, and social connection. Together, these findings show <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">what changes</i>, <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">when it changes</i>, and <italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">what teams can do next</i> in response to this shift in team interaction dynamics, where GenAI increasingly handles routine technical queries and human conversations center on context, reasoning, and connection. Teams can adopt norms for delegating questions, sustain human judgment in complex decisions, and create space for expertise, mentorship, and connection, alongside increasing technical self-sufficiency."

This paper investigates secure down link transmission and rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) in a STAR-RIS-assisted integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system, focusing on the communication and sensing needs of future networks. We propose an optimization problem to maximize system secrecy energy efficiency (SEE) by jointly op timizing beamforming vectors, the common-stream secrecy rate for users, and the amplitude and phase of the STAR-RIS under various operational constraints. To address the challenges inherent in solving this non-convex optimization problem, primarily stemming from complex channel dynamics and the coupling of mixed variables, we introduce a novel mixture of experts rollback proximal policy optimization (MoE-RBPPO) approach. Additionally, we utilize maximum ratio transmission and zero forcing techniques for beamforming design. Simulation results indicate that the proposed MoE-RBPPO method significantly outperforms several baseline approaches in terms of SEE. For example, it achieves a SEE gain of up to 4.5% over MoE-PPO and up to 9.2% over PPO, with these gains observed under varying radar cross section values of the target. Meanwhile, the overall simulation findings further highlight the inherent advantages of STAR-RIS-enhanced ISAC systems and the benefits of RSMA over space division multiple access."

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) severity diagnosis is crucial for early detecting potential patients and adopting tailored interventions. Diagnosing PD based on facial expression is grounded in PD patients' “masked face” symptom and gains growing interest recently for its convenience and affordability. However, current facial expression-based approaches often rely on single type of expression which can lead to misdiagnosis, and ignore the class imbalance across different PD stages which degrades the prediction performance. Moreover, most existing methods focus on binary classification (i.e., PD / non-PD) rather than diagnosing the severity of PD. To address these issues, we propose a new facial expression-based method for PD severity diagnosis which integrates multiple facial expression features through attention-based feature fusion. Moreover, we mitigate the class imbalance problem via an adaptive class balancing strategy which dynamically adjusts the contribution of training samples based on their class distribution and classification difficulty. Experimental results demonstrate the promising performance of the proposed method for PD severity diagnosis, as well as the efficacy of attention-based feature fusion and adaptive class balancing."

Reconnaissance, or briefly known as information gathering, is a key stage for threat actors, often relying on open-source intelligence (OSINT) to collect sensitive and extensive data on targets. In response to this challenge, this study introduces reconCTI, a command-line tool built using Python for Linux systems. The tool is designed to search for sensitive data leaks across both surface web and dark web platforms. It allows users to input specific keywords, scan multiple sites at once, and then assess the findings by referencing the MITRE ATT&CK framework. The results are compiled into a threat report that also includes possible mitigation strategies. reconCTI is intended to support both cybersecurity professionals and individuals in identifying risks early and taking appropriate action."

Furthermore, without increasing the footprint, the filter order is raised from 11 to 16 by embedding additional shunt resonators beneath existing ones, resulting in a significantly sharper roll-off. The fabricated prototype achieves >45 dBc suppression across 22.5 – 38 GHz, with 20 dBc attenuation at the 10% band edge, while maintaining a compact size of 20.96 mm × 7.535 mm × 1.778 mm.

Although various KT mechanisms have been developed in the literature, a unified analysis of their effectiveness is still lacking, leaving researchers without a systematic framework to guide the design of ETO algorithms. To fill this gap, we propose modeling KT mechanisms as distinct functions with unknown parameters, offering a coherent view to accommodate our limited understanding of ideal KT processes. This transforms the design of any KT mechanism into a mathematical task of parameter estimation, enabling its effectiveness to be evaluated through Bayesian estimation. Consequently, the success of KT, like accurate parameter estimation, depends on either strong prior understanding or a wealth of empirical data. Finally, we utilize the Fisher information to emphasize the importance of combining prior knowledge with empirical evidence to enhance the estimation efficiency, highlighting the potential of hybridizing both a priori and a posteriori insights to design effective KT mechanisms in ETO."

However, existing deep learning-based change detection methods often struggle to simultaneously model fine-grained spatial and temporal information, leading to suboptimal detection accuracy. To tackle this challenge, we model and refine the spatial and temporal features of bitemporal images separately with two different branches, and propose a spatial-temporal dual interpolation network (STDINet). In the spatial branch, we use interpolation to enhance spatial details, while an efficient network leveraging conditionally parameterized convolution extracts refined spatial features. In the temporal branch, we generate a pseudo video sequence for each image pair to construct a progressive representation of change and better characterize the temporal relationships between bitemporal images. Then the temporal branch is designed based on a bidirectional long short-term memory network to capture the refined temporal features. Finally, to obtain the final change map enriched with refined spatial and temporal semantics, we propose a feature adaptive weighting module to fuse the outputs of the two branches. Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative experiments conducted on three representative datasets, compared against seven advanced change detection methods, validate the effectiveness of refined spatialtemporal modeling and highlight the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed STDINet."

    "abstract": "In an increasingly fragmented digital media landscape, understanding the sustained acceptance of legacy media demands models that can effectively align heterogeneous platform representations and audience behaviors. Traditional techniques often struggle with poor generalizability and lack contextual awareness, particularly in cross-platform environments. To address these limitations, we propose MediaAdaptNet, a deep representation alignment framework that leverages a cross-platform attention mechanism to capture acceptance signals of legacy media across diverse online ecosystems. Our architecture includes two pivotal components: LEGEND (Latent Engagement Generative Encoder for Narrative Dynamics) and TRAILS (Temporal Reasoning for Acceptance Inference in Legacy Systems). LEGEND integrates multimodal content encoding, user trait embeddings, and graphical propagation to dynamically model audience acceptance behaviors. It employs topic-guided attention and structured representation projection for user behavior grouping to enable semantically grounded predictions over time. TRAILS complements LEGEND by introducing a graph-based temporal reasoning strategy that tracks cross-episode user-media interactions. It utilizes episodic memory, hierarchical segmentation, and structural alignment to infer stable, causal acceptance patterns while enhancing interpretability. Evaluated on multiple real-world datasets, MediaAdaptNet achieves substantial improvements, with a 12% increase in F1-score and an 18% boost in cross-domain retrieval R-precision over standard baselines. Ablation studies further validate the complementary strengths of LEGEND and TRAILS, demonstrating robust performance even under content noise and platform shifts. Our work contributes a scalable, interpretable, and empirically validated solution for legacy media acceptance discovery, advancing research at the intersection of digital media analytics, audience modeling, and deep learning."

    "abstract": "Multi-object navigation (MON) tasks involve sequentially locating multiple targets in an unknown environment, requiring global long-term planning under incomplete information. This necessitates that the agent dynamically balance immediate actions and long-term rewards while considering both local adaptability and global foresight. However, current methods overly focus on local path optimization, which leads to slower convergence in sparse reward settings and increases the risk of deadlocks or trap states. The core challenge of MON lies in the deformation of the shared decision space, where independent optimization leads to redundant and overlapping paths. Thus, path planning requires dynamic, cross-task optimization rather than simple subtask aggregation. To minimize overall effort, the optimization process should adaptively balance task contributions through weight adjustment. Thus, we propose the Goal-oriented Dynamic Weight Optimization (GDWO) algorithm. GDWO integrates target-specific value loss functions into a unified optimization framework and dynamically adjusts weights through gradient-based updates. To prevent over-optimization, weights are normalized during training according to navigation success rates, prioritizing more challenging targets. This adaptive mechanism effectively addresses the challenge of sparse rewards and improves convergence efficiency. By leveraging this mechanism, GDWO unifies multiple objectives within a unified decision space, achieving efficient optimization and balancing short-term gains with long-term goals. Additionally, we introduce two auxiliary modules: prior knowledge-based navigation and frontier-aware exploration to further enhance GDWO's performance. Experimental results on the Gibson and Matterport3D datasets demonstrate that GDWO achieves improvements in key metrics for MON tasks. It optimizes path planning, reduces exploration costs, and enhances navigation efficiency, enabling the agent to perform tasks more effectively in complex environments."

This article first introduces the architecture of IRS-aided systems and highlights real-world use cases where PSI delivery becomes a critical bottleneck. It then reviews current PSI compression approaches, outlining their limitations in terms of adaptability and scalability.

This paper adopts a phase difference method to calculate the IF curve, improving its calculation accuracy. Subsequently, a segmented fitting dualthreshold decision classifier is constructed to distinguish sinusoidal frequency modulation types.

These problems place higher demands on existing dynamic multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (DMOEAs), requiring them to address the dual challenges of large-scale search spaces and dynamic environmental changes. To this end, this paper proposes a large-scale DMOEA based on constraint-guided diffusion model (DM-LSDMOEA). This proposed method, for the first time to our best knowledge, integrates historical population search experience with the hierarchical sampling mechanism of diffusion learning, enabling the learning of change patterns between neighboring Pareto-optimal solutions in historical environments. Through an explicit dual-constraint guided diffusion learning process, DM-LSDMOEA injects decision boundary and historical convergence guidance information into each reverse denoising step, so that the generated solutions progressively converge to the Pareto-optimal solutions of a new environment. In addition, a diversity maintenance-based inference generation mechanism is designed, which uses dynamic noise strength adjustment and multiple independent Gaussian samplings to rapidly generate diverse solutions, providing a highquality initial population for the new environment. Comparative experiments on the DF test suite demonstrate that DM-LSDMOEA achieves superior performance on LSDMOPs ranging from 30 to 600 dimensions."

In addition to traditional time-series approaches, incorporating process analytics provides a deeper understanding of energy consumption patterns during a disruptive event. This paper analyzes the behavioral interrelationships of various natural gas demand markets— residential, commercial, industrial, electric power, and transportation—across short-, medium-, and long-term planning horizons. Using monthly gas consumption data from January 2001 to May 2024, we apply Complete Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (CEEMD) to extract intrinsic demand cycles and explore their co-movements. To enhance interpretability, we introduce a process mining perspective that treats demand data as event logs, uncovering structural shifts in market behavior due to COVID-19. Our findings reveal significant post-pandemic changes in inter-market dynamics, particularly in the strategic horizon, and highlight the value of integrating event-driven process insights with empirical forecasting.

Large Language Models (LLMs), like ChatGPT, provide large-scale AI-supported solutions for nutritional planning, physical activity prescription, and behavioral treatment. Their safety, accuracy, and effectiveness, nonetheless, have to be tested. Objective: This systematic review introduces the potential of LLMs in the treatment of obesity and their advantages, disadvantages, and ethics. Methods: The PubMed, Scopus, and IEEE Xplore databases were searched from 2023 to 2025 for peer-reviewed journal articles on the use of LLMs for weight management following PRISMA standards. Results: The promise of LLMs was discovered to discover individualized diet and exercise regimens, promote user engagement, and provide pharmacotherapeutic management of obesity. But there are issues of AI-generated advice reliability, user input quality dependence, absence of human control, and ethical issues like data privacy and accountability.

    "abstract": "The stock market's complexity makes it a challenging yet compelling area for predictive modeling. Accurate predictions can greatly benefit investment and economic decision-making. In this study, \"Stock Market Prediction Leveraging Deep Learning Techniques\", we explore and compare the effectiveness of different neural network architectures— Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs)—in forecasting stock prices. By leveraging the unique strengths of each architecture, the aim is to identify the best model for stock market prediction. CNNs excel at recognizing spatial patterns, RNNs handle sequential data well, and LSTMs manage long-term dependencies effectively. This comparative approach provides a comprehensive analysis of their performance differences and similarities. Grid Search Optimization is implemented with three optimizers—Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, and RMSprop—to find the optimal configuration for each model. Performance is evaluated using R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> (R-Squared), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), offering insights into model accuracy and predictive error.

    "abstract": "Customer segmentation is critical for tailoring marketing campaigns to specific consumer needs, enhancing engagement, and maximizing business profitability. This study integrates Recency-Frequency (RF) analysis with the K-Means clustering algorithm to classify customers of \"Ramallah Outfit\" into distinct behavioral segments. The Monetary (M) component was excluded because spending levels can sometimes be misleading high or low expenditures do not always reflect true loyalty or engagement. While monetary data may indicate how much a customer spends, it does not necessarily correlate with the frequency or recency of purchases, which are more reliable indicators of customer behavior and engagement. Excluding the Monetary component allows for a clearer focus on customer retention and loyalty. A high spender might make only occasional large purchases, whereas a customer with frequent smaller purchases could be more engaged and loyal. By focusing on Recency and Frequency, the analysis more accurately captures ongoing engagement, providing actionable insights for marketing. Using a unique first-hand dataset, the model achieved a clustering accuracy of 99.47%, effectively segmenting customers into actionable clusters: Gold (34.4%), Bronze (35.2%), and Silver (30.4%). The results demonstrate the effectiveness of this refined approach in optimizing marketing efforts and fostering customer loyalty."

    "abstract": "Electrical stimulation virtual vibration is widely used in fields like virtual reality and medical rehabilitation. However, its parameter optimization still relies on subjective psychological evaluation. This approach lacks objective quantitative criteria. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the neural response relationship between low-frequency vibration stimulation and electrical stimulation using EEG technology, providing quantitative theoretical support for optimizing electrical stimulation parameters. This paper employs a custom-built electrical stimulation system (incorporating a flexible electrode array) to conduct tactile EEG experiments with 42 participants under both electrical stimulation and vibration stimulation conditions. We extract beta-band power spectral density (PSD) and regional permutation entropy (PE) features for the two types of stimulation. Results demonstrate that under vibration stimulation, PSD at C6 and T8 channels exhibit positive correlation with frequency, while PE in the right central region and right temporal-frontal-parietal region shows positive correlation with amplitude. During electrical stimulation, corresponding neural features follow analogous patterns. For both modalities, PSD-frequency correlations (Pearson's r > 0.84) and PE-amplitude correlations (r > 0.68) achieve statistically significant levels. Finally, we conducted classification experiments using a k-nearest neighbor (kNN) classifier, with EEG features from vibratory stimulation as the training set and EEG features from electrical stimulation as the test set. The results show that the accuracy reached 66.7% for the frequency discrimination task, while the average accuracy for the amplitude discrimination task was 67.9%. These findings demonstrate significant similarity in neural signatures elicited by low-frequency vibration stimulation (1-15 Hz) and electrical stimulation. Our study provides new insights for quantifying the refinement of electrical stimulation parameters."

We then introduce an ingenious transformation that jointly optimizes phase coupling and energy splitting using the same phase optimization framework.

    "abstract": "With the growing emphasis on sustainable manufacturing, green scheduling has gained prominence from practitioners and researchers in the industry manufacturing enterprises. This article addresses the hybrid flow shop scheduling problem with peak power consumption constraints (HFSPP) to minimize makespan and total energy consumption (TEC), while ensuring real-time power usage does not exceed a predefined threshold. A hybrid framework, LLM-MODPPO-Evo, is proposed to solve HFSPP by simultaneously minimizing makespan and TEC. The framework consists of three parts: 1) large language models (LLMs) are introduced to automatically design algorithms and generate initial solutions; 2) evolutionary algorithm based on adaptive evolutionary strategy of covariance matrix (CMA-ES) is adopted to diversify solutions; 3) multi-objective distributed proximal policy optimization (MODPPO) is utilized to refine solutions. Firstly, initial scheduling algorithms generated by LLMs via tailored prompt frameworks produce diverse heuristic operators and decoding methods. Secondly, after screening feasible algorithms and producing the initial schemes, these solutions are extended through an EA to create a population of the improved schemes. Finally, the populations are adaptively optimized by MODPPO to yield the best Pareto-optimal solution set to balance makespan and TEC under peak power consumption constraints. The comparative results demonstrate that the framework outperforms that of the existing algorithms in solving the HFSPP."

The primary objective is to determine how to classify Arabic tweets as positive or negative. The analysis was based on a dataset of 4,546 Arabic tweets obtained from Kaggle. The word embedding model (e.g. Word2Vec and GloVe) was used to facilitate the analysis because its semantic meaning and relations of words were better than what was provided through traditional methods like TF-IDF. To analyze the data, some of the classification techniques that were used include logistic regression, decision trees, and support vector machines. The results of the study showed that SVM has the best accuracy at 87%, followed by decision trees at 80%, and then logistic regression at 85%. This demonstrates that word embedding simulation models are effective for Arabic sentiment analysis on social networking sites. With 80% decision trees, word embedding greatly aided pyramid computing’s divergence modulation, which allows for sentiment and mining analyses of Middle Eastern users’ social activities. SVM performed well at the more sensitive and sophisticated tasks of opinion and market research analysis involving the Arabic language. Even so, a more precise classification can be performed with the application of deep learning algorithms or a hybrid model in future work."

    "abstract": "Globally, heart failure is the leading cause of death. One of the first diagnostic techniques for examining the state of the heart is cardiac auscultation. The heart's mechanical activity, which is triggered by biopotentials produced by the Sino-Atrium (SA) node, results in non-stationary and non-deterministic signals known as Heart Sound Signals (HSS). When captured by an electronic stethoscope, the graphical representation of HSS is known as phonocardiogram (PCG). PCG can provide very helpful diagnostic information when evaluating a range of cardiac abnormalities, like valvular heart disease, irregular heartbeat, cardiac decompensation, and anatomical defects in the heart. PCG is composed of the first and second (S1, S2) heart sounds, which are frequently the two loudest heart sounds. In both diseased and non-pathological situations, the PCG signal may comprise murmurs, the third and fourth cardiac sounds (S3), and other odd sounds like clicks, snaps, and rubs.PCG analysis is effective for non-invasive cardiovascular disease diagnosis. The thesis is on creating an Automatic Computerised Auscultation (ACA) for effective cardiac state monitoring. ACA provides diagnostic and prognostic data in a non-invasive, affordable, fast, and precise manner, helping clinicians detect cardiac sickness early and prevent cardiovascular disease deaths.Following the same steps for classifying heart sounds, the suggested RNN+LSTM approach deals with classifying heart murmurs as harmless (normal) and pathological (abnormal). The classification AUC for the optimal murmur classification combination was $\\color {Orange}{\\text{93}}{\\text{.69}}\\% $."

    "abstract": "Dengue fever prevention and control is a critical task in subtropical and tropical countries. Public participation is widespread, with measures such as clearing water from vases and wearing long sleeves and long pants when outdoors to avoid bites. Public health agencies are implementing measures such as widespread insecticide spraying, releasing sterilized male mosquitoes, and distributing testing kits. However, the annual dengue fever infection rate remains unchecked. Dengue fever peaks between May and October and causes flu-like symptoms such as high fever, severe headache, and body aches. In extreme cases, it can lead to bleeding, difficulty breathing, and even death. This case study focuses on leveraging artificial intelligence technology to develop a public-engaged dengue fever prevention and control system, enabling citizens to actively participate in dengue fever prevention and control, both during outdoor activities and at home. The approach involves deploying multiple models trained using the ResNeXt-101 residual network framework on a public dengue fever prevention and AI control platform. The system is designed to instantly upload mosquito photos, identify the mosquito species, and provide alerts indicating the risk of infection and the number of cases in the area, thereby increasing public engagement and improving prevention and control effectiveness. The government, through the platform’s integration with the city’s extensive dengue monitoring infrastructure, can conduct targeted area disinfection and distribute dengue testing kits after a case occurs, enabling early detection and treatment. Implementing this system minimizes environmental impact, enabling targeted dengue prevention and control."

Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on multiple benchmarks, particularly under severe degradation."

    "abstract": "The partially separable functions (PSF) model is commonly adopted in dynamic MRI reconstruction, as is the underlying signal model in many reconstruction methods including the ones relying on low-rank assumptions. Even though the PSF model offers a parsimonious representation of the dynamic MRI signal in several applications, its representation capabilities tend to decrease in scenarios where voxels present different temporal/spectral characteristics at different spatial locations. In this work we account for this limitation by proposing a new model, called spatiotemporal maps (STMs), that leverages autoregressive properties of (k, t)-space. The STM model decomposes the spatiotemporal MRI signal into a sum of components, each one consisting of a product between a spatial function and a temporal function that depends on the spatial location. The proposed model can be interpreted as an extension of the PSF model whose temporal functions are independent of the spatial location. We show that spatiotemporal maps can be efficiently computed from autocalibration data by using advanced signal processing and randomized linear algebra techniques, enabling STMs to be used as part of many reconstruction frameworks for accelerated dynamic MRI. As proof-of-concept illustrations, we show that STMs can be used to reconstruct both 2D single-channel animal gastrointestinal MRI data and 3D multichannel human functional MRI data."

    "abstract": "Transfer-based attacks craft adversarial examples on white-box surrogate models and directly deploy them against black-box target models, offering practical query-free threat scenarios. While flatness-enhanced methods have recently emerged to improve transferability by enhancing the loss surface flatness of adversarial examples, their divergent flatness definitions and heuristic attack designs suffer from unexamined optimization limitations and missing theoretical foundation, thus constraining their effectiveness and efficiency. This work exposes the severely imbalanced exploitation-exploration dynamics in flatness optimization, establishing the first theoretical foundation for flatness-based transferability and proposing a principled framework to overcome these optimization pitfalls. Specifically, we systematically unify fragmented flatness definitions across existing methods, revealing their imbalanced optimization limitations in over-exploration of sensitivity peaks or over-exploitation of local plateaus. To resolve these issues, we rigorously formalize average-case flatness and transferability gaps, proving that enhancing zeroth-order average-case flatness minimizes cross-model discrepancies. Building on this theory, we design a Maximin Expected Flatness (MEF) attack that enhances zeroth-order average-case flatness while balancing flatness exploration and exploitation. Extensive evaluations across 33 models and 43 current transfer-based attacks demonstrate MEF’s superiority: it surpasses the state-of-the-art PGN attack by 4% in attack success rate at half the computational cost and achieves 8% higher success rate under the same budget. When combined with input augmentation, MEF attains 15% additional gains against defense-equipped models, establishing new robustness benchmarks.

Because of that, many international, national, and regional agencies are funding and promoting interdisciplinary based projects. This development underlines the need to integrate workplace dynamics into learning, ensuring that education remains aligned with the realities and demands of the professional environment. In recent years, European Union has been shedding light on advancing asphalt pavement engineering through a series of research projects under the umbrella of Horizon 2020 and the European Regional Development Fund. In light of these developments, there is a growing need for advanced master's programs that introduce students - the future workforce, to industry-applied processes while maintaining strong connections to the world of work through close cooperation between the education sector and industry. This paper aims to investigate whether asphalt pavement-based master's programs exist and the need for such programs. Particularly, this study aims to review the existing joint and cross-country master's programs offering specific, transversal, and multidisciplinary courses for pavement engineering. The review is based on a global search of university programs and a detailed examination of their curricula, by performing an online search assisted by the generative AI tool ChatGPT. Finally it proposes the need for a joint master's program relevant to pavement engineering with a focus on technological advancements and sustainability."

It is trained with various data augmentation and optimized with some model optimization strategies to maximize the system's robustness. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed YOLOv8-based model achieves remarkable accuracy and stability across diverse environmental conditions.

The preliminary quizzes provided to students include both practical and theoretical questions based on the course curriculum. The course instructors use these results to assess each student's knowledge level and to define for them an individual learning path. However, the information technologies (IT) industry is rapidly changing nowadays. New technologies such as artificial intelligence, blockchain, internet of things (loT), extended reality, digital twins, etc. provide new services for our daily life every year. In such a continuously changing context, the IT Foundations course does not cover all cutting-edge technologies, focusing on the previously defined course curriculum. Also, educators of the course have limited resources to continuously monitor cutting-edge technologies and add them to the course program. In this paper, we provide the integration of AI and blockchain technologies into the educational process for the IT Foundations course.

Unlike conventional approaches that require additional controllers or complex parameter tuning, the proposed scheme utilizes the inherent harmonic decomposition capabilities of modular multi-sector architectures to facilitate harmonic current suppression. The currents of three sectors are phase-shifted by 15°, 30°, and 45° electrical degrees with respect to a reference sector, forming a virtual quadruple three-phase machine with angle displacements. The reconstructed currents are further processed using vector space decomposition, which separates the fundamental and harmonic components, and enables independent regulation of each subspace using only proportional-integral controllers. Experimental validation on a modular four-sector machine confirms the effectiveness of the proposed method."

The circuit integrates a voltage divider with selector circuits to perform multiplications using multibit weights ranging from -1 to +1 and analog signals. Additionally, charge-domain average circuits accumulate, sum, and average these multiplications sequentially. For this study, a new convolution operator was designed to compute the convolution product over a pixel using a multibit 3x3 mask. Subsequently, a computing circuit was developed to perform 30 convolution operations in parallel per clock cycle. The charge-domain average circuit was synthesized in 180 nm CMOS technology, and post layout simulation results indicate its capability to convolve a 32×32 grayscale pixel image in 5.12μs while consuming only 117 μW, achieving an efficiency of 22154 1b-TOPS/W (1-bit tera-operations per second per watt) with a similarity to ideal processing of up to 99%."

    "abstract": "As the core mechanism of the DeepSeek-V3 model, Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA) significantly reduces the computational complexity by low-rank matrix factorization. However, the memory access overhead and computing bottlenecks are becoming increasingly prominent as the sequence length continues to grow. The performance of this mechanism is severely limited by the efficiency of memory access. Meanwhile, existing research on MLA acceleration mostly relies on NVIDIA GPUs and the CUDA ecosystem, which significantly constrains the expansion of its application scenario. Given this, this paper proposes Many-Core Optimized Multi-Head Latent Attention (MC-MLA), which is committed to achieving efficient parallel acceleration of MLA on a many-core RISC-V architecture. The scheme includes two core optimizations: (1) KV Reuse-Oriented Parallel Dataflow Optimization: For the matrix absorption characteristics in MLA, we design an online transposition dataflow that absorbs value matrices into key matrices. This approach ensures efficient reuse of KV-Cache while achieving pipeline overlap between data movement and computation, thereby reducing memory access pressure and hiding latency for KV-Cache load operations. (2) Balanced Tree-like Inter-Core Reduction Algorithm based on Semaphore: This algorithm resolves workload imbalance in high-parallel scenarios, significantly promoting many-core collaboration efficiency. The experimental results demonstrate that MC-MLA can enhance the computational efficiency of MLA under various configurations of batch size, number of heads, and sequence length. Final comparison results reveal that MC-MLA effectively alleviates key bottlenecks: load imbalance in reduction operations and NoC congestion in memory accesses, achieving up to <tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$1.69 \\times$</tex> performance improvement and 76 % of bandwidth utilization. This competitive implementation provides a reference for MLA adaptation and performance optimization on similar many-core architectures."

Building upon existing sea clutter simulation methods, a novel simulation method tailored for moving platforms is proposed. The proposed method comprehensively takes into account oceanographic factors, sea surface scattering mechanisms, high-resolution sea clutter statistical characteristics, and the illumination geometry associated with moving platforms. The simulation results produced by the proposed method exhibit amplitude distributions, spectral characteristics, and structural trends that are consistent with the theoretical analysis."

    "abstract": "We introduce a modular, hybrid decoding architecture that separates motion tracking (“where”) and image reconstruction (“what”) to recover high-resolution visual stimuli from noisy retinal ganglion cell (RGC) spike trains under naturalistic fixational drift. Our “where” network learns to infer instantaneous eye displacement directly from recent spike-image inputs via a compact CNN+GRU pipeline, amortizing the diffusion-pluslikelihood update of Bayesian filters into a single feed-forward pass. Conditioned on these shift estimates, a “what” network uses 3D convolutions over aligned spike volumes to reconstruct the static image with per-pixel probability outputs. On synthetic letter stimuli, the hybrid decoder achieves over 90% pixel accuracy, close to an ideal Bayesian baseline-while running over an order of magnitude faster. By embedding principled motion priors into a deep-learning framework, our approach combines interpretability, robustness, and real-time performance. This work suggests a general template for biologically inspired neural decoding: explicitly factor latent state and content inference, train specialized modules in sequence, and tightly integrate them in an online loop. Future directions include natural scenes, spiketiming dynamics, and cortical population recordings."

The hierarchical autoencoder is composed of an encoder to extract latent features and a decoder to reconstruct the inputs. The Encoder extracted hierarchical features from every layer to detecting the unknown targets in the feature space based on distance, and the feature from the last layer was exploited to classify the known samples. Our method was validated on measured HRRP data and the results showed its superior performance over other methods, indicating its potentials in the realistic application of HRRP target recognition in the open world."

We present a surveillance video-based face recognition pipeline and evaluate 16 model-detector combinations by pairing state-of-the-art face recognition models (ArcFace with ResNet, ArcFace with MobileNet, AdaFace, and Sub-center Contrastive Distillation model) with four detectors (MTCNN and three RetinaFace variants). Testing was conducted on benchmark datasets and a custom multi-view video dataset of 48 students recorded using four cameras at varied positions and distances. AdaFace with RetinaFace (ResNet) achieved the highest accuracy and robustness under real-world conditions. We also introduce FaceTrack, a lightweight tracking algorithm combining the IoU-based motion model from SORT with the embedding-based matching of Deep SORT, improving stability and ID consistency without the overhead of deep appearance models. Pipeline optimizations such as detection resizing and coordinate mapping further reduced inference time by about 50%.

However, traditional methods often struggle with LSMaOPs due to subjective weight allocation and insufficient diversity capture, making it difficult to fully reflect the complexity and diversity of these problems. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on overlapping grouping of objective guided variables (MaOEA-SOG). The algorithm categorizes decision variables into diversity and convergence variables through interaction analysis and dynamically adjusts groupings to match different stages of population evolution. It also optimizes interaction analysis by weighting interaction indicators to enhance grouping rationality. Experiments on LSMaOPs and Walking Fish Group (WFG) test suites demonstrate that MaOEA-SOG effectively balances solution diversity and convergence, outperforming state-of-the-art algorithms and showing strong adaptability and optimization efficiency."

Key components of the calibration are the energy scale and the core line spread function, both of which vary with photon energy. A major issue in the calibration of high-resolution spectrometers is locating good calibrators with well-known, stable intrinsic line shapes. Neutral fluorescence is widely used, but inner-shell transitions in neutral atoms often exhibit complex, poorly documented line shapes that vary with excitation conditions. Here we present empirical measurements of K-shell transitions in neutral O and F below 1 keV using an engineering model XRISM calorimeter array, an electron bombardment modulated X-ray source, and an Electron Beam Ion Trap (EBIT) to provide a precise energy reference. In addition, we report measurements of the Mo Lα complex with the Transition-Edge Microcalorimeter Spectrometer (TEMS), which reveal strong satellite structure and sensitivity of the line shape to the incident exciting spectrum. Together, these results demonstrate the need for empirical line-shape models, highlight the non-stationary nature of neutral fluorescence features, and define a path toward developing transfer standards for XRISM and future precision instruments such as Athena/X-IFU."

Compared with uniform arrays, the nonuniformity of sine-type arrays includes both larger and smaller inter-element spacing, which is more reasonable for wideband requirements, and the expanded virtual elements allow for increased degrees of freedom. In two patterns, Structure 1 connects multiple different delay channels only to the first antenna, while Structure 2 connects the same delay channels to each antenna.

This paper further uses the chaotic evolution optimization (CEO) to optimize threshold parameters to improve performance of FrEn, and proposes chaotic evolution optimization-FrEn (CEO-FrEn).

    "abstract": "Complex electromagnetic environments, often containing multiple jammers with different jamming patterns, produce non-uniform jamming power across the frequency spectrum. This spectral non-uniformity directly induces severe distortion in the target’s high resolution range profile (HRRP), consequently compromising the performance and reliability of conventional HRRP-based target recognition methods. This paper proposes a novel, end-to-end trained network for robust radar target recognition. The core of our model is a Complex-valued Frequency Attention (CFA) module that operates directly on the complex spectrum of the received echo. The CFA module learns to generate an adaptive frequency-domain filter, assigning lower weights to bands corrupted by strong jamming while preserving critical target information in cleaner bands. The filtered spectrum is then fed into a classifier backbone for recognition. Experimental results on simulated HRRP data with various jamming combinations demonstrate our method’s superiority. Notably, under severe jamming conditions, our model achieves a recognition accuracy nearly 9% higher than traditional modelbased approaches, all while introducing negligible computational overhead. This highlights its exceptional performance and robustness in challenging jamming environments."

    "abstract": "Continual Learning (CL) is essential in dynamic environments, such as biodiversity monitoring, due to the continuous emergence of new species or changes in their distribution over time. A major challenge in CL is catastrophic forgetting, where a model loses performance on previously learned classes as it learns new ones. One common approach to mitigate this issue is replay, in which samples from previous tasks are reintroduced during training. We investigate how Active Learning (AL) can improve replay strategies for the classification of plant species in a class-incremental learning setting. Specifically, we compare two AL-based sampling methods: selecting samples with the lowest confidence and those with the highest confidence, with a baseline random sampling strategy. The results show that while all methods achieve similar final accuracy, AL-based strategies significantly reduce catastrophic forgetting. High-confidence sampling reduces forgetting by 11.9 percentage points, while low-confidence sampling achieves a reduction of 9.2 percentage points compared to random sampling. We apply CL in a real-world scenario rather than a benchmark dataset, demonstrating its practical relevance for dynamic and evolving environments. Hence, our approach contributes to biodiversity monitoring, with the potential to support the development of a biodiversity index for tracking species diversity over time."

Although privacy-preserving digital credentials provide strong guarantees such as anonymity and minimal disclosure, these benefits are compromised if holders must simultaneously present physical identification (e.g., government issued IDs) to establish ownership. To securely bind digital credentials to their physical holders while preserving privacy, a new protocol called card-based anonymous credentials (cbAC) was proposed by Hesse et al. (USENIX Security'23). However, this approach faces two significant drawbacks: the size of the communication during credential presentation scales linearly with the number of disclosed attributes, and it lacks revocability, which is essential for internal governance, including identity management and accountability. In this paper, we bridge the above gap by first introducing a constant-size two-party proof of knowledge protocol in asymmetry settings, where there exists a disparity in storage and computational resources between the two parties. Furthermore, building upon this two-party proof of knowledge protocol and utilizing signatures with randomizable keys, we meticulously design a cbAC scheme that is both efficient and capable of supporting revocation. We formalize all notions and conduct a rigorous security proof of the proposed construction. Finally, we present benchmarks from our implementation to illustrate the better than-state-of-the-art performance and features of our solutions."

On top of it, the Platform Adaptation Layer supplies bidirectional adapters that map the universal schema to proprietary data structures and APIs of individual tools, enabling loss-aware conversions and extensibility when direct one-to-one mappings are not available. The framework further incorporates versioning and update mechanisms to ensure lifecycle traceability and consistency management of standardized digital humans. Collectively, these design choices lower migration costs, mitigate semantic fragmentation, and allow digital standard humans to function as reusable “standard resources” that can flow coherently through product design, verification, and evaluation stages—ultimately improving the efficiency and fidelity of ergonomics simulation workflows."

    "abstract": "Naturalistic recordings capture audio in real-world environments where participants behave naturally without interference from researchers or experimental protocols. Naturalistic long-form recordings extend this concept by capturing spontaneous and continuous interactions over extended periods, often spanning hours or even days, in participants’ daily lives. Naturalistic recordings have been extensively used to study children’s behaviors, including how they interact with others in their environment, in the fields of psychology, education, cognitive science, and clinical research. These recordings provide an unobtrusive way to observe children in real-world settings beyond controlled and constrained experimental environments. Advancements in speech technology and machine learning (ML) have provided an initial step for researchers to automatically and systematically analyze large-scale naturalistic recordings of children. Despite the imperfect accuracy of ML models, these tools still offer valuable opportunities to uncover important insights into children’s cognitive and social development. Several critical speech technologies involved include speaker diarization, vocalization classification, word count estimate from adults, speaker verification, and language diarization for code switching. Most of these technologies have been primarily developed for adults, and speech technologies applied to children specifically are still vastly underexplored. To fill this gap, we discuss current progress, challenges, and opportunities in advancing these technologies to analyze naturalistic recordings of children during early development (<3 years of age). We strive to inspire the signal processing community and foster interdisciplinary collaborations to further develop this emerging technology and address its unique challenges and opportunities."

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are vulnerable to multi-turn jailbreak attacks like Crescendo, which exploit context retention to bypass safety mechanisms and generate harmful outputs. This study is among the first to address the gap in understanding vulnerabilities of LLMs released after 2024 by reproducing the Crescendo attack on six recent models. We introduce two novel mitigation strategies—prompt hardening and LLM-as-guardrail—evaluated via Attack Success Rates (ASRs) across 15 tasks. Our contributions include these mitigation strategies, a comprehensive vulnerability assessment, and an open-source framework shared under the MIT License to foster collaborative AI safety research. Findings reveal that Llama-3.1-8b-Instruct (Llama 3.1) was the most resistant, achieving the lowest ASRs in 9 of 15 categories due to robust safety alignment, while DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B (DeepSeek R1) was highly vulnerable with 1.0 ASRs in 13 categories. Prompt hardening significantly outperformed LLM-as-guardrail, reducing ASRs effectively across models, though DeepSeek R1 maintained 1.0 ASRs despite mitigations. These results underscore prompt hardening as a superior defense, enhancing LLM security for safer deployment in critical domains like healthcare, education, and public policy."

Based on the geometric relationships among high peaks in multiple RangeDoppler Maps (RDMs), a registration method searching for the minimum error in the intersection distance space is proposed. Furthermore, by employing a unit-based range-Doppler domain registration method, incoherent fusion from multiple sources is achieved, enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for target detection. Additionally, compared to traditional methods such as spatial direct search registration detection methods or phase compensation registration detection methods, this method further reduces false alarm rates. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of this method."

    "abstract": "Employing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to predict traffic accidents presents a variety of significant benefits that could transform the industry. Their remarkable ability to effectively extract spatial features and automatically learn them greatly boosts hybrid models’ performance, achieving an impressive accuracy rate of 95% when integrated with XGBoost. This allows CNNs to proficiently process and gain insights from complex data, leading to marked improvements in predictive accuracy for traffic accident forecasting and safety management. By consolidating information from multiple sources, CNNs support the development of innovative approaches to accident prevention within a broader traffic management context. Looking ahead, there is considerable potential for further research, which could focus on developing sophisticated CNN architectures and utilizing more pertinent input data from conventional traffic accident prediction sources—ultimately enhancing road safety and traffic management efficiency. In this research, we provide a novel tree-structure-based information forwarding routing technique. To develop energy-efficient adaptive information forwarding in a decentralized manner, we modify wireless sensors in this study to choose better neighbour LoRa nodes.According to the suggested procedure, a wireless sensor first gathers the state and action data of its nearby LoRa node, including the distance and direction of information transmission, the amount of energy left, and the energy used for the information transmission action. For the future generation of IoT, where mesh topology is primarily used in current networks, LoRa technology is a possible alternative. This paper describes a LoRabased tree network and communication protocol that accounts for energy constraints. When employing LoRa technology, the nodes self-configure according to the physical link’s behaviour and forwarding, where mesh nodes are used to gather information when scalable. Analytical, computational, and experimental results show that the suggested approaches achieve energy efficiency and produce notable gains in energy performance. These findings provide helpful starting points for optimizing large-scale IoT networks. According to the experimental results, this approach also enhanced the lifetime of the entire LoRa network and reduced energy consumption in LoRa nodes."

Detecting such attacks in real time remains a complex challenge in cybersecurity, especially as reliance on digital platforms and financial transactions continues to grow. This study explores the effectiveness of combining Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with machine learning algorithms to detect and classify DDoS attacks using network log data. PCA, a dimensionality reduction technique, is employed to streamline data processing, enhance model efficiency, and mitigate overfitting. By reducing data complexity, PCA helps improve both the speed and accuracy of machine learning models. Several classifiers are evaluated in this research, including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naïve Bayes, Decision Trees, Random Forest, AdaBoost, and XGBoost. Among these, ensemble methods, particularly when integrated with PCA, demonstrated superior performance. Experimental results revealed a detection accuracy of 97.86%, highlighting the potential of this hybrid approach. This high accuracy is particularly valuable in handling high-dimensional datasets commonly found in network traffic analysis. The findings underscore the critical role of dimensionality reduction in improving the effectiveness of cybersecurity solutions driven by machine learning, making this integration a promising direction for real-time DDoS detection and network protection."

The study retrospectively analysed responses from an anonymous, online self-administered student satisfaction survey which all third-year medical students were required to complete at the end of the seven-week internal medicine module. Thirty relevant items were selected for analysis, covering module workload and organization, student progress, delivery of teaching and learning, learning resources, learning environment, and assessments. Responses comprised of a 5-point Likert scale ranging from Strongly disagree = 1 to Strongly agree = 5. Respondents were grouped into either Before MCO or During MCO according to the timing of their module. Differences in the responses between the two unpaired groups were inferred using the Mann-Whitney U test (significant p value < 0.05). There were 145 respondents in total, of which 61 were classed as Before MCO and 84 as During MCO. Respondents in the During MCO group generally felt that the learning sessions were better organized and adhered better to the timetables (median 4, IQR 4-5 vs median 4, IQR 3-4, p 0.0001), that the instructors were more responsive to their needs (median 5, IQR 4-5 vs median 4, IQR 4-5, p 0.04), that module facilitators dealt effectively with their problems (median 5, IQR 4-5 vs median 4, IQR 4-5, p 0.005), and that (online) case-based learning was useful (median 5, IQR 4-5 vs median 4, IQR 4-5, 0.008) compared to the Before MCO group. All other items showed comparable responses between the two groups. Students‟ evaluation showed comparable or better outcomes in the during MCO group compared to before MCO group. Online TEL can offer a satisfactory experience comparable to that of face-to-face learning in the first clinical year (3rd year) of MBBS program."

    "abstract": "Ovarian cancer ranks as the third most common gynecological malignancy. It presents significant global health challenges due to its high mortality rates, mainly resulting from late-stage diagnoses and inadequate early detection methods. Existing diagnostic techniques primarily focus on identifying morphological changes in the ovaries, which often overlook early cellular-level alterations, resulting in delayed diagnoses. Consequently, early detection is crucial for preventing cancer progression and improving patient survival rates. Aptamers, small nucleotide sequences that specifically bind to target proteins, represent a novel approach for identifying tumor cells. Recent advances include the design of a bispecific aptamer capable of detecting exosomes released by ovarian cancer cells. We hypothesize that these aptamers can specifically bind to the receptor surface and can be used to detect ovarian cancer. The current research utilized computational methods to investigate the binding capabilities of aptamers to surface receptors (EpCAM and CD24) present on exosomes. By predicting the aptamers secondary and tertiary structures, we performed molecular docking simulations to assess their interactions with the target receptors. Our findings indicate that the aptamers Apt1 and Apt2 exhibit strong binding affinities, warranting their selection for further evaluation. The docked structures were further validated by using the GrASP web server, which is a machine learning based method to enhance the accuracy of our predictions. This research contributes to identifying the most effective aptamers for binding to exosome surfaces, which may potentially advance ovarian cancer screening methods."

    "abstract": "Synthesizing anomalies that are both realistic and spatially precise is most valuable when it directly benefits pixelwise segmentation. Recent diffusion-based methods show strong generative capacity but often lack spatial controllability and can unintentionally alter background content. We propose SARD (Segmentation-Aware Anomaly Synthesis via Region-Constrained Diffusion with Discriminative Mask Guidance), a diffusion-based framework tailored for segmentation-oriented anomaly generation. Specifically, Region-Constrained Diffusion (RCD) performs a masked reverse update: the posterior sample is written only inside the anomaly mask while the background is passed through from the current noisy input, preventing background drift outside the target region. In addition, a Discriminative Mask Guidance (DMG) module augments the discriminator with a mask-aware branch that supplies localized adversarial feedback for sharper textures and boundary alignment. Extensive experiments on MVTec-AD and BTAD, across SegFormer and BiSeNet V2 backbones, show consistent gains in mIoU and pixel accuracy over strong baselines. By explicitly coupling background preservation with mask-guided discrimination, SARD advances segmentationaware anomaly synthesis."

This interference can obscure target signals, making target detection difficult. Traditional Frequency-domain Block Least Mean Square (FBLMS) algorithms are typically designed for continuous wave signals and struggle to balance convergence speed and steady-state error, resulting in poor direct path interference suppression. To address this, we propose a Kalman filtering-based FBLMS algorithm. By using the Kalman gain to update the weight coefficients, instead of a fixed step size, we mitigate the impact of inter-pulse intervals on convergence, improve iteration speed and steady-state error, and thus maximize the preservation of the target signal. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to fixed-step-size and other improved algorithms, our proposed algorithm achieves faster convergence, effectively suppresses direct path interference, and has a minimal impact on the target echo."

    "abstract": "Magnetic pose estimation is an accurate, noncontacting pose tracking method that is insusceptible to occlusion, making it widely used for tracking intracorporeal medical robots and devices in minimally invasive interventions. However, the ambiguity problem in magnetic pose estimation has been long overlooked that could result in inaccuracy and even divergence of pose tracking. This article is devoted to fundamentally investigating the ambiguity issue in 6-DoF electromagnetic pose estimation systems. Magnetic ambiguity is formally defined, and its existence and impacts on pose estimation are analyzed for single-magnet and dual-magnet tracking systems, then generalized to multiple-magnet systems. It is found that there are different types of ambiguity, each with distinct influence on pose estimation. Efficient algorithms are proposed to systematically identify all ambiguous poses in a workspace. The ambiguity in typical configurations of dual-magnet systems is identified and discussed. It is found that ambiguity can be completely eliminated by using at least THREE magnetic sources. An unambiguous tri-magnet system is proposed by combining the collocated and parallel dual-magnet systems and validated by tracking a continuum robot. This article lays the foundation for optimizing configurations of magnetic sources and designing compact, energy-efficient, but unambiguous magnetic tracking systems with minimum number of magnetic sources."

However, conventional manual or semi-automatic approaches are inherently subjective and inefficient. In this study, we propose Dil-RWKV, a novel hybrid architecture that integrates dilated convolutional layers with the Recurrent Weighted Key-Value (RWKV) framework to achieve fully automated and robust AIF selection. The model hierarchically extracts multi-scale temporal dynamics via dilated convolutions and enforces spectral coherence through a dual-domain optimization strategy that leverages time-frequency representations in the Fourier domain. Temporal consistency is further enhanced using RWKV’s linear attention mechanism, while a multimodal scoring module facilitates accurate AIF voxel discrimination. Compared to traditional and Transformer-based methods, Dil-RWKV achieves a 54.1% reduction in parameter complexity without compromising fidelity in hemodynamic estimation. Extensive validation on multi-institutional DCE-MRI datasets demonstrates high correlation with expert-annotated cerebral blood volume (CBV) maps, confirming its clinical reliability. The proposed framework offers a reproducible and scalable solution for automated perfusion analysis, promoting translational applications in neurovascular imaging."

Existing models have a tendency to prioritize infection trends, neglecting to account for the nonlinear interplay between population mobility, epidemic spread, and economic fluctuations. We propose a hybrid model architecture that combines the graph sample and aggregate (GraphSAGE) algorithm for modeling spatial dependencies driven by population flow and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) for capturing temporal patterns of infections and economic indicators. The simulation results demonstrate the model’s capacity to predict infection dynamics and economic trends accurately.

    "abstract": "Accurate prediction of power consumption is crucial for effective energy management, operational planning, and sustainability. Due to urbanization and industrialization, analyzing and predicting household energy consumption has become essential. According to earlier research, machine learning models play a key role in this area. However, these models are limited in their ability to handle complex data patterns. To address this issue, this research applied deep learning models, including Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTM), and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), along with advanced hyperparameter optimization techniques for power consumption predictions. These optimization techniques include Optuna, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Cuckoo Search, and Ant Colony Optimization (ACO). The model was trained and tested on the household_power_consumption dataset obtained from the Kaggle open-source data repository. The results show that without using the optimization techniques, LSTM demonstrated better baseline performance with an R<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup> score of 0.9601.

    "abstract": "Extracting relevant information from documents and websites is a time-consuming task that becomes increasingly complex as document length grows and websites expand. Manually retrieving precise information to meet user requirements from large documents and extensive websites is challenging and inefficient. In this context, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative technology, offering unparalleled capabilities for automating systems. AI has been widely utilized to streamline various processes, demonstrating its potential to simplify complex tasks, enhance accuracy, and reduce human effort. This research paper introduces \"AzureIQ-RAG\" Azure powered Intelligent Query and Hybrid Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system with two primary features: (1) extracting and retrieving information from diverse document formats, including PDF, TXT, DOCX, etc. and enabling question-answering based on the provided document(s), (2) extracting content from website and enabling question-answering regarding the content of the website. The system automates the extraction process from both documents and websites. The extracted content is segmented, embedded using Azure OpenAI Embeddings, and indexed in Azure Cognitive Search for efficient retrieval and then a reranking mechanism is applied to improve precision and accuracy further. Then the final response is generated by passing the relevant content and user query to the Large Language Model (LLM) GPT -4 omni. Additionally, the system maintains separate session memory for both document and website searches, ensuring context retention for improved query handling and user experience. The document processing feature of the system has been tested on a dataset of over 950+ documents of various formats and achieved an accuracy of 94.77 %, and the website feature of the system is tested on 50+ different websites, achieving an accuracy of 75.22%."

    "abstract": "Modeling electromagnetic (EM) wave propagation is critical for achieving efficient and reliable transmissions in maritime communication systems. Indeed, the signal propagation in this environment is strongly affected by several factors including surface roughness, diffraction, and atmospheric ducting. Even though traditional methods like ray tracing and mode theory analysis are computationally efficient, they often fail to capture the irregularities caused by these factors. The parabolic equation (PE) model has proved successful in addressing this issue but remains computationally intensive. This paper proposes a physics-informed neural network (PINN) approach that integrates the PE model with real-world data. The idea is to decompose the complex wave field into real and imaginary components, considering impedance boundary conditions, rough sea reflections, and wide-angle Padé approximation. Simulation results show that the proposed method significantly improves both accuracy and generalizability compared to the conventional models."

Past data breaches have driven new security practices to prevent future breaches. Recently developed blockchain technology is a wonderful tool for preserving private data. To protect medical data, the zero trust security model requires all steps, including transmission, to be secured. This paper reviews existing works on similar themes to provide a decentralized and trustless system for safe medical pictures and data sharing and storage. A timely and accurate diagnosis is needed to treat gastrointestinal illnesses like ulcerative colitis, polyps, and esophagitis. To show a Kvasir dataset Autoencoder-deep belief network (AE-DBN) model that automatically classifies gastrointestinal abnormal symptoms. The proposed AE-DBN model combines Autoencoders' unsupervised feature extraction with Deep Belief Networks' hierarchical classification. Experimental results show that the AE-DBN framework efficiently extracts discriminative features, resulting in more accurate and resilient classifications than classic deep learning methods. The results suggest that AE-DBN could be an artificial intelligence-driven gastrointestinal disease diagnostic tool due to its increased feature learning, classification accuracy, and processing efficiency."

    "abstract": "Reliable and early identification of epileptic seizures plays a vital role in improving clinical outcomes and supporting real-time therapeutic responses. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, despite being rich in brain activity information, are nonlinear and complex, which makes manual analysis both labor-intensive and prone to subjectivity. To address this challenge, we propose CACBH, a combined deep learning based architecture that aims at integrating CNN and BiLSTM. CNN is useful for capturing spatial representations, and BiLSTM units are effective for temporal sequence modeling, and an Attention mechanism for emphasizing clinically significant patterns in the EEG signal. The input signals are processed using bandpass filtering (0.5–40 Hz), z-score normalization, and segmented into 10-second intervals. The model’s training and testing is based on the CHB-MIT Scalp EEG dataset using a stratified data split that preserves the ratio of seizure to non-seizure events. Results show that CACBH achieves an impressive accuracy of 95.03%, surpassing traditional CNN and LSTM approaches. The attention layer improves interpretability by focusing on seizure-relevant features, while the overall architecture provides consistent detection performance. Evaluation through confusion matrices and classification metrics further validates the system’s reliability. Overall, CACBH shows promise as a deployable and scalable solution for automated seizure monitoring in both hospital-based EEG systems and portable health devices."

    "abstract": "For Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) swarms operating in large-scale unknown environments, lightweight long-range mapping is crucial for enhancing safe navigation. Traditional stereo cameras constrained by a short fixed baseline suffer from limited perception ranges. To overcome this limitation, we present Flying Co-Stereo, a cross-agent collaborative stereo vision system that leverages the wide-baseline spatial configuration of two UAVs for long-range dense mapping. However, realizing this capability presents several challenges. First, the independent motion of each UAV leads to a dynamic and continuously changing stereo baseline, making accurate and robust estimation difficult. Second, efficiently establishing feature correspondences across independently moving viewpoints is constrained by the limited computational capacity of onboard edge devices. To tackle these challenges, we introduce the Flying Co-Stereo system within a novel Collaborative Dynamic-Baseline Stereo Mapping (CDBSM) framework. We first develop a dual-spectrum visual-inertial ranging estimator to achieve robust and precise online estimation of the baseline between the two UAVs. In addition, we propose a hybrid feature association strategy that integrates cross-agent feature matching—based on a computationally intensive yet accurate deep neural network—with intra-agent, optical-flow based lightweight feature tracking. Furthermore, benefiting from the wide baselines between the two UAVs, our system accurately recovers long-range co-visible 3D sparse points. We then employ a monocular depth network to predict up-to-scale dense depth maps, which are refined using accurate metric scales derived from the triangulated sparse points via exponential fitting. Extensive real-world experiments demonstrate that the proposed Flying Co-Stereo system achieves robust and accurate dynamic baseline estimation in complex environments while maintaining efficient feature matching with resource-constrained computers under varying viewpoints. Ultimately, our system achieves dense 3D mapping at distances of up to 70 meters with a relative error between 2.3% and 9.7%. This corresponds to up to a 350% improvement in maximum perception range and up to a 450% increase in coverage area compared to conventional stereo vision systems with fixed compact baselines."

However, modeling and interpreting these complex neural dynamics remain a major challenge. In this study, we present a hypernetwork-based low-rank recurrent neural network (LR-RNN) that dynamically adapts its connectivity to predict and characterize time-varying seizure dynamics. We validate our model on both simulated Jansen-Rit models and real intracranial sEEG recordings from epilepsy patients. Our model exhibits high predictive accuracy, effectively capturing the onset and propagation of seizures. Furthermore, we conduct a compact, interpretable phase portrait analysis in a low-dimensional state space, enabling visualization and exploration of seizure trajectories over time. This geometric representation highlights distinct transitions between pre-ictal and ictal states, providing new insights into the underlying mechanisms of seizure evolution. Our work offers a unified computational framework for seizure forecasting and the interpretability of neural dynamics in epilepsy."

First, the performance and computational efficiency of U2-Net are optimized by streamlining its parametric number and computation; second, the 2D standard convolution of the RSU module in U2-Net is replaced by a 1D multi-scale convolution in order to enhance the model’s ability of capturing multi-scale features; furthermore, a differential convolution is introduced in the RSU module in order to highlight the characteristics of the R-wave in the ECG signals; lastly, this paper, with respect to the spatio-temporal and lead characteristics, a quadruple attention mechanism is proposed to enhance the model’s ability to perceive key ECG features. The experimental results show that the model proposed in this paper performs better in terms of reconstruction effect than the existing traditional models such as U2-Net, U-Net, LSTM and TCN. Among them, compared with the traditional model U2-Net, the amount of parameters of this paper’s model is reduced by $95.62 \\%$, and the amount of computation is reduced by $85.64 \\%$; compared with the traditional model U-Net, the root-mean-square error (RMSE) of this paper’s model is reduced by $13.87 \\%$ year-on-year, and the mean absolute error (MAE) is reduced by $49.01 \\%$ year-on-year; compared with the traditional model TCN, the correlation coefficient (CC) improved by $11.82 \\%$ year-on-year.

The potential usefulness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through an experimental evaluation on the classification task, which reveals consistently higher accuracy and stability when compared to baseline methods. In addition to its robustness, the proposed method also presents several desired attributes such as, computational simplicity, continuous adaptability and suitability for online applications. The experiments were conducted using a dataset acquired in an interval of 7 months, comprising nearly 4000 measurements from three different gases at different concentration levels in an array containing 17 polymeric sensors."

    "abstract": "To address the degradation of localization accuracy caused by multipath effects in urban environments, this letter proposes an improved spatial differencing method combined with a subarray selection strategy for an eight-rotary-arm helical array. Conventional methods (e.g., MUSIC, Bartlett) suffer from significant performance degradation under highly correlated multipath signals, while existing spatial differencing approaches are primarily limited to one-dimensional linear arrays. In this study, the proposed subarray selection strategy based on element numbering is proposed to establish a mapping relationship between the selection matrix and array elements, thereby extending the spatial differencing method to two-dimensional arrays. Experiments using a $\\mathbf{6 4}$-microphone array in a urban multipath environment demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over traditional algorithms (spatial differencing without subarray selection, MUSIC, Bartlett). The results show that the proposed method achieves a mean square error (MSE) of 0.1011, significantly outperforming the compared algorithms (0.3311-0.4954). Additionally, the error ellipse analysis reveals a smaller deviation range, confirming its effectiveness in suppressing multipath interference and enhancing localization stability. Future work will explore the application of transfer learning models to complex array structures."

Recently, embedding techniques have gained popularity, with researchers using both Natural Language Processing (NLP) and graph embeddings for malware classification. However, it remains unclear which embedding technique leads to superior results. In this study, we perform a comparative analysis between two NLP embedding techniquesWord2Vec and FastText-and a graph embedding technique, Node2Vec, applied to both directed and undirected graphs. We evaluate these embeddings using three machine learning classifiers: Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, and multilayer perceptrons. Results show that optimal embeddings vary by classifier: undirected graph-based embeddings achieved the highest F1 score ($\\mathbf{0. 9 4 8 1}$) with Random Forest, while NLP embeddings performed more consistently across classifiers. Undirected graphs also outperformed directed ones, suggesting bidirectionality captures richer opcode context. These findings demonstrate novel insights into how embedding choices impact malware classification, highlighting the reliability of NLP embeddings and the superiority of undirected graph-based embeddings."

    "abstract": "Imbalanced data widely exists in security-prioritized domains, where minority classes often bring a disproportionately high risk. Especially in multi-class scenarios, challenges arise not only from the imbalance between majority and minority classes, but also from the difficulty in separating minority classes and their underrepresentation in the training data. To address these issues, this paper adopts a One-Versus-One decomposition strategy to transform the multi-class problem into multiple binary subtasks. This formulation naturally increases the visibility of minority classes. Furthermore, we propose a large language modelassisted multi-task particle swarm optimization (LLM-MTPSO) algorithm. Each subtask is independently optimized via PSO, while a LLM is leveraged to semantically fuse optimal solutions among similar subtasks. This mechanism facilitates knowledge transfer and refinement at the solution level, enhancing the model's capacity to recognize minority patterns. Experiments on nine imbalanced datasets show that the test results of our method in terms of imbalanced classification accuracy outperform four classical methods. The ablation experiments indicate that the introduction of LLM promotes information sharing among subtasks, thus improving the algorithm performance."

These inverters connect distributed energy resources (DERs), such as photovoltaic (PV) and battery systems, to distribution grids. Existing inverter models have technical gaps on three fronts: i) inadequate modeling of inverter losses ii) use of mathematical abstractions for bidirectional flow of power, iii) inability to integrate different control modes into nonlinear solvers without loss of generality. We propose an inverter model that explicitly captures losses in passive circuit components, grounded in circuitlevel principles. We enable bidirectional power flow without binary or complementarity constraints by formulating loss terms as smooth, sign-aware expressions of current. We introduce and parameterize controlled current sources with twice-differentiable continuous functions to enable inverter control modes without loss of generality. We integrate DERs with the proposed inverter model at the load buses of distribution networks to perform power flow and optimization studies on real-world distribution networks with over 20,000 nodes. We demonstrate that the proposed model is more accurate, integrates seamlessly with various control modes without loss of generality, and scales robustly to large optimization problems."

Once relegated to speculative fiction, AI now emerges as a practical co-creator, offering tools capable of generating compelling narratives from minimal input. This study explores the evolving role of AI in screenwriting by evaluating story outputs generated by Bard AI against those written by human screenwriters. Using a structured, two-phase research design, the investigation compares the narratives based on five qualitative variables: plot, narration, character development, dialogue, and cultural relevance. A three-tiered input strategy—ranging from basic to extended prompts—was adopted to assess the AI's creative flexibility and responsiveness. Results show that while AI-generated stories demonstrate coherence, stylistic fluency, and efficient scene setting, they fall short in emotional depth, cultural nuance, and imaginative progression. Human-written scripts, though less structured, excel in dialogue and subtextual character portrayal. The findings highlight the potential of AI as a valuable tool in early-stage ideation and structural support, especially for Gen Z creators, while reaffirming the irreplaceable role of human imagination in storytelling. This research advocates for a hybrid screenwriting model, where AI serves as a creative assistant rather than a substitute for human authorship."

Prediction of EV anticipated range helps to take any useful decision in well advance including recharging. ADAS evaluates energy consumption for the remaining trip following the concerned EV drive model and find ODS using an optimization algorithm. Minimizing energy consumption, trip time and jerk are considered for optimization objectives. Effectiveness of ADAS is verified by analysing the effect of adopting ODS in a micro-trip planning with an E-bus based on experimental drive data.

    "abstract": "In modern research, the reversible logic gate has become very popular because of its attractive features like low power consumption, decreasing the quantum cost, no. of garbage output. For those features, it has been involved in different circuit design, such as, nanotechnology, quantum computing, signal processing, optical information processing, bio-informatics, cryptography etc. Previously, different types of reversible logic gates have already been developed in different times and are also being used in different digital circuits. This paper represents the development of a new reversible gate, its input output characteristics and also some applications in the digital family. By those applications, it would be clear that the newly implemented reversible gate is more superior than the other reversible gates in terms of its minimum usage number and lower garbage value."

    "abstract": "Segmentation has been a foundational concept in network security for decades, evolving from coarse techniques such as virtual local area networks to more granular approaches like micro-segmentation. Yet the absence of clear definitions and a standardized taxonomy has hindered consistent understanding, effective implementation, and rigorous research. This paper introduces practical definitions for key segmentation concepts and a comprehensive taxonomy for classifying methods across technologies, infrastructures, and enforcement strategies. We apply this language to describe major product categories, demonstrate its utility through a real-world enterprise case study, and use it to analyze prior research to identify under-explored areas for future work. Overall, this paper systematizes fragmented segmentation practices by providing clear definitions and a unified taxonomy that support consistent analysis of segmentation design across diverse networked environments."

As organizations confront rising threats and more distributed infrastructure, traditional one-size-fits-all security models are no longer adequate. The proposed architecture utilizes open-source technologies-pfSense, NGINX with ModSecurity, Active Directory, Graylog, and Wazuh-to implement layered defenses, network segmentation through a DMZ, and centralized monitoring. Empirical analysis of ten real-world scenarios shows that the framework achieves higher throughput, lower latency, and greater detection accuracy compared to existing models. The results highlight the effectiveness of a modular, opensource approach for protecting hybrid environments without depending on proprietary solutions."

    "abstract": "In this paper, we utilize frequency hopping spread spectrum (FHSS) to help enhance covert performance in frequency diverse array (FDA) covert system. Compared to conventional FDA covert communication, FHSS signals can hide in different channels by rapidly switching the transmission frequency to avoid being detected. Therefore, FHSS-aided FDA covert system can effectively counter the warden with strong detection ability and enhance covert performance. We focus on maximizing the covert capacity during the entire transmission by jointly optimizing the beamfoming vector and antenna frequency vector at the transmitter. Based on the system equipment constraints, two different optimization schemes, i.e., instantaneous optimization scheme (IOS) and robust optimization scheme (ROS), are proposed to solve the problem. Moreover, to evaluate the covert performance provided by FHSS-aided FDA covert communication, we introduce three benchmark schemes, i.e., phased array (PA) and logarithmic distribution FDA (Log-FDA) and non-FHSS. Simulation results demonstrate that FHSS combined with IOS can significantly improve covert performance compared to other benchmark schemes. In contrast, FHSS combined with ROS can effectively enhance covert performance when transmitting signals over a wide bandwidth."

The latter could not be evaluated experimentally due to cybersecurity concerns. In this section, we employ 506 flashing cycles (actual production cycles and synthetic cycles from an independent reproduction), and report process time, process jitter, and p-value. In particular, we find that the dual-bank scheme provides the best performance with a mean flashing time of 23.3 s which is a 45% improvement over Virgin Mode. The variance was reduced by a factor of 25, showing that the reduced cycle times were appropriate for a takt time sensitive environment.

In this context, Privacy-Preserving federated evolutionary optimization (PPFEO) has emerged as a promising search paradigm by integrating federated learning into surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms (SAEAs). However, privacy-preserving techniques that add random noise during local training introduce additional heterogeneity across clients, thereby degrading the performance of SAEAs. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel Privacy-Preserving Federated Evolutionary Algorithm with Personalized Data Transformation (PPFEA-PDT). Specifically, a personalized data transformation layer is incorporated into each client and trained to shift the distribution of local data, compensating for heterogeneity during local training. Additionally, a personalized surrogate management strategy is developed by combining multiple historical local models to construct the acquisition function on each client, preserving data privacy while enhancing optimization performance. Experimental results on six widely used benchmark problems demonstrate the effectiveness of PPFEA-PDT."

This paper compares four supervised machine learning approaches—Decision Tree (DT), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Extreme Gradient Boosting—for NILM on the UK-domestic appliance level electricity dataset. The evaluation criteria are accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score. The classification performance of DT and XGBoost is better than that of KNN and SVM. On the event detection side, XGBoost provided the highest classification accuracy and robustness.

While the short-term predictability of sea clutter enables suppression via time-series prediction, traditional linear model fails to address its nonlinear dynamics, and existing neural network-based methods often neglect timevarying characteristics and rely solely on amplitude information. This paper proposed a framework to suppress sea clutter with the following three innovations. Firstly, a complex-to-real transformation is achieved by decomposing complex radar returns into amplitude-phase components, allowing for holistic suppression while preserving phase correlation, which is critical for non-stationary signals. Secondly, a pre-train strategy leveraging heterogeneous clutter data with matched power of sea clutter to enhance global characterization of sea clutter. Third, the novel positional-attention enhanced Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network links amplitude and phase training via locationattention weights, while concentrating on the clutter information instead of random noise. Experiment results on the IPIX database attain better suppression performance than other algorithms."

Despite their widespread occurrence, there remains a gap in modeling particle propagation through these complex structures from a molecular communication (MC) perspective. This paper introduces a generalized analytical framework for modeling diffusion-based MC in multi-layered spherical environments. The framework is capable of supporting an arbitrary number of layers and flexible transmitter-receiver positioning. As an example, the detailed formulation is presented for the three-layer sphere, which is particularly relevant for different biological models such as tumor spheroids. Through this analytical model, two drug delivery scenarios for a three-layered tumor spheroid are investigated: (1) conventional drug delivery from a point source transmitter, and (2) targeted delivery utilizing pH-sensitive carriers that release their payload within the spheroid’s acidic necrotic core (i.e., innermost layer). The analytical results are validated using particle-based simulation (PBS) for configurations with short inter-layer distances. These findings advance the understanding of molecular transport mechanisms in multi-layered spheroids and provide a theoretical foundation for designing more efficient targeted drug delivery strategies."

We call our approach Mathematics Explanations through Games by AI LLMs (MEGA). Some students struggle with math, and as a result, avoid math-related disciplines or subjects despite the importance of math across many fields, including signal processing. Oftentimes, students’ math difficulties stem from suboptimal pedagogy. We compared the MEGA method to the traditional step-by-step (CoT) method to ascertain which is better by using a within-group design after randomly assigning questions for the participants, who are university students. Samples <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">${(}{n}{=}{60}{)}$</tex-math></inline-formula> were randomly drawn from each of the two test sets of the Grade School Math 8 K (GSM8K) and Mathematics Aptitude Test of Heuristics (MATH) datasets, based on an error margin of 11%, a confidence level of 90%, and a manageable number of samples for the student evaluators. These samples were used to evaluate two capable LLMs at length [Generative Pretrained Transformer 4o (GPT4o) and Claude 3.5 Sonnet] out of the initial six that were tested for capability. The results showed that students agree in more instances that the MEGA method is experienced as better for learning for both datasets. It is even much better than the CoT (47.5% compared to 26.67%) in the more difficult MATH dataset, indicating that MEGA is better at explaining difficult math problems. We also calculated the accuracies of the two LLMs and showed that model accuracies differ for the methods. MEGA appears to expose the hallucination challenge that still exists with these LLMs better than CoT. We provide public access to the MEGA app, the preset instructions that we created, and the annotations by the students for transparency."

    "abstract": "Machine Unlearning (MU) aims to remove target training data from a trained model so that the removed data no longer influences the model's behavior, fulfilling “right to be forgotten” obligations under data privacy laws. Yet, we observe that researchers in this rapidly emerging field face challenges in analyzing and understanding the behavior of different MU methods, especially in terms of three fundamental principles in MU: accuracy, efficiency, and privacy. Consequently, they often rely on aggregate metrics and ad-hoc evaluations, making it difficult to accurately assess the trade-offs between methods. To f ill this gap, we introduce a visual analytics system, Unlearning Comparator, designed to facilitate the systematic evaluation of MU methods. Our system supports two important tasks in the evaluation process: model comparison and attack simulation. First, it allows the user to compare the behaviors of two models, such as a model generated by a certain method and a retrained baseline, at class-, instance-, and layer-levels to better understand the changes made after unlearning. Second, our system simulates membership inference attacks (MIAs) to evaluate the privacy of a method, where an attacker attempts to determine whether specific data samples were part of the original training set. We evaluate our system through a case study visually analyzing prominent MU methods and demonstrate that it helps the user not only understand model behaviors but also gain insights that can inform the improvement of MU methods."

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the critical trade-off between estimation accuracy and computational complexity in Direction-of-Arrival (DOA) estimation for Frequency-Modulated Continuous-Wave (FMCW) radar systems equipped with Uniform Rectangular Arrays (URAs). The received radar echoes are first processed through de-chirping to convert wideband signals into narrowband intermediates. A 2D Fast Fourier Transform (2D-FFT) with windowing is then applied to construct the range-Doppler spectrum, from which target signals are extracted via peak detection within range-velocity gates effectively suppressing irrelevant interference. To reduce computational burden, a Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)-based beam-space transformation is introduced, projecting the high-dimensional element-space signals into a lower-dimensional beam-space. This transformation preserves essential signal energy while suppressing out-of-beam noise, thereby enhancing the effective signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In terms of simulation results, at 15 dB SNR, the Root-Mean-Squared Error (RMSE) of used algorithm for azimuth angle estimation is $\\leq 0.3^{\\circ}$, and for elevation angle estimation is $\\leq 0.2^{\\circ}$. Even at 3 dB SNR, BESPRIT maintains excellent estimation stability, avoiding the phase estimation error issue of PM-ESPRIT, which exhibits azimuth RMSE $\\gt 1.4^{\\circ}$ and elevation RMSE $\\gt 0.8^{\\circ}$. The used approach enables high-accuracy DOA estimation with significantly reduced computational overhead, making it suitable for real-time applications in large-scale URAs-based FMCW radar systems."

    "abstract": "Infrared Small Target Detection (IRSTD) is a critical technology, yet most deep learning models suffer from poor generalization when deployed in diverse, real-world scenarios, a challenge known as Omni-Domain IRSTD. Furthermore, the “black-box” nature of these models undermines their trustworthiness in high-stakes applications. To address these limitations, this paper introduces MetaKAN, a novel multi-modal architecture that pioneers the fusion of imaging metadata with visual features. MetaKAN employs a context-aware dynamic modulation module to adaptively adjust feature extraction based on metadata, such as sensor type and spectral band. Concurrently, it is the first to integrate a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) into an IRSTD framework, enhancing both parameter efficiency and providing a clear path toward model interpretability. Extensive experiments on the challenging WideIRSTD-Full benchmark demonstrate that MetaKAN achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing methods in both detection accuracy and suppression of false alarms in complex backgrounds. Our work presents a robust solution to the omni-domain problem and offers a new paradigm for developing generalizable and trustworthy IRSTD systems for practical applications."

    "abstract": "The goal of our article is to develop an Internet of Things (IoT)-based automated tree-planting robot that is adaptable to various tree plantation tasks, while also being dependable and efficient—key requirements for our initiative. The primary aim is to reduce the human labor needed for tree planting. With people’s busy schedules today, there is little time left to dedicate to planting trees, leading to a potential decline in the number of trees in the future. To address this, we conceived the idea of creating a tree-planting robot through IoT that can help prevent this decline. The robot is designed to plant a wide variety of saplings and has been engineered with cost-effectiveness in mind, making it accessible to everyone. Additionally, its controls have been simplified to ensure ease of use for all users."

This research builds on previous work using neural networks (NN) to study scaffold behavior by comparing several machine learning (ML) methods. Using an 8-story scaffolding structure in Paris as a case study, we assess the performance of NNs, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Linear Regression in predicting displacement, stress, strain, and axial loads. A dataset of 30,000 scenarios generated through finite element modeling provides training and testing data. Methods are compared for prediction accuracy, computational efficiency, and real-time applicability.

    "abstract": "Weakly supervised point cloud semantic segmentation (WSPCSS) has gained attention for reducing reliance on densely annotated data. However, inefficiencies in utilizing sparse annotations hinder comprehensive understanding of complex scenes. Inspired by masked autoencoder (MAE) techniques in image processing, researchers have adapted these methods to WSPCSS. Yet, current 3D masking strategies often fail to capture intricate geometric properties, resulting in generated to-be-filled content that inaccurately represents the underlying 3D scene structure. To address these limitations, this study proposes a novel stereo-wise masking strategy, which extends 2D plane masking into 3D space to generate coherent and semantically rich masked regions with contextual relevance. These regions serve as high-quality learning targets, enabling the model to better comprehend complex point cloud structures. Experimental results demonstrate that, at a 0.01 % annotation density, the proposed method achieves improvements in mIoU by 1.9 % and 4.72 % on the indoor datasets S3DIS and ScanNet V2, respectively, compared to previous methods. Furthermore, at a 0.1% annotation density on the forest dataset For-Instance, the method exhibits a 0.29 % improvement. These results substantiate the effectiveness and stability of the stereo-wise masking strategy."

This study investigates the impact of communication modalities - face-to-face (FTF) versus remote work (RW) - on collaborative performance and interpersonal closeness. 48 participants were paired into dyads and engaged in collaborative tasks under both FTF and RW conditions. Participants performed two cooperative tasks, namely, the Lost at Sea/Desert Survival task, to measure cooperation and shared decision-making abilities, and an ecological work problem simulation in which they had to allocate a budget for employee training, to assess practical collaboration and problem-solving skills. Participants also completed standardized questionnaires assessing media richness, interpersonal closeness, and perceived performance. Results indicate that FTF communication is perceived as richer and more socially engaging compared to RW, facilitating greater social connection between participants. However, no significant differences emerged in perceived performance or collaboration scores. These results suggest that FTF interaction is perceived as richer as RW, facilitating stronger interpersonal connections and greater social engagement. Future research could further investigate the role of individual and contextual variables to better understand the conditions that optimize collaboration in FTF and RW, through the use of more complex measures and by involving larger groups."

    "abstract": "An antenna coding approach for exploitingthe spatial multiplexing capability of pixel antennas is proposed. This approach can leverage additional degrees of freedom in the beamspace domain to transmit more information streams. Pixel antennas are a general reconfigurable antenna design where a radiating structure with arbitrary shape and size can be discretized into sub-wavelength elements called pixels. The adjacent pixels are connected by radio frequency switches. By controlling the switch states, the pixel antenna topology can be flexibly adjusted so that the resulting radiation pattern can be reconfigured for beamspace spatial multiplexing. In this work, we introduce the antenna coder and pattern coder for pixel antennas, provide a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication system model with antenna coding in the beamspace domain, and derive the spectral efficiency. Utilizing the antenna coder, the radiation pattern of the pixel antenna is analyzed and efficient optimization algorithms are provided for antenna coding design. Numerical simulation results show that the proposed technique using pixel antennas can enhance spectral efficiency of 4-by-4 MIMO by up to 12 bits/s/Hz, or equivalently reduce the required transmit power by up to 90%, when compared to conventional MIMO, demonstrating the effectiveness of the antenna coding technique in spectral efficiency enhancement and its promise for future sixth generation (6 G) wireless communication."

    "abstract": "Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have become an indispensable tool in search-and-rescue (SAR) missions, playing a crucial role in locating victims and delivering essential supplies in disaster-stricken areas. However, due to communications in open channels, these unignorable security issues including unauthorized data access, data tampering and leakage, potentially disturb, or even damage the SAR missions. The authentication and key agreement (AKA) technologies are designed to try to allow only verified legal entities can access the data securely with a negotiated session key. Despite the advantages of AKA, existing UAV-specific AKA solutions are unable to resist specific attacks which threaten the security of authentication and session key, and are plagued from the unsatisfactory performance given limited resources of UAVs. To address these issues, based on hyperelliptic curve cryptography (HECC), we propose a robust AKA for UAV enabled SAR network and preserve the desiring performance as well. With detailed security analysis, we demonstrate the robustness of our scheme under the eCK Adversary Model. Furthermore, the performance analysis shows the efficiency and utility of our design in terms of computational overhead and communication cost, in which it indicates that our scheme can be applied to the UAV-enabled SAR network."

Signal processing and timedomain feature extraction were carried out in Google Colab to evaluate heart rate (HR), heart rate variability (HRV), and pulse wave amplitude. Initial findings suggest that immersive VR elicits increased HR and reduced PPG amplitude, indicating sympathetic nervous system activation. The results validate the use of consumer-grade VR and portable biosignal equipment for short-term stress and arousal research."

    "abstract": "To address the challenges of high computational complexity, poor robustness in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions, and the reliance of deep learning on large-scale data in modulation recognition of non-stationary signals, a novel method combining segmented frequency estimation with multi-wavelet basis-based joint analysis is proposed. This approach reduces data dimensionality through signal segmentation and down-sampling, and extracts segmental frequency sequence features using the Kay instantaneous frequency estimation algorithm. Additionally, a multi-wavelet basis phase-jump detection mechanism based on the Gaussian derivative function family is designed. By utilizing modulus comparisons from wavelet transforms, the method achieves phase-jump angle decision-making and constructs a joint classification criterion combining frequency fitting slope, variance, and phase-jump angle. Simulation results demonstrate that, within the SNR range of -5 dB to 15 dB, the proposed algorithm achieves over 90% recognition accuracy for chirp signals and bi-phase/quad-phase shift-keyed (BPSK/QPSK) signals at low SNR levels, outperforming traditional methods like STFT, WignerVille Distribution (WVD), and CNN-based time-frequency imagery approaches. In terms of parameter estimation, the carrier frequency error remains below 1 MHz when SNR exceeds 0 dB. In contrast, the root mean square error (RMSE) of symbol width estimation stays under 1 ns when SNR is above 3 dB. The algorithm has been validated on an FPGA platform, providing an efficient solution for signal sensing and feature analysis in complex electromagnetic environments."

Therefore, it is imperative to effectively and efficiently detect the leakage of industrial waste gas, for the purpose of timely lowering the risk of pollution and explosions. To solve such a problem, we in this paper propose a new lightweight deep and wide network (LdwNet) for detecting the leakage of industrial waste gas from an image, which brings about the two main merits: 1) Compensating for the deficiencies of sensor-based detection methods, which can accurately detect the leakage of waste gas and even measure its concentrations but require to seek leakage sources beforehand; 2) Overcoming the shortcomings of image-based detection methods, which leverage DNN-based recognition technologies and usually suffer from low efficacy, low efficiency and high energy consumption during the model training and inference. To specify, the proposed LdwNet is developed by simulating human perception, motivated by the method which detects the leakage of industrial waste gas from surveillance images with the human observation and judgement. First, based on the inspiration that the human eyes are highly sensitive to horizontal and vertical stimuli, we construct a novel lightweight parallel-series-stripe (PS2) module to validly extract features with very few parameters. Second, to fully exploit deep and shallow features for fusing the global and local information, we extend the PS2 module as a backbone along both the deep and wide directions to build the multi-channel network. Third, to achieve effective, efficient and low-carbon detection in model running, we constraint the extended PS2 modules with parameter sharing to prodigiously reduce the model parameters and thus to make the proposed model ultra-lightweight. Experiments on the datasets of carbon particulate matters and ethylene leakage prove that our LdwNet with ten thousand parameters outperforms the state-of-the-art models with millions of parameters in detection accuracy and implementation cost, and this renders our proposed LdwNet more suitable for real industrial applications."

Rapid and accurate automated classification of these diseases has become critical to support overwhelmed healthcare systems and improve patient outcomes. Despite advances in deep learning, existing methods often suffer from limited datasets, overfitting, and lack of interpretability in clinical settings. Moreover, most studies focus on binary classification rather than multi-class detection of COVID-19, bacterial pneumonia, and normal cases in a single framework. In this study, we developed a custom convolutional neural network alongside VGG16 and DenseNet121 using a balanced chest X-ray dataset of over 12,000 images. We employed data augmentation, early stopping, and transfer learning techniques to enhance generalization and prevent overfitting during training and validation. The models were evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, F1-score, AUC, and confusion matrices. Our custom CNN achieved a high accuracy, macro F1-score and AUC, outperforming the transfer learning baselines. These results compellingly demonstrate the effectiveness of lightweight, wellregularized CNNs for reliable automated diagnosis and clinical decision support."

We aim to develop a machine learning (ML)-based screening pipeline for early BC detection using electronic-health-records (EHRs) in primary care. Methods: A multi-centred case-control cohort (1995–2018; n = 64,884) was created for model training and testing. We further validated the model prospectively on an independent cohort (2019–2020; n = 4,569). We proposed the Parsimony driven REweighting for Calibrated Input-based Screening for Early detection—Adjustable Grey Zone (PRECISE-AGZ), which identified influential features from 48,261 candidates and developed a calibrated logistic regression screening model with optimised grey-zone thresholds. Results: We finally identified 38 features, achieving an AUC (area under the curve) of 0.789 (95% CI: 0.780–0.798) on testing set. Neurological disorders (e.g., Parkinson's disease, OR: 0.86, 95% CI: 0.79–0.92) and medications (e.g., Tamoxifen, OR: 1.13, 95% CI: 1.07–1.20) emerged as novel predictors for BC screening. The screening model stratified the population into three risk categories based on predicted probability: low-risk (0.55), achieving a sensitivity of 0.852, F1-score of 0.799, and screening population coverage (SPC) of 34.5%. Applied to the prospective validation cohort, model performance varied by months before BC diagnosis, with sensitivities ranging from 0.872 (F1-score: 0.714, SPC: 29.9%) at the first month to 0.667 (F1-score: 0.690, SPC: 12.7%) at the twelfth month. Conclusion: The PRECISE-AGZ pipeline efficiently identified clinical signals from EHRs for early BC detection, offering promising potential for implementing population-based BC screening."

    "abstract": "Accurate prediction of the Maximum Usable Frequency (MUF) is critical for reliable high frequency (HF) communications. On the one hand, long-term prediction methods based on models such as VOACAP exhibit strong generalization capability but suffer from limited accuracy. On the other hand, deep learning-based approaches achieve higher prediction accuracy but require extensive historical data and demonstrate poor model generalization. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel short-term MUF prediction framework that balances high precision, low data dependency, and engineering feasibility. The method leverages real-time MUF measured data and its statistical distribution. First, by analyzing the temporal validity characteristics of communication links under specific accuracy requirements, a quantitative model is established to describe the evolution of MUF prediction error over time. This model precisely characterizes how prediction error increases when measured data are directly extrapolated into future time intervals. Within the validated time window, measured values can reflect the state of the ionosphere effectively. Beyond this window (i.e., when the required accuracy cannot be guaranteed), the method fits an hourly statistical distribution to short-term MUF observations, reconstructs missing data through distribution-based imputation, and performs prediction using the Kalman Filter (KF). Experimental results demonstrate that, the proposed approach significantly reduces reliance on large-scale continuous historical data. Furthermore, it achieves higher prediction accuracy than short-term distribution-based prediction method and lightweight LSTM."

This approach has been selected due to the fact that in general UAS lecturers have to have a certain number of years of experience in industry. So that they are familiar with processes in industry and able to educate their students in the knowledge, skills and competences as requested by the industry. Due to the lack of lecturers' experience in working in companies on one side and on the other side the lack of companies available to accommodate lecturers for ‘externships' a consortium composed of Ethiopian UASs and European universities was formed in order to elaborate the proposal ‘Methodology and Didactic Education for UASs' (MaDE for UASs) to use VR / Augmented Reality (AR) / simulations to mirror the W orld-of-Work (W 0 W) and to capture real world processes in companies. This proposal has been awarded as Erasmus+ Project for implementation. Before the development of the VRI ARisimulation based teaching and learning intervention will commence, it is important to define the pedagogical/educational approach. This paper tries to find an answer to the research question on ‘the most suitable learning theories/frameworks/approaches for the development of the VRI ARisimulation based teaching and learning interventions for the Ethiopian UASs'. A literature review clarify the terms learning and educational theories/frameworks/approaches and sets the baseline for the discussion on the most suitable educational/pedagogical approach for the development of the VRI ARisimulation based teaching and learning intervention."

    "abstract": "To further characterize the antenna array’s capability to focus energy, we introduce the power gain as the performance metric. Hence, with the aim of maximizing the minimum power gain in the mainlobe region, this paper discusses the wide-beam power gain pattern synthesis (PGPS) of linear phased arrays. It is greatly intractable due to the coupling of a max-min fractional objective function and lots of nonconvex unimodular constraints. To tackle these, we first translate the fractional objective function into an integral form by using generalized fractional programming. Then, we provide a penalty-based algorithm by using the equivalent rank-one expression and successive convex approximation to solve the problem. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms the conventional shaped beam pattern synthesis algorithms in the mainlobe power gain, while the performance degration introduced by phased arrays remains acceptable relative to a comparable digital array."

    "abstract": "The second harmonic current (SHC) is significant in the cascaded H-bridge converter with dc–dc stage and supercapacitor under high current and variable output frequency, increasing the risk of overcurrent in the dc–dc. Conventional suppression strategies designed for fixed-frequency SHC constrain the dc–dc controller bandwidth to the SHC frequency, inevitably degrading dynamic performance. To address this issue, this article proposes a feedforward-based SHC suppression strategy. By analyzing the transmission path of SHC, an accurate feed-forward compensation is introduced at the dc voltage reference point, blocking the second harmonic signal from entering the dc–dc control loop. This decouples the SHC suppression strategy from the controller, eliminating the bandwidth constraint imposed by the SHC frequency. Therefore, the proposed strategy ensures both effective SHC suppression and enhanced dynamic performance under variable frequency conditions. Furthermore, the dc–dc controller design process is significantly simplified. Finally, the experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed SHC suppression strategy."

In this article, we proposed an ultrarobust adaptive oscillator (AO) (URAO) method for predicting the kicking phase for the flutter kick and breaststroke kick, two main underwater motion patterns in diving activity. The URAO works without the need for data collection or training and can adapt to different users, motion patterns, and rapid changes in kicking frequency, offering greater precision than methods previously utilized for land-based exoskeletons. Eight participants were tested while performing fluctuating-frequency flutter and breaststroke kicks in indoor and outdoor swimming pools.

This study aims to integrate deep learning techniques to propose an efficient ECG denoising model for enhanced signal quality. First, a hybrid model combining fully convolutional networks with denoising autoencoder (FCN-DAE) is constructed, featuring a symmetric encoder-decoder architecture where the encoder compresses signals and extracts features through multiple convolutional layers while the decoder reconstructs signals via transposed convolutions, forming a complete autoencoder framework. Second, exponential linear unit (ELU) activation functions are introduced in the encoder to strengthen multi-scale feature extraction, while linear output layers are employed in the decoder to optimize signal detail restoration. Finally, the model is trained using clean signals from the MIT-BIH database mixed with multi-source noise and compared with traditional filtering methods (bandpass filtering, wavelet transform, etc.). Experimental results demonstrate that the FCN-DAE model outperforms conventional approaches in mean square error ($\\mathrm{MSE}=\\mathbf{0. 0 2 9 3}$) and sum of squared differences (SSD $=14.98$), with denoised signals closely approximating original waveforms while effectively preserving key features such as QRS complexes."

However, due to the coherence of SAR systems, SAR images inherently contain speckle noise, posing challenges for detection algorithms to distinguish targets, especially aircraft. Aircraft features in SAR images often appear unclear, leading to significant intra-class variations among the same aircraft type and inter-class similarities between different types, making precise discrimination difficult. This paper proposes an enhanced detection framework based on Faster R-CNN, leveraging Dynamic Prototypical Contrastive Learning to strengthen intraclass compactness and inter-class discriminability. The proposed algorithm is validated on a self-constructed dataset extended from SAR-AIRcraft-1.0. Experiments demonstrate that the method exhibits stronger robustness in detecting dense aircraft clusters under complex backgrounds, particularly improving the discrimination ability for aircraft types with high inter-class similarity. These results verify the effectiveness of Dynamic Prototypical Contrastive Learning in SAR aircraft detection."

However, as the number of people participating in problem solving increases, the burden on participants to recognize other participants increases. In addition, the possibility that solutions proposed by participants with minority views is buried increases. To solve these issues, we propose island model human-based evolutionary computation and implement it as a system. In the implemented system, the similarity of participants' views is measured, people with similar views form islands, and good solutions created on each island are sent to other islands, which is migration of solutions. The implemented system is evaluated in a small-scale experiment with 10 participants. The results show the basic effectiveness of creating islands with people with similar views."

    "abstract": "Children with cerebral palsy often suffer from gait abnormalities that limit mobility and increase the risk of chronic joint deformities. Ankle-foot orthoses (AFOs) are commonly prescribed to enhance ankle stability and improve gait patterns. However, conventional orthotic materials may exhibit limitations, such as excessive stiffness or insufficient deformation behavior, which can potentially cause discomfort or restrict natural gait motion. This study investigates the mechanical performance of Orthocryl composites reinforced with carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and polylactic acid (PLA) for pediatric AFO applications. Finite element analysis (FEA) was performed in ANSYS software to evaluate structural behavior and assess the materials' orthopedic suitability. A 3D model of the orthosis was generated using 3D scanning to match the patient's anatomy, then imported into ANSYS for simulation. Four material configurations were analyzed: pure Orthocryl, Orthocryl with CNTs, and two CNT-reinforced composites with varying PLA content. Simulations were conducted under dynamic gait loading, using ground reaction force data to represent heel strike, midstance, and toe-off phases. Results showed that maximum stress occurred during toe-off across all materials, corresponding to peak gait loading. CNT and PLA additions preserved the uniform stress distribution of pure Orthocryl without creating localized concentrations. Deformation analysis revealed minimal deflection in pure Orthocryl, indicating rigidity, while PLA enhanced flexibility, allowing greater deformation in midstance and toe-off. CNTs enhanced structural stability, and the hybrid composites balanced flexibility and support. Safety factors remained within acceptable limits throughout the gait cycle. Overall, CNT/PLA-reinforced composites demonstrated enhanced mechanical adaptability under dynamic gait conditions compared to pure Orthocryl."

    "abstract": "Cloud computing is a significant advancement in computing technologies as it operates on a pay-as-you-use model. It provides resources like storage, servers, etc., through a virtual platform which makes the remote access of distributed resources easy and efficient. This enhances flexibility, scalability, and cost-effectiveness. Clients provide tasks to the cloud service providers through some software which follow the resource scheduling. Resource scheduling is a critical process that shows the overall performance of a system. It is the process to generate the schedule appropriately that decides which task will be mapped to which resource. Efficient resource scheduling ensures optimal utilization of a resource. Sometimes many tasks are provided to the same set resources repeatedly and the rest of the resources remain idle. This creates an uneven distribution of workload which may have impact on the efficiency of the system. For this reason, load balancing is required. It is an important component of cloud computing which is designed to distribute workloads and computing resources efficiently across multiple servers or VMs. Several resource scheduling algorithms have been proposed over the years addressing multiple factors and challenges. However, many of these could not adequately integrate several factors of resource scheduling and load balancing for an overall optimal performance. This project aims to address those problems and enhance efficiency in resource scheduling through a simulation-based evaluation. The project proposes an algorithm which considers task length and task priorities simultaneously and then finds their credit. Since load balancing is equally important as resource scheduling, the proposed method integrates credit-based task allocation with a load balancing strategy to improve Makespan and system performance. This maintains an even distribution of workload."

Current computational methods for identifying SEs from genomic sequences face challenges in prediction accuracy and cross-species generalizability. This study introduces TransSE, a deep learning framework combining convolutional and recurrent neural networks with cross-species transfer learning for SE prediction. TransSE employs a two-phase strategy: pre-training on combined human and mouse data to learn conserved regulatory features, followed by species-specific fine-tuning to capture organism-specific patterns. Evaluation on human and mouse datasets demonstrates that TransSE achieves superior accuracy compared to existing methods including SENet, DeepSE, and transformer-based models (DNABERT, Enformer), with AUC values of 0.828 (human) and 0.832 (mouse). Ablation studies confirm that convolutional blocks are essential for feature extraction, while transfer learning and recurrent layers provide meaningful performance improvements. Feature analysis reveals that TransSE distinguishes SEs from typical enhancers based on learned sequence representations, achieving 10.4-fold improvement in clustering metrics. The model demonstrates effective cross-species prediction capability, maintaining AUC <inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\gt $</tex-math></inline-formula> 0.79 when trained on one species and evaluated on another.

This work presents the design and analysis of three low-power D flip-flops (DFFs), a Dynamic TFT Flip-Flop (DTFF), and two generations of Static TFT Flip-Flop (STFF-I and STFF-II), implemented using unipolar amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) TFTs. The first-generation STFF-I DFF, fabricated and measured on glass and flexible substrates, achieves a 79.8% reduction in total power relative to a conventional design. The STFF-II DFF incorporates optimized feedback control to achieve full-swing static operation with reduced switching delay. The DTFF design uses dynamic bootstrap-assisted feedback to suppress direct-path current while maintaining a compact area. All circuits were benchmarked in simulation against prior TFT-based DFFs and evaluated in subsystem-level implementations, including a 3-bit counter, frequency divider, and TFT-based scan-chain structures. The proposed DTFF achieves up to 77% lower power and 69% lower Power-Delay-Product (PDP) than state-of-the-art designs. These results establish the DTFF, STFF-I, and STFF-II designs as compact, energy-efficient sequential building blocks for next-generation flexible and large-area electronics."

This paper presents a novel Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based orchestration framework that dynamically places and migrates Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) to minimize end-to-end latency while maintaining service continuity. Our approach combines a Deep Q-Network (DQN) agent for placement decisions with a predictive migration mechanism that anticipates application demands.

    "abstract": "Password has become the mainstream method of authentication today. To improve password security, researchers evaluate the strength of target password datasets through early brute-force attacks to current password guessing methods, aiming to help users reduce the use of weak passwords. With users becoming more aware of security, they make local variations on weak passwords to improve the password strength while being easy to remember. These transformations render passwords more complex and enhance the score in password strength meter. However, such variations do not genuinely enhance password security, as human habits tend to converge. This allows attackers to deduce the modification patterns and consequently crack these passwords. Motivated by this, this paper defines the hidden weak passwords, a local variant of explicit weak passwords, which appear to enhance password security yet remain vulnerable. We systematically analyze transformation behavior between explicit and hidden weak passwords. Then we design an automated rule generation algorithm to identify hidden weak passwords and generate transformation rules. Based on automatically mined rules, we generate a large number of password guesses and fuses them with existing methods to improve password guessing performance. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method through password guessing experiments on eight real-world datasets, where the cracking rate improves on all five state-of-the-art methods."

    "abstract": "Underground environments present challenges for 3D point cloud segmentation, including complex structural characteristics and limited semantic annotations. To address these issues, this study introduces a novel unsupervised semantic segmentation framework for 3D point clouds. The proposed approach facilitates autonomous learning of semantic features through a progressive superpoint growth mechanism. During feature extraction, it incorporates an attention mechanism combined with a spatial pyramid architecture to improve the modeling and capture of global contextual information within intricate scenes. Additionally, a scene-aware superpoint construction strategy, specifically designed for underground point cloud data, is developed. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that the method attains high-precision unsupervised semantic segmentation on both the publicly available Seg2Tunnel dataset and proprietary underground mine datasets. Importantly, it achieves a substantial enhancement in mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) on the public S3DIS dataset. These findings substantiate the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed approach for 3D point cloud segmentation in complex underground scenarios characterized by sparse annotations."

    "abstract": "Secondary electron hyperspectral imaging (SEHI) is an emerging technique that allows experimental investigation of the chemical properties of material surfaces at the nanoscale. Despite advancements in automated image registration, registering SEHI images across different spatial scales remains a challenging task, and it is still typically performed manually in practice. Many image registration approaches often lead to inadequate registration in SEHI due to primarily focusing on spatial features, and do not capture the rich spectral information in SEHI. To fill in this gap, we propose a multi-scale spatio-spectral approach based on the scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) to automate SEHI image registration. The main novelty of this work lies in the proposed multi-scale SIFT spatio-spectral descriptors that effectively integrate both the SIFT spatial descriptor and differentiate the spectral signal profile as a function of electron energy. A new spatio-spectral descriptor matching algorithm is designed, achieving accurate image registration, with an accuracy error of less than 0.44 pixels. Results over real SEHI datasets show that the proposed approach performs better than other state-of-the-art registration methods. Two performance metrics are used for evaluation, including normalized cross correlation (NCC) for examining spatial alignment and cosine similarity regarding spectral alignment. The results show that our proposed approach achieves good accuracy, with an NCC of above 82%, and a cosine similarity of over 93%. This work offers a promising solution for automated multi-scale image registration, which is an essential step for SEHI analysis tasks for material surface chemical composition and accelerating materials discovery."

    "abstract": "This paper explores two optimization strategies for digital circuits based on Indium-Gallium-Zinc-Oxide (IGZO) thin-film transistors (TFTs). The first method focuses on clock tree synthesis (CTS) and its impact on performance. To evaluate the effectiveness of CTS, a 32-bit counter incorporating a Brent–Kung adder was designed and fabricated. Implementing the clock tree improved the maximum operating frequency up to 50%. The second optimization strategy is a mixed standard-cell library that integrates both high-performance and low-power cells, using a two-stage resistor-load logic topology. The high-performance cells will be placed along the critical paths of the integrated circuits, while low-power cells will be used in non-critical areas. To validate this approach, two MOS 6502 microprocessor versions were developed: one with only highperformance cells, and another with the mixed library. Our findings indicate a threefold reduction in power consumption when employing the mixed library during the digital flow at comparable clock speeds. Additionally, we developed what is, to our knowledge, the fastest IGZO-TFT microprocessor reported to date, achieving a clock frequency of 295 kHz, and the lowest power-consuming microprocessor in this technology, marking the first IGZO-CPU to operate in the sub-mW range at 580 μW."

    "abstract": "The communication links of multiagent systems (MASs) could be compromised by stealthy cyber attacks. To solve the problem, this paper proposes distributed nodes detection and event-triggered links isolation of stealthy attacks in MASs by topology-oriented watermarking (TOW). Firstly, the limitation of traditional MASs against distributed pole-dynamics attacks (dPDAs) is revealed. Secondly, different from existing water-marking methods for single-agent systems, a novel TOW method with four optional parameters selection schemes is proposed for distributed nodes detection in MASs, where it is proved that only one of optional parameters selection schemes can simultaneously possesses complexity and resistance to collusive dPDAs. Moreover, TOW combines the advantages of multiplicative and additive watermarking to achieve dPDAs detection. Furthermore, the positive relationship between dPDAs detection performance and the coupling factor of attack topology, attack signal and TOW parameters is quantified. Thirdly, a new TOW-based event-triggered links isolation algorithm incorporating multiple link-deletion observers is proposed, where TOW is leveraged to trigger running of link-deletion observers. It is proved that the compromised links can be correctly isolated. Finally, the simulation results verify our proposed scheme."

    "abstract": "Blockchain technology is revolutionising healthcare data management with its decentralised ledger, which allows for safe transactions and transparent record-keeping. Better privacy protections are necessary, nevertheless, because patient information is very sensitive. By improving decision-making and facilitating safe, transparent, and efficient handling of medical data, the Mother Optimisation Algorithm (MOA) and blockchain technology are reshaping the healthcare industry. Data security, interoperability, and privacy protection are becoming more important issues due to the exponential growth in volume of sensitive patient data generated by the proliferation of digital healthcare systems and medical equipment based on the Internet of Things (IoT). Secure and transparent data sharing across healthcare providers is made possible using blockchain technology, which offers a decentralised, immutable, and tamper-proof ledger. This helps to avoid data breaches. The MOA also improves healthcare system efficiency by maximising the use of available resources for illness diagnosis and therapy suggestion optimisation. Better patient outcomes, lower operational costs, and more efficient use of medical resources are all results of healthcare predictive analytics that are enhanced by MOA's intelligent, adaptive problem-solving skills. Making decisions in real-time, streamlining medical workflows, and creating personalised treatment plans are all possible with the integration of MOA with blockchain-based healthcare systems. This creates an environment that is trustworthy, intelligent, and patient-centric. Further study is address obstacles such as computational complexity, scalability, and interaction with existing healthcare infrastructures, despite its advantages. To build a stronger, safer, and more efficient healthcare system, future developments should concentrate on optimising MOA's methods, making blockchains more scalable, and integrating AI-driven approaches. This strategy has the ability to revolutionise healthcare by making it safer, more data-driven, and patient-centered. As a result, medical services will be better and more accessible for people all over the world."

This manuscript proposes a novel IDS framework that integrates machine learning techniques, including random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and long short-term memory (LSTM)-based anomaly detection, to address these limitations. The proposed system was evaluated using the NSL-KDD dataset in a simulated enterprise network environment, and its performance was measured using key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, false positive rate (FPR), false negative rate (FNR), and response time. The results showed that LSTM outperformed RF and SVM with an accuracy of 97.2%, precision of 97.0%, recall of 98.1%, and F1-score of 97.5%. It also demonstrated the lowest FPR (1.9%) and FNR (2.1%) and the fastest response time (124 ms). RF followed closely with 96.2% accuracy and an F1-score of 95.9%, while SVM achieved 94.6% accuracy and 94.0% F1-score. The system's integration with tools like Snort and Suricata, coupled with real-time alert generation and a centralized dashboard, significantly improved the efficiency of incident response. The proposed IDS framework demonstrated a 13–17% increase in detection accuracy and a 40% reduction in false alerts compared to baseline systems, highlighting its effectiveness for real-time network security monitoring."

    "abstract": "Recommender systems (RSs) are software systems that use machine learning techniques to suggest items, such as movies, products or routes to users based on input provided over time. These systems have been widely used by companies, such as Amazon, Google, and Netflix, who rely heavily on recommendations as a core element of their interaction with users. In the case of software engineering, RSs are used to recommend, for example, software tasks, developers, APIs, libraries, and bug fixes. More recently, advancements in natural language processing and large language models (LLMs) have led to the creation of LLM agents capable of generating plans, interacting with users and the environment, receiving feedback, and using tools. These developments have resulted in the use of LLM agents in RSs, giving rise to multi-agent RSs referred to as agentic recommender systems (ARSs). However, agentic RSs are not yet well characterized in terms of the basic elements of system modeling and design. This systematic literature review characterizes agentic recommender systems with respect to agents, roles, relationships, prompts, integration, use cases, strategies and evaluation methods. An analysis of published studies yields insights, such as (i) the identification of 13 distinct types of agents, (ii) the popularity of GPT models, (iii) a framework for ARSs, (iv) a generalized prompt, (v) the use of persona, cues, output format, and zero-shot prompting, (vi) the frequent use of Amazon, Yelp, and MovieLens datasets, (vii) the use of nDCG@k and Recall@k as common evaluation metrics, and (viii) the identification of many research gaps. This systematic literature review aims to support the continued research and development of agentic recommender systems."

By combining non-singular integral terminal sliding mode control with prescribed-time super-twisting algorithms, the framework ensures system convergence within a prescribed time independent of initial conditions while alleviating chattering effects. To mitigate the adverse impacts of partial loss-of-effectiveness faults and saturation-induced dead zones, Nussbaum-type adaptive gains compensate for unknown control effectiveness without requiring fault detection mechanisms. Prescribed-time stability is rigorously established via Lyapunov theory. Comparative simulations show that the proposed approach reduces tracking error by 60% relative to state-of-the-art adaptive sliding mode controllers, delivers superior transient performance with faster convergence, and exhibits stronger robustness against fault-saturation coupling, confirming its viability for safety-critical UAV applications."

    "abstract": "The cloud–fog automation (CFA) paradigm accelerates Industry 4.0 by enabling fully automated industrial systems through interconnected wired and wireless devices. However, dynamic uncertainties such as environment-induced network delays and disturbances challenge the stability and efficiency of these systems. To address these issues, this paper proposes a control–communication co-design framework named C<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup>L (Control– Communication Coupling Loop), which integrates 5G and Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) to coordinate transmission and control across cloud and fog layers. A hierarchical control strategy is introduced based on a delay threshold derived from Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) analysis, enabling dynamic selection between cloud and fog control units for both stability and responsiveness. To ensure timely and reliable control input delivery under uncertain networks, we develop a deterministic transmission mechanism centered on a novel metric, Packet Loss Tolerance (PLT), which quantifies how many consecutive losses the system can endure while maintaining stability. Additionally, a new optimization criterion, Pareto Deviation Value (PDV), is proposed to avoid combining control and communication costs with incompatible physical units. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method enhances control robustness and communication efficiency in complex industrial networks."

    "abstract": "Received Signal Strength (RSS)-based Wi-Fi localization offers a cost-effective solution for multi-floor indoor location estimation. However, its accuracy is often degraded by signal fading, multipath propagation, and device heterogeneity, posing major challenges to reliable localization. Recent studies have increasingly employed deep neural networks due to their ability to extract meaningful patterns from RSS data; however, these models require substantial computational resources and extensive parameter tuning, which limits their adaptability across diverse dynamic environments. To address these limitations, we propose DELLoc-RT, a localization framework integrating Dynamic Ensemble Learning (DELLoc) with RSS Transformation (RT) for accurate, efficient, and adaptable multi-floor indoor localization. The RT module applies Sigmoid-scaled normalization and confidence weighting to convert RSS values into compact, learnable features. DELLoc employs multiple base learners optimized via the Tree-structured Parzen Estimator with a pruning strategy (TPE-PS) that accelerates convergence by focusing on promising configurations. Additionally, Iterative Ensemble Optimization with Stepwise Selection (IEO-SS) selects complementary learners to enhance overall performance. Experimental results demonstrate that DELLoc-RT achieves floor classification accuracies of 93.32%, 94.38%, and 94.02% on the UJIIndoorLoc, UTSIndoorLoc, and Tampere datasets, respectively, with mean Euclidean errors (MEE) of 10.63 m, 7.87 m, and 8.19 m. These results highlight the model’s strong adaptability across diverse datasets. Evaluation on a self-constructed dataset further confirms that DELLoc-RT delivers high accuracy and efficiency while substantially reducing the need for manual tuning, enabling rapid deployment in practical scenarios."

    "abstract": "With the increasing deployment of polypropylene (PP) cables in power systems, early identification of partial discharge (PD) defects is critical for ensuring equipment reliability. However, as PP cables remain in the trial stage, defect samples from industrial sites are limited, making traditional recognition methods ineffective under limited-sample conditions. A limited-sample cross-domain recognition method for PD defects in PP cables is proposed in this paper, with the transfer recognition task from generator stator bar PD to PP cable PD being addressed. In the proposed framework, PD signals from generator stator bars and PP cables are collected as source- and target-domain data under typical defect scenarios. Phase-resolved PD (PRPD) patterns are constructed, and a deep synthetic minority oversampling technique (DeepSMOTE, DS) enhancement technique is applied to balance feature distribution among defect types in the target domain. A transfer framework combining graph isomorphism networks (GIN) and domain-adversarial neural networks (DANN) is then employed to improve graph feature representation and cross-domain adaptability. Experimental results show that the DS-GIN-DANN method achieves 90.25% accuracy at 64×64 resolution under limited-sample conditions, outperforming CNN-based transfer methods by 8.75%, effectively mitigating the problem of limited samples. Therefore, a new technical pathway for limited-sample recognition of PD defects in cable equipment is provided, with significant practical application value."

We employ K-means clustering with objective quality metrics (Silhouette Coefficient and Davies-Bouldin Index) to partition time series datasets into balanced subdomains, then quantify model performance consistency across these subdomains using SCM. Furthermore, we systematically test model robustness under six realistic perturbation types including Gaussian noise, shift, trend, outlier, missing value, and time delay, analyzing their impact on SCM values. Our approach introduces a logarithmic scoring mechanism that provides standardized robustness assessment across different perturbation intensities and ratios. This framework not only evaluates global model performance but also emphasizes stability across subdomains, thereby offering a new perspective for understanding model generalization in complex, perturbed environments. Experimental results on the M4 dataset demonstrate that this evaluation framework effectively reveals model robustness characteristics, with LightTS, TSMixer, and MICN showing superior performance, providing valuable insights for practical model selection and deployment."

This work also examines the range-angle coupling problem in target localization and the errors arising from the array configuration, including amplitude and phase errors, element position errors, and other factors. These analyses aim to improve the estimation accuracy of the position parameter. The proposed method is applied to experimental data obtained from a sparse THz-FDA and effectively restores the unique identifiability of the target.

As automated attacks grow more advanced, there is a strong need for accurate and efficient CAPTCHA solvers that can help evaluate and improve these systems. However, many existing studies focus on a single model design without comparing the performance and complexity trade-offs between different deep learning architectures. This work fulfil that gap by evaluating two CRNN-based models for solving image-based CAPTCHA challenges. The first model uses EfficientNetB0 as a feature extractor followed by LSTM layers, while the second model uses a simpler architecture with two convolutional layers and LSTM blocks. Both models use the Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss function to find the variable-length text from CAPTCHA images. The results show that although the EfficientNet-based model achieves a bit higher accuracy but the simpler CNN-LSTM model trains faster and uses fewer resources. The comparison highlights the balance between accuracy, training efficiency, and model complexity. Both models performed well on real-world CAPTCHA data, showing their practical value. Overall, this study provides a useful comparison of two CRNN architectures and offers insights for designing effective and efficient CAPTCHA recognition systems."

In an Open Data approach, it combines existing official and publicly available data and allows to add new data sources from crowdsourcing projects. A digital traffic twin uses aggregated data to predict traffic congestion up to three days in advance. This way, commuters can adapt their commuting times, home office days, and change to public transport. In all sections of the UDP a collection of anonymization modules for depersonalization of commuting trajectories is used to protect commuters and other road users' privacy. The system was integrated on a traffic simulation basis and is currently being assessed. Early results from experiments with student groups and project partners are presented.

    "abstract": "Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are a novel event-driven computational model with great potential for handling temporal classification tasks, such as speech recognition. Research has shown that synaptic delay plasticity in SNNs can significantly enhance their expressive capabilities. However, traditional SNNs face numerous challenges when dealing with sparse, inhomogeneous, and noisy temporal classification data, which limits their performance. To address these challenges, we introduce a temporal attention mechanism into the synaptic delay plasticity of SNNs to enhance the ability of the model to capture critical temporal information. Specifically, we use extended convolution to learn delays and weights, and then apply the temporal attention mechanism along the temporal dimension to dynamically quantify the importance of different time steps. Our approach achieves accuracies of 96.21% and 80.87% on two benchmark temporal classification datasets, Spiking Heidelberg Digits and Spiking Speech Command, respectively, representing a significant improvement over traditional SNNs. These results validate that the integration of synaptic delay plasticity with the temporal attention mechanism enhances the temporal classification capability of SNNs and offers new perspectives for applying SNNs to temporal classification tasks."

    "abstract": "This paper considers the multi-target tracking problem under epistemic uncertainty. A multi-scan possibility generalized labeled multi-Bernoulli (GLMB) smoothing is proposed to eliminate track fragmentation and switching in scenario with unknown and time-varying detection profiles. The labeled uncertainty finite set (UFS) based on outer probability measure is introduced into multi-scan GLMB model for improved multitarget state estimation, resulting in a possibility-based analog of the conventional multi-scan GLMB smoothing process. The multi-scan possibility functions are capable to capture epistemic uncertainties arising from incomplete knowledge about detection profile. These prediction-update possibility functions are represented by the Gaussian max-mixture (GMM), facilitating the implementation of the multi-scan possibility GLMB recursion. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed multi-scan possibility GLMB smoothing yields better multi-target trajectories and cardinality estimation under epistemic uncertainty, especially in real-world applications."

    "abstract": "In aerial inspection of high-voltage power equipment, acoustic signals emitted by partial discharge (PD) are often severely interfered by environmental noise and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) self-noise, which significantly degrades the accuracy and stability of sound source localization. Traditional methods, such as beamforming and subspace decomposition algorithms, suffer from poor resolution and low robustness under low signal-to-noise ratio conditions. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a Fast Linear Iterative Sparse Bayesian Inference (FLISBI) algorithm. Based on the conventional Sparse Bayesian Inference (SBI) framework, the proposed method introduces a linearized covariance update strategy that eliminates the need for matrix inversion, thereby improving computational efficiency while maintaining noise robustness. Utilizing a UAVmounted acoustic sensor array, experiments were conducted in complex noisy environments to evaluate the proposed approach. Results demonstrate that the FLISBI algorithm achieves superior localization accuracy and robustness within a fixed number of iterations, outperforming existing methods and showing strong potential for practical deployment in power equipment inspection tasks."

    "abstract": "Incorporating IoT in the medical field immensely promotes patient care efficiency and effectiveness and reduces the cost-effectiveness of healthcare processes. IoT devices play a critical role in early disease detection and monitoring of significant symptoms, harvesting medical information, and processing it with algorithms in offsite servers. Despite its numerous advantages, IoT devices have no exceptions when it comes to cybersecurity vulnerabilities that can leak patient information and jeopardize the security of the entire system. In this article, a complex model is proposed for improving efficiency in anomalous network activity detection, particularly in handling imbalanced distribution of classes and hyperparameter sensitivities. We introduce a novel approach, the imbalanced maximizing area under the curve (AUC) proximal support vector machine (ImAUC-PSVM), improving the traditional PSVM by directly including AUC optimization in its main goal. This change simplifies the structure of the model and reduces the need for numerous hyperparameter adjustments, making it highly effective for training on datasets with skewed class distributions. The theoretical basis for the ImAUC-PSVM is that it retains all meaningful aspects of traditional PSVM and extends its adaptability to update its performance promptly, a key consideration for efficient anomaly detection. In addition, we use the Bayesian optimization hyperband (BOHB) algorithm for meticulous hyperparameter fine-tuning of our model. On testing with the NSL-KDD and MAWI datasets, our model reaches an average F-measure of 87.050% and 89.089%, respectively, and validates its high performance in various IoT anomaly detection scenarios."

    "abstract": "The application of external human–machine interface (EHMI) on autonomous vehicles (AVs) facilitates information exchange. Existing research fails to consider the impact of the sequence of actions, as well as the effects of EHMI applications and deception, raising the question of whether benevolent, well-intentioned deception should be permitted (i.e., misleading statements that are intended to benefit both parties). We established a game theory based EHMI information disclosure framework for AVs in this study. In considering benevolent deception, this framework divided the decision-making process into three stages, respectively encompassing three key questions: whether to disclose, when to disclose, and what type of intention information to disclose. The results show that theoretical advantages of deception exist in certain cases when AV expects to maximize the safety of the interaction. In 40 out of 484 cases (8.3%), safety can be enhanced through successful deception. Those successful deceptions fall into two categories: 1) In 28 of these cases, the straight-going AV expected the left-turning human-driven vehicle (HV) to yield, while HV exhibited lower speed and higher acceleration; 2) In 12 of these cases, AV expected HV to proceed first, while HV exhibited higher speed and lower acceleration. We also conducted a VR-based driving simulation experiment, and the results confirmed our conclusion. Additionally, we found that when participants had low trust in the EHMI, its use negatively impacted interaction efficiency instead. This study serves as an exploratory behavioral mechanism study based on specific hypotheses for future EHMI design and ethical decision-making of autonomous driving system."

    "abstract": "Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) enables all-weather and all-day imaging, playing a critical role in military and civilian applications. Ship detection, as a fundamental task in SAR image interpretation, supports downstream applications including attitude estimation and target tracking. Although existing methods address multi-scale ship detection through traditional strategies like Constant False Alarm Rate (CFAR) or deep learningbased feature fusion architectures, they often suffer from limited robustness in complex scenarios (e.g., ports and nearshore areas) and high computational complexity. Recently, diffusion models have shown remarkable potential in generative tasks by learning data distributions through iterative noise addition and denoising. Inspired by DiffusionDet, which formulates object detection as a reverse diffusion process, this paper proposes a novel multiscale SAR ship detection method based on a diffusion model. During training, our model learns to recover ground-truth boxes from noised versions via a Markov chain. At inference, it detects ships of various scales directly from random boxes without anchor-based priors. To mitigate false alarms on land, we further introduce a segmentation-derived land-sea mask as structural prior knowledge. Extensive experiments on SAR ship datasets demonstrate that our method achieves competitive accuracy and robustness across diverse marine environments, offering a new perspective for scalable and efficient SAR target detection."

    "abstract": "Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that manifests with subtle structural changes in key brain regions, often occurring years before clinical symptoms appear. Early and accurate identification of volumetric biomarkers, such as the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, and ventricles, from MRI scans is essential for timely diagnosis and monitoring disease progression. However, existing deep learning models primarily focus on classification tasks and often fail to capture the region-specific anatomical nuances necessary for precise volumetric estimation. To address this limitation, we propose a novel hybrid architecture,MACSDE (Multi-head Autocorrelated Convolutional Squeeze Densely-connected Encoder), which combines spatially-aware multi-head correlated convolution with dense connectivity and attention-based recalibration. This architecture is designed to capture region-specific features, enhance inter-regional interactions, and prioritize Alzheimer-relevant channels for accurate volumetric predictions. The model incorporates a brain-wide feature extraction layer, a cognitive integration module, and a regression block tailored for volumetric output. Extensive experiments conducted on benchmark MRI datasets demonstrate the superior performance of MACSDE. Our results show that MACSDE achieves a 15% reduction in MAE, a 20% improvement in RMSE, and significantly higher correlation scores compared to existing methods. Specifically, the model outperforms state-of-the-art approaches like MRNN, PLSTM-Z, and Deep RNN, which show MAE values of 0.143, 0.305, and 0.059, respectively, while MACSDE reduces this to 0.0508. Similarly, RMSE improves from 3.951 (MRNN) and 2.929 (PLSTM-Z) to 1.125 for MACSDE, showing enhanced consistency in biomarker volume prediction. MACSDE offers competitive, state-of-the-art volumetric AD biomarker prediction performance in the 2024-2025 literature, as demonstrated by comparisons with recent advanced architectures."

Computer-aided expert systems are currently in high demand for helping with medical diagnostic and therapy suggestions. Many frameworks based on deep learning and machine learning are used to detect brain tumors. The purpose of this paper is to develop an effective deep learning framework for brain tumor segmentation and classification. The MRI scans are volumetrically segmented using the 3D-UNet model, and CNNs are then used to classify the tumor. The models' validity is demonstrated by the presentation of the loss and precision diagrams.

The VQC's trainable rotation gates are optimized via simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (SPSA) under realistic hardware-inspired noise models. Evaluated on UMSA-U, a curated dataset of 6,000 Urdu video clips with aligned transcripts, audio, and facial-expression annotations, our quantum-enhanced model achieves 84.2% overall accuracy and a macro-F1 score of 81.7% improving over both the classical cross-modal baseline (82.4%/79.6%) and a purely classical MLP head (83.1%/80.8%). Ablation studies demonstrate that quantum feature encoding yields more separable decision boundaries, and noise-robust SPSA tuning sustains performance on simulated hardware error rates up to 5%. These results showcase the promise of variational quantum classifiers for low-resource, multimodal language tasks and set a new benchmark for Urdu sentiment understanding on NISQ devices."
