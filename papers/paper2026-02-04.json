    "abstract": "The main contribution of this paper is to develop a hierarchical Bayesian formulation of PINNs for linear inverse problems, which is called BPINN-IP. The proposed methodology extends PINN to account for prior knowledge on the nature of the expected NN output, as well as its weights. Also, as we can have access to the posterior probability distributions, naturally uncertainties can be quantified. Also, variational inference and Monte Carlo dropout are employed to provide predictive means and variances for reconstructed images. Un example of applications to deconvolution and super-resolution is considered, details of the different steps of implementations are given, and some preliminary results are presented."

Using the optical theorem and the operator product expansion, we derive analytic results for fixed Mellin moments $N = 2$ to $22$ of the structure functions $F_2$ and $F_L$. Our results reproduce the known expressions in the relevant asymptotic limits, in particular for virtualities of the exchanged photon $Q^2$ much larger than the heavy-quark mass squared $m^2$, and are in agreement with existing parametrisations of the next-to-leading-order coefficient functions. The computational set-up developed in this work also provides a direct pathway toward extending these calculations to next-to-next-to-leading order."

    "abstract": "Remote unproctored assessments increasingly use messaging interventions to reduce cheating, but existing approaches lack theoretical grounding, focus narrowly on cheating suppression while overlooking performance and experience, and treat cheating as binary rather than continuous. This study examines whether messages based on 15 psychological concepts from self-determination, cognitive dissonance, social norms, and self-efficacy theories can reduce cheating while preserving performance and experience. Through an expert workshop (N=5), we developed 45 theory-informed messages and tested them with online participants (N=1232) who completed an incentivized anagram task. Participants were classified as non-cheaters (0% items cheated), partial-cheaters (1-99% cheated), or full-cheaters (100% cheated). Results show that concept-based messages reduced full-cheating occurrence by 42% (33% to 19%), increased non-cheating by 19% (53% to 63%), with no negative effects on performance or experience across integrity groups. Surprisingly, messages grounded in different theoretical concepts produced virtually identical effects. Analyses of self-rated psychological mechanisms revealed that messages influenced multiple mechanisms simultaneously rather than their intended targets, though these mechanisms predicted behavior, performance, and experience. These findings show that causal pathways are more complex than current theories predict. Practically, integrity interventions using supportive motivation rather than rule enforcement can reduce cheating without impairing performance or experience."

SWE-Bench is a benchmark designed to evaluate repair systems using real issues mined from popular open-source Python repositories. Its public leaderboards-SWE-Bench Lite and Verified-have become central platforms for tracking progress and comparing solutions. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study of these two leaderboards, examining who is submitting solutions, the products behind the submissions, the LLMs employed, and the openness of the approaches. We analyze 79 entries submitted to Lite leaderboard and 133 to Verified. Our results show that most entries on both leaderboards originate from industry, particularly small companies and large publicly traded companies. These submissions often achieve top results, although academic contributions-typically open source-also remain competitive. We also find a clear dominance of proprietary LLMs, especially Claude family, with state-of-the-art results on both leaderboards currently achieved by Claude 4 Sonnet. These findings offer insights into the SWE-Bench ecosystem that can guide greater transparency and diversity in future benchmark-driven research."

Extending generalized splines are a further extension of generalized splines by allowing vertex labels of $G$ to lie in varying modules rather than in a fixed ring $R$. Geometrically, this corresponds to the construction of equivariant cohomology by Braden and MacPherson (see [5]). Therefore, characterizing such splines has immediate implications in geometry, particularly in the computation of equivariant cohomology. In this paper, we study extending generalized splines as a $R$- module in which each vertex $v$ is labeled by $M_v = m_v R$ and each edge $e$ is labeled by $M_e = R/r_e R$ together with quotient $R$-module homomorphisms $M_v\\to M_e$ for each vertex $v$ incident to the edge $e$, where $R$ is a greatest common divisor domain (GCD). We characterize module bases of such splines in terms of determinants so that it provides a criterion for freeness of spline modules."

    "abstract": "Hand gesture recognition (HGR) is a fundamental technology in human computer interaction (HCI).In particular, HGR based on Doppler radar signals is suited for in-vehicle interfaces and robotic systems, necessitating lightweight and computationally efficient recognition techniques. However, conventional deep learning-based methods still suffer from high computational costs. To address this issue, we propose an Echo State Network (ESN) approach for radar-based HGR, using frequency-modulated-continuous-wave (FMCW) radar signals. Raw radar data is first converted into feature maps, such as range-time and Doppler-time maps, which are then fed into one or more recurrent neural network-based reservoirs. The obtained reservoir states are processed by readout classifiers, including ridge regression, support vector machines, and random forests. Comparative experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches on an 11-class HGR task using the Soli dataset and surpasses existing deep learning models on a 4-class HGR task using the Dop-NET dataset. The results indicate that parallel processing using multi-reservoir ESNs are effective for recognizing temporal patterns from the multiple different feature maps in the time-space and time-frequency domains. Our ESN approaches achieve high recognition performance with low computational cost in HGR, showing great potential for more advanced HCI technologies, especially in resource-constrained environments."

In this study, we present a machine learning (ML)-driven framework that leverages advanced models, including Time Series Forest (TSF), Random Forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and a simple feedforward neural network (NN), to classify crystal systems, point groups, and space groups from XRD data of perovskite materials. To address class imbalance and enhance model robustness, we integrated feature augmentation strategies such as Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE), class weighting, jittering, and spectrum shifting, along with efficient data preprocessing pipelines. The TSF model with SMOTE augmentation achieved strong performance for crystal system prediction, with a Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) of 0.9, an F1 score of 0.92, and an accuracy of 97.76%. For point and space group prediction, balanced accuracies above 95% were obtained. The model demonstrated high performance for symmetry-distinct classes, including cubic crystal systems, point groups 3m and m-3m, and space groups Pnma and Pnnn.

Related research proposed using a bivariate standard deviation; however, the proposal was only tested using a single speed-accuracy bias condition, thus the assessment was limited. We compared the univariate and bivariate techniques in a 2D Fitts' law experiment using three speed-accuracy biases and 346 crowdworkers. Calculating W_e using the univariate standard deviation yielded higher model correlations across all bias conditions and produced more stable throughput among the biases. The findings were also consistent in cases using randomly sampled subsets of the participant data. We recommend that future research should calculate W_e using the univariate standard deviation for fair performance evaluations. Also, we found trivial effects when using nominal or effective amplitude and using different perspectives of the task axis."

Inspired by the seminal work of Caravenna, Sun and Zygouras \\cite{csz_2016}, we adopt a general framework that encompasses as key examples both the disordered pinning model and the long-range directed polymer model. We provide some subcriticality condition under which we prove that the discrete disordered system possesses a non-trivial scaling limit. We also interpret the subcriticality condition in terms of a generalized Harris criterion without second moment, which gives a prediction for disorder relevance depending on the parameters of the system. Our analysis relies on the study of multilinear polynomials of independent heavy-tailed random variables known as polynomial chaos and their continuous analogue, given by multiple integrals with respect to a $γ$-stable Lévy white noise. We develop precise and flexible moments estimates adapted to the heavy-tailed setting."

    "abstract": "Activation steering has emerged as a cost-effective paradigm for modifying large language model (LLM) behaviors. Existing methods typically intervene at the block level, steering the bundled activations of selected attention heads, feedforward networks, or residual streams. However, we reveal that block-level activations are inherently heterogeneous, entangling beneficial, irrelevant, and harmful features, thereby rendering block-level steering coarse, inefficient, and intrusive. To investigate the root cause, we decompose block activations into fine-grained atomic unit (AU)-level activations, where each AU-level activation corresponds to a single dimension of the block activation, and each AU denotes a slice of the block weight matrix. Steering an AU-level activation is thus equivalent to steering its associated AU. Our theoretical and empirical analysis show that heterogeneity arises because different AUs or dimensions control distinct token distributions in LLM outputs. Hence, block-level steering inevitably moves helpful and harmful token directions together, which reduces efficiency. Restricting intervention to beneficial AUs yields more precise and effective steering. Building on this insight, we propose AUSteer, a simple and efficient method that operates at a finer granularity of the AU level. AUSteer first identifies discriminative AUs globally by computing activation momenta on contrastive samples. It then assigns adaptive steering strengths tailored to diverse inputs and selected AU activations. Comprehensive experiments on multiple LLMs and tasks show that AUSteer consistently surpasses advanced baselines while steering considerably fewer activations, demonstrating that steering less achieves more."

The recently discovered system PTF1 J2238+7430 is a candidate for this evolutionary channel, hosting a low-mass sdB and a comparatively massive WD in a compact orbit. We aim to reproduce the evolutionary history of PTF1 J2238+7430, in which the sdB forms first via stable mass transfer, followed by the formation of the WD through a subsequent common-envelope (CE) phase. Additionally, we seek to constrain the range of initial binary parameters that can lead to such double-detonation progenitors. Using the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA), we performed detailed binary evolution simulations from the zero-age main sequence to the present-day configuration. We explored initial stellar masses, orbital periods, and mass-loss fractions, including the effects of angular momentum transfer, tidal synchronization, and gravitational-wave-driven orbital evolution. The post-CE binary properties were derived using the standard energy formalism. Our models successfully reproduce the observed properties of PTF1 J2238+7430, consisting of a 0.406 solar-mass sdB and a 0.72 solar-mass WD in a 76.34-minute orbit. Stable Roche-lobe overflow of an approximately 2.7 solar-mass donor produces the sdB, while the WD forms from the initially less massive companion during an episode of CE evolution. We find that the CE ejection efficiency must be high to match the observed orbit, exceeding canonical values for similar systems. We further delineate the allowed parameter space for initial binaries that can evolve into sdB+WD systems consistent with double-detonation progenitors. These limits are preliminary; a systematic exploration of all parameters is needed for robust constraints, but our results provide a useful starting point for future work."

Action sequences are generated by computing graph edit operations between the goal and belief graphs, ordered by temporal dependencies and movement costs. This approach seamlessly combines exploration and sequential manipulation planning. In ablation studies across 46 realistic household scenes and 5 long-horizon daily object transportation tasks, EPoG achieved a success rate of 91.3%, reducing travel distance by 36.1% on average.

We assess segmentation, classification, modality alignment (retrieval), and VQA tasks.

    "abstract": "Diffusion Models generate data by reversing a stochastic diffusion process, progressively transforming noise into structured samples drawn from a target distribution. Recent theoretical work has shown that this backward dynamics can undergo sharp qualitative transitions, known as speciation transitions, during which trajectories become dynamically committed to data classes. Existing theoretical analyses, however, are limited to settings where classes are identifiable through first moments, such as mixtures of Gaussians with well-separated means. In this work, we develop a general theory of speciation in diffusion models that applies to arbitrary target distributions admitting well-defined classes. We formalize the notion of class structure through Bayes classification and characterize speciation times in terms of free-entropy difference between classes. This criterion recovers known results in previously studied Gaussian-mixture models, while extending to situations in which classes are not distinguishable by first moments and may instead differ through higher-order or collective features. Our framework also accommodates multiple classes and predicts the existence of successive speciation times associated with increasingly fine-grained class commitment. We illustrate the theory on two analytically tractable examples: mixtures of one-dimensional Ising models at different temperatures and mixtures of zero-mean Gaussians with distinct covariance structures. In the Ising case, we obtain explicit expressions for speciation times by mapping the problem onto a random-field Ising model and solving it via the replica method. Our results provide a unified and broadly applicable description of speciation transitions in diffusion-based generative models."

    "abstract": "Performative predictions influence the very outcomes they aim to forecast. We study performative predictions that affect a sample (e.g., only existing users of an app) and/or the whole population (e.g., all potential app users). This raises the question of how well models generalize under performativity. For example, how well can we draw insights about new app users based on existing users when both of them react to the app's predictions? We address this question by embedding performative predictions into statistical learning theory. We prove generalization bounds under performative effects on the sample, on the population, and on both. A key intuition behind our proofs is that in the worst case, the population negates predictions, while the sample deceptively fulfills them. We cast such self-negating and self-fulfilling predictions as min-max and min-min risk functionals in Wasserstein space, respectively. Our analysis reveals a fundamental trade-off between performatively changing the world and learning from it: the more a model affects data, the less it can learn from it. Moreover, our analysis results in a surprising insight on how to improve generalization guarantees by retraining on performatively distorted samples. We illustrate our bounds in a case study on prediction-informed assignments of unemployed German residents to job trainings, drawing upon administrative labor market records from 1975 to 2017 in Germany."

The probability density function of the USh distribution is sufficiently flexible to model both left- and right-skewed data, while its hazard rate function is capable of capturing various failure-rate patterns, including increasing, bathtub-shaped, and J-shaped forms. Several statistical properties of the proposed distribution are investigated, including moments and related measures, the quantile function, entropy, and stress-strength reliability. Parameter estimation is carried out using the maximum likelihood method, and its performance is evaluated through a simulation study. The practical usefulness of the USh distribution is demonstrated using four real-life data sets, and its performance is compared with several well-known competing unit distributions. The comparative results indicate that the proposed model fits the data better than the competitive models applied in this study."

For craft communities that value relational practices, abstractions limit the adoption and creative uptake of computational tools which might otherwise be beneficial. To understand how better tool design could support richer relations between individuals, tools, and materials, we interviewed expert woodworkers, fiber artists, and metalworkers. We identify three orders of convivial relations central to craft: immediate relations between individuals, tools, and materials; mid-range relations between communities, platforms, and shared materials; and extended relations between institutions, infrastructures, and ecologies. Our analysis shows how craftspeople engage and struggle with convivial relations across all three orders, creating workflows that learn from materials while supporting autonomy. We conclude with design principles for computational tools and infrastructures to better support material dialogue, collective knowledge, and accountability, along with richer and more convivial relations between craftspeople, tools, and the material worlds around them."

    "abstract": "Symmetry constraints determine which physical responses are allowed in a given system. Magnetization induced by strain fields, such as in piezomagnetic and flexomagnetic effects, has typically been considered in materials that break time-reversal symmetry. Here, we propose that nonuniform strain can induce magnetization even in nonmagnetic metals and semiconductors that preserve time-reversal symmetry. This mechanism differs from the conventional flexomagnetic effect: the strain gradient acts as a driving force on the electrons, generating magnetization in a manner closely analogous to current-induced magnetization. Treating the strain field as an external field, we derive a general expression for the magnetization induced by a strain gradient and demonstrate that this response is symmetry-allowed even in time-reversal symmetric systems. We apply our formulation to nonmagnetic systems that lack spatial inversion symmetry while preserving time-reversal symmetry, using a decorated square lattice, monolayer MoS$_2$, and monolayer Janus MoSSe as representative examples. We find a finite magnetization response to strain gradients, which is consistent with symmetry arguments, supporting the validity of our theoretical framework. These results offer a pathway for controlling magnetization in nonmagnetic materials using strain fields."

    "abstract": "The pure traction problem of elasticity appears frequently in engineering applications, and its complexity stems from the fact that its solution is unique only up to (infinitesimal) rigid body motions. When finite elements are employed to approximate this problem, one solution is typically singled out by applying carefully selected boundary conditions on the discrete model or by imposing global constraints on the deformation. However, neither of these strategies is both simple and computationally efficient. In this work, we propose a new approach to solving the pure traction problem that overcomes existing limitations. Our method builds on a regularized form of the problem whose solution is shown to be unique, converges to the original solution of minimal norm, and can be approximated with finite elements in a straightforward way, without additional degrees of freedom. Additionally, we analyze the situation in which the approximation of the solution domain renders the loading of the discretized problem non-equilibrated, making the problem ill-posed. In this case, we propose a regularized predictor--corrector finite element formulation that handles the incompatibilities of the loading, providing a solution that converges to that of the original Neumann problem as the mesh size and the regularizing parameter tend to zero. Numerical examples illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach for representative problems in mechanics where pure traction boundary conditions appear."

    "abstract": "Achieving ubiquitous global connectivity requires integrating satellite and terrestrial networks, particularly to serve remote and underserved regions. In this work, we investigate the design and optimization of Space-Terrestrial Integrated Networks (STINs) using a hybrid quantum-classical approach. We formalize three key combinatorial optimization problems: the Satellite Selection Problem (SSP), the Gateway Selection Problem (GSP), and the Spectrum Assignment Problem (SAP), each capturing critical aspects of network deployment and operation. Leveraging neutral-atom quantum processors, we map the SSP onto a Maximum Weight Independent Set problem, embedding it onto the Aquila platform and solving it via the Quantum Adiabatic Algorithm (QAA). Postprocessing ensures feasible solutions that guide downstream GSP and SAP optimization. Benchmarking across 165 realistic remote regions shows that QAA solutions closely match classical exact solvers and outperform greedy heuristics, while subsequent GSP and SAP outcomes remain largely robust to differences in initial satellite selection. These results demonstrate that quantum optimization achieves performance broadly comparable to classical approaches for end-to-end STIN design, with rare instances where it can even surpass state-of-the-art solvers. This suggests that, while not yet consistently superior, quantum methods may offer competitive advantages for larger or more complex instances of the underlying combinatorial subproblems."

The influence of charging dynamics is explored using an enhanced one-dimensional fluid-Poisson model, where the source charge is treated as a dynamical variable and solved self-consistently alongside the core plasma equations. By comparing these results with prior fixed-charge models, we evaluate the effects on soliton onset and propagation, finding that charging dynamics does not hinder soliton generation or evolution. To assess the impact of the impermeability of debris surface, a two-dimensional fluid model simulates the interaction between an electrostatically biased, impenetrable object and a flowing plasma. Modeling the object as an infinite wall disconnects the upstream and downstream plasma regions, forming a sheath without solitons -- consistent with earlier fluid and particle-in-cell simulations. However, replacing the wall with a finite object enables plasma flow around it, restoring upstream-downstream connectivity and naturally generating precursor solitons."

This paper proposes the SDD Planner, a diffusion-based framework designed to effectively reconcile safety constraints with driving styles in real time. The framework integrates two core modules: a Multi-Source Style-Aware Encoder, which employs distance-sensitive attention to fuse dynamic agent data and environmental contexts for heterogeneous safety-style perception; and a Style-Guided Dynamic Trajectory Generator, which adaptively modulates priority weights within the diffusion denoising process to generate user-preferred yet safe trajectories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SDD Planner achieves state-of-the-art performance. On the StyleDrive benchmark, it improves the SM-PDMS metric by 3.9% over WoTE, the strongest baseline. Furthermore, on the NuPlan Test14 and Test14-hard benchmarks, SDD Planner ranks first with overall scores of 91.76 and 80.32, respectively, outperforming leading methods such as PLUTO. Real-vehicle closed-loop tests further confirm that SDD Planner maintains high safety standards while aligning with preset driving styles, validating its practical applicability for real-world deployment."

Learning invariant representations from large-scale unlabeled visual data with various pretrained models in a fully unsupervised transfer manner remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose a multiview self-representation learning (MSRL) method in which invariant representations are learned by exploiting the self-representation property of features across heterogeneous views. The features are derived from large-scale unlabeled visual data through transfer learning with various pretrained models and are referred to as heterogeneous multiview data. An individual linear model is stacked on top of its corresponding frozen pretrained backbone. We introduce an information-passing mechanism that relies on self-representation learning to support feature aggregation over the outputs of the linear model. Moreover, an assignment probability distribution consistency scheme is presented to guide multiview self-representation learning by exploiting complementary information across different views. Consequently, representation invariance across different linear models is enforced through this scheme. In addition, we provide a theoretical analysis of the information-passing mechanism, the assignment probability distribution consistency and the incremental views. Extensive experiments with multiple benchmark visual datasets demonstrate that the proposed MSRL method consistently outperforms several state-of-the-art approaches."

This motivates us to define the congruence density cd$(L)$ of a finite $n$-element lattice as $|$Con$(L)|/2^{n-1}$, where $|$Con$(L)|$ is the number of elements of the congruence lattice Con$(L)$ of $L$. We prove that whenever $L$ is a finite lattice with cd$(L)>3/32$, then $L$ has the same number of join-irreducible and meet-irreducible elements. This result is sharp, since there exists a six-element lattice $R_6$ with cd$(R_6)=3/32$ but fewer join-irreducible than meet-irreducible elements. By R. Freese, C. Mureşan, J. Kulin, and the present author's results, lattices with congruence densities larger than $1/8$ have already been described. Here we decrease the lower threshold from $1/8$ to $3/32$. That is, we describe all finite lattices $L$ such that cd$(L)>3/32$. As a corollary, we give the $k$th largest number of congruences of $n$-element lattices for $n>8$ and $k\\in\\{n+1, n+2, n+3,n+4\\}$."

    "abstract": "Biodiversity open-access databases are valuable resources in the structuring and accessibility of species occurrence data. By compiling different data sources, they reveal the uneven spatial distribution of knowledge, with areas or taxonomic groups better prospected than others. Understanding the determinants of spatial and taxonomic knowledge gaps helps in informing the use of open-access data. Here, we identified knowledge gaps' determinants within a French regional biodiversity database, in the largest administrative region in France. Knowledge gaps were assessed using two metrics, completeness and ignorance scores, for 8 taxonomic groups covering five vertebrates and three invertebrates groups. The data was analyzed for the entire region, but also at the level of the three former sub-regions, to identify the potential drivers that may account for knowledge gaps' determinants. Our findings show that invertebrates were characterized by higher knowledge gaps than vertebrates. Overall, knowledge gaps are influenced by variables related to sites' accessibility rather than ecological appeal across both metrics. All groups shared similar determinants of gaps, except for the impact of agricultural pressure which is found to be more significant for invertebrates than vertebrates. Ultimately, our study emphasizes the impact of biodiversity governance, through local funding and regional political decisions, on knowledge distribution in open-access databases. We recommend limiting these biases by redirecting biodiversity funding towards under-sampled taxonomic groups and under-prospected areas. When not possible, users of data extracted from these databases should correct for spatial-sampling biases (SSP) using knowledge gaps' maps in order to get a more accurate understanding of species occurrence."

To address this gap, we constructed MIND, a public motor imagery fNIRS-EEG dataset based on a four-class directional MI paradigm of the right upper limb. The dataset includes 64-channel EEG recordings (1000 Hz) and 51-channel fNIRS recordings (47.62 Hz) from 30 participants (12 females, 18 males; aged 19.0-25.0 years). We analyse the spatiotemporal characteristics of EEG spectral power and hemodynamic responses, and validate the potential advantages of hybrid fNIRS-EEG BCIs in terms of classification accuracy. We expect that this dataset will facilitate the evaluation and comparison of neuroimaging analysis and decoding methods."

Applied to a range of state-of-the-art coders and games, our approach uncovers notable discrepancies between benchmark scores and actual performance in dynamic settings, revealing overlooked limitations and opportunities for improvement.

In this work, we shift perspective by introducing a principled definition of an event as the smallest semantically self-contained action or state change in a text prompt that can be temporally aligned with a motion segment. Building on this definition, we propose Event-T2M, a diffusion-based framework that decomposes prompts into events, encodes each with a motion-aware retrieval model, and integrates them through event-based cross-attention in Conformer blocks. Existing benchmarks mix simple and multi-event prompts, making it unclear whether models that succeed on single actions generalize to multi-action cases. To address this, we construct HumanML3D-E, the first benchmark stratified by event count. Experiments on HumanML3D, KIT-ML, and HumanML3D-E show that Event-T2M matches state-of-the-art baselines on standard tests while outperforming them as event complexity increases. Human studies validate the plausibility of our event definition, the reliability of HumanML3D-E, and the superiority of Event-T2M in generating multi-event motions that preserve order and naturalness close to ground-truth. These results establish event-level conditioning as a generalizable principle for advancing text-to-motion generation beyond single-action prompts."

Herein, we report a robust, high-contrast, and recyclable zinc-based dynamic window enabled by a synergistic electrolyte and interfacial engineering strategy. Molecular dynamics simulations and electrochemical analyses reveal a dual-ion cooperative mechanism that governs the reversibility: anions with the strongest binding affinity guide uniform Zn deposition by stabilizing the inner solvation shell, while formate anions co-enriched at the interface facilitate smooth stripping via protonation during the oxidation process. This orchestrated interplay effectively eliminates \"dead Zn\" accumulation and dendrite growth. Consequently, the device demonstrates a record-high lifespan of 15,000 cycles with negligible degradation and maintains a large optical modulation of >50%, along with multiple optical states (transparent, gray, black, and mirror). Furthermore, it achieves a large reflectance modulation (>50%) stable for over 2,000 cycles. This work establishes the recyclable zinc-based dynamic window as a scalable, high-performance alternative to conventional electrochromic systems, advancing the feasibility of solution-processed energy-saving windows in sustainable buildings."

Photoplethysmography (PPG) has emerged as a promising screening modality due to its widespread availability in wearable devices and its ability to reflect underlying hemodynamic dynamics. However, the extreme scarcity of gold-standard labeled PPG data severely constrains the effectiveness of data-driven approaches. To address this challenge, we propose and validate a new paradigm, Physiology-Guided Self-Supervised Learning (PG-SSL), aimed at unlocking the value of large-scale unlabeled PPG data for efficient screening of Aortic Stenosis (AS) and Aortic Regurgitation (AR). Using over 170,000 unlabeled PPG samples from the UK Biobank, we formalize clinical knowledge into a set of PPG morphological phenotypes and construct a pulse pattern recognition proxy task for self-supervised pre-training. A dual-branch, gated-fusion architecture is then employed for efficient fine-tuning on a small labeled subset. The proposed PG-SSL framework achieves AUCs of 0.765 and 0.776 for AS and AR screening, respectively, significantly outperforming supervised baselines trained on limited labeled data. Multivariable analysis further validates the model output as an independent digital biomarker with sustained prognostic value after adjustment for standard clinical risk factors. This study demonstrates that PG-SSL provides an effective, domain knowledge-driven solution to label scarcity in medical artificial intelligence and shows strong potential for enabling low-cost, large-scale early screening of aortic valve disease."

In this work, we introduce T2T(Thickening-to-Thinning), a dynamic reward framework inspired by human learning processes. Specifically, it implements a dual-phase mechanism: (1) On incorrect attempts, T2T incentivizes \"thickening\" (longer trajectories) to broaden the search space and explore novel solution paths; (2) Upon achieving correctness, it shifts to \"thinning\", imposing length penalties to discourage redundancy, thereby fostering model confidence and crystallizing reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments on mathematical benchmarks (MATH-500, AIME, AMC) across Qwen-series and Deepseek models demonstrate that T2T significantly outperforms standard GRPO and recent baselines, achieving superior performance."

Here, we report a purely geometric scheme for achieving massive equipartition of coherent light on a photonic chip by leveraging the geometric phases of a null space spanned by degenerate states with zero eigenvalue. The evolution of the null space maps to real-space rotation described by the special orthogonal group SO(N), thus enabling precise and scalable control over light distribution by engineering the system parameters. We experimentally realize up to one-to-nine equipartition of light on a waveguide array fabricated on a glass-based photonic chip. The framework can be upscaled for one-to-N light distribution. This work establishes a versatile and scalable platform for integrated coherent light sources, paving the way for integrated photonic applications such as quantum photonics and optical computing."

Stage 1 trains a transformer policy via reinforcement learning to produce high-quality hard pseudo-labels; Stage 2 describes feature selection as a sequential reinforcement learning problem, selecting features step by step and outputting an interpretable global ranking. We further provide the theoretical analysis of PML-POMDP correspondence and the excess-risk bound that decompose the error into pseudo label quality term and sample size.

Using part-of-speech (POS) tagging as a controlled downstream task, we show that OBPE consistently achieves stronger morphological alignment and higher tagging accuracy than conventional methods, particularly within the Latin-script group. These gains arise from reduced fragmentation in open-class categories and a better balance across the frequency spectrum. Transfer efficacy further depends on the downstream tagging architecture, interacting with both training volume and genealogical proximity.

    "abstract": "Language-guided grasping has emerged as a promising paradigm for enabling robots to identify and manipulate target objects through natural language instructions, yet it remains highly challenging in cluttered or occluded scenes. Existing methods often rely on multi-stage pipelines that separate object perception and grasping, which leads to limited cross-modal fusion, redundant computation, and poor generalization in cluttered, occluded, or low-texture scenes. To address these limitations, we propose GeoLanG, an end-to-end multi-task framework built upon the CLIP architecture that unifies visual and linguistic inputs into a shared representation space for robust semantic alignment and improved generalization. To enhance target discrimination under occlusion and low-texture conditions, we explore a more effective use of depth information through the Depth-guided Geometric Module (DGGM), which converts depth into explicit geometric priors and injects them into the attention mechanism without additional computational overhead. In addition, we propose Adaptive Dense Channel Integration, which adaptively balances the contributions of multi-layer features to produce more discriminative and generalizable visual representations. Extensive experiments on the OCID-VLG dataset, as well as in both simulation and real-world hardware, demonstrate that GeoLanG enables precise and robust language-guided grasping in complex, cluttered environments, paving the way toward more reliable multimodal robotic manipulation in real-world human-centric settings."

    "abstract": "Estimating total treatment effects in the presence of network interference typically requires knowledge of the underlying interaction structure. However, in many practical settings, network data is either unavailable, incomplete, or measured with substantial error. We demonstrate that causal message passing, a methodology that leverages temporal structure in outcome data rather than network topology, can recover total treatment effects comparable to network-aware approaches. We apply causal message passing to two large-scale field experiments where a recently developed bipartite graph methodology, which requires network knowledge, serves as a benchmark. Despite having no access to the interaction network, causal message passing produces effect estimates that match the network-aware approach in direction across all metrics and in statistical significance for the primary decision metric. Our findings validate the premise of causal message passing: that temporal variation in outcomes can serve as an effective substitute for network observation when estimating spillover effects. This has important practical implications: practitioners facing settings where network data is costly to collect, proprietary, or unreliable can instead exploit the temporal dynamics of their experimental data."

    "source": "arXiv",
    "abstract": "Relativistic quantum field theory (QFT) is commonly formulated in terms of operators, asymptotic states, and covariant amplitudes, a perspective that tends to obscure the real-time origin of field dynamics and correlations. Here we formulate quantum fields in a real-time Schrödinger-picture framework, in which fields evolve as probability ensembles on the space of field configurations. Within this formulation, the wavefunctional $Ψ[φ,t]$ encodes a first-order, causal ensemble dynamics on configuration space. Interactions appear as couplings between configuration-space directions, while propagators arise as derived correlation structures rather than as fundamental postulates. Entanglement, scattering amplitudes, and conformal field theory correlators emerge as distinct projections of the same underlying ensemble evolution, corresponding to equal-time, asymptotic, and symmetry-organized observables. Standard operator, diagrammatic, and path-integral formulations are recovered as computational representations of this single real-time dynamics. This organization makes explicit the distinction between fundamental dynamical structure and representational tools in QFT, and clarifies the scope within which ensemble-averaged correlators account for quantum fluctuations, while also delineating the level at which questions associated with individual realizations and randomness would arise beyond the correlator-based field-theoretic description."

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the robust optimal control of sampled-data stochastic systems with multiplicative noise and distributional ambiguity. We consider a class of discrete-time optimal control problems where the controller \\emph{jointly} selects a feedback policy and a sampling period to maximize the worst-case expected concave utility of the inter-sample growth factor. Modeling uncertainty via a Wasserstein ambiguity set, we confront the structural obstacle of~``concave-max'' geometry arising from maximizing a concave utility against an adversarial distribution. Unlike standard convex loss minimization, the dual reformulation here requires a minimax interchange within the semi-infinite constraints, where the utility's concavity precludes exact strong duality. To address this, we utilize a general minimax inequality to derive a tractable convex relaxation. Our approach yields a rigorous lower bound that functions as a probabilistic performance guarantee. We establish an explicit, non-asymptotic bound on the resulting duality gap, proving that the approximation error is uniformly controlled by the Lipschitz-smoothness of the stage reward and the diameter of the disturbance support. Furthermore, we introduce necessary and sufficient conditions for \\emph{robust viability}, ensuring state positivity invariance across the entire ambiguity set. Finally, we bridge the gap between static optimization and dynamic performance, proving that the optimal value of the relaxation serves as a rigorous deterministic floor for the asymptotic average utility rate almost surely. The framework is illustrated on a log-optimal portfolio control problem, which serves as a canonical instance of multiplicative stochastic control."

    "abstract": "Transformer-based models have shown strong performance in speech deepfake detection, largely due to the effectiveness of the multi-head self-attention (MHSA) mechanism. MHSA provides frame-level attention scores, which are particularly valuable because deepfake artifacts often occur in small, localized regions along the temporal dimension of speech. This makes fine-grained frame modeling essential for accurately detecting subtle spoofing cues. In this work, we propose fine-grained frame modeling (FGFM) for MHSA-based speech deepfake detection, where the most informative frames are first selected through a multi-head voting (MHV) module. These selected frames are then refined via a cross-layer refinement (CLR) module to enhance the model's ability to learn subtle spoofing cues. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the baseline model and achieves Equal Error Rate (EER) of 0.90%, 1.88%, and 6.64% on the LA21, DF21, and ITW datasets, respectively. These consistent improvements across multiple benchmarks highlight the effectiveness of our fine-grained modeling for robust speech deepfake detection."

It had been proposed that unclustered tracers (with bias $b_1=0$) could be optimal for PNG studies, and that these could be found by selecting galaxies in bins of their local density. Here, we test this hypothesis in state-of-the-art simulations from the PNG-UNITsim suite with local $f_{\\rm NL}=100$ and $f_{\\rm NL}=-20$. We consider different parent tracer catalogues: all halos together, halos in large mass bins, and HOD models for LRGs and QSO. We then classify these tracers by their local density ($δ_{t,R}$) and measure the linear bias ($b_1$) and PNG-response ($b_φ$). Most $δ_{t,R}$ bins show a PNG-response compatible with $b_φ=0$ for all halos or the low-mass bin (log$M<11$). For high-mass halos (log$M>$12), QSO or LRG, we recover a trend closer to the universality relation ($b_φ= 2 δ_{\\rm crit}(b_1-1)$) for $b_1>1$, but the $b_φ(b_1)$ curve flattens to 0 below $\\vert b_1\\lvert<1$. Hence, we find $b_φ\\approx0$ for all bias-zero tracers considered. The complex $δ_{t,R}$-based selection causes their clustering to strongly deviate from simple assumptions, namely the universality relation and Poisson shot noise, hindering their capability to constrain PNG."

    "abstract": "Detecting uncivil language is crucial for maintaining safe, inclusive, and democratic online spaces. Yet existing classifiers often misinterpret posts containing uncivil cues but expressing civil intents, leading to inflated estimates of harmful incivility online. We introduce LinGO, a linguistic graph optimization framework for large language models (LLMs) that leverages linguistic structures and optimization techniques to classify multi-class intents of incivility that use various direct and indirect expressions. LinGO decomposes language into multi-step linguistic components, identifies targeted steps that cause the most errors, and iteratively optimizes prompt and/or example components for targeted steps. We evaluate it using a dataset collected during the 2022 Brazilian presidential election, encompassing four forms of political incivility: Impoliteness (IMP), Hate Speech and Stereotyping (HSST), Physical Harm and Violent Political Rhetoric (PHAVPR), and Threats to Democratic Institutions and Values (THREAT). Each instance is annotated with six types of civil/uncivil intent. We benchmark LinGO using three cost-efficient LLMs: GPT-5-mini, Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite, and Claude 3 Haiku, and four optimization techniques: TextGrad, AdalFlow, DSPy, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). The results show that, across all models, LinGO consistently improves accuracy and weighted F1 compared with zero-shot, chain-of-thought, direct optimization, and fine-tuning baselines. RAG is the strongest optimization technique and, when paired with Gemini model, achieves the best overall performance. These findings demonstrate that incorporating multi-step linguistic components into LLM instructions and optimize targeted components can help the models explain complex semantic meanings, which can be extended to other complex semantic explanation tasks in the future."

Local studies typically rely on limited indicators (e.g., firm-level data, patents, basic socioeconomic measures), with few offering a systematic framework integrating urban form, mobility, amenities, and human-capital proxies at the neighborhood scale. Our study investigates innovation at a finer spatial resolution, going beyond proprietary or static indicators. We develop the Local Innovation Determinants (LID) database and framework to identify key enabling factors across regions, combining traditional government data with publicly available data via APIs for a more granular understanding of spatial dynamics shaping innovation capacity. Using exploratory big and geospatial data analytics and random forest models, we examine neighborhoods in New York and Massachusetts across four dimensions: social factors, economic characteristics, land use and mobility, morphology, and environment. Results show that alternative data sources offer significant yet underexplored potential to enhance insights into innovation dynamics. City policymakers should consider neighborhood-specific determinants and characteristics when designing and implementing local innovation strategies."

    "abstract": "Physics informed neural networks provide a meshfree framework for solving partial differential equations by embedding governing physical laws directly into the training process. However, most PINNs developed for fluid dynamics remain restricted to fixed flow parameters, requiring retraining for each new condition and limiting their usefulness as general purpose solvers. In this work, we develop a parameterized PINNs formulation for the incompressible Navier Stokes equations in which the Reynolds number (Re) is treated as an explicit network input, enabling a single trained model to represent a continuous family of flow solutions. The approach is demonstrated using the 2D lid driven cavity flow as a canonical benchmark. For low Re, where the flow is laminar and diffusion dominated, pure PINNs trained solely using the governing equations and boundary conditions accurately reproduce velocity and pressure fields across a wide range of Re, including cases not explicitly sampled during training. As the Re increases and the flow becomes increasingly convection dominated, the predictive accuracy of pure PINNs deteriorates due to stiffness and optimization imbalance. To address this limitation, a hybrid framework is introduced that combines transfer learning with sparse supervision from high fidelity CFD data. The resulting parameterized PINNs model accurately captures the Re dependence of the flow over both interpolation and limited extrapolation regimes while requiring CFD data only over a narrow subset of the parameter space. Detailed comparisons with OpenFOAM simulations demonstrate strong agreement in velocity profiles, and pressure fields. The results show that incorporating governing parameters directly into PINNs enables the construction of parametric Navier Stokes solvers, offering a promising route toward efficient reduced order modeling and data assisted simulation of fluid flows."

    "abstract": "Stochastic processes are often represented through orthonormal series expansions, a framework originating in the classical works of Loève and Karhunen and widely used for simulation and numerical approximation. While truncation error in such expansions has been extensively studied, practical models frequently involve an additional source of error arising from the approximation of coefficient functions when closed-form expressions are unavailable. The combined effect of these two errors remains insufficiently addressed in the literature. Building on the author's earlier work on reliability and accuracy estimates for $\\varphi$-sub-Gaussian processes, this paper extends the methodology to orthonormal polynomial systems that do not possess normalized generating functions in analytical form, including the Legendre, generalized Laguerre, and Gegenbauer families. New bounds are derived for models in $L_p(T)$ and $C([0,T])$ that simultaneously account for truncation and coefficient approximation. The resulting criteria provide practical guidance for selecting the number of series terms required to achieve prescribed levels of reliability and accuracy across a broader class of polynomial-based stochastic process models."

However, these tasks remain challenging because diffusion models have intractable likelihoods, which creates a barrier for directly applying popular policy-gradient type methods. Existing approaches primarily focus on crafting new objectives built on already heavily engineered LLM objectives, using ad hoc estimators for likelihood, without a thorough investigation into how such estimation affects overall algorithmic performance. In this work, we provide a systematic analysis of the RL design space by disentangling three factors: i) policy-gradient objectives, ii) likelihood estimators, and iii) rollout sampling schemes. We show that adopting an evidence lower bound (ELBO) based model likelihood estimator, computed only from the final generated sample, is the dominant factor enabling effective, efficient, and stable RL optimization, outweighing the impact of the specific policy-gradient loss functional. We validate our findings across multiple reward benchmarks using SD 3.5 Medium, and observe consistent trends across all tasks.

We use high-resolution VLT-ESPRESSO archival spectra to study 26 wide binaries with projected separations larger than 13,000 AU. By combining precise radial velocities with Gaia proper motions and parallaxes, we aim to test whether these systems are consistent with Newtonian gravity in the low acceleration regime. Methods. We use multiple radial velocity measurements and stellar parameters to remove systems affected by unresolved triples, chance alignments, or young systems. For the remaining binaries, we combine radial velocities (corrected for convective shift and gravitational redshift) with Gaia proper motions, parallaxes, and positions to attempt bound Newtonian orbital solutions Results. Fourteen of the 26 initial systems were discarded: 12 due to radial velocity variability indicating unresolved close binaries, one hosting a faint Gaia companion, and one too young. Of the remaining 12, nine can be fitted with bound orbital solution, while three show velocity differences too large to be reconciled with any bound Newtonian orbit. Conclusions. For the three systems that cannot be fitted with a bound orbit, repeated radial velocity observations allow us to confidently exclude, with one possible exception, unresolved triple stellar companions or massive close-in planets as causes. Given their likely large 3-dimensional separations, these binaries may have been dynamically perturbed or disrupted by stellar encounters or Galactic tides, and may no longer be gravitationally bound.

However, most existing methods rely on heuristics constructed based on inter-visual-token similarity or cross-modal visual-text similarity, which gives rise to certain limitations in compression performance and practical deployment. In contrast, we propose PIO-FVLM from the perspective of inference objectives, which transforms visual token compression into preserving output result invariance and selects tokens primarily by their importance to this goal. Specially, vision tokens are reordered with the guidance of token-level gradient saliency generated by our designed layer-local proxy loss, a coarse constraint from the current layer to the final result. Then the most valuable vision tokens are selected following the non-maximum suppression (NMS) principle. The proposed PIO-FVLM is training-free and compatible with FlashAttention, friendly to practical application and deployment. It can be deployed independently as an encoder-free method, or combined with encoder compression approaches like VisionZip for use as an encoder-involved method. On LLaVA-Next-7B, PIO-FVLM retains just 11.1% of visual tokens but maintains 97.2% of the original performance, with a 2.67$\\times$ prefill speedup, 2.11$\\times$ inference speedup, 6.22$\\times$ lower FLOPs, and 6.05$\\times$ reduced KV Cache overhead.

Two complementary approaches are developed, one based on a mean-field theory for order statistics, and the other on the replica method from the field of disordered systems. In all dimensions $d$, and for rotationally symmetric distributions, the optimal subset for large populations consists of all points lying outside a $d$-dimensional ball whose radius is determined self-consistently. For a single trait ($d=1$), the statistics of the maximal dispersion can be tackled for finite $N,M$ as well.

    "abstract": "Block sparsity is a widely exploited structure in sparse recovery, offering significant gains when signal blocks are known. Yet, practical signals often exhibit unknown block boundaries and isolated non-zero entries, which challenge traditional approaches. A promising method to handle such complex sparsity patterns is the difference-of-logs total variation (DoL-TV) regularized sparse Bayesian learning (SBL). However, due to the complex form of DoL-TV term, the resulting optimization problem is hard to solve. This paper develops a new optimization framework for the DoL-TV SBL cost function. By introducing an exponential reparameterization of the SBL hyperparameters, we reveal a novel structure that admits a majorization-minimization formulation and naturally extends to unknown noise variance estimation. Sparse recovery results on both synthetic data and extended source direction-of-arrival estimation demonstrate improved accuracy and runtime performance compared to benchmark methods."

    "abstract": "Extreme weather can substantially change electricity consumption behavior, causing load curves to exhibit sharp spikes and pronounced volatility. If forecasts are inaccurate during those periods, power systems are more likely to face supply shortfalls or localized overloads, forcing emergency actions such as load shedding and increasing the risk of service disruptions and public-safety impacts. This problem is inherently difficult because extreme events can trigger abrupt regime shifts in load patterns, while relevant extreme samples are rare and irregular, making reliable learning and calibration challenging. We propose AdaCNP, a probabilistic forecasting model for data-scarce condition. AdaCNP learns similarity in a shared embedding space. For each target data, it evaluates how relevant each historical context segment is to the current condition and reweights the context information accordingly. This design highlights the most informative historical evidence even when extreme samples are rare. It enables few-shot adaptation to previously unseen extreme patterns. AdaCNP also produces predictive distributions for risk-aware decision-making without expensive fine-tuning on the target domain. We evaluate AdaCNP on real-world power-system load data and compare it against a range of representative baselines. The results show that AdaCNP is more robust during extreme periods, reducing the mean squared error by 22\\% relative to the strongest baseline while achieving the lowest negative log-likelihood, indicating more reliable probabilistic outputs. These findings suggest that AdaCNP can effectively mitigate the combined impact of abrupt distribution shifts and scarce extreme samples, providing a more trustworthy forecasting for resilient power system operation under extreme events."

Most general purpose encoders, however, are trained on generic corpora with limited coverage of specialized domains. We introduce RexBERT, a family of BERT-style encoders designed specifically for e-commerce semantics. We make three contributions. First, we release Ecom-niverse, a 350 billion token corpus curated from diverse retail and shopping sources. We describe a modular pipeline that isolates and extracts e-commerce content from FineFineWeb and other open web resources, and characterize the resulting domain distribution. Second, we present a reproducible pretraining recipe building on ModernBERT's architectural advances. The recipe consists of three phases: general pre-training, context extension, and annealed domain specialization. Third, we train RexBERT models ranging from 17M to 400M parameters and evaluate them on token classification, semantic similarity, and general natural language understanding tasks using e-commerce datasets. Despite having 2-3x fewer parameters, RexBERT outperforms larger general-purpose encoders and matches or surpasses modern long-context models on domain-specific benchmarks. Our results demonstrate that high quality in-domain data combined with a principled training approach provides a stronger foundation for e-commerce applications than indiscriminate scaling alone."

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly being integrated into educational contexts, promising personalized support and increased efficiency. However, growing evidence suggests that the uncritical adoption of AI may produce unintended harms that extend beyond individual learning outcomes to affect broader societal goals. This paper examines the societal implications of AI in education through an integrative framework with four interrelated dimensions: cognition, agency, emotional well-being, and ethics. Drawing on research from education, cognitive science, psychology, and ethics, we synthesize existing evidence to show how AI-driven cognitive offloading, diminished learner agency, emotional disengagement, and surveillance-oriented practices can mutually reinforce one another. We argue that these dynamics risk undermining critical thinking, intellectual autonomy, emotional resilience, and trust, capacities that are foundational both for effective learning and also for democratic participation and informed civic engagement. Moreover, AI's impact is contingent on design and governance: pedagogically aligned, ethically grounded, and human-centered AI systems can scaffold effortful reasoning, support learner agency, and preserve meaningful social interaction. By integrating fragmented strands of prior research into a unified framework, this paper advances the discourse on responsible AI in education and offers actionable implications for educators, designers, and institutions. Ultimately, the paper contends that the central challenge is not whether AI should be used in education, but how it can be designed and governed to support learning while safeguarding the social and civic purposes of education."

However, there is currently no method for uncertainty decomposition in TabPFN. Because it behaves, in an idealised limit, as a Bayesian in-context learner, we cast the decomposition challenge as a Bayesian predictive inference (BPI) problem. The main computational tool in BPI, predictive Monte Carlo, is challenging to apply here as it requires simulating unmodeled covariates. We therefore pursue the asymptotic alternative, filling a gap in the theory for supervised settings by proving a predictive CLT under quasi-martingale conditions. We derive variance estimators determined by the volatility of predictive updates along the context. The resulting credible bands are fast to compute, target epistemic uncertainty, and achieve near-nominal frequentist coverage. For classification, we further obtain an entropy-based uncertainty decomposition."

Here, we realize a bifurcation-induced nonreciprocal lattice that supports robust propagation of elastic kink waves. Each unit is a prestrained, hinged-beam circulator that develops angular momentum bias during snap-through transitions between buckling states, producing an effective breaking of time reversal symmetry. Coupling such units into a hexagonal array yields a mechanically chiral network where localized soliton-like excitations propagate unidirectionally along interfaces and edges, immune to sharp bends. We demonstrate non-dispersive kink transport governed by a SineGordon type field whose effective bias encodes mechanical chirality. This framework bridges bifurcation dynamics and nonreciprocal transport, establishing a nonlinear route toward topological like mechanical functionality without magnetic or gyroscopic bias."

    "abstract": "Coordination in distributed systems is often hampered by communication latency, which degrades performance. Quantum entanglement offers fundamentally stronger correlations than classically achievable without communication. Crucially, these correlations manifest instantaneously upon measurement, irrespective of the physical distance separating the systems. We investigate the application of shared entanglement to a dual-work optimization problem in a distributed system comprising two servers. The system must process both a continuously available, preemptible baseline task and incoming customer requests arriving in pairs. System performance is characterized by the trade-off between baseline task throughput and customer waiting time. We present a rigorous analytical model demonstrating that when the baseline task throughput function is strictly convex, rewarding longer uninterrupted processing periods, entanglement-assisted routing strategies achieve Pareto-superior performance compared to optimal communication-free classical strategies. We prove this advantage through queueing-theoretic analysis, non-local game formulation, and computational certification of classical bounds. Our results identify distributed scheduling and coordination as a novel application domain for near-term entanglement-based quantum networks."

We demonstrate this by using the accelerated BrainScaleS-2 mixed-signal neuromorphic research platform and interfacing it directly to microphones and a servo-motor-driven actuator. Utilizing BrainScaleS-2's 1000-fold acceleration factor, we employ a spiking neural network to transform interaural time differences into a spatial code and thereby predict the location of sound sources. Our primary contributions are the first demonstrations of direct, continuous-valued sensor data injection into the analog compute units of the BrainScaleS-2 ASIC, and actuator control using its embedded microprocessors. This enables a fully on-chip processing pipeline$\\unicode{x2014}$from sensory input handling, via spiking neural network processing to physical action.

By adopting an AI-augmented annotation workflow that tightly integrates human expertise with LLM assistance, AIANO enables annotators to leverage AI suggestions while retaining full control over annotation decisions. In a within-subject user study ($n = 15$), participants created question-answering datasets using both a baseline tool and AIANO. AIANO nearly doubled annotation speed compared to the baseline while being easier to use and improving retrieval accuracy. These results demonstrate that AIANO's AI-augmented approach accelerates and enhances dataset creation for information retrieval tasks, advancing annotation capabilities in retrieval-intensive domains."

    "abstract": "The discovery of fractional charge excitations in new platforms offers crucial insights into strongly correlated quantum phases. While a range of fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) states have recently been observed in two-dimensional twisted moire systems, the theoretically anticipated filling factor v = -1/3 FQAH state has remained elusive, with debates centering on its nature of charge density wave or a topological Chern insulator. Here, we report the optical detection of a v = -1/3 FQAH state in twisted MoTe2 bilayers. Using photoluminescence (PL) and reflective magnetic circular dichroism (RMCD) techniques, we identify ferromagnetic states at filling factors v = -1, -2/3, and -1/3, all tunable by a vertical electric field. The corresponding Curie temperatures are approximately 11 K, 3.5 K, and 2.4 K, respectively. The -1/3 state emerges over a narrower electric field range and a lower temperature compared to the integer and other fractional states, indicating its fragile nature that may lead to its absence in previous reports. Notably, the PL spectra at v = -1/3 disperse as the out-of-plane magnetic field increases, consistent with a nontrivial topological origin. Theoretical calculations based on the exact diagonalization method further support the interpretation of this topologically non-trivial state."

While Fermi surface geometry has long been considered the primary driver of the instability, a full understanding of the lattice dynamics and electron-phonon role has remained elusive. Our first principles calculations in the high-symmetry phase show that the Fermi surface is correctly reproduced only when the Hubbard interaction on the Te $5p$ orbitals is included, which in turn is essential for the appearance of a soft harmonic phonon mode at the CDW wavevector. Analyzing the mode and momentum dependence of the electron-phonon coupling, we find that its variations with phonon momentum dominate over electronic effects. These results identify unambiguously the CDW origin in ZrTe$_3$ as a cooperative effect of Fermi surface geometry and momentum-dependent electron-phonon coupling, with the latter playing the leading role. The mechanisms revealed in our work are directly relevant to other quasi-1D systems, including trichalcogenides and compounds hosting Peierls-like chains."

However, these approaches retain critical limitations: they require extensive evaluation of the target problem to guide the search process, making them impractical for real-world optimization tasks, where each evaluation consumes substantial computational resources. This research proposes an innovative and efficient framework that decouples algorithm discovery from high-cost evaluation. Our core innovation lies in combining a Genetic Programming (GP) function generator with an LLM-driven evolutionary algorithm designer. The evolutionary direction of the GP-based function generator is guided by the similarity between the landscape characteristics of generated proxy functions and those of real-world problems, ensuring that algorithms discovered via proxy functions exhibit comparable performance on real-world problems. Our method enables deep exploration of the algorithmic space before final validation while avoiding costly real-world evaluations. We validated the framework's efficacy across multiple real-world problems, demonstrating its ability to discover high-performance algorithms while substantially reducing expensive evaluations. This approach shows a path to apply LLM-based automated algorithm design to computationally intensive real-world optimization challenges."

Within it, particles exist at points in space, follow continuous, piecewise differentiable paths, and their linear momentum is equal to their mass times their velocity along their path. Yet the probabilities for position and momentum, conditioned on the state of the particle's environment, follow the rules of quantum theory. Indeed, all observable consequences of quantum theory are satisfied; particles can be entangled, have intrinsic spin, this spin is not local to the particle, particle identity can effect probabilities, and so forth. All the rules of quantum mechanics are obeyed, and all arise in a straightforward fashion. After this is established, connections will be drawn out between this type of mechanics and other types of quantum worlds; those that obey Bohmian mechanics, stochastic mechanics, the many worlds interpretation, and physical collapse. In the final section, a relativistic version of the mechanics will be presented."

    "abstract": "Neural implicit mapping has emerged as a powerful paradigm for robotic navigation and scene understanding. However, real-world robotic deployment requires continual adaptation to changing environments under strict memory and computation constraints, which existing mapping systems fail to support. Most prior methods rely on replaying historical observations to preserve consistency and assume static scenes. As a result, they cannot adapt to continual learning in dynamic robotic settings. To address these challenges, we propose TACO (TemporAl Consensus Optimization), a replay-free framework for continual neural mapping. We reformulate mapping as a temporal consensus optimization problem, where we treat past model snapshots as temporal neighbors. Intuitively, our approach resembles a model consulting its own past knowledge. We update the current map by enforcing weighted consensus with historical representations. Our method allows reliable past geometry to constrain optimization while permitting unreliable or outdated regions to be revised in response to new observations. TACO achieves a balance between memory efficiency and adaptability without storing or replaying previous data. Through extensive simulated and real-world experiments, we show that TACO robustly adapts to scene changes, and consistently outperforms other continual learning baselines."

Our contributions include: (1) a hierarchical task framework that decomposes proactive assistance into timing prediction and assist content generation; (2) a privacy-compliant dataset with 28,000+ events from 500+ hours of real user sessions, preserving bursty interaction patterns (burstiness B=0.787) absent in synthetic data; and (3) extensive experiments that evaluates LLM- and VLM-based baselines. Numerically, we showed that long-term memory and historical context significantly enhance prediction accuracy, while real-world training data substantially outperforms synthetic alternatives. We release our dataset and code at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/ProAgentBench-6BC0."

    "abstract": "Despite recent advancements in Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) on diverse understanding tasks, these models struggle to solve problems which require extensive multi-step reasoning. This is primarily due to the progressive dilution of visual information during long-context generation, which hinders their ability to fully exploit test-time scaling. To address this issue, we introduce Vision-aligned Latent Reasoning (VaLR), a simple, yet effective reasoning framework that dynamically generates vision-aligned latent tokens before each Chain of Thought reasoning step, guiding the model to reason based on perceptual cues in the latent space. Specifically, VaLR is trained to preserve visual knowledge during reasoning by aligning intermediate embeddings of MLLM with those from vision encoders. Empirical results demonstrate that VaLR consistently outperforms existing approaches across a wide range of benchmarks requiring long-context understanding or precise visual perception, while exhibiting test-time scaling behavior not observed in prior MLLMs. In particular, VaLR improves the performance significantly from 33.0% to 52.9% on VSI-Bench, achieving a 19.9%p gain over Qwen2.5-VL."

A previous study shows micro domain-adaptive pre-training ($\\textbf{mDAPT}$) with fewer documents is effective, similarly to DAPT in larger domains. However, it evaluates mDAPT only on multiple-choice questions; thus, its effectiveness for generative tasks in real-world operations remains unknown. We aim to reveal the potential and bottlenecks of mDAPT for generative tasks. To this end, we disentangle the answering process into three subtasks and evaluate the performance of each subtask: (1) $\\textbf{eliciting}$ facts relevant to questions from an LLM's own knowledge, (2) $\\textbf{reasoning}$ over the facts to obtain conclusions, and (3) $\\textbf{composing}$ long-form answers based on the conclusions. We verified mDAPT on proprietary IT product knowledge for real-world questions in IT technical support operations. As a result, mDAPT resolved the elicitation task that the base model struggled with but did not resolve other subtasks. This clarifies mDAPT's effectiveness in the knowledge aspect and its bottlenecks in other aspects. Further analysis empirically shows that resolving the elicitation and reasoning tasks ensures sufficient performance (over 90%), emphasizing the need to enhance reasoning capability."

We propose novel 2-approximations for this problem, which are much simpler and faster than a folklore adaptation of the 2-approximation by Krivelevich for finding a minimum triangle transversal in unsigned graphs. One of our algorithms also works for weighted BTT and for approximately optimal feasible solutions to the bad triangle cover LP. Using a recent result on approximating the bad triangle cover LP, we obtain a $(2+ε)$ approximation in time almost equal to the time needed to find a maximal set of edge-disjoint bad triangles (which would give a standard 3-approximation). Additionally, several inapproximability results are provided. For complete signed graphs, we show that BTT is NP-hard to approximate with factor better than $\\frac{2137}{2136}$. Our reduction also implies the same hardness result for related problems such as correlation clustering (cluster editing), cluster deletion and the min. strong triadic closure problem. On complete signed graphs, BTT is closely related to correlation clustering. We show that the correlation clustering optimum is at most $3/2$ times the BTT optimum, by describing a pivot procedure that transforms BTT solutions into clusters. This improves a result by Veldt, which states that their ratio is at most two."

Central to our inversion scheme is the construction of indicator functions, defined pointwise over the spatial and temporal sampling variables. The proposed inversion scheme permits the recovery of the $Θ$-convex support domain from far-field data at sparse observation directions. Uniqueness in determining the convex hull of the support and the excitation instants-using all observation directions-is also established as a direct consequence of the factorization method. The effectiveness and feasibility of the approach are examined through comprehensive numerical simulations in two and three dimensions."

Unlike existing methods that require the embedding dimension to be set apriori, LORE regularizes the solution using the nonconvex Schatten-$p$ quasi norm, enabling automatic joint recovery of both the ordinal embedding and its dimensionality. We optimize this joint objective via an iteratively reweighted algorithm and establish convergence guarantees. Extensive experiments on synthetic datasets, simulated perceptual spaces, and real world crowdsourced ordinal judgements show that LORE learns compact, interpretable and highly accurate low dimensional embeddings that recover the latent geometry of subjective percepts. By simultaneously inferring both the intrinsic dimensionality and ordinal embeddings, LORE enables more interpretable and data efficient perceptual modeling in psychophysics and opens new directions for scalable discovery of low dimensional structure from ordinal data in machine learning."

This paper proposes a sparse DOA estimation scheme specifically tailored for the stringent requirements of automotive radar such as limited computational resources, restricted array apertures, and a single snapshot. By introducing the concept of the spatial angular pseudo-derivative and incorporating this property as a constraint into a standard L0-norm minimization problem, we formulate an objective function that more faithfully characterizes the physical properties of the DOA problem. The associated solver, designated as the SAPD search algorithm, naturally transforms the high-dimensional optimization task into an efficient grid-search scheme. The SAPD algorithm circumvents high-order matrix inversions and computationally intensive iterations. We provide an analysis of the computational complexity and convergence properties of the proposed algorithm. Extensive numerical simulations demonstrate that the SAPD method achieves a superior balance of real-time efficiency, high precision, and super-resolution, making it highly suitable for next-generation automotive radar applications."

    "abstract": "3D medical imaging is in high demand and essential for clinical diagnosis and scientific research. Currently, diffusion models (DMs) have become an effective tool for medical imaging reconstruction thanks to their ability to learn rich, high-quality data priors. However, learning the 3D data distribution with DMs in medical imaging is challenging, not only due to the difficulties in data collection but also because of the significant computational burden during model training. A common compromise is to train the DMs on 2D data priors and reconstruct stacked 2D slices to address 3D medical inverse problems. However, the intrinsic randomness of diffusion sampling causes severe inter-slice discontinuities of reconstructed 3D volumes. Existing methods often enforce continuity regularizations along the z-axis, which introduces sensitive hyper-parameters and may lead to over-smoothing results. In this work, we revisit the origin of stochasticity in diffusion sampling and introduce Inter-Slice Consistent Stochasticity (ISCS), a simple yet effective strategy that encourages interslice consistency during diffusion sampling. Our key idea is to control the consistency of stochastic noise components during diffusion sampling, thereby aligning their sampling trajectories without adding any new loss terms or optimization steps. Importantly, the proposed ISCS is plug-and-play and can be dropped into any 2D trained diffusion based 3D reconstruction pipeline without additional computational cost. Experiments on several medical imaging problems show that our method can effectively improve the performance of medical 3D imaging problems based on 2D diffusion models. Our findings suggest that controlling inter-slice stochasticity is a principled and practically attractive route toward high-fidelity 3D medical imaging with 2D diffusion priors.

This review examines recent advances in evolutionary game dynamics that employ reinforcement learning (RL) as an alternative paradigm. In RL, individuals learn through trial and error and introspectively refine their strategies based on environmental feedback. We begin by introducing key concepts in evolutionary game theory and the two learning paradigms, then synthesize progress in applying RL to elucidate cooperation, trust, fairness, optimal resource coordination, and ecological dynamics. Collectively, these studies indicate that RL offers a promising unified framework for understanding the diverse social and ecological phenomena observed in human and natural systems."

In this paper, we take a one-dimensional Rydberg atomic chain to theoretically study the dynamical of finite-length string state. Under different string tension conditions, we find that the string dynamics exhibits two clearly distinguishable evolution characteristics: one is that the string breaks and the system enters a superposition state space containing multiple meson state configurations; the other is localized string dynamics, in which the string undergoes local breaking but can then recombine and return to a state close to the initial structure, with the breaking and recombination processes recurring over a long time scale. Through the analysis of the evolution of different meson state configurations, we visually depict the redistribution of configuration weights during the string breaking process, and reveal the observable recovery characteristics of the string after breaking. Further analysis shows that the enhancement of quantum fluctuations can increase the weight of the double-meson state configurations in the system wave function without changing the dominant dynamical behavior. The above results present a rich picture of string breaking dynamics in a one-dimensional Rydberg atomic chain and provide insights for studying confinement physics and related gauge field theory phenomena on quantum simulation platforms."

However, they mainly focus on Text-Attributed Graphs (TAGs), leaving Multimodal-Attributed Graphs (MAGs) largely untapped. Developing Multimodal Graph Foundation Models (MGFMs) allows for leveraging the rich multimodal information in MAGs, and extends applicability to broader types of downstream tasks. While recent MGFMs integrate diverse modality information, our empirical investigation reveals two fundamental limitations of existing MGFMs: (1)they fail to explicitly model modality interaction, essential for capturing intricate cross-modal semantics beyond simple aggregation, and (2)they exhibit sub-optimal modality alignment, which is critical for bridging the significant semantic disparity between distinct modal spaces. To address these challenges, we propose PLANET (graPh topoLogy-aware modAlity iNteraction and alignmEnT), a novel framework employing a Divide-and-Conquer strategy to decouple modality interaction and alignment across distinct granularities. At the embedding granularity, (1)Embedding-wise Domain Gating (EDG) performs local semantic enrichment by adaptively infusing topology-aware cross-modal context, achieving modality interaction. At the node granularity, (2)Node-wise Discretization Retrieval (NDR) ensures global modality alignment by constructing a Discretized Semantic Representation Space (DSRS) to bridge modality gaps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PLANET significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across diverse graph-centric and multimodal generative tasks."

    "abstract": "In many matching markets--such as athlete recruitment or academic admissions--participants on one side are evaluated by attribute vectors known to the other side, which in turn applies individual \\emph{salience vectors} to assign relative importance to these attributes. Since saliences are known to change in practice, a central question arises: how robust is a stable matching to such perturbations? We address several fundamental questions in this context. First, we formalize robustness as a radius within which a stable matching remains immune to blocking pairs under any admissible perturbation of salience vectors (which are assumed to be normalized). Given a stable matching and a radius, we present a polynomial-time algorithm to verify whether the matching is stable within the specified radius. We also give a polynomial-time algorithm for computing the maximum robustness radius of a given stable matching. Further, we design an anytime search algorithm that uses certified lower and upper bounds to approximate the most robust stable matching, and we characterize the robustness-cost relationship through efficiently computable bounds that delineate the achievable tradeoff between robustness and cost. Finally, we show that for each stable matching, the set of salience profiles that preserve its stability factors is a product of low-dimensional polytopes within the simplex. This geometric structure precisely characterizes the polyhedral shape of each robustness region; its volume can then be computed efficiently, with approximate methods available as the dimension grows, thereby linking robustness analysis in matching markets with classical tools from convex geometry."

Data-driven discovery methods address this challenge by inferring governing equations from time-series data using a library of functions constructed from the measured variables. However, these methods typically assume time-invariant coefficients, which limits their ability to capture evolving system dynamics. To overcome this limitation, we allow some of the parameters to vary over time, learn their temporal evolution directly from data, and infer a system of equations that incorporates both constant and time-varying parameters. We then transform this framework into a forecasting model by predicting the time-varying parameters and substituting these predictions into the learned equations. The model is validated using datasets for Susceptible-Infected-Recovered, Consumer--Resource, greenhouse gas concentration, and Cyanobacteria cell count. By dynamically adapting to temporal shifts, our proposed model achieved a mean absolute error below 3\\% for learning a time series and below 6\\% for forecasting up to a month ahead. We additionally compare forecasting performance against CNN-LSTM and Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), and show that our model outperforms these methods across most datasets.

Because both assumptions are frequently invalid, estimators more aligned with real-world settings have been proposed. An effect can be estimated as the difference in areas below the cumulative incidence functions of two groups up to a pre-specified time point. This approach, restricted mean time lost (RMTL), can be used in settings with competing risks as well. We extend RMTL estimation for use in an understudied health policy application in Medicare. Medicare currently supports healthcare payment for over 69 million beneficiaries, most of whom are enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans and receive insurance from private insurers. These insurers are prospectively paid by the federal government for each of their beneficiaries' anticipated health needs using an ordinary least squares linear regression algorithm. As all coefficients are positive and predictor variables are largely insurer-submitted health conditions, insurers are incentivized to upcode, or report more diagnoses than may be accurate. Such gaming is projected to cost the federal government $40 billion in 2025 alone without clear benefit to beneficiaries. We propose several novel estimators of coding intensity and possible upcoding in Medicare Advantage, including accounting for unreliable reporting. We demonstrate estimator performance in simulated data leveraging the National Institutes of Health's All of Us study and also develop an open source R package to simulate realistic labeled upcoding data, which were not previously available."

While our previous work Jaiswal [2025] established that this model mimics BH formation conditions even when the Hoop conjecture is seemingly violated, we here focus on the resulting stationary radiation spectrum and its detectability. By mapping the spin chain dynamics to a Dirac fermion in a curved (1 + 1)-dimensional spacetime, we analyze the radiation using two complementary approaches: field-theoretic modes and operational quantum sensors. First, using localized Gaussian wave packets to model realistic detectors, we find that the radiation spectrum exhibits deviations from the ideal Planckian form, analogous to frequency-dependent greybody factors, while retaining robust Poissonian statistics that signal the loss of formation-scale information. Second, we introduce a qubit coupled to the chain as a stationary Unruh-DeWitt detector. We demonstrate that the qubit functions as a faithful quantum sensor of the Hawking temperature only in the weak-coupling regime, where its population dynamics are governed solely by the bath spectral density. In the strong-coupling limit, the probe thermalizes with the global environment, obscuring the horizon-induced thermal signature. These results provide a clear operational protocol for distinguishing genuine analog HR from environmental noise in quantum simulation platforms."

In view of this, we in this paper present URSA-GAN, a unified and domain-aware generative framework specifically designed to mitigate mismatches in both noise and channel conditions. URSA-GAN leverages a dual-embedding architecture that consists of a noise encoder and a channel encoder, each pre-trained with limited in-domain data to capture domain-relevant representations. These embeddings condition a GAN-based speech generator, facilitating the synthesis of speech that is acoustically aligned with the target domain while preserving phonetic content. To enhance generalization further, we propose dynamic stochastic perturbation, a novel regularization technique that introduces controlled variability into the embeddings during generation, promoting robustness to unseen domains. Empirical results demonstrate that URSA-GAN effectively reduces character error rates in ASR and improves perceptual metrics in SE across diverse noisy and mismatched channel scenarios. Notably, evaluations on compound test conditions with both channel and noise degradations confirm the generalization ability of URSA-GAN, yielding relative improvements of 16.16% in ASR performance and 15.58% in SE metrics."

This work demonstrates that UGA-SSMRPT2 is also an accurate and computationally inexpensive framework for computing excitation energies. The method achieves near-chemical accuracy for the vast majority of $π\\to π^*$, $n \\to π^*$, charge-transfer, valence-Rydberg and Rydberg excited states commonly used for benchmarking electronic structure theories for excited states. Our results demonstrate that UGA-SSMRPT2 excitation energies lie within 0.20 eV of EOM-CCSD and/or well-established theoretical best estimates often surpassing the popular MRPT2 approaches like NEVPT2, CASPT2, and MCQDPT while typically requiring smaller active spaces. Its state-specific formulation circumvents the well-known intruder-state problem and eliminates the need for empirical parameters such as IPEA shifts in CASPT2. This work proposes UGA-SSMRPT2 as a robust, and scalable approach for modeling challenging electronic excited states."

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a cornerstone for fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs), with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) serving as the de facto standard algorithm. Despite its ubiquity, we argue that the core ratio clipping mechanism in PPO is structurally ill-suited for the large vocabularies inherent to LLMs. PPO constrains policy updates based on the probability ratio of sampled tokens, which serves as a noisy single-sample Monte Carlo estimate of the true policy divergence. This creates a sub-optimal learning dynamic: updates to low-probability tokens are aggressively over-penalized, while potentially catastrophic shifts in high-probability tokens are under-constrained, leading to training inefficiency and instability. To address this, we propose Divergence Proximal Policy Optimization (DPPO), which substitutes heuristic clipping with a more principled constraint based on a direct estimate of policy divergence (e.g., Total Variation or KL). To avoid huge memory footprint, we introduce the efficient Binary and Top-K approximations to capture the essential divergence with negligible overhead. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that DPPO achieves superior training stability and efficiency compared to existing methods, offering a more robust foundation for RL-based LLM fine-tuning."

To address this problem, we propose Mask-LLaVA, a framework that leverages different levels of visual features to create a compact yet information-rich visual representation for autoregressive VLMs. Namely, we combine mask-based object representations together with global tokens and local patch tokens. While all tokens are used during training, it shows that the resulting model can flexibly drop especially the number of mask-based object-tokens at test time, allowing to adapt the number of tokens during inference without the need to retrain the model and without a significant drop in performance. We evaluate the proposed approach on a suite of standard benchmarks showing results competitive to current token efficient methods and comparable to the original LLaVA baseline using only a fraction of visual tokens. Our analysis demonstrates that combining multi-level features enables efficient learning with fewer tokens while allowing dynamic token selection at test time for good performance."

We first study this model in a general $N\\times N$ MIMO setting. For this channel, we derive achievable rate lower bounds based on explicit transmission schemes and capacity upper bounds using a duality approach. We study Gaussian signaling and propose a practical superposition scheme with subspace alignment (SN) and successive interference cancellation, where a coarse-layer stream serves as an implicit pilot for decoding refined-layer data.

We evaluate three task-equivalent prompting regimes: Direct, Assistive, and Incremental, across different model scales and multi-hop QA benchmarks. We find that although accuracy gains from decomposition diminish in frontier models, disagreements between prompting regimes remain highly indicative of potential errors. Because factual knowledge is stable while hallucinations are stochastic, cross-regime agreement provides a precise signal of internal uncertainty. We leverage this signal to implement a training-free abstention policy that requires no retrieval or fine-tuning. Our results show that disagreement-based abstention outperforms standard uncertainty baselines as an error detector, improving both F1 and AUROC across settings. This demonstrates that decomposition-based prompting can serve as a practical diagnostic probe for model reliability in closed-book QA."

To bridge the accessibility gap for these tools and expand their reach to chemists with broader backgrounds, we introduce El Agente Quntur, a hierarchical, multi-agent AI system designed to operate not merely as an automation tool but as a research collaborator for computational quantum chemistry. Quntur was designed following three main strategies: i) elimination of hard-coded procedural policies in favour of reasoning-driven decisions, ii) construction of general and composable actions that facilitate generalization and efficiency, and iii) implementation of guided deep research to integrate abstract quantum-chemical reasoning across subdisciplines and a detailed understanding of the software's internal logic and syntax. Although instantiated in ORCA, these design principles are applicable to research agents more generally and easily expandable to additional quantum chemistry packages and beyond. Quntur supports the full range of calculations available in ORCA 6.0 and reasons over software documentation and scientific literature to plan, execute, adapt, and analyze in silico chemistry experiments following best practices. We discuss the advances and current bottlenecks in agentic systems operating at the research level in computational chemistry, and outline a roadmap toward a fully autonomous end-to-end computational chemistry research agent."

We emphasize the role of combinatorics in the study of continuous eigenvalues through the interplay between coboundaries and extension graphs, and we give several types of sufficient conditions for the nonexistence of trivial letter-coboundaries. As further results, we apply coboundaries in the context of bounded discrepancy, and in particular we obtain a simple characterization of letter-balance for primitive substitutive subshifts.

    "abstract": "We propose a computational framework for modeling opinion dynamics in electoral competitions that combines two realistic features: voter memory and exogenous shocks. The population is represented by a fully-connected network of agents, each holding a binary opinion that reflects support for one of two candidates. First, inspired by the classical voter model, we introduce a memory-dependent opinion update: each agent's probability of adopting a neighbor's stance depends on how many times they agreed with that neighbor in the agent's past $m$ states, promoting inertia and resistance to change. Second, we define an electoral shock as an abrupt external influence acting uniformly over all agents during a finite interval $[t_0, t_0+Δt]$, favoring one candidate by switching opinions with probability $p_s$, representing the impact of extraordinary events such as political scandals, impactful speeches, or sudden news. We explore how the strength and duration of the shock, in conjunction with memory length, influence the transient and stationary properties of the model, as well as the candidates' advantage. Our findings reveal a rich dynamical behavior: memory slows down convergence and enhances system resilience, whereas shocks of sufficient intensity and duration can abruptly realign collective preferences, particularly when occurring close to the election date. Conversely, for long memory lengths or large election horizons, shock effects are dampened or delayed, depending on their timing. These results offer insights into why some sudden political events reshape electoral outcomes while others fade under strong individual inertia. Finally, a qualitative comparison with real electoral shocks reported in opinion polls illustrates how the model captures the competition between voter inertia and abrupt external events observed in actual elections."

    "abstract": "Refractory multi-principal element alloys (RMPEAs) have attracted growing interest for their exceptional high-temperature strength, yet their complex compositions hinder a mechanistic understanding of plastic deformation. Here, we perform atomistic simulations to determine local slip resistances (LSRs) of edge and screw dislocations on primary BCC slip planes in 12 equal-molar RMPEAs. Machine learning is employed to uncover relationships between LSR and underlying material properties, enabling systematic assessment of compositional effects on dislocation behavior. Based on these insights, we develop a thermally activated, dislocation-based model to predict macroscopic yield stress. We find that increasing the fraction of hexagonal close-packed elements above 50% significantly reduces unstable stacking fault energy, ideal shear strength, and screw LSR across all slip planes. Higher elastic anisotropy further lowers these quantities, while lattice distortion modifies relative slip resistances between dislocation characters and slip systems. By combining an autoencoder with a random forest model, we identify elastic constants and lattice distortion as the dominant factors controlling LSR. The resulting framework accurately predicts tensile yield stress in BCC RMPEAs and provides guidance for alloy design."

We focus on two natural notions of collective dominance, $α$-winning and $α$-dominating sets, and we identify sharp threshold phenomena for both of them using probabilistic methods, duality arguments, and rounding techniques. We first consider $α$-winning sets. A set $S$ of $k$ candidates is $α$-winning if, for every outside candidate $a \\notin S$, at least an $α$-fraction of voters rank some member of $S$ above $a$. We show a sharp threshold at \\[ α_{\\mathrm{win}}^\\star = 1 - \\frac{1}{k}. \\] Specifically, an $α$-winning set of size $k$ exists with high probability when $α< α_{\\mathrm{win}}^\\star$, and is unlikely to exist when $α> α_{\\mathrm{win}}^\\star$. We then study the stronger notion of $α$-dominating sets. A set $S$ of $k$ candidates is $α$-dominating if, for every outside candidate $a \\notin S$, there exists a single committee member $b \\in S$ such that at least an $α$-fraction of voters prefer $b$ to $a$.

In this work, we show that existing pretrained diffusion models can be easily adapted to HDR generation without retraining from scratch. A key challenge is that HDR images are natively represented in linear RGB, whose intensity and color statistics differ substantially from those of sRGB-encoded LDR images. This gap, however, can be effectively bridged by converting HDR inputs into perceptually uniform encodings (e.g., using PU21 or PQ). Empirically, we find that LDR-pretrained variational autoencoders (VAEs) reconstruct PU21-encoded HDR inputs with fidelity comparable to LDR data, whereas linear RGB inputs cause severe degradations. Motivated by this finding, we describe an efficient adaptation strategy that freezes the VAE and finetunes only the denoiser via low-rank adaptation in a perceptually uniform space. This results in a unified computational method that supports both text-to-HDR synthesis and single-image RAW-to-HDR reconstruction. Experiments demonstrate that our perceptually encoded adaptation consistently improves perceptual fidelity, text-image alignment, and effective dynamic range, relative to previous techniques."

However, rigorously measuring this foundational capability is hindered by two obstacles: the entanglement of prior knowledge, where ``new'' knowledge may appear in pre-training data, and the entanglement of reasoning complexity, where failures may stem from problem difficulty rather than an inability to recall learned knowledge. We introduce SE-Bench, a diagnostic environment that obfuscates the NumPy library and its API doc into a pseudo-novel package with randomized identifiers. Agents are trained to internalize this package and evaluated on simple coding tasks without access to documentation, yielding a clean setting where tasks are trivial with the new API doc but impossible for base models without it. Our investigation reveals three insights: (1) the Open-Book Paradox, where training with reference documentation inhibits retention, requiring \"Closed-Book Training\" to force knowledge compression into weights; (2) the RL Gap, where standard RL fails to internalize new knowledge completely due to PPO clipping and negative gradients; and (3) the viability of Self-Play for internalization, proving models can learn from self-generated, noisy tasks when coupled with SFT, but not RL. Overall, SE-Bench establishes a rigorous diagnostic platform for self-evolution with knowledge internalization. Our code and dataset can be found at https://github.com/thunlp/SE-Bench."

By adopting nonparametric mixture models, we address this limitation, establishing a statistically robust foundation for SSD. Our BNP approach offers several advantages, including its efficacy in handling small datasets or censored data, which are common in ecological risk assessment, and its ability to provide principled uncertainty quantification alongside simultaneous density estimation and clustering. We utilize a specific nonparametric prior as the mixing measure, chosen for its robust clustering properties, a crucial consideration given the lack of strong prior beliefs about the number of components. Through simulation studies and analysis of real datasets, we demonstrate the superiority of our BNP-SSD over classical SSD methods. We also provide a BNP-SSD Shiny application, making our methodology available to the Ecotoxicology community. Moreover, we exploit the inherent clustering structure of the mixture model to explore patterns in species sensitivity. Our findings underscore the effectiveness of the proposed approach in improving ecological risk assessment methodologies."

This paper focuses on achieving accurate, fast, and robust wind speed prediction by full use of cluster data with spatial-temporal correlation. First, weighted mean filtering (WMF) is applied to denoise wind speed data at the single-farm level. The Legendre memory unit (LMU) is then innovatively applied for the wind speed prediction, in combination with the Compensating Parameter based on Kendall rank correlation coefficient (CPK) of wind farm cluster data, to construct the multi-slice LMU (MSLMU). Finally, an innovative ensemble model WMF-CPK-MSLMU is proposed herein, with three key blocks: data pre-processing, forecasting, and multi-slice compensation. Advantages include: 1) LMU jointly models linear and nonlinear dependencies among farms to capture spatial-temporal correlations through backpropagation; 2) MSLMU enhances forecasting by using CPK-derived weights instead of random initialization, allowing spatial correlations to fully activate hidden nodes across clustered wind farms.; 3) CPK adaptively weights the compensation model in MSLMU and complements missing data spatially, to facilitate the whole model highly accurate and robust. Test results on different wind farm clusters indicate the effectiveness and superiority of proposed ensemble model WMF-CPK-MSLMU in the short-term prediction of wind farm clusters compared to the existing models."

While foundation models have transformed language and vision via large-scale pretraining and lightweight adaptation, extending this paradigm to general, real-world graphs is challenging. In this work, we present Graph Billion- Foundation-Fusion (GraphBFF): the first end-to-end recipe for building billion-parameter Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) for arbitrary heterogeneous, billion-scale graphs. Central to the recipe is the GraphBFF Transformer, a flexible and scalable architecture designed for practical billion-scale GFMs. Using the GraphBFF, we present the first neural scaling laws for general graphs and show that loss decreases predictably as either model capacity or training data scales, depending on which factor is the bottleneck. The GraphBFF framework provides concrete methodologies for data batching, pretraining, and fine-tuning for building GFMs at scale. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework with an evaluation of a 1.4 billion-parameter GraphBFF Transformer pretrained on one billion samples. Across ten diverse, real-world downstream tasks on graphs unseen during training, spanning node- and link-level classification and regression, GraphBFF achieves remarkable zero-shot and probing performance, including in few-shot settings, with large margins of up to 31 PRAUC points. Finally, we discuss key challenges and open opportunities for making GFMs a practical and principled foundation for graph learning at industrial scale."

We derive a dependence of the IRX on UV slope $β$, stellar mass $M_\\ast$, and redshift out to $z \\simeq 5$, and establish consistent functional relations that can be used for correcting the UV/optical-selected galaxy samples for the effects of dust absorption. Methods. This work is based on a $K$-band selected sample of $\\sim 10^5$ star-forming galaxies detected in the UDS and COSMOS fields. Quiescent sources and known starbursts are removed, and the IR luminosities are established through stacking in FIR {\\it Herschel} and JCMT maps. UV slopes are found from SED fits and stacked IRX values are derived by taking the median of individual IRX measurements in bins of $β$, $M_\\ast$ and redshift. Results. While our best-fit IRX-$β$ relation is consistent with a Calzetti-like attenuation curve at $β\\gtrsim -1$, at bluer values the IRX seems to increase with redshift due to different mass-completeness limits imposed. When deriving the IRX-$β$ relation in stellar-mass bins, a systematic trend is found, where the effective slope of the attenuation law becomes progressively shallower with increasing mass. We incorporate this into the IRX-$β$ relation through the slope of the underlying reddening law, $dA_{1600}/dβ$, being a quadratic function of $\\log(M_\\ast/{\\rm M_\\odot})$. Expressing IRX as a function of the stellar mass we find a tight correlation, with IRX rising monotonically with mass but exhibiting a clear high-mass turnover at $z\\lesssim 2-3$, consistent with suppressed cold-gas accretion and dust growth in massive systems."

Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have improved MT system performance, adapting them to lesser-represented languages remains challenging. In-context learning (ICL) may offer novel ways to adapt LLMs for low-resource MT by conditioning models on demonstration at inference time. In this study, we explore scaling low-resource machine translation ICL beyond the few-shot setting to thousands of examples with long-context models. We scale in-context token budget to 1M tokens and compare three types of training corpora used as in-context supervision: monolingual unsupervised data, instruction-style data, and parallel data (English--target and Indonesian--target). Our experiments on Javanese and Sundanese show that gains from additional context saturate quickly and can degrade near the maximum context window, with scaling behavior strongly dependent on corpus type. Notably, some forms of monolingual supervision can be competitive with parallel data, despite the latter offering additional supervision. Overall, our results characterize the effective limits and corpus-type sensitivity of long-context ICL for low-resource MT, highlighting that larger context windows do not necessarily yield proportional quality gains."

This study revisits 226 peer-reviewed articles drawn from two global systematic reviews on island ecosystem services and climate change, applying a structured post hoc analysis to evaluate how uncertainty is treated across methods, service categories, ecosystem realms, and decision contexts. Studies were classified according to whether uncertainty was explicitly analysed, just mentioned, or ignored. Only 30 percent of studies incorporated uncertainty explicitly, while more than half did not address it at all. Scenario-based approaches dominated uncertainty assessment, whereas probabilistic and ensemble-based frameworks remained limited. Cultural ecosystem services and extreme climate impacts exhibited the lowest levels of uncertainty integration, and few studies connected uncertainty treatment to policy relevant decision frameworks. Weak or absent treatment of uncertainty emerges as a structural challenge in island systems, where narrow ecological thresholds, strong land-sea coupling, limited spatial buffers, and reduced institutional redundancy amplify the consequences of decision-making under incomplete knowledge. Systematic mapping of how uncertainty is framed, operationalised, or neglected reveals persistent methodological and conceptual gaps and informs concrete directions for strengthening uncertainty integration in future island-focused ecosystem service and climate assessments. Embedding uncertainty more robustly into modelling practices, participatory processes, and policy tools is essential for enhancing scientific credibility, governance relevance, and adaptive capacity in insular socio-ecological systems."

This article aims to make two contributions to this problem: (1) We show that using the value function of an LQR design as CLF, the resulting Sontag-type controller minimizes a classical quadratic cost around the setpoint and a CLF-dependent cost within the domain where the CLF condition holds. We also show that the closed-loop system is stable within a local region at least as large as that generated by the LQR. (2) We show a related CLF design for feedback-linearizable systems resulting in a global CLF in a straight-forward manner; The Sontag design then guarantees global asymptotic stability while minimizing a quadratic cost at the setpoint and a CLF-dependent cost in the whole state-space. Both designs are constructive and easily applicable to nonlinear multi-input systems under mild assumptions."

We show that transverse connectivity between chains qualitatively reshapes the phase diagram, substantially enlarging the tetramer region and, in particular, stabilizing weakly bound tetramers when compared to the one-dimensional chains. By tuning the interchain hopping, we identify a transition from a degenerate manifold of spatially separated dimers to a localized tetramer ground state, driven by the lifting of one-dimensional configurational degeneracies and an associated kinetic-energy gain. Finally, we demonstrate interaction and geometric quench protocols to dynamically prepare these complexes with high fidelity. Our results provide a microscopic framework for engineering and probing few-body bosonic bound states in tunable lattice geometries."

Based on this meta-estimator, we develop three practical CCME estimators: (1) Ridge Regression estimator, (2) Deep Feature estimator that parameterizes the feature map by a neural network, and (3) Neural-Kernel estimator that performs RKHS-valued regression, with the coefficients parameterized by a neural network. We provide finite-sample convergence rates for all estimators, establishing that they possess the double robustness property.

Using Fourier discretization combined with symmetry reduction and Krylov-Arnoldi methods, we compute on the order of one hundred leading eigenpairs reliably in the asymptotic, weak-diffusion regime. While the principal eigenvalue is asymptotically diffusive and localized on the largest regular region, the broader spectrum exhibits a rich organization controlled by local Lagrangian phase-space geometry. In particular, exponential mixing in chaotic regions rapidly suppresses correlations, whereas algebraic mixing in integrable regions generates long-lived coherent structures that dominate the slow and intermediate parts of the spectrum. We identify three distinct classes of eigenmodes: advective modes associated with transport on invariant tori, diffusive modes and, within the duffusive branch, tunneling modes arising from weak coupling between dynamically separated regular regions. Drawing on a semiclassical analogy, we assign quantum-number-like labels to these families and predict the appearance, scaling, and ordering of their sub-spectra directly from the Hamiltonian phase-space structure. The coexistence of these families implies that no uniform control of the spectral gap exists across the full spectrum: although the slowest mode is diffusive, arbitrarily small gaps arise between competing families at higher mode numbers. As a result, finite-time advection-diffusion dynamics is generically governed by persistent modal competition rather than single-mode dominance, even at asymptotically large Peclet number."

Here, we extend the benchmark set to more species, such as electrostatically bound borazine dimers as well as the minima structures of parallel displaced acene and coronene dimers. While the minimum structures of the parallel displaced acene dimers yield similar results to previously published sandwich-structured acenes, the borazine dimers behave vastly different, yielding yet a more complete picture on non-covalent interactions and their scalability. In contrast, the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon structures -- coronenes sandwich-stacked and coronenes parallel displaced -- give results consistent with those obtained for both types of the polyacene series, resulting in an updated estimate for the coronene dimer energy."

    "abstract": "Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a highly effective paradigm for keeping LLM-based responses up-to-date and reducing the likelihood of hallucinations. Yet, RAG was recently shown to be quite vulnerable to corpus knowledge poisoning: an attacker injects misleading documents to the corpus to steer an LLMs' output to an undesired response. We argue that the standard causal attention mechanism in LLMs enables harmful cross-document interactions, specifically in cases of attacks. Accordingly, we introduce a novel defense approach for RAG: Sparse Document Attention RAG (SDAG). This is a block-sparse attention mechanism that disallows cross-attention between retrieved documents. SDAG requires a minimal inference-time change to the attention mask; furthermore, no fine-tuning or additional architectural changes are needed. We present an empirical evaluation of LLM-based question answering (QA) with a variety of attack strategies on RAG. We show that our SDAG method substantially outperforms the standard causal attention mechanism in terms of attack success rate. We further demonstrate the clear merits of integrating SDAG with state-of-the-art RAG defense methods. Specifically, the integration results in performance that is statistically significantly better than the state-of-the-art."

    "abstract": "While message-passing neural networks (MPNNs) have shown promising results, their real-world impact remains limited. Although various limitations have been identified, their theoretical foundations remain poorly understood, leading to fragmented research efforts. In this thesis, we provide an in-depth theoretical analysis and identify several key properties limiting the performance of MPNNs. Building on these findings, we propose several frameworks that address these shortcomings. We identify two properties exhibited by many MPNNs: shared component amplification (SCA), where each message-passing iteration amplifies the same components across all feature channels, and component dominance (CD), where a single component gets increasingly amplified as more message-passing steps are applied. These properties lead to the observable phenomenon of rank collapse of node representations, which generalizes the established over-smoothing phenomenon. By generalizing and decomposing over-smoothing, we enable a deeper understanding of MPNNs, more targeted solutions, and more precise communication within the field. To avoid SCA, we show that utilizing multiple computational graphs or edge relations is necessary. Our multi-relational split (MRS) framework transforms any existing MPNN into one that leverages multiple edge relations. Additionally, we introduce the spectral graph convolution for multiple feature channels (MIMO-GC), which naturally uses multiple computational graphs. A localized variant, LMGC, approximates the MIMO-GC while inheriting its beneficial properties. To address CD, we demonstrate a close connection between MPNNs and the PageRank algorithm. Based on personalized PageRank, we propose a variant of MPNNs that allows for infinitely many message-passing iterations, while preserving initial node features. Collectively, these results deepen the theoretical understanding of MPNNs."

We show that these BIC-mediated emitter interactions can span several wavelengths, thus overcoming the traditional subwavelength separation between emitters required in free space. We further show that reaching the idealised Dicke limit is possible in this system, provided that the emitters are coupled to the BIC mode efficiently enough, as quantified through the $β$-factor. Moreover, we demonstrate its experimental viability by analysing its robustness to realistic experimental imperfections. This work puts forward optical metasurfaces supporting BICs as a physically viable platform for realising the upper limits of cooperative emission in physically extended quantum emitter arrays."

At equilibrium, the neural activities produce weight updates that implicitly encode the full prior-task curvature, a property we term the continual-natural gradient, requiring no explicit curvature storage. Experiments confirm that our learning framework recovers true prior-task curvature and enables task discrimination, outperforming existing methods on standard benchmarks without replay."

In recent years, computer vision has been used to automate several tasks in precision agriculture, such as detecting and counting fruits, and estimating their size. However, the fundamental problem of matching the exact same fruits from one video, collected on a given date, to the fruits visible in another video, collected on a later date, which is needed to track fruits' growth through time, remains to be solved. Few attempts were made, but they either assume that the camera always starts from the same known position and that there are sufficiently distinct features to match, or they used other sources of data like GPS. Here we propose a new paradigm to tackle this problem, based on constellations of 3D centroids, and introduce a descriptor for very sparse 3D point clouds that can be used to match fruits across videos. Matching constellations instead of individual fruits is key to deal with non-rigidity, occlusions and challenging imagery with few distinct visual features to track. The results show that the proposed method can be successfully used to match fruits across videos and through time, and also to build an orchard map and later use it to locate the camera pose in 6DoF, thus providing a method for autonomous navigation of robots in the orchard and for selective fruit picking, for example."

In this work, we introduce a frontend system that estimates clean speech tokens from noisy speech and evaluate it on an ASR backend using semantic tokens. We consider four types of enhancement models based on their input/output domains: wave-to-wave, token-to-token, continuous SSL features-to-token, and wave-to-token. These models are trained independently of ASR backends. Experiments on the CHiME-4 dataset demonstrate that wave-to-token enhancement achieves the best performance among the frontends. Moreover, it mostly outperforms the ASR system based on continuous SSL features."

Such low-frequency tokens not only waste vocabulary capacity but also increase vulnerability to adversarial or atypical inputs. We present a systematic empirical characterization of this phenomenon across commonly used tokenizers and introduce LiteToken, a simple method for removing residue tokens.

    "abstract": "Process mining techniques enable organizations to gain insights into their business processes through the analysis of execution records (event logs) stored by information systems. While most process mining efforts focus on intra-organizational scenarios, many real-world business processes span multiple independent organizations. Inter-organizational process mining, though, faces significant challenges, particularly regarding confidentiality guarantees: The analysis of data can reveal information that the participating organizations may not consent to disclose to one another, or to a third party hosting process mining services. To overcome this issue, this paper presents CONFINE, an approach for secrecy-preserving inter-organizational process mining. CONFINE leverages Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) to deploy trusted applications that are capable of securely mining multi-party event logs while preserving data secrecy. We propose an architecture supporting a four-stage protocol to secure data exchange and processing, allowing for protected transfer and aggregation of unaltered process data across organizational boundaries. To avoid out-of-memory errors due to the limited capacity of TEEs, our protocol employs a segmentation-based strategy, whereby event logs are transmitted to TEEs in smaller batches. We conduct a formal verification of correctness and a security analysis of the guarantees provided by the TEE core. We evaluate our implementation on real-world and synthetic data, showing that the proposed approach can handle realistic workloads. The results indicate logarithmic memory growth with respect to the event log size and linear growth with the number of provisioning organizations, highlighting scalability properties and opportunities for further optimization."

Extensive simulation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed tests, and an empirical application illustrates their practical relevance."

    "abstract": "Disordered materials occur naturally and also provide a broader design space than ordered or crystalline structures. We investigate a two-dimensional disordered network metamaterial constructed from a Delaunay triangulation of an underlying point cloud. Small perturbations in the point cloud induce discrete topological changes. One such change we identify is a Delaunay flip, in which two neighboring Delaunay triangles that form a convex quadrilateral structure with their common edge being one of the two quadrilateral diagonals exchange this diagonal for the other diagonal. These topological changes can cause substantial jumps in the effective resistance measured diagonally across the network, when the change is located near the source or the sink node. The jumps are explained analytically by showing that the change in effective resistance from edge removal or addition depends on the voltage drop across that edge. However, Delaunay flips have less impact on global resistance measurements and in larger networks. These local topological changes are relevant for finite-sized samples and experimentally-measurable properties such as electrical transport. Global characterizations of the network disorder or topology lack the location-specificity of our observed effects on network transport, and thus may be inadequate for predicting certain experimentally measurable transport properties in disordered network metamaterials, highlighting the importance of localized regions in material design."

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as proxies for human judgment in computational social science, yet their ability to reproduce patterns of susceptibility to misinformation remains unclear. We test whether LLM-simulated survey respondents, prompted with participant profiles drawn from social survey data measuring network, demographic, attitudinal and behavioral features, can reproduce human patterns of misinformation belief and sharing. Using three online surveys as baselines, we evaluate whether LLM outputs match observed response distributions and recover feature-outcome associations present in the original survey data. LLM-generated responses capture broad distributional tendencies and show modest correlation with human responses, but consistently overstate the association between belief and sharing. Linear models fit to simulated responses exhibit substantially higher explained variance and place disproportionate weight on attitudinal and behavioral features, while largely ignoring personal network characteristics, relative to models fit to human responses. Analyses of model-generated reasoning and LLM training data suggest that these distortions reflect systematic biases in how misinformation-related concepts are represented. Our findings suggest that LLM-based survey simulations are better suited for diagnosing systematic divergences from human judgment than for substituting it."

We fit the light curves using the afterglow modelling package \\texttt{afterglowpy} for both Top-hat and Gaussian jets for different values of the electronic participation fraction $ξ$ from 0.01 to 1.0 and find that, although the radio behavior is well described by the $ξ=1.0$ case, the required circumburst medium (CBM) densities are very low, $<10^{-4}$ cm$^{-3}$. However, the resulting energy requirements are modest, $\\sim10^{52}$ erg, with an electron energy distribution (EED) index $p\\sim2.05$. Similar results are also obtained from an analytic model fit to the light curve, except the predicted $p$ is higher, $\\sim2.40$. The observed post-break decay index of $2.99$ is at least 5$σ$ away from $p$, which is one of the steepest observed so far. We also find that when ignoring the radio observations, the CBM density is raised by a few orders of magnitude to $\\sim0.01$ cm$^{-3}$ for $ξ=1.0$, still far from the expected ISM density ($>1$ cm$^{-3}$) of GRB environments, which are highly star forming regions. Similarly low ISM densities have been seen in modeling of other LAT GRBs as well, especially ones with reverse-shock features (e.g., GRBs 130427A, 160509A and 160625B), thereby hinting at either an issue with the standard model or possible evacuated cavities where GRBs explode."

The proposed control law ensures that: (i) if the system output state initially lies within a prescribed safe set, safety is maintained for all time; otherwise, the output is driven back into the safe region within a preassigned finite time; and (ii) convergence to zero of all plant states is achieved.

PPO performs well empirically but has a heuristic motivation and handles the KL-divergence constraint used in LM-RLHF in an ad-hoc manner and suffers form reward oscillations, entropy collapse, value function drift, and sudden policy divergence that require frequent restarts and extensive hyperparameter tuning. In this paper, we develop a new pure on policy actor-critic RL method for the LM-RLHF setting. We present SAFE (Stable Alignment Finetuning with Entropy-aware control),a novel RLHF algorithm that combines a Double Soft-Min Critic for pessimistic value estimation with a new multi-layer stabilization framework combining entropy-gated KL regulation, and PID-controlled adaptive thresholds. Unlike standard PPO's symmetric KL penalties, SAFE distinguishes high-entropy exploration from low-entropy mode collapse and adjusts penalties dynamically based on reward velocity. Experiments on a 3B parameter model show SAFE achieves +5.15\\% training-average reward than PPO (0.725 vs 0.689), negligible reward crashes, and superior KL control than ppo . Our method adds minimal computational overhead and provides an interpretable, crash-resistant RLHF framework that maintains aggressive learning speed while ensuring stable long-horizon optimization suitable for production deployment.

We show that the invariance of this manifold under the linear configurational dynamics yields an exact evolution for the macroscopic conformation tensor, recovering the classical diffusive Oldroyd-B closure.

The project was motivated by the strong interest within the EIC community in a second general-purpose detector and interaction region, and by the recognition that such a detector is essential to fully exploit the scientific potential of the EIC over its multi-decade lifetime. The key goals of the LDRD were to (i) strengthen the case for a second EIC detector, building on the community Yellow Report; (ii) develop a realistic detector concept complementary to the project detector, ePIC, in terms of physics reach, precision, and control of systematics; and (iii) broaden the overall EIC physics program. Since a possible second detector is expected to be realized with a delay of several years relative to the first detector, the project explicitly aimed at identifying technologies that are not yet sufficiently mature for ePIC but could be deployed on the later timescale of a second detector, thereby providing genuine complementarity and room for innovation. As envisioned in the original proposal, the expected outcome was a document detailing the physics potential and requirements of a second EIC detector, accompanied by a conceptual design and an outline of the remaining R&D needs. This report summarizes progress toward these goals, consolidating the physics studies, detector concepts, and technology assessments developed under this LDRD, and situating them within the broader context of worldwide detector R&D. Despite evolving EIC priorities and the effort devoted to ePIC, the work documented here is intended to provide a foundation and reference for future efforts toward a second detector. We hope this report will serve as a useful guide for colleagues advancing this program in the near- and mid-term future."

It is well-known that while such equations describe the evolution of probabilities, they do not automatically justify classical reasoning based on the assumption that the system exists in a definite state at intermediate times. On the other hand, we show that this assumption is crucial for the standard calculation of stochastic times such as the persistent time and the time of first arrivals. We then consider examples of single particles, bosons, and fermions in the so-called ultradecoherence limit to illustrate how classical stochasticity may emerge from quantum mechanics."

    "abstract": "Recently, the progress in the radar sensing technology consisting in the miniaturization of the packages and increase in measuring precision has drawn the interest of the robotics research community. Indeed, a crucial task enabling autonomy in robotics is to precisely determine the pose of the robot in space. To fulfill this task sensor fusion algorithms are often used, in which data from one or several exteroceptive sensors like, for example, LiDAR, camera, laser ranging sensor or GNSS are fused together with the Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) measurements to obtain an estimate of the navigation states of the robot. Nonetheless, owing to their particular sensing principles, some exteroceptive sensors are often incapacitated in extreme environmental conditions, like extreme illumination or presence of fine particles in the environment like smoke or fog. Radars are largely immune to aforementioned factors thanks to the characteristics of electromagnetic waves they use. In this thesis, we present Radar-Inertial Odometry (RIO) algorithms to fuse the information from IMU and radar in order to estimate the navigation states of a (Uncrewed Aerial Vehicle) UAV capable of running on a portable resource-constrained embedded computer in real-time and making use of inexpensive, consumer-grade sensors. We present novel RIO approaches relying on the multi-state tightly-coupled Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and Factor Graphs (FG) fusing instantaneous velocities of and distances to 3D points delivered by a lightweight, low-cost, off-the-shelf Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) radar with IMU readings. We also show a novel way to exploit advances in deep learning to retrieve 3D point correspondences in sparse and noisy radar point clouds."

    "abstract": "The synthetic control method (SCM) estimates causal effects in panel data with a single-treated unit by constructing a counterfactual outcome as a weighted combination of untreated control units that matches the pre-treatment trajectory. In this paper, we introduce the targeted synthetic control (TSC) method, a new two-stage estimator that directly estimates the counterfactual outcome. Specifically, our TSC method (1) yields a targeted debiasing estimator, in the sense that the targeted updating refines the initial weights to produce more stable weights; and (2) ensures that the final counterfactual estimation is a convex combination of observed control outcomes to enable direct interpretation of the synthetic control weights. TSC is flexible and can be instantiated with arbitrary machine learning models. Methodologically, TSC starts from an initial set of synthetic-control weights via a one-dimensional targeted update through the weight-tilting submodel, which calibrates the weights to reduce bias of weights estimation arising from pre-treatment fit. Furthermore, TSC avoids key shortcomings of existing methods (e.g., the augmented SCM), which can produce unbounded counterfactual estimates. Across extensive synthetic and real-world experiments, TSC consistently improves estimation accuracy over state-of-the-art SCM baselines."

In this paper, we propose Focus-LIME, a coarse-to-fine framework designed to restore the tractability of surgical interpretation. Focus-LIME utilizes a proxy model to curate the perturbation neighborhood, allowing the target model to perform fine-grained attribution exclusively within the optimized context. Empirical evaluations on long-context benchmarks demonstrate that our method makes surgical explanations practicable and provides faithful explanations to users."

In particular, after a general presentation of various options, we focus on restricted variants of the Schwarz methods aimed at improving parallel efficiency, while preserving their convergence features. In order to rigorously describe and analyze the convergence behavior, we employ the theory of generalized locally Toeplitz (GLT) sequences, which provides a robust framework for studying the asymptotic spectral distribution of the discretized operators arising from Schwarz iterations. By associating each operator sequence with the appropriate GLT symbol, we derive explicit expressions for the GLT symbols of the convergence factors, for both additive and multiplicative Schwarz methods. The GLT-based spectral approach offers a unified and systematic understanding of how the spectrum evolves with mesh refinement and overlap size (in the algebraic case). Our analysis not only deepens the theoretical understanding of classical Schwarz methods, but also establishes a foundation for examining future restricted or hybrid Schwarz variants using symbolic spectral tools. These results enable the prediction of the remarkable efficiency of block Jacobi/Gauss--Seidel and block additive/multiplicative Schwarz preconditioners for GLT sequences, as further illustrated through a wide choice of numerical experiments."

Building on this perspective, we introduce CoMe-VLA, a cognitive and memory-aware vision-language-action (VLA) framework that leverages large-scale human egocentric data to learn versatile exploration and manipulation priors. Our framework integrates a cognitive auxiliary head for autonomous sub-task transitions and a dual-track memory system to maintain consistent self and environmental awareness by fusing proprioceptive and visual temporal contexts. By aligning human and robot hand-eye coordination behaviors in a unified egocentric action space, we train the model progressively in three stages. Extensive experiments on a wheel-based humanoid have demonstrated strong robustness and adaptability of our proposed method across diverse long-horizon tasks spanning multiple active perception scenarios."

Quantization is an effective solution, with INT weights and FP activations being widely adopted to preserve accuracy. Prior works further reduce FP overhead by using block floating point (BFP) activations in linear layers, but fail to extend BFP to attention layers due to severe accuracy degradation, limiting overall efficiency. To address this challenge, we propose Harmonia, an algorithm-hardware co-design framework that enables all-layer BFP activations with a configurable hardware architecture. First, we systematically explore BFP configurations to achieve a better trade-off between accuracy and activation compression across all layers. Second, to reduce KV-cache storage and computation in attention layers, we introduce an asymmetric bit-allocation strategy and computations in attention layers,we introduce an asymmetric bit-allocation strategy combined with a hybrid offline-online outlier smoothing technique. This allow aggressive KV-cache compression from FP16 to 4-bit-mantissa BFP with only 0.3% average accuracy loss. Third, to fully exploit all-layer BFP activations, we design dedicated hardware components, including a reconfigurable PE supporting mixed data formats (BFP-INT and BPF-BFP), a real-time FP16-to-BFP converter, and a tiling-aware dataflow to reduce memory traffic. We evaluate Harmonia on GEMM operations in both linear and attention layers across eight widely used LLMs. Compared with prior works, Harmonia achieves 3.84x (up to 5.05x) higher area efficiency, 2.03x (up to 3.90x) better energy efficiency, and 3.08x (up to 4.62x) speedup on average."

Their flux ratios can determine the low-energy cosmic-ray spectrum in different objects and of the Milky Way as a whole. Different phases of the interstellar medium are traced by hot nucleosynthesis ejecta, cooling positrons, or cosmic-ray interactions with molecular clouds. Positron annihilation itself can be considered as an astrophysical messenger as their production and destruction in typical space environments is inevitable. Finally, as-of-yet unknown signatures from beyond standard model physics might have their elusive imprints in $γ$-ray lines.

Some universal properties and conclusions are obtained for these spacetimes. We mostly focus on the existence of photon spheres, the total number of photon spheres $n = n_{\\text{stable}} + n_{\\text{unstable}}$, the subtraction of stable photon sphere and unstable photon sphere $w = n_{\\text{stable}} - n_{\\text{unstable}}$ in different categories of spacetimes.

    "abstract": "This paper investigates bounds on the estimation error of a linear system affected by norm-bounded disturbances and full sensor attacks. The system is equipped with a detector that evaluates the norm of the innovation signal to detect faults, and the attacker wants to avoid detection. We utilize induced $L_\\infty$ system norms, also called \\emph{peak-to-peak} norms, to compare the estimation error bounds under nominal operations and under attack. This leads to a sufficient condition for when the bound on the estimation error is smaller during an attack than during nominal operation. This condition is independent of the attack strategy and depends only on the attacker's desire to remain undetected and (indirectly) the observer gain. Therefore, we investigate both an observer design method, that seeks to reduce the error bound under attack while keeping the nominal error bound low, and detector threshold tuning. As a numerical illustration, we show how a sensor attack can deactivate a robust safety filter based on control barrier functions if the attacked error bound is larger than the nominal one. We also statistically evaluate our observer design method and the effect of the detector threshold."

Our analysis relies on a precise geometric characterization of the RDP privacy region, leveraging its convexity and the fact that its boundary is determined exclusively by Bernoulli mechanisms. Our results establish that the \"intersection-of-RDP-privacy-regions\" rule is not only valid, but optimal: no other black-box conversion can uniformly dominate it in the Blackwell sense, marking the fundamental limit of what can be inferred about a mechanism's privacy solely from its RDP guarantees."

We propose EmbedPlan, which replaces autoregressive next-state generation with a lightweight transition model operating in a frozen language embedding space. EmbedPlan encodes natural language state and action descriptions into vectors, predicts the next-state embedding, and retrieves the next state by nearest-neighbor similarity, enabling fast planning computation without fine-tuning the encoder. We evaluate next-state prediction across nine classical planning domains using six evaluation protocols of increasing difficulty: interpolation, plan-variant, extrapolation, multi-domain, cross-domain, and leave-one-out. Results show near-perfect interpolation performance but a sharp degradation when generalization requires transfer to unseen problems or unseen domains; plan-variant evaluation indicates generalization to alternative plans rather than memorizing seen trajectories. Overall, frozen embeddings support within-domain dynamics learning after observing a domain's transitions, while transfer across domain boundaries remains a bottleneck."

To address this gap, we present PersoPilot, an agentic AI-Copilot that integrates persona understanding with contextual analysis to support both end users and analysts. End users interact through a transparent, explainable chat interface, where they can express preferences in natural language, request recommendations, and receive information tailored to their immediate task. On the analyst side, PersoPilot delivers a transparent, reasoning-powered labeling assistant, integrated with an active learning-driven classification process that adapts over time with new labeled data. This feedback loop enables targeted service recommendations and adaptive personalization, bridging the gap between raw persona data and actionable, context-aware insights.

We point out that the regeneration process is not thermodynamically free in a reduced open-system description, and we treat the required work input as an explicit regeneration cost by modifying the cycle efficiency accordingly. We consider two working substances--a single spin-$1/2$ and a pair of interacting spin-$1/2$ particles--and investigate the cycle performance by taking the regeneration cost at its minimum value set by the Carnot heat-pump limit. For comparison, we also analyze the conventional Stirling cycle without regeneration under the same conditions. The super-Carnot efficiencies reported under the cost-free regeneration assumption disappear once the regeneration cost is included: the modified efficiency stays below the Carnot bound, while still remaining higher than the efficiency of the conventional Stirling cycle. For the conventional Stirling cycle, we provide a rigorous Carnot bound using quantum relative entropy, whereas for the regenerative cycle we derive a sufficient lower bound on the regeneration cost that guarantees thermodynamic consistency. Finally, we suggest three candidate quantum regenerator models for future work."

    "abstract": "Polarized dust emission is a major astrophysical foreground contaminant of the cosmic microwave background polarization (CMB), which must be accurately measured to look for the faint primordial polarization B-modes of inflationary origin. The available maps to date, obtained from Planck space mission data, are noise-dominated in the high Galactic latitude regions that are most relevant for CMB observations. The goal of this work is to obtain better dust polarization maps from Planck observations, by exploiting both the dependence between polarization and total intensity, as well as the non-Gaussian filamentary structure of the dust emission. To this end, we use scattering transforms, which provide a stable and interpretable representation of complex non-Gaussian textures, allowing for a data-driven analysis approach requiring no explicit priors on dust. The analysis is performed locally on Cartesian patches of sky, where Stokes linear polarization parameters, redefined in a local reference frame, are modeled as the sum of a signal of interest and a nuisance term. Using multiple realizations of the random nuisance term, we recover the polarized dust maps by minimizing a composite objective function that enforces multiple statistical constraints in scattering space. The proposed algorithm reconstructs maps of polarized dust emission whose statistics are consistent with those expected from the Planck data once random nuisance realizations are added. This is confirmed in a validation test using a high signal-to-noise sky region as a test case. Comparisons with existing dust polarization maps and models show that our approach better recovers small-scale polarized dust emission, and that our reconstructed power and cross-spectra closely match those of the dust polarization maps. A second set of maps that deterministically reproduce the features of the dust polarized emission is also produced."

A generalized RLA framework has remained elusive for algorithmic election rules such as the Single Transferable Vote (STV) rule, because of the dependence of these rules on the chronology of eliminations and elections leading to the outcome of the election. This paper proposes a new graph-based approach to audit these algorithmic election rules, by considering the space of all possible sequences of elections and eliminations. If we fix a subgraph of this universal space ahead of the audit, a sufficient strategy is to verify statistically that the true election sequence does not leave the fixed subgraph. This makes for a flexible framework to audit these elections in a chronology-agnostic way."

The low-multipole convergence field, encodes the largest-angle coherent potential gradients, essential for assessment of large-angle features in data. To study this large angle signal, we perform a combined analytical, numerical and observational study. Starting from exact analytical expressions for the convergence power spectrum, we quantify how the dipole, quadrupole and octupole build up with source redshift and show that, in $Λ$CDM, they saturate at an amplitude of order $10^{-4}$. We then use full-sky, horizon-scale $N$-body simulations (Quijote) to explore the dependence of this signal on the observer's environment, comparing random observers to ``Milky Way-like'' observers. In parallel, we reconstruct the convergence field due to our local Universe with the 2MASS Redshift Survey (2MRS), with proper treatment of incompleteness and galaxy bias. We find that the observed low multipoles from observation is above the $Λ$CDM mean predictions, but in full agreement with Milky Way-like observers in the simulation. Finally, by converting the convergence dipole into a number-count dipole, we test whether weak lensing can contribute to the cosmic dipole anomaly, an idea motivated by its natural alignment with the CMB dipole and by the fact that lensing, unlike clustering, cannot be removed by cross-matching surveys and thus survives in all high-redshift catalogues. We show that weak lensing by local structure contributes at most a few percent to this observed anomaly."

These Painleve solitons propagate against a background governed by a Painleve transcendent, establishing a fundamental generalization of the well-known elliptic solitons concept. We demonstrate that while elliptic solitons arise from the combination of translation invariance and square eigenfunction symmetry, a different symmetry combination-scaling invariance, Galilean invariance, and square eigenfunction symmetry-generates ``Painleve IV solitons'' for the AKNS system. This discovery represents a significant theoretical advance in integrable systems theory. By selecting special solutions of the Painleve IV equation, we obtain explicit forms of several previously unknown classes of solutions for the AKNS system and the nonlinear Schrodinger (NLS) equation: irrational algebraic solitons, rational algebraic solitons, and parabolic cylindrical function solitons. These results dramatically expand the known solution landscape of one of the most important integrable models in mathematical physics, with broad implications for nonlinear wave phenomena across multiple physical disciplines including optics, Bose-Einstein condensates, and fluid dynamics."

This paper addresses the latency-resilient Layer 3 routing optimization problem in telecommunications networks with predefined Layer 1 optical links. We formulate this problem as a graph-based optimization problem with the objective of minimizing latency, creating vertex-disjoint paths from each site to the internet backbone, and maximizing overall resiliency by limiting the impact of dual-link failures. By framing the problem as finding two disjoint shortest paths, coupled together with a resiliency component to the objective function, we establish a single formulation to produce optimal path design. The mathematical formulation was adapted to solve the problem using quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) executed over both quantum simulator and quantum hardware. QAOA was tested on a toy graph topology with 5 vertices and 7 edges and considering two limiting scenarios respectively representing independent (uncorrelated) link failures and highly correlated failure for one pair of edges. Both explored scenarios produced the optimal network design-corresponding to the valid solution with highest frequency of occurrence and minimum energy state, hence, validating the proposed formulation for optimizing Layer 3 routing on quantum systems of the future."

However, existing pruning methods often rely on static importance scores, which fail to capture the evolving role of attention heads during iterative removal. We propose Greedy-Gradient norm (Greedy-Gnorm), a novel head pruning algorithm that dynamically recalculates head importance after each pruning step. Specifically, each head is scored by the elementwise product of the l2-norms of its Q/K/V gradient blocks, as estimated from a hold-out validation set and updated at every greedy iteration. This dynamic approach to scoring mitigates against stale rankings and better reflects gradient-informed importance as pruning progresses. Extensive experiments on BERT, ALBERT, RoBERTa, and XLM-RoBERTa demonstrate that Greedy-Gnorm consistently preserves accuracy under substantial head removal, outperforming attention entropy. By effectively reducing model size while maintaining task performance, Greedy-Gnorm offers a promising step toward more energy-efficient transformer model deployment."

As an exemplary example, we apply our scheme to design an optimal control for the adiabatic speedup in a two-level system under a non-Markovian environment. Our optimization procedure entails two steps: driving trajectory optimization and zero-area pulse optimization. Fidelity improvement for both steps have been obtained, showing the effectiveness of the scheme.

This study investigates the role of central vision and slowness learning in the formation of semantic object representations from human-like visual experience. We simulate five months of human-like visual experience using the Ego4D dataset and generate gaze coordinates with a state-of-the-art gaze prediction model. Using these predictions, we extract crops that mimic central vision and train a time-contrastive Self-Supervised Learning model on them. Our results show that combining temporal slowness and central vision improves the encoding of different semantic facets of object representations. Specifically, focusing on central vision strengthens the extraction of foreground object features, while considering temporal slowness, especially during fixational eye movements, allows the model to encode broader semantic information about objects. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms by which humans may develop semantic object representations from natural visual experience."

Here we present a first proof-of-concept demonstration of a non-radioactive alternative based on x-ray fluorescence (XRF) computational ghost imaging (CGI) at the human-organ scale. Using a thyroid phantom filled with iodine solution as a model system, we show that structured illuminations combined with fluorescence detection reconstruct the iodine distribution with high fidelity. This approach eliminates the need for radioactive tracers while preserving image quality, and in principle can reach spatial resolution comparable to CT. Beyond this demonstration, XRF-CGI establishes a generalizable framework for non-radioactive tracer imaging, opening a route toward safer, repeatable, and more accessible diagnostics."

We couple sparse trajectories, per-frame local point maps, and relative camera poses with geometric consistency objectives: (i) bidirectional trajectory-pointmap consistency with controlled gradient flow, and (ii) a pose consistency objective driven by static track anchors that suppresses gradients from dynamic regions. To scale training to in-the-wild videos where 3D trajectory labels are scarce, we reformulate the same coupling constraints into self-supervised objectives using only pseudo 2D tracks, enabling unified training with mixed supervision.

In this article we present a novel range-based RBL scheme via GaBP that removes the latter limitation. To this end, the proposed method incorporates a quadratic angle approximation to linearize the relative orientation between the prior and the target rigid body, enabling high precision estimates of corresponding rotation angles even for large deviations. Leveraging the resulting linearized model, we derive the corresponding message-passing (MP) rules to obtain estimates of the translation vector and rotation matrix of the target rigid body, relative to a prior reference frame.

Thresholds are typically hand-tuned offline for a specific environment and fixed during deployment, leading to degraded performance under environmental change. We propose a method that, given a user-defined precision requirement, automatically selects the operating point of a VPR system to maximise recall. The method uses a small calibration traversal with known correspondences and transfers thresholds to deployment via quantile normalisation of similarity score distributions. This quantile transfer ensures that thresholds remain stable across calibration sizes and query subsets, making the method robust to sampling variability. Experiments with multiple state-of-the-art VPR techniques and datasets show that the proposed approach consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art, delivering up to 25% higher recall in high-precision operating regimes. The method eliminates manual tuning by adapting to new environments and generalising across operating conditions. Our code will be released upon acceptance."

    "abstract": "We study a setting in which two players play a (possibly approximate) Nash equilibrium of a bimatrix game, while a learner observes only their actions and has no knowledge of the equilibrium or the underlying game. A natural question is whether the learner can rationalize the observed behavior by inferring the players' payoff functions. Rather than producing a single payoff estimate, inverse game theory aims to identify the entire set of payoffs consistent with observed behavior, enabling downstream use in, e.g., counterfactual analysis and mechanism design across applications like auctions, pricing, and security games. We focus on the problem of estimating the set of feasible payoffs with high probability and up to precision $ε$ on the Hausdorff metric. We provide the first minimax-optimal rates for both exact and approximate equilibrium play, in zero-sum as well as general-sum games. Our results provide learning-theoretic foundations for set-valued payoff inference in multi-agent environments."

They arise not only in collider cross-section calculations, but also in the post-Minkowskian expansion of gravitational-wave scattering. A powerful approach to compute integrals of this type is via differential equations, particularly when cast in a canonical form, which simplifies their $\\varepsilon$-expansion and makes analytic properties manifest. In these proceedings, we will present a method to systematically construct canonical differential equations even for integrals that evaluate beyond multiple polylogarithms. The discussion is kept as light as possible, focusing on the two-loop sunrise integral, deferring the technical details to the original publications."

Starting from the master equation, we derive an exact integral representation for the probability $P(M,N,t)$ of observing $N$ particles at time $t$ starting from $M$ monomers for any finite $M, N, t$. From this, we obtain an exact expression for the exponential moment $\\langle p^N\\rangle$ for integer $p$. Employing a replica conjecture -- numerically validated by finite-$M$ scaling -- we extend this result to real $p \\geq 0$. The convex envelope of the large deviation function, obtained via a Legendre-Fenchel transform of the exponential moment, shows singular behavior. The singular structure allows us to construct the full phase diagram of product-kernel aggregation, which contains a tricritical point, separating continuous and discontinuous transitions. We also compute the asymptotic form of the LDF for small $N/M$."

    "abstract": "The increasing use of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers significant opportunities across the engineering lifecycle, including requirements engineering, software development, process optimization, and decision support. Despite this potential, organizations face substantial challenges in assessing the risks associated with LLM use, resulting in inconsistent integration, unknown failure modes, and limited scalability. This paper introduces the LLM Risk Assessment Framework (LRF), a structured approach for evaluating the application of LLMs within Systems Engineering (SE) environments. The framework classifies LLM-based applications along two fundamental dimensions: autonomy, ranging from supportive assistance to fully automated decision making, and impact, reflecting the potential severity of incorrect or misleading model outputs on engineering processes and system elements. By combining these dimensions, the LRF enables consistent determination of corresponding risk levels across the development lifecycle. The resulting classification supports organizations in identifying appropriate validation strategies, levels of human oversight, and required countermeasures to ensure safe and transparent deployment. The framework thereby helps align the rapid evolution of AI technologies with established engineering principles of reliability, traceability, and controlled process integration. Overall, the LRF provides a basis for risk-aware adoption of LLMs in complex engineering environments and represents a first step toward standardized AI assurance practices in systems engineering."

    "abstract": "Adversarial attacks against Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) are crucial for exposing safety vulnerabilities in modern multimodal systems. Recent attacks based on input transformations, such as random cropping, suggest that spatially localized perturbations can be more effective than global image manipulation. However, randomly cropping the entire image is inherently stochastic and fails to use the limited per-pixel perturbation budget efficiently. We make two key observations: (i) regional attention scores are positively correlated with adversarial loss sensitivity, and (ii) attacking high-attention regions induces a structured redistribution of attention toward subsequent salient regions. Based on these findings, we propose Stage-wise Attention-Guided Attack (SAGA), an attention-guided framework that progressively concentrates perturbations on high-attention regions. SAGA enables more efficient use of constrained perturbation budgets, producing highly imperceptible adversarial examples while consistently achieving state-of-the-art attack success rates across ten LVLMs. The source code is available at https://github.com/jackwaky/SAGA."

Such phenomena could have Gaussian distributions, when it comes to all players in a stratum, but when interest focuses on the very tails, for the top few percent, those above certain high thresholds, different models are called for, along with the need to analyse such based on the listed top scores only. In this note I develop such models and tools, and apply them to the top-100 and above 2100 points lists for regular chess ratings, for the currently active 14671 men and 753 women, as given by the FIDE, January 2026. It is argued that even when two or more distributions have close to identical expected values, or medians, even smaller differences in variance may explain gaps for the few very best ones."

On the other hand, the entanglement of a system with its environment is closely related to the entropy of the system. However, does this imply that the entropy of systems with larger internal entanglement will grow stronger? We study the issue using the simplest model as an example: a system of qubits interacts with the environment described by the quantum harmonic oscillator. The answer to the posed question is ambiguous. However, the study of the situation on average (using the simulation of a set of random states) reveals certain patterns and we can say that the answer is affirmative. At the same time, the choice of states satisfying certain conditions in some cases can change the dependence to the opposite. Additionally, we show that the entanglement depth also makes a small contribution to entropy growth."

In active learning settings, the model must select the most informative samples for annotation from a large pool of unlabeled data. Existing approaches typically estimate uncertainty via entropy-based criteria or representation clustering, without explicitly modeling uncertainty from the model perspective. In this work, we propose a robust uncertainty modeling framework for active CLIP adaptation based on dual-prompt tuning. We introduce two learnable prompts in the textual branch of CLIP. The positive prompt enhances the discriminability of task-specific textual embeddings corresponding to light-weight tuned visual embeddings, improving classification reliability. Meanwhile, the negative prompt is trained in an reversed manner to explicitly model the probability that the predicted label is correct, providing a principled uncertainty signal for guiding active sample selection. Extensive experiments across different fine-tuning paradigms demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing active learning methods under the same annotation budget."

Existing unsupervised self-training methods rely on pseudo-labeling, yet often suffer from unreliable confidence filtering, confirmation bias, and underutilization of low-confidence samples. We propose Collaborative Fine-Tuning (CoFT), an unsupervised adaptation framework that leverages unlabeled data through a dual-model, cross-modal collaboration mechanism. CoFT introduces a dual-prompt learning strategy with positive and negative textual prompts to explicitly model pseudo-label cleanliness in a sample-dependent manner, removing the need for hand-crafted thresholds or noise assumptions. The negative prompt also regularizes lightweight visual adaptation modules, improving robustness under noisy supervision. CoFT employs a two-phase training scheme, transitioning from parameter-efficient fine-tuning on high-confidence samples to full fine-tuning guided by collaboratively filtered pseudo-labels. Building on CoFT, CoFT+ further enhances adaptation via iterative fine-tuning, momentum contrastive learning, and LLM-generated prompts. Extensive experiments demonstrate consistent gains over existing unsupervised methods and even few-shot supervised baselines."

We apply an adaptive kernel-density estimation method that incorporates the full photometric redshift probability distribution function of each galaxy to map galaxy overdensities, and identify 207 significant ($>4\\,σ$) overdensities at $1.5<z<5$. We measure the quenched-galaxy fraction, the median specific star formation rate (sSFR), the total halo mass, and the local galaxy density of each system. By investigating the correlation among these observables, we find that galaxy quenching proceeds in two paths:($i$) Overdensities within more massive halos exhibit higher quenched fractions and lower averaged sSFRs. This trend weakens at $z\\gtrsim2$, consistent with cold gas streams penetrating shock-heated massive halos and sustaining star formation activity at early times. ($ii$) We also find a dependence of the same parameters on local densities at $z<2$, where the quenched fraction increases and the sSFR decreases toward higher densities. The environmental trend in sSFR weakens at $z\\sim2$--$3$ and shows tentative evidence for a reversal at $z>3$, potentially due to a larger cold gas supply in earlier times. Our study reveals a complex interplay between individual galaxies and large-scale environmental properties, marking the onset of environmental effects on galaxy quenching in massive halos at cosmic noon."

    "abstract": "Statistical mechanics is a powerful framework for analyzing optimization yielding analytical results for matching, optimal transport, and other combinatorial problems. However, these methods typically target the zero-temperature limit, where systems collapse onto optimal configurations, a.k.a. the ground states. Real-world systems often occupy intermediate regimes where entropy and cost minimization genuinely compete, producing configurations that are structured yet sub-optimal. The Sub-Optimal Transport (SOT) model captures this competition through an ensemble of weighted bipartite graphs: a coupling parameter interpolates between entropy-dominated dense configurations and cost-dominated sparse structures. This crossover has been observed numerically but lacked analytical understanding. Here we develop a mean-field theory that characterizes this transition. We show that local fluctuations in Lagrange multipliers become sub-extensive in the thermodynamic limit, reducing the full model with strength constraints to an effective single-constraint problem admitting an exact solution in some intermediate regime. The resulting free energy is analytic in the coupling parameter, confirming a smooth crossover rather than a phase transition. We derive closed-form expressions for thermodynamic observables and weight distributions, validated against numerical simulations. These results establish the first analytical description of the SOT model, extending statistical mechanics methods beyond the zero-temperature regime."

Despite many efforts, an ongoing challenge is hidden bias: LLMs appear fair under standard evaluations, but can produce biased responses outside those evaluation settings. In this paper, we identify framing -- differences in how semantically equivalent prompts are expressed (e.g., \"A is better than B\" vs. \"B is worse than A\") -- as an underexplored contributor to this gap. We first introduce the concept of \"framing disparity\" to quantify the impact of framing on fairness evaluation. By augmenting fairness evaluation benchmarks with alternative framings, we find that (1) fairness scores vary significantly with framing and (2) existing debiasing methods improve overall (i.e., frame-averaged) fairness, but often fail to reduce framing-induced disparities. To address this, we propose a framing-aware debiasing method that encourages LLMs to be more consistent across framings. Experiments demonstrate that our approach reduces overall bias and improves robustness against framing disparities, enabling LLMs to produce fairer and more consistent responses."

Prior work suggests that few-shot examples may compromise safety, but lacks investigation into how few-shot interacts with different system prompt strategies. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation on multiple mainstream LLMs across four safety benchmarks (AdvBench, HarmBench, SG-Bench, XSTest) using six jailbreak attack methods. Our key finding reveals that few-shot demonstrations produce opposite effects on RoP and ToP: few-shot enhances RoP's safety rate by up to 4.5% through reinforcing role identity, while it degrades ToP's effectiveness by up to 21.2% through distracting attention from task instructions. Based on these findings, we provide practical recommendations for deploying prompt-based defenses in real-world LLM applications."

First, we introduce a layered component graph, explicitly representing multimodal information at two layers - each representing coarse and fine granularity - facilitating efficient yet precise reasoning.

The objective is to minimize task execution delays while ensuring the long-term energy stability of the L-UAVs, despite unknown future system states. To this end, the problem is decoupled using Lyapunov optimization, which adaptively balances the priorities of task delays and L-UAV energy cost based on their real-time energy states. An efficient vehicle to L-UAV matching scheme is designed, and the joint optimization problem for task assignment, computing resource allocation, and trajectory control of L-UAVs and H-UAV is then solved via a Block Coordinate Descent (BCD) algorithm.

In this paper, we propose CoLT, a novel framework that implements latent reasoning as ``tool calls''. Instead of reasoning entirely in the latent space, CoLT generates seed tokens that contain information of a reasoning step. When a latent tool call is triggered, a smaller external model will take the hidden states of seed tokens as its input, and unpack the seed tokens back to a full reasoning step. In this way, we can ensure that the main model reasons in the explicit token space, preserving its ability while improving efficiency. Experimental results on four mathematical datasets demonstrate that CoLT achieves higher accuracy and shorter reasoning length than baseline latent models, and is compatible with reinforcement learning algorithms and different decoder structures."

We study a reusable dyadic negotiation testbed that employs a controlled midstream change in one party's outside alternative as a repeatable perturbation to stress-test adaptation. In a six-round chat-based negotiation study (N=100), the perturbation reliably reorganized interaction dynamics: transitions between integrative (cooperative) and distributive (positional) behaviors declined, behavioral diversity narrowed, and interactions drifted toward more distributive tactics. Critically, this distributive drift predicted worse relational experience net of objective outcomes, and adaptation patterns were path dependent on prior behavior. These results establish a methodological bridge for evaluating and comparing AI coaching systems on strategic adaptation as a process and identify failure modes and design targets for adaptive interaction support."

By analyzing 245 features spanning token-, trajectory-, and round-level entropy, we counterintuitively find that a single agent outperforms MAS in approximately 43.3% of cases, and that uncertainty dynamics are largely determined during the first round of interaction. Furthermore, we provide three key observations: 1) Certainty Preference: reducing uncertainty at any stage for any agent is critical for guaranteeing correct solutions; 2) Base Uncertainty: base models with lower entropy during problem-solving directly benefit MAS performance; and 3) Task Awareness: entropy dynamics of MAS play varying roles across different tasks. Building on these insights, we introduce a simple yet effective algorithm, the Entropy Judger, to select solutions from MAS's pass@k results, leading to consistent accuracy improvements across all MAS configurations and tasks.

However, recent studies have reported harmonic instabilities associated with VA-CC, motivating the need for a more physically interpretable understanding of their origin. This letter identifies a delay-independent structural mechanism of harmonic instability in the VA-CC scheme, wherein the interaction between the filter and virtual inductances introduces a non-passive second-order transfer-function term exhibiting negative resistance. To address this issue, a simple yet effective modification is proposed by integrating a parallel virtual resistor into the VA structure. This reconfiguration enhances the passivity of VA-CC scheme across the harmonic range by mimicking the skin effect which augments damping in high-frequency range, without altering the wellestablished current controller or voltage feedforward control. Experimental results validate that the proposed method achieves robust harmonic stability, whereas the conventional approach fails under identical grid conditions."

    "abstract": "Autoregressive policies offer a compelling foundation for scalable robot learning by enabling discrete abstraction, token-level reasoning, and flexible inference. However, applying autoregressive modeling to continuous robot actions requires an effective action tokenization scheme. Existing approaches either rely on analytical discretization methods that produce prohibitively long token sequences, or learned latent tokenizers that lack structure, limiting their compatibility with next-token prediction. In this work, we identify three desiderata for action tokenization - high compression, total decodability, and a left-to-right causally ordered token space - and introduce Ordered Action Tokenization (OAT), a learned action tokenizer that satisfies all three. OAT discretizes action chunks into an ordered sequence of tokens using transformer with registers, finite scalar quantization, and ordering-inducing training mechanisms. The resulting token space aligns naturally with autoregressive generation and enables prefix-based detokenization, yielding an anytime trade-off between inference cost and action fidelity. Across more than 20 tasks spanning four simulation benchmarks and real-world settings, autoregressive policies equipped with OAT consistently outperform prior tokenization schemes and diffusion-based baselines, while offering significantly greater flexibility at inference time."

    "abstract": "Dual connectivity (DC) has garnered significant attention in 5G evolution, allowing for enhancing throughput and reliability by leveraging the channel conditions of two paths. However, when the paths exhibit different delays, such as in terrestrial and non-terrestrial integrated networks with multi-orbit topologies or in networks characterized by frequent topology changes, like Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite constellations with different elevation angles, traffic delivery may experience packet reordering or triggering congestion control mechanisms. Additionally, real-time traffic may experience packet drops if their arrival exceeds a play-out threshold. Different techniques have been proposed to address these issues, such as packet duplication, packet switching, and network coding for traffic scheduling in DC. However, if not accurately designed, these techniques can lead to resource waste, encoding/decoding delays, and computational overhead, undermining DC's intended benefits. This paper provides a mathematical framework for calculating the average end-to-end packet loss in case of a loss process modeled with a Discrete Markov Chain - typical of a wireless channel - when combining packet duplication and packet switching or when network coding is employed in DC. Such metrics help derive optimal policies with full knowledge of the underlying loss process to be compared to empirical models learned through Machine Learning algorithms."

Understanding this hypothesized use will help to understand how, and in what contexts, developers use type information; additionally, it may help to design better development tools and inform educational decisions. To provide this evidence, we conduct an eye tracking study with 26 undergraduate students to determine if they read type annotations during code comprehension and bug localization in the TypeScript language. We found that developers do not look directly at lines containing type annotations or type declarations more often when they are present, in either code summarization or bug localization tasks. The results have implications for tool builders to improve the availability of type information, the development community to build good standards for use of type annotations, and education to enforce deliberate teaching of reading patterns."

We construct unbiased estimators of suitably truncated versions of the functional and derive sharp oracle risk bounds through an explicit bias--variance analysis.

However, assessment of low-grade dysplasia remains limited by subjective histopathologic interpretation. Advancements in digital pathology and deep learning provide new opportunities to identify subtle and fine morphologic patterns associated with malignant progression that may be imperceptible to the human eye. In this work, we propose XtraLight-MedMamba, an ultra-lightweight state-space-based deep learning framework for classifying neoplastic tubular adenomas from whole-slide images (WSIs). The architecture is a blend of ConvNext based shallow feature extractor with parallel vision mamba to efficiently model both long- and short-range dependencies and image generalization. An integration of Spatial and Channel Attention Bridge (SCAB) module enhances multiscale feature extraction, while Fixed Non-Negative Orthogonal Classifier (FNOClassifier) enables substantial parameter reduction and improved generalization. The model was evaluated on a curated dataset acquired from patients with low-grade tubular adenomas, stratified into case and control cohorts based on subsequent CRC development. XtraLight-MedMamba achieved an accuracy of 97.18% and an F1-score of 0.9767 using approximately 32,000 parameters, outperforming transformer-based and conventional Mamba architectures with significantly higher model complexity."

    "abstract": "The game of coding is a new framework at the intersection of game theory and coding theory; designed to transcend the fundamental limitations of classical coding theory. While traditional coding theoretic schemes rely on a strict trust assumption, that honest nodes must outnumber adversarial ones to guarantee valid decoding, the game of coding leverages the economic rationality of actors to guarantee correctness and reliable decodability, even in the presence of an adversarial majority. This capability is paramount for emerging permissionless applications, particularly decentralized machine learning (DeML). However, prior investigations into the game of coding have been strictly confined to scalar computations, limiting their applicability to real world tasks where high dimensional data is the norm. In this paper, we bridge this gap by extending the framework to the general $N$-dimensional Euclidean space. We provide a rigorous problem formulation for vector valued computations and fully characterize the equilibrium strategies of the resulting high dimensional game. Our analysis demonstrates that the resilience properties established in the scalar setting are preserved in the vector regime, establishing a theoretical foundation for secure, large scale decentralized computing without honest majority assumptions."

This formalizes afferent sensing as providing an inductive bias for efficient learning: architectures are selected based on their ability to enable effective learning (rather than directly minimizing damage). We provide theoretical convergence guarantees under smoothness and bounded-noise assumptions. We illustrate the general approach in the challenging context of biomechanical digital twins operating over long time horizons (multiple decades of the life-course). Here, we find that CAT-based evolved architectures achieve significantly higher efficiency and better age-robustness than hand-designed baselines, enabling policies that exhibit age-dependent behavioral adaptation (23% reduction in high-risk actions). Ablation studies validate CAT signals, evolution, and predictive discrepancy as essential. We release code and data for reproducibility."

In real-world scenarios, language also frequently appears as visualized text embedded in images, raising the question of whether current VLMs handle such input requests comparably. We introduce VISTA-Bench, a systematic benchmark from multimodal perception, reasoning, to unimodal understanding domains. It evaluates visualized text understanding by contrasting pure-text and visualized-text questions under controlled rendering conditions. Extensive evaluation of over 20 representative VLMs reveals a pronounced modality gap: models that perform well on pure-text queries often degrade substantially when equivalent semantic content is presented as visualized text. This gap is further amplified by increased perceptual difficulty, highlighting sensitivity to rendering variations despite unchanged semantics. Overall, VISTA-Bench provides a principled evaluation framework to diagnose this limitation and to guide progress toward more unified language representations across tokenized text and pixels.

    "abstract": "Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is a popular data embedding technique. Given a nonnegative data matrix $X$, it aims at finding two lower dimensional matrices, $W$ and $H$, such that $X\\approx WH$, where the factors $W$ and $H$ are constrained to be element-wise nonnegative. The factor $W$ serves as a basis for the columns of $X$. In order to obtain more interpretable and unique solutions, minimum-volume NMF (MinVol NMF) minimizes the volume of $W$. In this paper, we consider the dual approach, where the volume of $H$ is maximized instead; this is referred to as maximum-volume NMF (MaxVol NMF). MaxVol NMF is identifiable under the same conditions as MinVol NMF in the noiseless case, but it behaves rather differently in the presence of noise. In practice, MaxVol NMF is much more effective to extract a sparse decomposition and does not generate rank-deficient solutions. In fact, we prove that the solutions of MaxVol NMF with the largest volume correspond to clustering the columns of $X$ in disjoint clusters, while the solutions of MinVol NMF with smallest volume are rank deficient. We propose two algorithms to solve MaxVol NMF. We also present a normalized variant of MaxVol NMF that exhibits better performance than MinVol NMF and MaxVol NMF, and can be interpreted as a continuum between standard NMF and orthogonal NMF. We illustrate our results in the context of hyperspectral unmixing."

We initialize the system in the ground state of the Hamiltonian in either the BTC or the non-BTC phase, and drive it across the BTC transition. The driving is done by an abrupt quench or by a finite-time linear ramp of a Hamiltonian control parameter under Markovian Lindblad dynamics. We diagnose DQPTs through zeros of the fidelity-based Loschmidt echo between the initial state and the evolving mixed state, which induce nonanalytic cusp-like features in the associated rate function. For quenches into the BTC phase, the Loschmidt echo exhibits repeated zeros due to the emergent time-periodic steady state, whereas for quenches into the non-BTC phase, the overlap vanishes and remains zero once the dynamics relaxes to a stationary state. We further show that the DQPT persists under the ramp protocol followed by unitary evolution with the final Hamiltonian. Finally, we analyze the finite-size scaling of the first critical time and find convergence to a constant in the thermodynamic limit, with distinct power-law approaches for the quench and the ramp protocols."

To address this gap, we propose a unified framework that recasts the estimation of any given multi-state transition model as a set of Poisson regression problems. This reformulation enables the direct application of existing fair pricing methods, which together constitute our proposed methodology. As an illustration, we apply the framework to a fair pricing exercise for a stylized long-term care insurance product using data from the University of Michigan Health and Retirement Study (HRS), focusing on a post-processing approach.

On the algebraic side, we decompose the transposition class sum into cut and join channels and recover the classical cut-and-join operator on the ring of symmetric functions. On the geometric side, we use the Grojnowski-Nakajima Fock space identification to realize the ladder operator $E_1=[W_0,p_1]$ as the Hecke correspondence on $\\mathrm{Hilb}_n(\\mathbb C^2)$, and we interpret the cubic generator $W_0$ as a normal ordered triple incidence correspondence. We then explain how the $β$-deformed cubic generator $W_0^{(β)}$ arises from the Ward identities/Virasoro constraints of the Gaussian $β$-ensemble via a background charge parametrization, clarifying its conformal field theoretic meaning. Finally, using the Grojnowski-Nakajima Heisenberg-Fock isomorphism $Φ_{\\mathrm{Hilb}}:Λ\\xrightarrow{\\sim}\\bigoplus_{n\\ge0}H_T^*(\\Hilb^n(\\mathbb C^2))$, we transport the resulting commutator hierarchy to Hilbert schemes, where $E_1$ is realised by the Hecke correspondence (adding one point) and the diagonal correction terms are computed by equivariant localization from the $T$-weights of the tangent bundle $T\\Hilb^n(\\mathbb C^2)$ and the tautological bundle $\\mathcal V$.

However, standard evaluation tools like the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and the area under the curve (AUC) are designed for point scores and fail to capture the impact of predictive uncertainty on ranking performance. We propose an uncertainty-aware ROC framework specifically for interval-valued predictions, introducing two new measures: $AUC_L$ and $AUC_U$. This framework enables an informative three-region decomposition of the ROC plane, partitioning pairwise rankings into correct, incorrect, and uncertain orderings. This approach naturally supports selective prediction by allowing models to abstain from ranking cases with overlapping intervals, thereby optimizing the trade-off between abstention rate and discriminative reliability. We prove that under valid class-conditional coverage, $AUC_L$ and $AUC_U$ provide formal lower and upper bounds on the theoretical optimal AUC ($AUC^*$), characterizing the physical limit of achievable discrimination. The proposed framework applies broadly to interval-valued prediction models, regardless of the interval construction method. Experiments on real-world benchmark datasets, using bootstrap-based intervals as one instantiation, validate the framework's correctness and demonstrate its practical utility for uncertainty-aware evaluation and decision-making."

Recent efforts to encode EEG signals into large language models (LLMs) show promise in handling neural signals across diverse patients, but two significant challenges remain: (1) multi-channel heterogeneity, as seizure-relevant information varies substantially across EEG channels, and (2) computing inefficiency, as the EEG signals need to be encoded into a massive number of tokens for the prediction. To address these issues, we draw the EEG signal and propose the novel NeuroCanvas framework. Specifically, NeuroCanvas consists of two modules: (i) The Entropy-guided Channel Selector (ECS) selects the seizure-relevant channels input to LLM and (ii) the following Canvas of Neuron Signal (CNS) converts selected multi-channel heterogeneous EEG signals into structured visual representations. The ECS module alleviates the multi-channel heterogeneity issue, and the CNS uses compact visual tokens to represent the EEG signals that improve the computing efficiency. We evaluate NeuroCanvas across multiple seizure detection datasets, demonstrating a significant improvement of $20\\%$ in F1 score and reductions of $88\\%$ in inference latency. These results highlight NeuroCanvas as a scalable and effective solution for real-time and resource-efficient seizure detection in clinical practice.The code will be released at https://github.com/Yanchen30247/seizure_detect."

A2MAML models each modality-specific feature as a stochastic estimate with uncertainty prediction, actively selects reliable agent-modality pairs, and aggregates information via Bayesian inverse-variance weighting. This formulation enables fine-grained, modality-level fusion, supports asymmetric modality availability, and provides a principled mechanism to suppress corrupted or noisy modalities.

As a result, interventions remain siloed and are difficult to evaluate and compare, leading to a reactive cycle of whack-a-mole. We contribute the first comprehensive AIG-NCII technological ecosystem that maps and taxonomizes 11 categories of technologies facilitating the creation, distribution, proliferation and discovery, infrastructural support, and monetization of AIG-NCII. First, we build and visualize the ecosystem through a synthesis of over a hundred primary sources from researchers, journalists, advocates, policymakers, and technologists. Next, we demonstrate how stakeholders can use the ecosystem as a tool to 1) understand new incidents of harm via a case study of Grok and 2) evaluate existing interventions via three more case studies. We conclude with three actionable recommendations, namely that stakeholders should 1) use the ecosystem to map out state, federal, and international laws to produce a clearer policy landscape, 2) collectively develop a database that dynamically tracks the 11 technologies in the ecosystem to better evaluate interventions, and 3) adopt a relational approach to researching AIG-NCII to better understand how the ecosystem technologies interact."

    "abstract": "Missing data are ubiquitous in empirical databases, yet statistical analyses typically require complete data matrices. Multiple imputation offers a principled solution for filling these gaps. This study evaluates the performance of several multiple imputation methods, both in the presence and absence of extreme values, using the MICE package in R. Through Monte Carlo simulations, we generated incomplete data sets with three variables and assessed each imputation method within regression models. The results indicate that the linear regression based imputation method showed the best overall predictive performance (CV-MSE), whereas the sparse model approach was generally less efficient. Our findings underscore the relevance of extreme values when selecting an imputation strategy and highlight sample size, proportion of missingness, presence of extremes, and the type of fitted model as key determinants of performance. Despite its limitations, the study offers practical recommendations for researchers, stressing the need to examine the missingness mechanism and the occurrence of extreme values before choosing an imputation method."

    "abstract": "Semantic segmentation of high-resolution remote-sensing imagery is critical for urban mapping and land-cover monitoring, yet training data typically exhibits severe long-tailed pixel imbalance. In the dataset LoveDA, this challenge is compounded by an explicit Urban/Rural split with distinct appearance and inconsistent class-frequency statistics across domains. We present a prompt-controlled diffusion augmentation framework that synthesizes paired label--image samples with explicit control of both domain and semantic composition. Stage~A uses a domain-aware, masked ratio-conditioned discrete diffusion model to generate layouts that satisfy user-specified class-ratio targets while respecting learned co-occurrence structure. Stage~B translates layouts into photorealistic, domain-consistent images using Stable Diffusion with ControlNet guidance. Mixing the resulting ratio and domain-controlled synthetic pairs with real data yields consistent improvements across multiple segmentation backbones, with gains concentrated on minority classes and improved Urban and Rural generalization, demonstrating controllable augmentation as a practical mechanism to mitigate long-tail bias in remote-sensing segmentation.

To counteract the first, bounded archives are employed as a strategic mechanism for effectively managing the increasing number of non-dominated solutions. Addressing the second challenge involves an in-depth exploration of solution diversity algorithms found in existing literature. Upon recognizing that current approaches predominantly center on diversity within the objective space, this research introduces innovative methods specifically designed to enhance diversity in the solution space. Results demonstrate the efficacy of the Hamming Distance Archiving Algorithm, one of the newly proposed algorithms for multi-objective local search, surpassing the performance of the Adaptive Grid Archiving and the Hypervolume Archiving, both drawn from the literature. This outcome suggests a promising avenue for enhancing the overall efficiency of metaheuristics employed for solving MOOPs."

We first present a nonlinear MPC scheme for autonomous vehicles. Building on this nominal scheme, we assume limited uncertainty in tire parameters as well as bounded force disturbances in both lateral and longitudinal directions. By simplifying the perturbed model, we optimize a CCM for the uncertain model, which is validated through simulations at the dynamic limits of vehicle performance. This CCM is subsequently employed to parameterize a homothetic tube used for constraint tightening within the MPC formulation. The resulting robust nonlinear MPC is computationally more efficient than competing methods, as it introduces only a single additional state variable into the prediction model compared to the nominal scheme. Simulation results demonstrate that the homothetic tube expands most significantly in regions where the nominal scheme would otherwise violate constraints, illustrating its ability to capture all uncertain trajectories while avoiding unnecessary conservatism."

    "abstract": "Drawing on constructs from psychology, prior work has identified a distinction between explicit and implicit bias in large language models (LLMs). While many LLMs undergo post-training alignment and safety procedures to avoid expressions of explicit social bias, they still exhibit significant implicit biases on indirect tasks resembling the Implicit Association Test (IAT). Recent work has further shown that inference-time reasoning can impair LLM performance on tasks that rely on implicit statistical learning. Motivated by a theoretical link between implicit associations and statistical learning in human cognition, we examine how reasoning-enabled inference affects implicit bias in LLMs. We find that enabling reasoning significantly reduces measured implicit bias on an IAT-style evaluation for some model classes across fifteen stereotype topics. This effect appears specific to social bias domains, as we observe no corresponding reduction for non-social implicit associations. As reasoning is increasingly enabled by default in deployed LLMs, these findings suggest that it can meaningfully alter fairness evaluation outcomes in some systems, while also raising questions about how alignment procedures interact with inference-time reasoning to drive variation in bias reduction across model types. More broadly, this work highlights how theory from cognitive science and psychology can complement AI evaluation research by providing methodological and interpretive frameworks that reveal new insights into model behavior."

Phase 1 assessed GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet 3.5, Pixtral 12B, and Qwen VL Plus; Phase 2 evaluated their successors (GPT-5, Claude Sonnet 4.5, Pixtral Large, and Qwen Omni) yielding 82,256 human harm ratings. Large, persistent differences emerged across model families: Pixtral models were consistently the most vulnerable, whereas Claude models appeared safest due to high refusal rates. Attack success rates (ASR) showed clear alignment drift: GPT and Claude models exhibited increased ASR across generations, while Pixtral and Qwen showed modest decreases. Modality effects also shifted over time: text-only prompts were more effective in Phase 1, whereas Phase 2 produced model-specific patterns, with GPT-5 and Claude 4.5 showing near-equivalent vulnerability across modalities. These findings demonstrate that MLLM harmlessness is neither uniform nor stable across updates, underscoring the need for longitudinal, multimodal benchmarks to track evolving safety behaviour."

We also propose Manipulating Data Features (MDF), a lightweight approach that summarizes candidate data through their mean representations and injects them into the forward pass of a base model, allowing latent statistical signals in the data to shape model activations and reveal potential biases and safety risks without updating any parameters. MDF achieves reliable prediction while consuming only about 20% of the GPU resources required for fine-tuning. Experiments on Qwen3-14B, Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct, and Gemma-3-12b-it confirm that MDF can anticipate unintended behaviors and provide insight into pre-training vulnerabilities."

However, most deep generative models focus exclusively on perfectly ordered crystals, neglecting the important class of disordered materials. To address this gap, we introduce DMFlow, a generative framework specifically designed for disordered crystals. Our approach introduces a unified representation for ordered, Substitutionally Disordered (SD), and Positionally Disordered (PD) crystals, and employs a flow matching model to jointly generate all structural components. A key innovation is a Riemannian flow matching framework with spherical reparameterization, which ensures physically valid disorder weights on the probability simplex. The vector field is learned by a novel Graph Neural Network (GNN) that incorporates physical symmetries and a specialized message-passing scheme. Finally, a two-stage discretization procedure converts the continuous weights into multi-hot atomic assignments. To support research in this area, we release a benchmark containing SD, PD, and mixed structures curated from the Crystallography Open Database. Experiments on Crystal Structure Prediction (CSP) and De Novo Generation (DNG) tasks demonstrate that DMFlow significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines adapted from ordered crystal generation. We hope our work provides a foundation for the AI-driven discovery of disordered materials."

However, several ultra stable laser systems observed additional noise sources that hinder the realization of the expected improvements in frequency stability. These additional noise sources are related to the birefringence of the coatings and its modification by intracavity light. The origin of the birefringence is not yet well understood and its modification via illumination remains unexplained. Here we present an extensive study on the steady-state and transient modification of the birefringence by intracavity light and by uniform illumination at various wavelengths using an optical cavity at room temperature. We find a unified description that suggests a primary two-photon process for photon energies below the bandgap of GaAs, or a single-photon process at higher energies. Adding external illumination allows to reduce noise induced by laser power fluctuations by balancing the photo-thermal-optic response of the mirrors and the photo-birefringent effect at a more favorable low intracavity power."

We introduce the first evolutionary, hardware-in-the-loop mapping framework for neuromorphic accelerators, enabling users without deep hardware knowledge to deploy workloads more efficiently. We evaluate our approach on Intel Loihi 2, a representative spatial accelerator featuring 152 cores per chip in a 2D mesh. Our method achieves up to 35% reduction in total latency compared to default heuristics on two sparse multi-layer perceptron networks.

By contrast, Feature Error Rate (FER) has recently attracted attention as a viable metric that reveals linguistically meaningful errors in models' performance. In this paper, we evaluate three speech encoders on two African languages by complementing WER with CER, and FER, and add a tone-aware extension (TER). We show that by computing errors on phonological features, FER and TER reveal linguistically-salient error patterns even when word-level accuracy remains low. Our results reveal that models perform better on segmental features, while tones (especially mid and downstep) remain the most challenging features. Results on Yoruba show a striking differential in metrics, with WER=0.788, CER=0.305, and FER=0.151. Similarly for Uneme (an endangered language absent from pretraining data) a model with near-total WER and 0.461 CER achieves the relatively low FER of 0.267. This indicates model error is often attributable to individual phonetic feature errors, which is obscured by all-or-nothing metrics like WER."

They are driven by a resonant interaction between streaming dust and waves in a background medium, which results in dust density fluctuations and amplification of the waves. This broad class of instabilities includes recently-proposed modes incorporating acoustic and magnetohydrodynamic waves, as well as the well-studied disk streaming instability. As the study of RDIs is at an early stage, their evolution beyond the linear regime is not well understood. In order to make inroads into the nonlinear theory of RDIs, we performed simulations of the simplest case, the acoustic RDI, in which sound waves in a gas are amplified by interaction with supersonically streaming dust. This particular instability is of interest both due its potential relevance in various poorly ionized environments, and due to its resemblance to the fast magnetosonic RDI. We find that the nonlinear growth and saturation of the instability are characterized by a balance between time scales of instability growth and turbulent eddy turnover. The simulations demonstrate a saturated state possessing an anisotropic outer forcing range in which this balance is maintained, and suggest the presence of an isotropic turbulent inertial range below this scale. By presenting a model for the nonlinear growth and saturated state of the acoustic RDI, this work provides a framework for further study of the nonlinear behavior of this and other RDIs."

We ask whether selective refusal can be moved entirely offline: can a mechanistic understanding of category-specific refusal be distilled into a circuit-restricted weight update that deploys as a standard checkpoint? We propose C-Δθ: Circuit Restricted Weight Arithmetic, which (i) localizes refusal-causal computation as a sparse circuit using EAP-IG and (ii) computes a constrained weight update ΔθC supported only on that circuit (typically <5% of parameters). Applying ΔθC yields a drop-in edited checkpoint with no inference-time hooks, shifting cost from per-request intervention to a one-time offline update.

First, we introduce a hardware-aware native formulation for multi-state probabilistic digits (p-dits) that avoids the locally dense intra-variable couplings required by binary Ising encodings. We validate p-dit dynamics by reproducing known critical behavior of the 2D Potts model. Second, we propose mean-field constraints (MFC), a hybrid scheme that replaces dense pairwise constraint couplings with dynamically updated single-node biases. Applied to balanced graph partitioning, MFC achieves solution quality comparable to exact all-to-all constraint formulations while dramatically reducing graph density. Finally, we demonstrate the practical impact of restored sparsity by an FPGA implementation, enabling orders-of-magnitude acceleration over CPU-based solvers. Together, these results outline a pathway for scaling constrained optimization on probabilistic hardware."

This creates a fundamental mismatch: in inverse problems, the desired output is typically a posterior distribution and most PnPDP solvers induce a distribution over reconstructions, but existing benchmarks only evaluate a single reconstruction, ignoring distributional characterization such as uncertainty. To address this gap, we conduct a systematic study to benchmark the uncertainty quantification (UQ) of existing diffusion inverse solvers. Specifically, we design a rigorous toy model simulation to evaluate the uncertainty behavior of various PnPDP solvers, and propose a UQ-driven categorization. Through extensive experiments on toy simulations and diverse real-world scientific inverse problems, we observe uncertainty behaviors consistent with our taxonomy and theoretical justification, providing new insights for evaluating and understanding the uncertainty for PnPDPs."

The first relies on precomputed road costs for optimal routing and heuristic algorithms for generating alternatives, while the second, generative methods, has recently gained significant attention. However, the former struggles with personalization and route diversity, while the latter fails to meet the efficiency requirements of large-scale real-time scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose GenMRP, a generative framework for multi-route planning. To ensure generation efficiency, GenMRP first introduces a skeleton-to-capillary approach that dynamically constructs a relevant sub-network significantly smaller than the full road network. Within this sub-network, routes are generated iteratively. The first iteration identifies the optimal route, while the subsequent ones generate alternatives that balance quality and diversity using the newly proposed correctional boosting approach. Each iteration incorporates road features, user historical sequences, and previously generated routes into a Link Cost Model to update road costs, followed by route generation using the Dijkstra algorithm. Extensive experiments show that GenMRP achieves state-of-the-art performance with high efficiency in both offline and online environments. To facilitate further research, we have publicly released the training and evaluation dataset. GenMRP has been fully deployed in a real-world navigation app, demonstrating its effectiveness and benefits."

Unlike the leading vision-language systems that tokenize videos through a naive frame-sampling strategy, we propose to decouple the spatial and temporal representations of videos by retaining the spatial features of a single key frame while encoding each subsequent frame into a single residual token, achieving compact yet expressive video tokenization. Our experiments suggest that VTok effectively reduces the complexity of video representation from the product of frame count and per-frame token count to their sum, while the residual tokens sufficiently capture viewpoint and motion changes relative to the key frame. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of VTok: it achieves notably higher performance on a range of video understanding and text-to-video generation benchmarks compared with baselines using naive tokenization, all with shorter token sequences per video (e.g., 3.4% higher accuracy on our TV-Align benchmark and 1.9% higher VBench score). Remarkably, VTok produces more coherent motion and stronger guidance following in text-to-video generation, owing to its more consistent temporal encoding. We hope VTok can serve as a standardized video tokenization paradigm for future research in video understanding and generation."

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) for Verilog code generation are increasingly adopted in hardware design, yet remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks where adversaries inject malicious triggers during training to induce vulnerable hardware designs. Unlike patchable software vulnerabilities, hardware trojans become irreversible once fabricated, making remediation extremely costly or impossible. Existing active defenses require access to training data, impractical for third-party LLM users, while passive defenses struggle against semantically stealthy triggers that naturally blend into design specifications. In this paper, we hypothesize that under the requirements of both effectiveness and stealthiness, attackers are strongly biased toward embedding triggers in non-functional requirements (e.g., style modifiers, quality descriptors) rather than functional specifications that determine hardware behavior. Exploiting this insight, we propose Semantic Consensus Decoding (SCD), an inference-time passive defense with two key components: (1) functional requirement extraction that identifies essential requirements from user specifications, and (2) consensus decoding that adaptively fuses output distributions based on full user specifications and extracted functional requirements. When these distributions diverge significantly, SCD automatically suppresses suspicious components. Extensive experiments with three representative backdoor attacks demonstrate that SCD reduces average attack success rate from 89% to under 3% with negligible impact on generation quality."

We construct explicit lattice models to showcase three topological phenomena characterized by the Berry-dipole moment: a flat-band returning pump featuring bidirectional, soliton-like displacement of Wannier centers by exactly n unit cells per half cycle, a dipolar Haldane phase diagram arising from the competition between time-reversal and parity symmetries, and n pairs of bulk helical zero modes whose existence depends on the orientation of pseudomagnetic field. Our findings establish a universal framework for the topology beyond Chern class in perfectly flat bands and provide a tunable platform for exploring quantum geometry and interaction-driven phases."

    "abstract": "Stack Overflow is a popular Q&A platform where users ask technical questions and receive answers from a community of experts. Recently, there has been a significant increase in the number of answers generated by ChatGPT, which can lead to incorrect and unreliable information being posted on the site. While Stack Overflow has banned such AI-generated content, detecting whether a post is ChatGPT-generated remains a challenging task. We introduce a novel approach, SOGPTSpotter, that employs Siamese Neural Networks, leveraging the BigBird model and the Triplet loss, to detect ChatGPT-generated answers on Stack Overflow. We use triplets of human answers, reference answers, and ChatGPT answers. Our empirical evaluation reveals that our approach outperforms well-established baselines like GPTZero, DetectGPT, GLTR, BERT, RoBERTa, and GPT-2 in identifying ChatGPT-synthesized Stack Overflow responses. We also conducted an ablation study to show the effectiveness of our model. Additional experiments were conducted to assess various factors, including the impact of text length, the model's robustness against adversarial attacks, and its generalization capabilities across different domains and large language models. We also conducted a real-world case study on Stack Overflow. Using our tool's recommendations, Stack Overflow moderators were able to identify and take down ChatGPT-suspected generated answers, demonstrating the practical applicability and effectiveness of our approach."

    "abstract": "Multi-cellular programs (MCPs) are coordinated patterns of gene expression across interacting cell types that collectively drive complex biological processes such as tissue development and immune responses. While MCPs are typically estimated from high-dimensional gene expression data using methods like sparse principal component analysis or latent factor models, these approaches often suffer from high computational costs and limited statistical power. In this work, we propose Sparse Group Principal Component Analysis (SGPCA) to estimate MCPs by leveraging their inherent group and individual sparsity. We introduce an efficient double-thresholding algorithm based on power iteration. In each iteration, a group thresholding step first identifies relevant gene groups, followed by an individual thresholding step to select active cell types. This algorithm achieves a linear computational complexity of $O(np)$, making it highly efficient and scalable for large-scale genomic analyses. We establish theoretical guarantees for SGPCA, including statistical consistency and a convergence rate that surpasses competing methods. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate that SGPCA achieves superior estimation accuracy and improved statistical power for signal detection. Furthermore, We apply SGPCA to a Lupus study, discovering differentially expressed MCPs distinguishing Lupus patients from normal subjects."

In this paper, we prove the existence, uniqueness and regularity of the weak solution to such a recent model proposed in [25,35]. To this end, firstly, we introduce a fully implicit time semi-discrete approximation and a fully discrete approximation for an appropriate weak formulation of the thermodynamically consistent model. Next, by using the zeros of a vector field theorem, we prove the existence of the weak solution for the fully discrete approximation. Then the existence of weak solutions for the fully implicit time semi-discrete approximation and the weak formulation of the model are derived by the weak convergence technique and the energy stability estimate. Subsequently, by the Gr{\\\" o}nwall inequality, we prove the uniqueness result under the smoothness assumption on the chemical potential. Finally, combined with the regularity theory of elliptic partial differential equations (PDE), the regularity of the weak solution for the model with complete Neumann boundary conditions is established."

Taking inspiration from both matters, we address the decays $Z\\to\\ell_α\\ell_β$, with $\\ell_α\\ne\\ell_β$, thus violating charged-lepton flavor. We calculate the set of contributing one-loop diagrams characterized by virtual neutral leptons, both light and heavy, emerged from the inverse seesaw mechanism for the generation of neutrino mass. By neglecting charged-lepton and light-neutrino masses, and then assuming that the mass spectrum of the heavy neutral leptons is degenerate, we find that a relation $\\textrm{Br}\\big( Z\\to\\ell_α\\ell_β\\big)\\propto\\big| η_{βα} \\big|^2$, with $η$ the matrix describing non-unitarity effects in light-lepton mixing, is fulfilled. Our quantitative analysis, which considers both scenarios of degenerate and non-degenerate masses of heavy neutral leptons, takes into account upper bounds on $η_{μe}$, imposed by current constraints on the decay $μ\\to eγ$ from the MEG II experiment, while projected future sensitivity of this experiment is considered as well. We find that, even though current constraints on $Z\\to\\ell_α\\ell_β$, by the ATLAS Collaboration, remain far from inverse-seesaw contributions, improved sensitivity from in-plans machines, such as the Future Circular Collider and the Circular Electron Positron Collider, shall be able to probe this mass-generating mechanism through these decays."

Several approaches suggest that supporting LLMs with additional guidance can improve PoC generation outcomes, motivating further evaluation of their effectiveness. In this work, we develop PoC-Gym, a framework for PoC generation for Java security vulnerabilities via LLMs and systematic validation of generated exploits. Using PoC-Gym, we evaluate whether the guidance from static analysis tools improves the PoC generation success rate and manually inspect the resulting PoCs. Our results from running PoC-Gym with Claude Sonnet 4, GPT-5 Medium, and gpt-oss-20b show that using static analysis for guidance and criteria lead to 21% higher success rates than the prior baseline, FaultLine. However, manual inspection of both successful and failed PoCs reveals that 71.5% of the PoCs are invalid. These results show that the reported success of LLM-based PoC generation can be significantly misleading, which is hard to detect with current validation mechanisms."

While post-training quantization (PTQ) maintains high fidelity at 4-bit, it deteriorates at 2-3 bits. Fundamentally, existing methods enforce a shape-invariant quantization grid (e.g., the fixed uniform intervals of UINT2) for each group, severely restricting the feasible set for error minimization. To address this, we propose Bit-Plane Decomposition Quantization (BPDQ), which constructs a variable quantization grid via bit-planes and scalar coefficients, and iteratively refines them using approximate second-order information while progressively compensating quantization errors to minimize output discrepancy. In the 2-bit regime, BPDQ enables serving Qwen2.5-72B on a single RTX 3090 with 83.85% GSM8K accuracy (vs. 90.83% at 16-bit). Moreover, we provide theoretical analysis showing that the variable grid expands the feasible set, and that the quantization process consistently aligns with the optimization objective in Hessian-induced geometry.

    "abstract": "Odor visualization translates odor information and perception into visual outcomes and arouses the corresponding olfactory synesthesia, surpassing the spatial limitation that odors can only be perceived where they are present. Traditional odor visualization has typically relied on unidimensional mappings, such as odor-to-color associations, and has required extensive manual design efforts. However, the advent of generative AI (Gen AI) and large language models (LLMs) presents a new opportunity for automatic odor visualization. Nonetheless, gaps remain in bridging olfactory perception with generative tools to produce odor images. To address these gaps, this paper introduces Paint by Odor, a pipeline that leverages Gen AI and LLMs to transform olfactory perceptions into rich, aesthetically engaging visual representations. Two experiments were conducted, where 30 participants smelled real-world odors and provided descriptive data and 28 participants evaluated 560 generated odor images through seven systematically designed prompts. Our findings explored the capability of LLMs in producing olfactory perception by comparing it with human responses and revealed the underlying mechanisms and effects of language-based descriptions and several abstraction styles on odor visualization. Our work further discussed the possibility of automatic odor visualization without human participation. These explorations and results have bridged the research gap in odor visualization using LLMs and Gen AI, offering valuable design insights and various possibilities for future applications."

We propose TL-GPSTGN, a transfer-oriented spatiotemporal framework that enhances sample efficiency and out-of-distribution generalization by selectively pruning non-optimized graph context. Specifically, our method employs information-theoretic and correlation-based criteria to extract structurally informative subgraphs and features, resulting in a compact, semantically grounded representation. This optimized context is subsequently integrated into a spatiotemporal convolutional architecture to capture complex multivariate dynamics. Evaluations on large-scale traffic benchmarks demonstrate that TL-GPSTGN consistently outperforms baselines in low-data transfer scenarios. Our findings suggest that explicit context pruning serves as a powerful inductive bias for improving the robustness of graph-based forecasting models."

We suggest that the orbital currents generated by the orbital Hall effect in Cr can be injected into Tb with negligible loss at the interface and then efficiently interact with the orbital moments. Our work implies that orbital currents could be harnessed to manipulate the orbital magnetization of materials, which would advance the development of orbitronics."

Using UD-derived supervision, we compare lemma-driven baselines (lemma TF--IDF + Logistic Regression; BERTurk trained on lemma sequences), a grammar-only Logistic Regression over UD morphosyntax (UPOS/DEPREL/MORPH), and a full-input BERTurk baseline. We evaluate on a controlled diagnostic set with Random negatives, lexical controls (NLVC), and LVC positives, reporting split-wise performance to expose decision-boundary behavior. Results show that coarse morphosyntax alone is insufficient for robust LVC detection under controlled contrasts, while lexical identity supports LVC judgments but is sensitive to calibration and normalization choices. Overall, Our findings motivate targeted evaluation of Turkish MWEs and show that ``lemma-only'' is not a single, well-defined representation, but one that depends critically on how normalization is operationalized."

This paper studies the contextual bandit problem under a uniform $(1-δ)$-fairness constraint, and addresses its unique vulnerabilities to strategic manipulation. The fairness constraint ensures that preferential treatment is strictly justified by an arm's actual reward across all contexts and time horizons, using uniformity to prevent statistical loopholes. We develop novel algorithms that achieve (nearly) minimax-optimal regret for both linear and smooth reward functions, while maintaining strong $(1-\\tilde{O}(1/T))$-fairness guarantees, and further characterize the theoretically inherent yet asymptotically marginal \"price of fairness\". However, we reveal that such merit-based fairness becomes uniquely susceptible to signal manipulation. We show that an adversary with a minimal $\\tilde{O}(1)$ budget can not only degrade overall performance as in traditional attacks, but also selectively induce insidious fairness-specific failures while leaving conspicuous regret measures largely unaffected. To counter this, we design robust variants incorporating corruption-adaptive exploration and error-compensated thresholding. Our approach yields the first minimax-optimal regret bounds under $C$-budgeted attack while preserving $(1-\\tilde{O}(1/T))$-fairness. Numerical experiments and a real-world case demonstrate that our algorithms sustain both fairness and efficiency."

By incorporating this additional information, we can provide a stronger privacy guarantee (e.g. an amplification). The range restricted formal privacy standards protect only a subset (or ball) of data values and exclude ranges (or balls) believed to be already publicly known. The privacy standards are designed for the risk-weighted pseudo posterior (model) mechanism (PPM) used to generate synthetic data under an asymptotic Differential (aDP) privacy guarantee. The PPM downweights the likelihood contribution for each record proportionally to its disclosure risk. The PPM is adapted under inclusion of beliefs by adjusting the risk-weighted pseudo likelihood. We introduce two alternative adjustments. The first expresses data owner knowledge of the sensitive range as a probability, $λ$, that a datum value drawn from the underlying generating distribution lies outside the ball or subspace of values that are sensitive. The portion of each datum likelihood contribution deemed sensitive is then $(1-λ) \\leq 1$ and is the only portion of the likelihood subject to risk down-weighting. The second adjustment encodes knowledge as the difference in probability masses $P(R) \\leq 1$ between the edges of the sensitive range, $R$. We use the resulting conditional (pseudo) likelihood for a sensitive record, which boosts its worst case tail values away from 0. We compare privacy and utility properties for the PPM under the aDP and range restricted privacy standards."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel outer approximation algorithm for nonsmooth mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problems. The method proceeds by fixing the integer variables and solving the resulting nonlinear convex subproblem. When the subproblem is feasible, valid linear cuts are derived by computing suitable subgradients of the objective and constraint functions at the optimal solution, utilizing KKT optimality conditions. A new parameter, defined through the nonlinear constraint functions, is introduced to facilitate the generation of these cuts. For infeasible subproblems, a feasibility problem is solved, and valid linear cuts are generated via KKT-based subgradients to exclude the infeasible integer assignment. By integrating both types of cuts, a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) master problem is formulated and proven equivalent to the original MINLP. This equivalence underpins a new outer approximation algorithm, which is guaranteed to terminate after a finite number of iterations. Numerical experiments on smooth convex MINLP problems demonstrate that the proposed algorithm produces tighter MILP relaxations than the classical outer approximation method. Furthermore, the approach offers an alternative mechanism for generating linear cuts, extending beyond reliance solely on first-order Taylor expansions and shows that the efficiency of outer approximation algorithm is strongly dependent on the inherent structure of the MINLP problem."

Our approach leverages rich molecular priors learned from large-scale SMILES corpora to steer molecular generation towards high-reward, synthesizable chemical spaces.

    "abstract": "Given a text, a query $\\mathsf{rank}(q, c)$ counts the number of occurrences of character $c$ among the first $q$ characters of the text. Space-efficient methods to answer these rank queries form an important building block in many succinct data structures. For example, the FM-index is a widely used data structure that uses rank queries to locate all occurrences of a pattern in a text. In bioinformatics applications, the goal is usually to process a given input as fast as possible. Thus, data structures should have high throughput when used with many threads. Contributions. For the binary alphabet, we develop BiRank with 3.28% space overhead. It merges the central ideas of two recent papers: (1) we interleave (inline) offsets in each cache line of the underlying bit vector [Laws et al., 2024], reducing cache-misses, and (2) these offsets are to the middle of each block so that only half of them need popcounting [Gottlieb and Reinert, 2025]. In QuadRank (14.4% space overhead), we extend these techniques to the $σ=4$ (DNA) alphabet. Both data structures require only a single cache miss per query, making them highly suitable for high-throughput and memory-bound settings. To enable efficient batch-processing, we support prefetching the cache lines required to answer upcoming queries. Results. BiRank and QuadRank are around $1.5\\times$ and $2\\times$ faster than similar-overhead methods that do not use inlining. Prefetching gives an additional $2\\times$ speedup, at which point the dual-channel DDR4 RAM bandwidth becomes a hard limit on the total throughput. With prefetching, both methods outperform all other methods apart from SPIDER [Laws et al., 2024] by $2\\times$. When using QuadRank with prefetching in a toy count-only FM-index, QuadFm, this results in a smaller size and up to $4\\times$ speedup over Genedex, a state-of-the-art batching FM-index implementation."

Starting from a local Taylor expansion around the fixed point and the bifurcation parameter, we derive a reduced description that captures the convergence towards stationary state both at and near criticality. At the bifurcation point, three universal critical exponents are obtained, characterising the short-time behaviour, the asymptotic decay, and the crossover between these regimes. Away from criticality, a fourth exponent governing the relaxation time is identified. We show this phenomenology, well established for one-dimensional maps, extends naturally to two-dimensional mappings. By projecting the dynamics onto the centre manifold, we demonstrate that the local normal form of a two-dimensional period-doubling bifurcation reduces to the same universal structure found in one dimension. The theoretical predictions are validated numerically using the Hénon and Ikeda maps, showing excellent agreement for all scaling laws and critical exponents."

Continuing in this spirit, Crnčević, Hernández, Rizk, Sereesuchart and Tao considered the joint distribution of $ω(n)$ and $ω(\\lfloorαn\\rfloor)$, which they showed to be asymptotically independent for irrational values of $α$. Generalising both results, we show that for any positive integer $k$, real numbers $α_1, \\dots, α_k > 0$ and $β_1, \\dots, β_k$, where $α_i/α_j$ is irrational for $i\\neq j$, the joint distribution of $(ω(\\lfloorα_in + β_i\\rfloor) - \\log\\log N)/\\sqrt{\\log\\log N}$ converges to the $k$-dimensional standard Gaussian. We next discuss quantitative bounds on the rate of convergence which do not depend on the values taken by the relevant parameters. Banks and Shparlinski remarked that such quantitative bounds may be given for a single Beatty sequence $\\lfloorαn + β\\rfloor$ under Diophantine type assumptions on $α$. We show that such assumptions are in fact unnecessary. Specifically, for any real numbers $α> 0, β$, we show that the Kolmogorov distance between the random variable $(ω(\\lfloorαn + β\\rfloor) - \\log\\log N)/\\sqrt{\\log\\log N}$ and the standard Gaussian is bounded above by $O(\\log\\log\\log N/\\sqrt{\\log\\log N})$ as $N$ tends to infinity.

    "abstract": "Recent work has shown that diffusion models can generate high-quality images by operating directly on SSL patch features rather than pixel-space latents. However, the dense patch grids from encoders like DINOv2 contain significant redundancy, making diffusion needlessly expensive. We introduce FlatDINO, a variational autoencoder that compresses this representation into a one-dimensional sequence of just 32 continuous tokens -an 8x reduction in sequence length and 48x compression in total dimensionality. On ImageNet 256x256, a DiT-XL trained on FlatDINO latents achieves a gFID of 1.80 with classifier-free guidance while requiring 8x fewer FLOPs per forward pass and up to 4.5x fewer FLOPs per training step compared to diffusion on uncompressed DINOv2 features. These are preliminary results and this work is in progress."

These surfaces can be obtained by contracting disjoint chains of smooth rational curves inside the anticanonical cycle $D$ of a smooth log Calabi-Yau surface $(Y,D)$ with maximal boundary and considering the result as an orbifold. The Fukaya-Seidel categories of these abstract Lefschetz fibrations admit semiorthogonal decompositions akin to the ones described via the derived special McKay correspondence of Ishii and Ueda arXiv:1104.2381v2 [math.AG]. We apply this construction to establish an equivalence at the large volume limit between the derived category of an effective orbifold log Calabi-Yau surface with points of type $\\frac{1}{k}(1,1)$ and the Fukaya-Seidel category of its mirror Lefschetz fibration. We also compare the abstract construction to an explicit Landau-Ginzburg model defined by a Laurent polynomial associated to a toric degeneration in the case of the family of hypersurfaces $X_{k+1}\\subset \\mathbb{P}(1,1,1,k)$. The hypersurfaces $X_{k+1}$ admit a non-trivial moduli of complex structures, which we compare with an open subset of the space of symplectic structures on the total space of the mirror Landau-Ginzburg model via a mirror map built out of intrinsic quantities in a non-exact Fukaya-Seidel category."

However, existing proposals require low-noise quantum communication and long-lived quantum memory, capabilities which remain challenging to realize in practice. In this work, we introduce a quantum digital signature scheme that operates with only classical communication, using the classical shadows of states produced by random circuits as public keys. We provide theoretical and numerical evidence supporting the conjectured hardness of learning the private key (the circuit) from the public key (the shadow). A key technical ingredient enabling our scheme is an improved state-certification primitive that achieves higher noise tolerance and lower sample complexity than prior methods. We realize this certification by designing a high-rate error-detecting code tailored to our random-circuit ensemble and experimentally generating shadows for 32-qubit states using circuits with $\\geq 80$ logical ($\\geq 582$ physical) two-qubit gates, attaining 0.90 $\\pm$ 0.01 fidelity. With increased number of measurement samples, our hardware-demonstrated primitives realize a proof-of-principle quantum digital signature, demonstrating the near-term feasibility of our scheme."

Challenging this assumption, our study reveals that during fake news generation, even when a model rejects a harmful request, its Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning may still internally contain and propagate unsafe narratives. To analyze this phenomenon, we introduce a unified safety-analysis framework that systematically deconstructs CoT generation across model layers and evaluates the role of individual attention heads through Jacobian-based spectral metrics. Within this framework, we introduce three interpretable measures: stability, geometry, and energy to quantify how specific attention heads respond or embed deceptive reasoning patterns. Extensive experiments on multiple reasoning-oriented LLMs show that the generation risk rise significantly when the thinking mode is activated, where the critical routing decisions concentrated in only a few contiguous mid-depth layers. By precisely identifying the attention heads responsible for this divergence, our work challenges the assumption that refusal implies safety and provides a new understanding perspective for mitigating latent reasoning risks."

    "abstract": "As computer systems continue to diversify across technologies, architectures, applications, and beyond, the relevant design space has become larger and more complex. Given such trends, design space exploration (DSE) at early stages is critical to ensure agile development towards optimal performance and cost. Industry-grade EDA tools directly take in RTL code and report accurate results, but do not perform DSE. Recent works have attempted to explore the design space via simulation. However, most of these works are domain-specific and constrain the space that users are allowed to explore, offering limited flexibility between technologies, architecture, and applications. Moreover, they often demand high domain expertise to ensure high accuracy. To enable simulation that is agnostic to technology, architecture, and application at any granularity, we introduce Architecture-Graph (Agraph), a graph that unifies the system representation surrounding any arbitrary application, software, architecture, and circuit. Such a unified representation distinguishes Agraph from prior works, which focus on a single stack, allowing users to freely explore the design space across system stacks. To fully unleash the potential of Agraph, we further present Archx, a framework that implements Agraph. Archx is user-friendly in two ways. First, Archx has an easy-to-use programming interface to automatically generate and sweep design points under user constraints, boosting the programmability. Second, Archx adopts scope-based metric retrieval to analyze and understand each design point at any user-preferred hierarchy, enhancing the explainability. We conduct case studies that demonstrate Agraph's generalization across technologies, architecture, and applications with high simulation accuracy. Overall, we argue that Agraph and Archx serve as a foundation to simulate both performance and cost at will."

The negative branch is associated with near-exponential or factorial growth of degeneracies for $ n \\gg 1$ in a region of large $N$ stability, while the positive branch occurs when the finite $N$ reduction of degrees of freedom takes over as $n$ becomes sufficiently large compared to $N$."

Whereas the METR study claims that fitting sigmoid/logistic curves results in inflection points far in the future, we fit a sigmoid curve to their current data and find that the inflection point has already passed. In addition, we propose a more complex model that decomposes AI capabilities into base and reasoning capabilities, exhibiting individual rates of improvement. We prove that this model supports our hypothesis that AI capabilities will exhibit an inflection point in the near future.

We argue that Software Engineering, as traditionally defined around code construction and process management, is no longer sufficient. Instead, the discipline must be redefined around intent articulation, architectural control, and systematic verification.

MAE-Select fully leverages pre-trained multi-view masked autoencoder representations and dynamically selects the next most informative viewpoint at each time chunk without requiring labeled viewpoints. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MAE-Select improves the capabilities of single-camera systems and, in some cases, even surpasses multi-camera setups.

    "abstract": "Central to many self-improvement pipelines for large language models (LLMs) is the assumption that models can improve by reflecting on past mistakes. We study a phenomenon termed contextual drag: the presence of failed attempts in the context biases subsequent generations toward structurally similar errors. Across evaluations of 11 proprietary and open-weight models on 8 reasoning tasks, contextual drag induces 10-20% performance drops, and iterative self-refinement in models with severe contextual drag can collapse into self-deterioration. Structural analysis using tree edit distance reveals that subsequent reasoning trajectories inherit structurally similar error patterns from the context. We demonstrate that neither external feedback nor successful self-verification suffices to eliminate this effect. While mitigation strategies such as fallback-behavior fine-tuning and context denoising yield partial improvements, they fail to fully restore baseline performance, positioning contextual drag as a persistent failure mode in current reasoning architectures."

    "abstract": "Current multiton dark matter (DM) detectors are largely incapable of detecting light dark matter from the Galactic halo due to the energy threshold limitations of their recoil measurements. However, primordial black holes (PBHs) can evaporate via Hawking radiation to particles whose energies are set by the black hole temperature. Consequently, weakly interacting light dark matter (or dark radiation) particles produced in this manner can reach the Earth with sufficient flux and kinetic energy above the experimental thresholds. This opens up a novel avenue to probe the light dark sector in terrestrial experiments. In this work, we explore this possibility by considering fermionic DM produced through PBH evaporation and investigate its electron recoil signatures in direct detection experiments. We analyze both energy independent (constant) and energy dependent (scalar and vector mediated) DM-electron interactions, highlighting the strong dependence of the recoil spectra on the underlying Lorentz structure of the interaction. In addition, we also account for the attenuation effects due to loss of kinetic energy while DM traverses through Earth's crust, which can significantly modify the incoming DM flux. Incorporating these effects carefully, we place constraints on light DM using the electron recoil data from XENONnT, LZ, and PandaX-4T. Finally, we also discuss the detection prospects of such dark matter in current and future generation neutrino detectors, such as Super Kamiokande and Hyper Kamiokande."

While impressive progress has been made, at low rates, compression introduces artifacts that degrade visual quality significantly. We introduce NiFi, a method for extreme 3DGS compression through restoration via artifact-aware, diffusion-based one-step distillation.

While the exact astrophysical origins of these variations are still a matter of debate, their identification provides insights on the environment of the Sun's birth and the formation of the Solar System. Here we present a new Python tool called SIMPLE (Stellar Interpretation of Meteoritic Data and Plotting for Everyone) designed to compare the isotopic composition of the ejecta from core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) with meteoritic data. In the present version, the SIMPLE toolkit includes a dataset of 18 CCSN models, from 6 different published sets, with initial masses of 15, 20, and 25 M$_{\\odot}$ and solar metallicity. SIMPLE is designed to easily extract the isotopic abundances predicted by each CCSN model for any elements and post-process them into the format needed to compare to the meteoritic data, therefore, facilitating their interpretation. As an example of how to use SIMPLE, we analyze the composition of the Ni isotopes in the 18 models and confirm that bulk meteorite Ni anomalies are compatible with material from the innermost Si-rich region of CCSN ejecta. Designed as a collaborative platform, SIMPLE is open-source and welcomes community contributions to enhance its development and dissemination for stellar nucleosynthesis and meteoritic studies. Future enhancements include addition of more model predictions and inclusion of mixing between different layers of supernova ejecta."

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are widely used as zero-shot and few-shot classifiers, where task behaviour is largely controlled through prompting. A growing number of works have observed that LLMs are sensitive to prompt variations, with small changes leading to large changes in performance. However, in many cases, the investigation of sensitivity is performed using underspecified prompts that provide minimal task instructions and weakly constrain the model's output space. In this work, we argue that a significant portion of the observed prompt sensitivity can be attributed to prompt underspecification. We systematically study and compare the sensitivity of underspecified prompts and prompts that provide specific instructions. Utilising performance analysis, logit analysis, and linear probing, we find that underspecified prompts exhibit higher performance variance and lower logit values for relevant tokens, while instruction-prompts suffer less from such problems. However, linear probing analysis suggests that the effects of prompt underspecification have only a marginal impact on the internal LLM representations, instead emerging in the final layers. Overall, our findings highlight the need for more rigour when investigating and mitigating prompt sensitivity."

    "abstract": "A/B testing on platforms often faces challenges from network interference, where a unit's outcome depends not only on its own treatment but also on the treatments of its network neighbors. To address this, cluster-level randomization has become standard, enabling the use of network-aware estimators. These estimators typically trim the data to retain only a subset of informative units, achieving low bias under suitable conditions but often suffering from high variance. In this paper, we first demonstrate that the interior nodes - units whose neighbors all lie within the same cluster - constitute the vast majority of the post-trimming subpopulation. In light of this, we propose directly averaging over the interior nodes to construct the mean-in-interior (MII) estimator, which circumvents the delicate reweighting required by existing network-aware estimators and substantially reduces variance in classical settings. However, we show that interior nodes are often not representative of the full population, particularly in terms of network-dependent covariates, leading to notable bias. We then augment the MII estimator with a counterfactual predictor trained on the entire network, allowing us to adjust for covariate distribution shifts between the interior nodes and full population. By rearranging the expression, we reveal that our augmented MII estimator embodies an analytical form of the point estimator within prediction-powered inference framework. This insight motivates a semi-supervised lens, wherein interior nodes are treated as labeled data subject to selection bias. Extensive and challenging simulation studies demonstrate the outstanding performance of our augmented MII estimator across various settings."

    "abstract": "The La2-xSrxCuO4+delta (LSCO) system provides a unique experimental setting for exploring how magnetism, superconductivity, and disorder jointly shape charge transport in a doped Mott insulator. Transport measurements in lightly doped and oxygen-enriched LSCO reveal a strongly insulating normal state governed by variable-range hopping, accompanied by pronounced nonlinear current-voltage characteristics and, at low temperatures, current-induced negative differential resistance. With increasing carrier concentration, these features evolve into regimes characterized by granular and percolative superconductivity near the threshold of bulk superconductivity and, eventually, into a homogeneous strange-metal state close to optimal doping. Throughout this evolution, the transport response shows marked sensitivity to disorder, electronic inhomogeneity, and external control parameters, such as bias current and magnetic field. Rather than reflecting a sequence of sharply distinct phases, the observed transport regimes form a continuous crossover from a localization-dominated insulating state to granular superconductivity and further to a coherent metallic state. This crossover is driven primarily by the progressive enhancement of electronic screening, inter-region coupling, and superconducting connectivity, rather than by abrupt changes in the underlying microscopic scattering mechanisms. Taken together, the available transport data provide a coherent experimental basis for understanding how disorder and mesoscale electronic inhomogeneity organize charge transport and superconductivity across the LSCO phase diagram, underscoring the central role of percolation and nonequilibrium effects in underdoped cuprates."

Recent training-free zero-shot methods often employ Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to compose a target image description for retrieval. However, due to the fuzzy matching nature of ZS-CIR, the generated description is prone to semantic bias relative to the target image. We propose SDR-CIR, a training-free Semantic Debias Ranking method based on CoT reasoning. First, Selective CoT guides the MLLM to extract visual content relevant to the modification text during image understanding, thereby reducing visual noise at the source. We then introduce a Semantic Debias Ranking with two steps, Anchor and Debias, to mitigate semantic bias. In the Anchor step, we fuse reference image features with target description features to reinforce useful semantics and supplement omitted cues. In the Debias step, we explicitly model the visual semantic contribution of the reference image to the description and incorporate it into the similarity score as a penalty term. By supplementing omitted cues while suppressing redundancy, SDR-CIR mitigates semantic bias and improves retrieval performance. Experiments on three standard CIR benchmarks show that SDR-CIR achieves state-of-the-art results among one-stage methods while maintaining high efficiency.

SynthVerse includes several new domains and object types missing from existing synthetic datasets, such as animated-film-style content, embodied manipulation, scene navigation, and articulated objects. SynthVerse substantially expands dataset diversity by covering a broader range of object categories and providing high-quality dynamic motions and interactions, enabling more robust training and evaluation for general point tracking.

    "abstract": "LLM-augmented data systems enable semantic querying over structured and unstructured data, but executing queries with LLM-powered operators introduces a fundamental runtime--accuracy trade-off. In this paper, we present Stretto, a new execution engine that provides end-to-end query guarantees while efficiently navigating this trade-off in a holistic manner. For this, Stretto formulates query planning as a constrained optimization problem and uses a gradient-based optimizer to jointly select operator implementations and allocate error budgets across pipelines. Moreover, to enable fine-grained execution choices, Stretto introduces a novel idea on how KV-caching can be used to realize a spectrum of different physical operators that transform a sparse design space into a dense continuum of runtime--accuracy trade-offs. Experiments show that Stretto outperforms state-of-the-art systems while consistently meeting quality guarantees."

The concept of $S$-spectrum for quaternionic operators emerged as the natural spectrum in slice hyperholomorphic functional calculi, known as the $S$-functional calculus and also utilized in the quaternionic spectral theorem. This spectral theory extends to Clifford operators. A key distinction from classical complex spectral theory lies in the definition of the $S$-spectrum, which is second order in the operator $T$, and in the $S$-resolvent operators that turns out to be the product of two different operators. This study delves into the analyticity of the $S$-resolvent operators under specified boundary conditions for the $S$-spectral problem. The spectral theory on the $S$-spectrum also provides deeper insights into classical spectral theory."

Our analysis covers both weak and strong convergence regimes, corresponding respectively to rigid-lid and \"fully periodic\" boundary conditions. Furthermore, we explore the impact of relaxing the hydrostatic assumption in the stochastic primitive equations by retaining martingale terms as deviations from hydrostatic equilibrium. This modified model, obtained through a specific asymptotic scaling accessible only within the stochastic framework, captures non-hydrostatic effects while remaining within the primitive equations formalism. The resulting generalized hydrostatic model has been shown to be well-posed when the additional terms are regularized using a suitable filter for divergence-free noises under suitable assumptions. Within this setting, we demonstrate that the model provides a higher-order approximation of the 3D Navier-Stokes equations for appropriately scaled noises."

    "abstract": "Self-consistency methods are the core technique for improving the reasoning reliability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). By generating multiple reasoning results through repeated sampling and selecting the best answer via voting, they play an important role in cross-modal tasks. However, most existing self-consistency methods are limited to a fixed ``repeated sampling and voting'' paradigm and do not reuse historical reasoning information. As a result, models struggle to actively correct visual understanding errors and dynamically adjust their reasoning during iteration. Inspired by the human reasoning behavior of repeated verification and dynamic error correction, we propose the H-GIVR framework. During iterative reasoning, the MLLM observes the image multiple times and uses previously generated answers as references for subsequent steps, enabling dynamic correction of errors and improving answer accuracy. We conduct comprehensive experiments on five datasets and three models. The results show that the H-GIVR framework can significantly improve cross-modal reasoning accuracy while maintaining low computational cost. For instance, using \\texttt{Llama3.2-vision:11b} on the ScienceQA dataset, the model requires an average of 2.57 responses per question to achieve an accuracy of 78.90\\%, representing a 107\\% improvement over the baseline."

Such methods fail in in-the-wild setting characterized by variable embodiments and dynamic open environments. This paper introduces self-evolving embodied AI, a new paradigm in which agents operate based on their changing state and environment with memory self-updating, task self-switching, environment self-prediction, embodiment self-adaptation, and model self-evolution, aiming to achieve continually adaptive intelligence with autonomous evolution. Specifically, we present the definition, framework, components, and mechanisms of self-evolving embodied AI, systematically review state-of-the-art works for realized components, discuss practical applications, and point out future research directions.

We propose $\\texttt{LoRDO}$, a principled framework unifying low-rank optimization with infrequent synchronization. We first demonstrate that, while global projections based on pseudo-gradients are theoretically superior, they permanently restrict the optimization trajectory to a low-rank subspace. To restore subspace exploration, we introduce a full-rank quasi-hyperbolic update. $\\texttt{LoRDO}$ achieves near-parity with low-rank $\\texttt{DDP}$ in language modeling and downstream tasks at model scales of $125$M--$720$M, while reducing communication by $\\approx 10 \\times$.

While effective, this paradigm treats supervision as a binary filter that systematically excludes teacher-generated errors, leaving a gap in how reasoning failures are modeled during training. In this paper, we propose TrajFusion, a fine-tuning strategy that reframes rejection sampling as a structured supervision construction process. Specifically, TrajFusion forms fused trajectories that explicitly model trial-and-error reasoning by interleaving selected incorrect trajectories with reflection prompts and correct trajectories. The length of each fused sample is adaptively controlled based on the frequency and diversity of teacher errors, providing richer supervision for challenging problems while safely reducing to vanilla rejection sampling fine-tuning (RFT) when error signals are uninformative. TrajFusion requires no changes to the architecture or training objective. Extensive experiments across multiple math benchmarks demonstrate that TrajFusion consistently outperforms RFT, particularly on challenging and long-form reasoning problems."

Despite extensive exploration of reward processing strategies and training dynamics, all existing group-based methods exclusively use KL divergence for policy regularization, leaving the choice of divergence function unexplored. We introduce Group-Based Mirror Policy Optimization (GBMPO), a framework that extends group-based policy optimization to flexible Bregman divergences, including hand-designed alternatives (L2 in probability space) and learned neural mirror maps. On GSM8K mathematical reasoning, hand-designed ProbL2-GRPO achieves 86.7% accuracy, improving +5.5 points over the Dr. GRPO baseline. On MBPP code generation, neural mirror maps reach 60.1-60.8% pass@1, with random initialization already capturing most of the benefit. While evolutionary strategies meta-learning provides marginal accuracy improvements, its primary value lies in variance reduction ($\\pm$0.2 versus $\\pm$0.6) and efficiency gains (15% shorter responses on MBPP), suggesting that random initialization of neural mirror maps is sufficient for most practical applications. These results establish divergence choice as a critical, previously unexplored design dimension in group-based policy optimization for LLM reasoning."

Our results indicate that HNSO is efficiently produced on grain surfaces through reactions involving atomic oxygen and nitrogen atoms with the radicals NS and SO, forming NSO as a key intermediate. Subsequent hydrogenation of NSO leads to HNSO, with a clear preference for the lowest energy cis conformer, while the trans form is metastable and may be short-lived under typical interstellar conditions. The models predict that solid HNSO can reach abundances comparable to icy OCS, placing it among the major sulfur-bearing species in interstellar ices. Gas-phase abundances, in contrast, remain lower than those of OCS. The implementation of a multibinding scheme in our models clarifies the role of diffusive chemistry in the production of HNSO at early times, improving agreement with observations. These findings suggest that reactions involving diffusing O and N atoms on icy grains contribute significantly to sulfur chemistry and beyond in dense clouds and motivate further searches for molecules containing simultaneously H, N, O and S in other astronomical environments."

    "abstract": "In recent years, strong-field processes such as high-order harmonic generation (HHG) and above-threshold ionization driven by nonclassical states of light have become an increasingly popular field of study. The theoretical modeling of these processes often applies an approximate phase-space expansion of the nonclassical driving field in terms of coherent states, which has been shown to accurately predict the harmonic spectrum. However, its accuracy for the computation of quantum optical observables like the degree of squeezing and photon statistics has not been thoroughly considered. In this work, we introduce this approximative phase-space description and discuss its accuracy, and we find that it mischaracterizes the quantum optical properties of the driving laser by making it an incoherent mixture of classical states. We further show that this error in the driving field description maps onto the light emitted from HHG, as neither sub-Poissonian photon statistics nor quadrature squeezing below vacuum fluctuations can be captured by the approximative phase-space description. Lastly, to benchmark the approximative phase-space description, we consider the quantum HHG from a one-band model, which yields an exact analytical solution. Using the approximative phase-space representation with this specific model, we find a small quantitative error in the quadrature variance of the emitted field that scales with pulse duration and emitter density. Our results show that using this approximative phase-space description can mischaracterize quantum optical observables. Attributing physical meaning to such results should therefore be accompanied by a quantitative analysis of the error."

To this end, we propose MSH-LLM, a Multi-Scale Hypergraph method that aligns Large Language Models for time series analysis. Specifically, a hyperedging mechanism is designed to enhance the multi-scale semantic information of time series semantic space. Then, a cross-modality alignment (CMA) module is introduced to align the modality between natural language and time series at different scales. In addition, a mixture of prompts (MoP) mechanism is introduced to provide contextual information and enhance the ability of LLMs to understand the multi-scale temporal patterns of time series. Experimental results on 27 real-world datasets across 5 different applications demonstrate that MSH-LLM achieves the state-of-the-art results."

We train dense and convolutional neural networks on Pauli-measurement outcomes, provide design guidelines for each architecture, and systematically compare their performance across types of states. To interpret the models, we compute Shapley values to quantify the contribution of each measurement, analyze measurement-importance patterns across different systems, and use these insights to guide a measurement-reduction scheme.

Reviewing the ChartU dataset synthesis and data selection domains, we find that subsets can potentially probe the MLLMs' capability gains from full-set fine-tuning. Given that data diversity is vital for boosting MLLMs' performance and entropy reflects this feature, we propose EXaMCaP, which uses entropy gain maximization to select a subset. To obtain a high-diversity subset, EXaMCaP chooses the maximum-entropy subset from the large ChartU dataset. As enumerating all possible subsets is impractical, EXaMCaP iteratively selects samples to maximize the gain in set entropy relative to the current set, approximating the maximum-entropy subset of the full dataset. Experiments show that EXaMCaP outperforms baselines in probing the capability gains of the ChartU training set, along with its strong effectiveness across diverse subset sizes and compatibility with various MLLM architectures."

It is, however, widely recognized that this classical framework is inadequate for random phenomena involving quantum effects, and more generally for \\emph{quantum-like} situations. A broader formulation is provided by an algebraic viewpoint: one starts from an algebra of random variables equipped with a distinguished linear functional -- the \\emph{state} -- interpreted as expectation. In this sense, the approach can also be viewed as a modern reading of ideas already implicit in early probability (e.g., the Bernoullis), while its contemporary form has been developed and used extensively in quantum physics. The algebraic framework accommodates both classical and quantum-like behaviours, yet it remains underused in classical probability and uncertainty quantification, where it can nevertheless open new perspectives and clarify structural features. Although the language carries a physics flavor, the subject is purely probabilistic. The key distinction between classical and quantum-like behaviour is \\emph{commutativity}: its failure produces the characteristic effects of quantum-like situations. The rise of quantum computing is a prominent setting in which such behaviour may become relevant even for practitioners in computational science. Here we focus on the purely algebraic core of the approach. By restricting attention to finite-dimensional algebras, we avoid many analytical subtleties while retaining the main ideas, their classical limit, and their applicability to quantum-like models and quantum computation."

We propose MirrorLA, a geometric framework that substitutes passive truncation with active reorientation. By leveraging learnable Householder reflections, MirrorLA rotates the feature geometry into the non-negative orthant to maximize information retention. Our approach restores representational density through a cohesive, multi-scale design: it first optimizes local discriminability via block-wise isometries, stabilizes long-context dynamics using variance-aware modulation to diversify activations, and finally, integrates dispersed subspaces via cross-head reflections to induce global covariance mixing. MirrorLA achieves state-of-the-art performance across standard benchmarks, demonstrating that strictly linear efficiency can be achieved without compromising representational fidelity."

However, most existing grid design methods neglect the influence of base station height, assuming instead that the base station is positioned at ground level - a simplification that rarely reflects real-world deployments. To overcome this limitation, we propose a generalized grid design framework that accommodates arbitrary base station locations. Unlike conventional correlation-based approaches, our method optimizes the grid based on the minimization of the optimal normalized mean squared error, leading to more accurate channel representation. We evaluate the performance of a hybrid U-MIMO system operating at sub-THz frequencies, considering the P-SOMP algorithm for channel estimation. Analytical and numerical results show that the proposed design enhances both channel estimation accuracy and spectral efficiency compared to existing alternatives."

    "abstract": "Molybdenum carbide (MoC) is a promising candidate for substituting expensive platinum-group metals in many applications owing to its low cost and excellent properties. A comprehensive understanding of the carrier dynamics in MoC facilitates its implementations and helps designing synthesis strategies. In this work, the carrier relaxation in MoC nanosheets is investigated by combining femtosecond transient reflection spectroscopy with first-principles calculations. The observed processes of electron-electron, electron-phonon, and phonon-phonon scattering show longer lifetimes compared to those of other transition metal carbides. The nanosecond carrier lifetime is explained by the restricted phonon decay pathways induced by the large mass difference between C and Mo atoms, which is revealed through the analysis of calculated phonon dispersion. The slow cooling of hot carriers in MoC nanosheets offers a simple approach for designing devices that effectively utilize hot carriers, which are expected to improve photothermal and photovoltaic performances."

This need is especially evident in fast-evolving biomedical fields such as the gut-brain axis, where research investigates complex interactions between the gut microbiota and brain-related disorders. Existing biomedical IE benchmarks, however, are often narrow in scope and rely heavily on distantly supervised or automatically generated annotations, limiting their utility for advancing robust IE methods. We introduce GutBrainIE, a benchmark based on more than 1,600 PubMed abstracts, manually annotated by biomedical and terminological experts with fine-grained entities, concept-level links, and relations. While grounded in the gut-brain axis, the benchmark's rich schema, multiple tasks, and combination of highly curated and weakly supervised data make it broadly applicable to the development and evaluation of biomedical IE systems across domains."

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of low earth orbit (LEO) satellites, the design of integrated communication and navigation (ICAN) signals has attracted increasing attention, especially in the field of vehicle-to-everything (V2X). As a new-generation waveform, Affine Frequency Division Multiplexing (AFDM) features high robustness against Doppler effects, a simple modulation structure, and low pilot overhead, making it a promising candidate for high-dynamic LEO satellite scenarios. However, LEO-ICAN AFDM signals face challenges in fractional delay and Doppler frequency estimation. Existing studies that ignore its inherent spectrum wrapping phenomenon may lead to deviations of varying degrees in model construction. This paper conducts an in-depth derivation of AFDM's input-output relationship under fractional cases, reveals the envelope characteristics of its equivalent channel, and proposes a joint estimation algorithm based on peak-to-sidelobe power ratio (PSPR) detection and early-late gate (ELG) to estimate fractional Doppler frequency and delay. Simulations show that the algorithm has low complexity, low guard interval overhead, and high precision compared with traditional methods."

    "abstract": "We study the asymptotic spectral behavior of high-dimensional random Gram matrices with sparsity and a given variance profile, motivated by applications in wireless communication. Specifically, we consider the Gram matrices $\\mathbf S_n=\\mathbf Y_n\\mathbf Y_n^*$, where the entries of $\\mathbf Y_n$ are independent, centered, heteroscedastic, and sparse through Bernoulli masking. The sparsity level is parameterized as $s=q^2/n$, with $q$ ranging from polynomial order to order $n^{1/2}$. We investigate two asymptotic regimes in a high-dimensional framework: a moderate-sparsity regime with fixed $s\\in(0,1]$, and a high-sparsity regime where $s\\to0$. In both regimes, we establish the convergence of the empirical spectral distribution of $\\mathbf S_n$ to a deterministic limit, and further derive central limit theorems for linear spectral statistics using resolvent techniques and martingale difference arguments. Our analysis reveals a phase transition in the fluctuation behavior across the two regimes. In the high-sparsity regime, the asymptotic fluctuations are governed by fourth-moment effects, with sparsity-scaled contributions being suppressed. Moreover, a mismatch between the scaling of the mean and variance, of different orders in $q$, necessitates an explicit correction in the centering of the linear spectral statistic. The theory applies to both Gaussian and non-Gaussian entries, and its statistical utility is illustrated through applications to hypothesis testing and outage probability analysis in large-scale MIMO systems."

    "abstract": "Face fill-light enhancement (FFE) brightens underexposed faces by adding virtual fill light while keeping the original scene illumination and background unchanged. Most face relighting methods aim to reshape overall lighting, which can suppress the input illumination or modify the entire scene, leading to foreground-background inconsistency and mismatching practical FFE needs. To support scalable learning, we introduce LightYourFace-160K (LYF-160K), a large-scale paired dataset built with a physically consistent renderer that injects a disk-shaped area fill light controlled by six disentangled factors, producing 160K before-and-after pairs. We first pretrain a physics-aware lighting prompt (PALP) that embeds the 6D parameters into conditioning tokens, using an auxiliary planar-light reconstruction objective. Building on a pretrained diffusion backbone, we then train a fill-light diffusion (FiLitDiff), an efficient one-step model conditioned on physically grounded lighting codes, enabling controllable and high-fidelity fill lighting at low computational cost. Experiments on held-out paired sets demonstrate strong perceptual quality and competitive full-reference metrics, while better preserving background illumination. The dataset and model will be at https://github.com/gobunu/Light-Up-Your-Face."

    "abstract": "We present a canonical quantization of electromagnetic modes in cylindrical waveguides, extending a gauge-based formalism previously developed for Cartesian geometries [1]. By introducing the two field quadratures $X,Y$ of TEM (transverse electric-magnetic), but also of TM (transverse magnetic) and TE (transverse electric) traveling modes, we identify for each a characteristic one-dimensional scalar field (a generalized flux $\\varphi$) governed by a Klein-Gordon type equation. The associated Hamiltonian is derived explicitly from Maxwell's equations, allowing the construction of bosonic ladder operators. The generalized flux is directly deduced from the electromagnetic potentials $A,V$ by a proper gauge choice, generalizing Devoret's approach [2]. Our analysis unifies the treatment of cylindrical and Cartesian guided modes under a consistent and generic framework, ensuring both theoretical insight and experimental relevance. We derive mode-specific capacitance and inductance from the field profiles and express voltage and current in terms of the canonical field variables. Measurable quantities are therefore properly defined from the mode quantum operators, especially for the non-trivial TM and TE ones. The formalism shall extend in future works to any other type of waveguides, especially on-chip coplanar geometries particularly relevant to quantum technologies."

    "abstract": "We propose the Convolutional Operator Network for Forward and Inverse Problems (FI-Conv), a framework capable of predicting system evolution and estimating parameters in complex spatio-temporal dynamics, such as turbulence. FI-Conv is built on a U-Net architecture, in which most convolutional layers are replaced by ConvNeXt V2 blocks. This design preserves U-Net performance on inputs with high-frequency variations while maintaining low computational complexity. FI-Conv uses an initial state, PDE parameters, and evolution time as input to predict the system future state. As a representative example of a system exhibiting complex dynamics, we evaluate the performance of FI-Conv on the task of predicting turbulent plasma fields governed by the Hasegawa-Wakatani (HW) equations. The HW system models two-dimensional electrostatic drift-wave turbulence and exhibits strongly nonlinear behavior, making accurate approximation and long-term prediction particularly challenging. Using an autoregressive forecasting procedure, FI-Conv achieves accurate forward prediction of the plasma state evolution over short times (t ~ 3) and captures the statistic properties of derived physical quantities of interest over longer times (t ~ 100). Moreover, we develop a gradient-descent-based inverse estimation method that accurately infers PDE parameters from plasma state evolution data, without modifying the trained model weights. Collectively, our results demonstrate that FI-Conv can be an effective alternative to existing physics-informed machine learning methods for systems with complex spatio-temporal dynamics."

This raises the natural question of whether every almost o-minimal structure admits a proper elementary extension that is again almost o-minimal. The main result of this paper provides an affirmative answer to this question."

    "abstract": "The integration of reinforcement learning (RL) into large language models (LLMs) has opened new opportunities for recommender systems by eliciting reasoning and improving user preference modeling. However, RL-based LLM recommendation faces significant efficiency challenges, making full-data training costly. Existing data selection methods define sample value based on learnability or representativeness, yet their loss- or gradient-driven or dataset coverage-driven criteria often misalign with RL learning dynamics, resulting in suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose MiniRec, a data selection framework tailored for RL-based LLM recommendation. MiniRec evaluates sample learnability using key RL signals -- rewards -- pruning samples that are too easy (too high reward) or too difficult (consistently low reward). It assesses representativeness by aligning sample gradients with the approximated \"ideal\" global RL optimization trajectory, selecting samples that mainly drive model updates, and it also enforces diversity to reduce redundancy. Combined with a curriculum learning strategy from easy to hard samples, MiniRec significantly reduces training cost while largely preserving performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate MiniRec's effectiveness, highlighting the importance of reward-aligned, trajectory-informed data selection in RL-based LLM recommendation."

The basic VLBI correlation and fringe fitting operations, including fringe rotation, Fourier transform, delay compensation, and cross correlation, can be implemented via quantum algorithms with significantly reduced computational complexity. We construct a full quantum processing pipeline and validate its feasibility and accuracy through direct comparison with a classical VLBI pipeline. We recognize that amplitude encoding of large data volumes remains the primary bottleneck in quantum computing; however, the quantized nature of VLBI raw data helps reduce the state-preparation complexity. Our investigation demonstrates that quantum computation offers a promising paradigm for VLBI data correlation and is likely to play a role in future VLBI systems."

    "source": "arXiv",
    "abstract": "Despite the significant progress of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) across diverse tasks, hallucination -- corresponding to the generation of visually inconsistent objects, attributes, or relations -- remains a major obstacle to their reliable deployment. Unlike pure language models, MLLMs must ground their generation process in visual inputs. However, existing models often suffer from semantic drift during decoding, causing outputs to diverge from visual facts as the sequence length increases. To address this issue, we propose KVSmooth, a training-free and plug-and-play method that mitigates hallucination by performing attention-entropy-guided adaptive smoothing on hidden states. Specifically, KVSmooth applies an exponential moving average (EMA) to both keys and values in the KV-Cache, while dynamically quantifying the sink degree of each token through the entropy of its attention distribution to adaptively adjust the smoothing strength. Unlike computationally expensive retraining or contrastive decoding methods, KVSmooth operates efficiently during inference without additional training or model modification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that KVSmooth significantly reduces hallucination ($\\mathit{CHAIR}_{S}$ from $41.8 \\rightarrow 18.2$) while improving overall performance ($F_1$ score from $77.5 \\rightarrow 79.2$), achieving higher precision and recall simultaneously. In contrast, prior methods often improve one at the expense of the other, validating the effectiveness and generality of our approach."

In this paper, we prove the global convergence of the flow for arbitrary initial energy under the same positivity assumptions by establishing a non-local version of the Łojasiewicz-Simon inequality for the Paneitz-Sobolev quotient along the flow. We construct test bubbles and estimate their Paneitz-Sobolev quotients, a strategy that was carried out in the celebrated work of Brendle in the context of the Yamabe flow. We develop a more geometric and systematic proof that addresses the algebraic and computational complexity inherent in the $Q$-curvature and the Paneitz operator. Along the way, we derive a stability inequality for the Paneitz-Sobolev quotient using a higher-order Koiso-Bochner formula established in recent work of Bahuaud, Guenther, Isenberg, and Mazzeo."

We show that Deep Bernstein Networks (which utilizes Bernstein polynomials as activation functions) can act as residual-free architecture while simultaneously optimize trainability and representation power. We provide a two-fold theoretical foundation for our approach. First, we derive a theoretical lower bound on the local derivative, proving it remains strictly bounded away from zero. This directly addresses the root cause of gradient stagnation; empirically, our architecture reduces ``dead'' neurons from 90\\% in standard deep networks to less than 5\\%, outperforming ReLU, Leaky ReLU, SeLU, and GeLU. Second, we establish that the approximation error for Bernstein-based networks decays exponentially with depth, a significant improvement over the polynomial rates of ReLU-based architectures. By unifying these results, we demonstrate that Bernstein activations provide a superior mechanism for function approximation and signal flow. Our experiments on HIGGS and MNIST confirm that Deep Bernstein Networks achieve high-performance training without skip-connections, offering a principled path toward deep, residual-free architectures with enhanced expressive capacity."

Our method achieves superior results on three challenging benchmarks, demonstrating significant improvements in robustness against heavy occlusion and spatial accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency."

This strategy effectively eludes redundant operators. We further develop a sub-Hamiltonian technique and integrate a hot-start VQE optimization strategy, achieving a significant reduction in measurement costs. Numerical experiments on typical molecular systems demonstrate that Param-ADAPT-VQE outperforms the original ADAPT-VQE in computational accuracy, ansatz size, and measurement costs. Furthermore, our scheme retains the fundamental framework of ADAPT-VQE and is thus fully compatible with its various modified versions, enabling further performance improvements in specific aspects. This work presents an efficient and scalable enhancement to ADAPT-VQE, mitigating the core obstacles that impede its practical implementation in the field of molecular quantum chemistry."

We propose a modified mixed formulation that decomposes the problem into a system of Poisson equations, where the number of equations depends on both the largest interior angle and the boundary conditions on its two adjacent sides. In contrast to the naive mixed formulation, which involves only two Poisson problems, the proposed approach guarantees convergence to the true solution for arbitrary polygonal domains and general boundary conditions, including Navier, Neumann, and mixed boundary conditions. $C^0$ finite element algorithms are developed, rigorous error estimates are established, and numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the well-posedness and effectiveness of the proposed method."

In this paper, we provide a theoretical investigation by introducing a novel framework, caulking, inspired by parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods such as adapter-based fine-tuning, low-rank adaptation, and partial fine-tuning. Our analysis establishes that improved pre-trained models provably decrease the sample complexity of downstream tasks, thereby offering theoretical justification for the empirically observed scaling laws relating pre-trained model size to downstream performance, a relationship not covered by existing results."

Moreover, they intervene only at action decoding while keeping visual representations fixed-insufficient under perceptual ambiguity, where reconsidering how to perceive is as important as deciding what to do. To address these limitations, we propose SCALE, a simple inference strategy that jointly modulates visual perception and action based on 'self-uncertainty', inspired by uncertainty-driven exploration in Active Inference theory-requiring no additional training, no verifier, and only a single forward pass. SCALE broadens exploration in both perception and action under high uncertainty, while focusing on exploitation when confident-enabling adaptive execution across varying conditions. Experiments on simulated and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that SCALE improves state-of-the-art VLAs and outperforms existing TTS methods while maintaining single-pass efficiency."

Existing approaches often struggle to generalize across trajectories and parameter settings, or rely on discretization-tied decoders that do not naturally transfer across meshes and resolutions.

Using the Fourier Multi-Component and Multi-Layer Neural Network (FMMNN) as the INR backbone improves representation of complex spatial fields and yields more stable optimization than sine-based INRs. We provide a conditional theoretical justification: under stable delay observability of point measurements on a low-dimensional parametric invariant set, the reconstruction operator factors through a finite-dimensional embedding, making STRIDE-type architectures natural approximators. Experiments on four challenging benchmarks spanning chaotic dynamics and wave propagation show that STRIDE outperforms strong baselines under extremely sparse sensing, supports super-resolution, and remains robust to noise."

For example, during code-based reinforcement learning, a model may covertly manipulate logged accuracy for self-preservation. We present the first systematic study of this problem, introducing a taxonomy with five risk levels, ten fine-grained risk categories, and three incentive types. Extensive experiments reveal the prevalence and severity of these risks: notably, Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct exhibits risky behaviors in 74.4% of training runs when provided only with background information. We further analyze factors influencing these behaviors and demonstrate that implicit training-time risks also arise in multi-agent training settings.

In this work, we adapt OpenEMMA, an open-source MLLM-based end-to-end driving framework that ingests front-camera views and ego-state and outputs 10-step speed-curvature trajectories, to this setting, presenting a reproducible instruction-conditioned baseline on doScenes and investigate the effects of human instruction prompts on predicted driving behavior. We integrate doScenes directives as passenger-style prompts within OpenEMMA's vision-language interface, enabling linguistic conditioning before trajectory generation. Evaluated on 849 annotated scenes using ADE, we observe that instruction conditioning substantially improves robustness by preventing extreme baseline failures, yielding a 98.7% reduction in mean ADE. When such outliers are removed, instructions still influence trajectory alignment, with well-phrased prompts improving ADE by up to 5.1%. We use this analysis to discuss what makes a \"good\" instruction for the OpenEMMA framework.

We collect 840 spectroscopically confirmed LAEs at $z=2\\sim7$ from the literature and nearly 50\\% of them appear to have multiple components in JWST images. We further construct a sample of 248 LAEs that have two or more relatively isolated components in a circular aperture of 2$\\arcsec$ in diameter.

KD reconstructions of H\\,\\textsc{i} and CO surveys assume circular rotation in an axisymmetric potential, an assumption that is strongly violated in the barred inner Milky Way. We use high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations of gas flow in an observationally constrained barred Milky Way potential. From a quasi-steady snapshot we generate synthetic longitude--velocity data and apply a standard axisymmetric KD inversion using the circular-speed curve derived from the $m=0$ component of the same potential. To isolate non-circular effects, we remove the near--far ambiguity by selecting, for each gas element, the KD branch closest to its true distance. We find that the KD method reproduces the gas distribution reasonably well outside the bar-dominated region ($R \\gtrsim 5$~kpc), but fails systematically in the bar region ($R \\sim 0.5$--3~kpc). There the KD-reconstructed face-on map exhibits anisotropic, quadrant-dependent artifacts, including arc-like overdensities and LOS-elongated low-density cavities. In azimuthally averaged profiles, these anisotropic misassignments translate into net radial mixing: the axisymmetric KD inversion substantially fills in the true bar-induced depression (hereafter, the ``bar gap'') and yields a flatter inner profile. Distance-error maps show coherent structures with $|Δd| \\sim 1$--2~kpc and relative errors of several tens of percent along the bar and inner ring, coincident with zones where the KD mapping is intrinsically ill-conditioned, quantified by a large geometric sensitivity $S \\equiv \\left|\\partial d/\\partial V_{\\rm LOS}^{\\rm circ}\\right|$. In these regions the error is well approximated to first order by $Δd \\simeq S\\,ΔV_{\\rm LOS}$, linking KD failures directly to bar-driven streaming velocities. ..."

    "abstract": "Traditional Bell state measurement (BSM) and product basis measurements (PBM) have been integral to nearly the entire development of quantum computing. Unlike the BSM and the PBM, a recently proposed two-qubit joint measurement called the elegant joint measurement (EJM) exhibits novel tetrahedral symmetry in its single-qubit reduced states. In [Phys.Rev.Lett.126:220401], a parameterized two-qubit iso-entangled basis was proposed, with concurrence between 1/2 and 1, perfectly spanning the original EJM and conventional BSM. We present a two-qubit symmetric joint measurement having concurrence from 0 to 1/2, which is complementary to [Phys.Rev.Lett.126:220401] and contains the PBM and the original EJM. We investigate the symmetry of the current structure and its application in triangular networks. The results indicate that the reduction vectors of the current basis states exhibit rotational symmetry, rather than the aforementioned mirror symmetry; moreover, the output probability distributions of three parties in the network explicitly demonstrate the expected permutation symmetry. Furthermore, we generalize the two-qubit symmetric joint measurement to the multiqubit systems with an even number of qubits."

All previous production implementations of XDM have used the two-parameter Becke--Johnson damping function based on atomic radii. Here, we introduce and implement a new XDM variant that uses a one-parameter damping function based on atomic numbers, recently proposed by Becke. Both this new Z damping and the canonical BJ-damping variants of XDM are benchmarked on the comprehensive GMTKN55 database using minimally empirical generalised-gradient-approximation, global hybrid, and range-separated hybrid functionals. This marks the first time that the XDM (and many-body dispersion, MBD) corrections have been tested on the GMTKN55 set. Using the new WTMAD-4 metric, an outlier analysis is performed for all new data, as well as for top-ranking functionals from the literature at each rung, providing insight into both performance and consistency across the dataset. To test Z damping's transferability to the solid state, four benchmarks involving molecular crystals are also considered. Across these molecular and solid-state benchmarks, the revPBE0 and B86bPBE0 hybrid functionals, paired with the Z damped XDM variant, show excellent performance."

Yet standard impedance/scattering tools and weak-loss resonator approximations do not provide low-dimensional invariants that remain predictive under intrinsic asymmetry and realistic boundaries, nor do they cleanly separate total absorption from useful power delivered to a load. Here we develop a unified mass--energy framework for linear, single-mode, one-dimensional systems, in which energy-like and power-flow variables $(\\mathcal{U},\\mathcal{S})$ satisfy the universal invariant $\\mathcal{U}^2-\\mathcal{S}^2=|Γ_g|^2$, with the effective standing-wave ``mass'' $|Γ_g|$ becoming state-dependent under asymmetry. The Cai--Smith chart gives a bounded state-space map of stability, feedback proximity and operating states, and makes explicit the divergence between maximum absorption and useful delivery under loss. We derive four laws governing absorption and emission, validate the invariant in multiport optics via coherent perfect absorption at exceptional points using a basis-independent SVD criterion (reconciling quadratic vs quartic near-zero scaling), and map electrochemical polarization onto the same geometry by extracting $|Γ_g|$ from two-mode orthogonal fits to reveal a universal storage-to-transfer transition across pH. This framework provides a transferable design language for dissipative, boundary-controlled systems."

Early pruning decisions can lock the network into a brittle structure that is difficult to escape, especially in deep reinforcement learning (RL) where the evolving policy continually shifts the training distribution. We propose Topology-Aware Revival (TAR), a lightweight one-shot post-pruning procedure that improves static sparsity without dynamic rewiring. After static pruning, TAR performs a single revival step by allocating a small reserve budget across layers according to topology needs, randomly uniformly reactivating a few previously pruned connections within each layer, and then keeping the resulting connectivity fixed for the remainder of training. Across multiple continuous-control tasks with SAC and TD3, TAR improves final return over static sparse baselines by up to +37.9% and also outperforms dynamic sparse training baselines with a median gain of +13.5%."

We propose relative improvement, the ratio of actual risk reduction to potential reduction from a baseline predictor, which recovers the Kalai-Smorodinsky solution. Unlike absolute-scale methods that may not be comparable when groups have different potential predictability, relative improvement provides axiomatic justification including scale invariance and individual monotonicity. We establish finite-sample convergence guarantees under mild conditions."

For example, the deautonomisation procedure led directly to the development of a general theory of discrete Painlevé equations, and it seems highly likely it will play a crucial role in any future theory of higher dimensional Painlevé equations as well. Generally speaking however, higher order integrable mappings may have non-confined singularities and it is important to understand if, and how, deautonomisation should work for such mappings. In this paper we explore different deautonomisation scenarios on a series of carefully constructed higher order mappings, integrable as well as non-integrable, that possess non-confined singularities and we challenge some common assumptions regarding the co-dimensionality of the singular loci that might play a role in the deautonomisation process. Along the way we also propose a novel procedure to calculate the growth of the multiplicities of singularities that appear in so-called anticonfined singularity patterns, based on an ultradiscrete version of the mapping."

This paper studies the data efficiency for MPRM training.Our preliminary experiments reveal that MPRM training quickly saturates under random subsampling of the training data, indicating substantial redundancy within existing MC-annotated corpora.To explain this, we formalize a theoretical framework and reveal that informative gradient updates depend on two factors: label mixtures of positive/negative steps and label reliability (average MC scores of positive steps). Guided by these insights, we propose the Balanced-Information Score (BIS), which prioritizes both mixture and reliability based on existing MC signals at the rollout level, without incurring any additional cost. Across two backbones (InternVL2.5-8B and Qwen2.5-VL-7B) on VisualProcessBench, BIS-selected subsets consistently match and even surpass the full-data performance at small fractions. Notably, the BIS subset reaches full-data performance using only 10% of the training data, improving over random subsampling by a relative 4.1%."

Prior HCI research has examined how temporal feedback, such as feedback mode (Elapsed-Time vs. Remaining-Time) shapes wait-time perception. However, few studies have investigated how such feedback influences users' downstream task performance, as well as overall affective and cognitive experience. To study these effects, we conducted an online experiment where 425 participants performing a visual reasoning task experienced a 10-, 30-, or 60-second wait with a Remaining-Time, Elapsed-Time, or No Time Display. Findings show that temporal feedback mode shapes how waiting is perceived: Remaining-Time feedback increased frustration relative to Elapsed-Time feedback, while No Time Display made waits feel longer and heightened ambiguity. Notably, these experiential differences did not translate into differences in post-wait task performance. Integrating psychophysical and cognitive science perspectives, we discuss implications for implementing temporal feedback in latency-prone digital systems."

BBH mergers embedded in AGN disks are unique among GW formation channels in their generic ability to produce electromagnetic (EM) counterparts, via interactions between the merger remnant and the surrounding disk gas (though these are not always observable). While such mergers represent valuable multi-messenger sources, the lack of predictive statistical models in existing literature currently limits our ability to select possible EM counterparts with GW detections in archival data and in real time using time-domain surveys such as ZTF or LSST. Here, we employ the Monte Carlo For AGN Channel Testing and Simulation code (\\texttt{McFACTS}\\footnote{https://www.github.com/mcfacts/mcfacts}) to predict the bolometric luminosities of jets and shocks associated with LVK-detectable BBH merger remnants in AGN disks. \\texttt{McFACTS} predicts the distribution of GW observables for an underlying BH population and disk model. In this work we present a new capability that simultaneously generates the distribution of bolometric EM luminosities corresponding to these predicted GW detections. We show that (i) migration traps in dense, Sirko-Goodman-like AGN disks efficiently drive hierarchical BH mergers, yielding high-mass, high-spin BH remnants capable of powering observable EM counterparts across merger generations; and ii) mergers embedded in sufficiently dense disks with chirp mass $\\mathcal{M}\\gtrsim40M_\\odot$ are highly likely to yield observable EM counterparts for sufficiently long-lived disks and top-heavy BH initial mass functions."

However, its application to safety-critical physical systems remains constrained by the lack of stability guarantees. Standard RL algorithms prioritize reward maximization, often yielding policies that may induce oscillations or unbounded state divergence. There has significant work in incorporating Lyapunov-based stability guarantees in RL algorithms with key challenges being selecting a candidate Lyapunov function, computational complexity by using excessive function approximators and conservative policies by incorporating stability criterion in the learning process. In this work we propose a novel Lyapunov-constrained Soft Actor-Critic (LC-SAC) algorithm using Koopman operator theory. We propose use of extended dynamic mode decomposition (EDMD) to produce a linear approximation of the system and use this approximation to derive a closed form solution for candidate Lyapunov function. This derived Lyapunov function is incorporated in the SAC algorithm to further provide guarantees for a policy that stabilizes the nonlinear system. The results are evaluated trajectory tracking of a 2D Quadrotor environment based on safe-control-gym. The proposed algorithm shows training convergence and decaying violations for Lyapunov stability criterion compared to baseline vanilla SAC algorithm.

Most current methods are \"coupled\" in such a way that they generate explanations simultaneously with model inferences. As a result, these approaches incur redundant computation, high latency and poor scalability when deployed across heterogeneous sets of edge devices. In this work we propose Explainability-as-a-Service (XaaS), a distributed architecture for treating explainability as a first-class system service (as opposed to a model-specific feature). The key innovation in our proposed XaaS architecture is that it decouples inference from explanation generation allowing edge devices to request, cache and verify explanations subject to resource and latency constraints. To achieve this, we introduce three main innovations: (1) A distributed explanation cache with a semantic similarity based explanation retrieval method which significantly reduces redundant computation; (2) A lightweight verification protocol that ensures the fidelity of both cached and newly generated explanations; and (3) An adaptive explanation engine that chooses explanation methods based upon device capability and user requirement. We evaluated the performance of XaaS on three real-world edge-AI use cases: (i) manufacturing quality control; (ii) autonomous vehicle perception; and (iii) healthcare diagnostics. Experimental results show that XaaS reduces latency by 38\\% while maintaining high explanation quality across three real-world deployments. Overall, this work enables the deployment of transparent and accountable AI across large scale, heterogeneous IoT systems, and bridges the gap between XAI research and edge-practicality."

DELTA further incorporates reinforcement learning guided by a distribution-level Emotion Attunement Score to encourage emotionally attuned responses. Experiments on a multimodal counseling benchmark show that DELTA improves both counseling quality and emotion attunement across models. Ablation and qualitative analyses suggest that explicit multimodal reasoning and structured mental state representations play complementary roles in supporting empathic human-AI interaction."

Extensive experimentation on real endoscopy recordings studies our approach's most suitable configuration and evaluates SuperPoint-E feature quality. The comparison with other baselines also shows that our 3D reconstructions are denser and cover more and longer video segments because our detector fires more densely and our features are more likely to survive (i.e. higher detection precision). In addition, our descriptor is more discriminative, making the guided matching step almost redundant. The presented approach brings significant improvements in the 3D reconstructions obtained, via SfM on endoscopy videos, compared to the original SuperPoint and the gold standard SfM COLMAP pipeline."

Prior work using logistic regression achieves limited reconstruction; we show that a 3-layer MLP improves this to 63.1% top-1 accuracy, and that a transformer-based sequence decoder recovers 91.2% of tokens top-1 (94.8% top-10) on 32-token sequences from OpenWebText after training on 100M tokens. These results connect MoE routing to the broader literature on embedding inversion. We outline practical leakage scenarios (e.g., distributed inference and side channels) and show that adding noise reduces but does not eliminate reconstruction. Our findings suggest that expert selections in MoE deployments should be treated as sensitive as the underlying text."

A thin controller sits on top of this stack and exposes a single, OpenAI-style endpoint: it decides which small models and actions to run and always forwards the distilled context to a user-selected LLM that produces the final response. On this architecture, Interfaze-Beta achieves 83.6% on MMLU-Pro, 91.4% on MMLU, 81.3% on GPQA-Diamond, 57.8% on LiveCodeBench v5, and 90.0% on AIME-2025, along with strong multimodal scores on MMMU (val) (77.3%), AI2D (91.5%), ChartQA (90.9%), and Common Voice v16 (90.8%).

    "abstract": "The discrepancy between processor speed and memory system performance continues to limit the performance of many workloads. To address the issue, one effective and well studied technique is cache prefetching. Many prefetching designs have been proposed, with varying approaches and effectiveness. For example, SPP is a popular prefetcher that leverages confidence throttled recursion to speculate on the future path of program's references, however it is very susceptible to the reference reordering of higher-level caches and the OoO core. Orthogonally, AMPM is another popular approach to prefetching which uses reordering-resistant access maps to identify patterns within a region, but is unable to speculate beyond that region. In this paper, we propose SPPAM, a new approach to prefetching, inspired by prior works such as SPP and AMPM, while addressing their limitations. SPPAM utilizes online-learning to build a set of access-map patterns. These patterns are used in a speculative lookahead which is throttled by a confidence metric. Targeting the second-level cache, SPPAM alongside state-of-the-art prefetchers Berti and Bingo improve system performance by 31.4% over no prefetching and 6.2% over the baseline of Berti and Pythia."

Furthermore, we prove the exponential decay of correlations and the Central Limit Theorem for Hölder observables. A key feature of our approach is its applicability to systems where traditional spectral gap techniques fail due to the presence of singularities and the lack of invertibility.

    "abstract": "A number of studies have concluded that dreaming is mostly caused by randomly arriving internal signals because \"dream contents are random impulses\", and argued that dream sleep is unlikely to play an important part in our intellectual capacity. On the contrary, numerous functional studies have revealed that dream sleep does play an important role in our learning and other intellectual functions. Specifically, recent studies have suggested the importance of dream sleep in memory consolidation, following the findings of neural replaying of recent waking patterns in the hippocampus. The randomness has been the hurdle that divides dream theories into either functional or functionless. This study presents a cognitive and computational model of dream process. This model is simulated to perform the functions of learning and memory consolidation, which are two most popular dream functions that have been proposed. The simulations demonstrate that random signals may result in learning and memory consolidation. Thus, dreaming is proposed as a continuation of brain's waking activities that processes signals activated spontaneously and randomly from the hippocampus. The characteristics of the model are discussed and found in agreement with many characteristics concluded from various empirical studies."

Naturally labelled posets are encoded as Boolean lower triangular matrices, allowing a unified treatment of Birkhoff problem on non-isomorphic posets and Dedekind problem on antichains. A key idea is a systematic construction and indexing of poset matrices as principal submatrices of the binary Pascal matrix, leading to new structural insights through permutation similarity and domination relations. This approach provides a consistent matrix-based perspective on classical enumeration problems in poset theory."

    "abstract": "The dynamics of black hole magnetospheres critically depend on the black hole spin and on the structure of the accretion flow. In the limit of a Schwarzschild black hole immersed in a zero-net angular momentum flow, accretion is spherical. However, in the presence of a large-scale vertical magnetic field, the classical Bondi accretion model is significantly altered. The frozen-in field is stretched radially as the plasma is pulled inward by gravity. This continues until the restoring force from the magnetic tension suddenly expels the material and resets the field, allowing a new cycle to begin. Although this scenario has been well depicted in previous studies, it remains incomplete as the issues of dissipation and particle acceleration are not yet fully resolved. In this work, we aim to revisit these issues with a first-principles kinetic plasma model. We perform two-dimensional global general relativistic particle-in-cell simulations of magnetized spherical accretion onto a Schwarzschild black hole, for both pair and electron-ion plasmas. The simulations are evolved over long timescales to capture multiple flux eruption events and establish a quasi-steady state. For each accretion cycle, we find that the system goes through three main stages: (i) an ideal advection phase where magnetic flux through the horizon increases quasi-linearly with time; (ii) a reconnection-regulated phase where the net increase of the flux is slowed down by intermittent reconnection events near the horizon; and (iii) a flaring phase when a major, large-scale reconnection event expels the flux, leading to efficient particle acceleration. The emergence of large-amplitude quasi-periodic flux eruptions and concomitant particle acceleration is reminiscent of Sgr A* flaring activity. This phenomenon could also be applicable to quiescent black holes, especially isolated black holes accreting the interstellar medium."

With the advance of AI systems in recent years, it has become apparent that such agreements, in order to be acceptable to the involved parties, must remain aligned with ethical principles and moral values. However, this is notoriously difficult to ensure, especially as different human users (and their software agents) may hold different value systems, i.e. they may differently weigh the importance of individual moral values. Furthermore, it is often hard to specify the precise meaning of a value in a particular context in a computational manner. Methods to estimate value systems based on human-engineered specifications, e.g. based on value surveys, are limited in scale due to the need for intense human moderation. In this article, we propose a novel method to automatically \\emph{learn} value systems from observations and human demonstrations. In particular, we propose a formal model of the \\emph{value system learning} problem, its instantiation to sequential decision-making domains based on multi-objective Markov decision processes, as well as tailored preference-based and inverse reinforcement learning algorithms to infer value grounding functions and value systems. The approach is illustrated and evaluated by two simulated use cases."

Our approach addresses the scalability bottleneck of foundation models through a simple strategy of sequence segmentation followed by segment alignment and lightweight loop closure optimization. Without model retraining, we benefit from remarkable 3D reconstruction capacities of MUSt3R model and achieve trajectory and reconstruction performance comparable to traditional methods with more complex architecture. We evaluate S-MUSt3R on TUM, 7-Scenes and proprietary robot navigation datasets and show that S-MUSt3R runs successfully on long RGB sequences and produces accurate and consistent 3D reconstruction. Our results highlight the potential of leveraging the MUSt3R model for scalable monocular 3D scene in real-world settings, with an important advantage of making predictions directly in the metric space."

While most MOR research focuses on single-domain systems (e.g., structural dynamics or computational fluid mechanics), this work compares MOR techniques for large multi-domain problems to identify methods that remain efficient and accurate at very large scales. In particular, harmonic response simulations of vibroacoustic fluid-structure coupled systems used to compute transfer functions from an input force to either structural acceleration or pressure in the heavy fluid domain are of high interest. To achieve this, the most common MOR techniques based on modal methods and Krylov subspace methods are compared for multi-material systems. To assess the feasibility and accuracy of these techniques for different system sizes, a scalable benchmark model of a water-filled Plexiglass cylinder is developed, with mesh sizes from 10,000 to 1,000,000 Degrees of Freedom (DOF). The quality of the models is assured by validation against experimental data. The geometry, model data, and experimental results are made available so that they can be used as a benchmark for further studies. For systems larger than 100,000 DOF, the investigated modal methods become impractical due to memory limitations, even on powerful workstations. Among the tested techniques, a Krylov subspace two-level orthogonal Arnoldi reduction, combined with symmetrization and conditioning of the system matrices, provides the most accurate and efficient approximation of the target transfer functions - particularly for large-scale models up to 1,000,000 DOF. This approach achieves a speedup of up to 600 times compared to the full model."

We study a setting where voters hold intrinsic preference rankings over a set of alternatives but cast approval ballots to determine the collective outcome. The ballots are shaped by an anchoring bias: alternatives are presented sequentially by a social planner, and a voter approves an alternative if and only if it is acceptable and strictly preferred to all alternatives previously encountered. We first analyze which approval-based voting rules are anchor-proof, in the sense that they always select the same winner regardless of the presentation order. We show that this requirement is extremely demanding: only very restrictive rules satisfy it. We then turn to the potential influence of the social planner. On the upside, when the planner has no information about the voters' intrinsic preferences, she cannot manipulate the outcome."

The framework is developed for first-order logic in a purely relational language and is compatible with both classical and intuitionistic settings. Truthmaking is defined via a recursive construction over intentic states, yielding a semantic consequence relation that is shown to be sound and complete with respect to standard natural deduction. The resulting structure supports two natural extension relations, corresponding to truthmaking growth and hypothetical refinement, which are shown to satisfy the axioms governing Linnebo's bi-modal potentialist semantics. Moreover, we investigate the computational properties of the non-hypothetical fragment of natural deduction. Motivated by proof-theoretic and semantic considerations, we formulate a conjecture that non-hypothetical logic is decidable over Peano Arithmetic in a purely relational axiomatization, and more ambitiously over any fixed Peano Arithmetic theorem taken as an additional axiom. A schematic proof-search procedure is drafted to support this conjecture, identifying structural sources of finiteness. While preliminary, this analysis suggests a strong subformula discipline for normal non-hypothetical proofs and provides a proof-theoretic foundation for future work."

However, conventional cryogenic MIR cameras face a fundamental trade-off between frame rate, noise, and pixel format. Here we report a passive, incoherent MIR imaging platform that leverages sum-frequency upconversion in chirped periodically poled lithium niobate (CPLN) to translate broadband 3--5um scenes to the near-infrared, enabling ultrafast acquisition on a silicon-based intensified CCD (iCCD). In fast-kinetics mode we achieve a physical frame rate of 100kHz with microsecond-scale gate control, and we directly capture the full evolution of an air-breakdown electric arc, resolving its rapid ignition, expansion, and decay dynamics. Beyond demonstrating ultrafast passive imaging, we introduce a drift-aware calibration workflow based on Allan deviation analysis to quantitatively select the gate width and averaging strategy under realistic slow-drift and multiplicative noise. This combined capability -- ultrafast passive MIR imaging plus operationally meaningful calibration -- provides a practical route toward real-time thermal surveillance and early-warning systems for hazardous fast transients."

While previous studies have primarily centered on structural dynamics at the metal site, the response of its coordinated nonmetal atoms remains largely unexplored. Here, using Ni SACs with mixed nitrogen/carbon coordination (NiN4-xCx) as representatives, we investigate potential-driven hydrogenation of metal-center-coordinated nonmetallic atoms through constant-potential density functional theory and ab initio molecular dynamics. We find that the C sites directly bound to Ni undergo potential-driven hydrogenation, whereas hydrogenation at N sites is thermodynamically unfavorable. Taking NiNC3 as a representative system, we demonstrate that these hydrogenation processes proceed with accessible kinetic barriers and obey the Brønsted-Evans-Polanyi relation. The resulting dynamic coordination reshapes the Ni 3d and dz2 orbitals, modulates the stability of the active center, and weakens molecular adsorption through combined electronic and steric effects. These findings reveal that electrode potential and solvent not only regulate the metal center but also dynamically reconfigure its coordination environment, offering novel mechanistic insights into potential-induced coordination dynamics and guiding the rational design of coordination-engineered SACs."

However, most existing models perform diffusion in the pixel space and train distinct models for different multispectral (MS) imagery, suffering from high latency and sensor-specific limitations. In this paper, we present SALAD-Pan, a sensor-agnostic latent space diffusion method for efficient pansharpening. Specifically, SALAD-Pan trains a band-wise single-channel VAE to encode high-resolution multispectral (HRMS) into compact latent representations, supporting MS images with various channel counts and establishing a basis for acceleration. Then spectral physical properties, along with PAN and MS images, are injected into the diffusion backbone through unidirectional and bidirectional interactive control structures respectively, achieving high-precision fusion in the diffusion process. Finally, a lightweight cross-spectral attention module is added to the central layer of diffusion model, reinforcing spectral connections to boost spectral consistency and further elevate fusion precision. Experimental results on GaoFen-2, QuickBird, and WorldView-3 demonstrate that SALAD-Pan outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion-based methods across all three datasets, attains a 2-3x inference speedup, and exhibits robust zero-shot (cross-sensor) capability."

To efficiently manage distributed storage, we integrate large language models (LLMs) for real-time and intelligent caching decisions. The proposed approach leverages LLMs' ability to process heterogeneous information, including user profiles, historical data, content characteristics, and dynamic system states. Through a designed prompting framework encoding task objectives and caching constraints, the LLMs formulate caching as a decision-making task, and our hierarchical deterministic caching mapping strategy enables adaptive requests prediction and precise content placement across three tiers without frequent retraining. Simulation results demonstrate the advantages of our proposed caching scheme."

To address these limitations, we propose Model-Dowser, a novel sparse fine-tuning approach for MLLMs. Model-Dowser measures a principled importance score for each model parameter with respect to pretrained generalization (prior to downstream adaptation) by jointly considering weight magnitudes, input activations, and output sensitivities. During fine-tuning, Model-Dowser selectively preserves high-importance parameters and updates the remaining. Comprehensive experiments on two representative MLLMs, LLaVA and NVILA, demonstrate that Model-Dowser effectively mitigates catastrophic forgetting and consistently outperforms prior methods, while remaining resource-efficient and scalable to multi-billion-parameter models."

However, current approaches remain predominantly stateless, discarding successful reasoning patterns after each problem instance and failing to mimic the empirical accumulation of wisdom characteristic of human problem-solving. To bridge this gap, we introduce Empirical-MCTS, a dual-loop framework that transforms stateless search into a continuous, non-parametric learning process. The framework unifies local exploration with global memory optimization through two novel mechanisms: Pairwise-Experience-Evolutionary Meta-Prompting (PE-EMP) and a Memory Optimization Agent. PE-EMP functions as a reflexive optimizer within the local search, utilizing pairwise feedback to dynamically synthesize adaptive criteria and evolve meta-prompts (system prompts) in real-time. Simultaneously, the Memory Optimization Agent manages a global repository as a dynamic policy prior, employing atomic operations to distill high-quality insights across problems. Extensive evaluations on complex reasoning benchmarks, including AIME25, ARC-AGI-2, and MathArena Apex, demonstrate that Empirical-MCTS significantly outperforms both stateless MCTS strategies and standalone experience-driven agents. These results underscore the critical necessity of coupling structured search with empirical accumulation for mastering complex, open-ended reasoning tasks."

Existing evaluations, such as microcanonical molecular dynamics (MD), are computationally expensive and primarily probe near-equilibrium states. To improve evaluation metrics for MLIPs, we introduce the Bond Smoothness Characterization Test (BSCT). This efficient benchmark probes the PES via controlled bond deformations and detects non-smoothness, including discontinuities, artificial minima, and spurious forces, both near and far from equilibrium. We show that BSCT correlates strongly with MD stability while requiring a fraction of the cost of MD. To demonstrate how BSCT can guide iterative model design, we utilize an unconstrained Transformer backbone as a testbed, illustrating how refinements such as a new differentiable $k$-nearest neighbors algorithm and temperature-controlled attention reduce artifacts identified by our metric. By optimizing model design systematically based on BSCT, the resulting MLIP simultaneously achieves a low conventional E/F regression error, stable MD simulations, and robust atomistic property predictions. Our results establish BSCT as both a validation metric and as an \"in-the-loop\" model design proxy that alerts MLIP developers to physical challenges that cannot be efficiently evaluated by current MLIP benchmarks."

The method approximates the stochastic population-level hazard by a large population limit while retaining a count-valued stochastic model, and leads to survival analytic inferential strategies that are both computationally efficient and flexible to model generalizations. Through simulation, we show that parameter estimation is competitive with recent exact but computationally expensive likelihood-based methods in partially observed settings. Previous work has shown that the DSA approximation is generalizable, and we show that the inferential developments here also carry over to models featuring individual heterogeneity, such as frailty models. We consider case studies of both Ebola and COVID-19 data on variants of the model, including a network-based epidemic model and a model with distributions over susceptibility, demonstrating its flexibility and practical utility on real, partially observed datasets."

By varying the degree of anisotropy in a turbulence dataset, we explore how statistical symmetry affects these mappings. To do this, we train super-resolution models at different wall-normal locations in a channel flow, where anisotropy varies naturally, and test their generalization. By evaluating the learned mappings on new coordinate frames and new flow conditions, we find that coordinate-frame generalization is a key part of the generalization problem. Turbulent flows naturally present a wide range of local orientations, so respecting the symmetries of the Navier-Stokes equations improves generalization to new flows. Importantly, turbulence's rotational structure can embed these symmetries into learned mappings -- an effect that strengthens with isotropy and dataset size. This is because a more isotropic dataset samples a wider range of orientations, more fully covering the rotational symmetries of the Navier-Stokes equations. The dependence on isotropy means equivariance error is also scale-dependent, consistent with Kolmogorov's hypothesis. Therefore, turbulence provides its own data augmentation (we term this implicit data augmentation). We expect this effect to apply broadly to learned mappings between tensorial flow quantities, making it relevant to most machine learning applications in turbulence."

While recent methods perform well on the first two subtasks, legal sentencing prediction (LSP) remains difficult due to its need for fine-grained objective knowledge and flexible subjective reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose $MSR^2$, a framework that integrates multi-source retrieval and reasoning in LLMs with reinforcement learning. $MSR^2$ enables LLMs to perform multi-source retrieval based on reasoning needs and applies a process-level reward to guide intermediate subjective reasoning steps. Experiments on two real-world datasets show that $MSR^2$ improves both accuracy and interpretability in LSP, providing a promising step toward practical legal AI.

    "abstract": "Phytoplankton is the basis of marine food webs, driving both ecological processes and global biogeochemical cycles. Despite their ecological and climatic significance, accurately simulating phytoplankton dynamics remains a major challenge for biogeochemical numerical models due to limited parameterizations, sparse observational data, and the complexity of oceanic processes. Here, we explore how deep learning models can be used to address these limitations predicting the spatio-temporal distribution of phytoplankton biomass in the global ocean based on satellite observations and environmental conditions. First, we investigate several deep learning architectures. Among the tested models, the UNet architecture stands out for its ability to reproduce the seasonal and interannual patterns of phytoplankton biomass more accurately than other models like CNNs, ConvLSTM, and 4CastNet. When using one to two months of environmental data as input, UNet performs better, although it tends to underestimate the amplitude of low-frequency changes in phytoplankton biomass. Thus, to improve predictions over time, an auto-regressive version of UNet was also tested, where the model uses its own previous predictions to forecast future conditions. This approach works well for short-term forecasts (up to five months), though its performance decreases for longer time scales. Overall, our study shows that combining ocean physical predictors with deep learning allows for reconstruction and short-term prediction of phytoplankton dynamics. These models could become powerful tools for monitoring ocean health and supporting marine ecosystem management, especially in the context of climate change."

ALMA continuum observations resolve a compact disk with a radius of $\\sim$0.14\\arcsec\\ (60\\,au). Scattered light from the outflow cavity is prominent in the short-wavelength NIRCam and NIRSpec observations, revealing only the southeast nearside lobe. We detected 27 H$_2$ emission lines tracing a narrow, cone-shaped structure within the outflow cavity. A high-velocity ionized jet is detected in several forbidden atomic lines, characterized by a position angle of 142\\degree, an opening angle of 1.4\\degree, and an estimated geometric launching radius of at most $\\sim$40\\,au. Mid-infrared CO ro-vibrational emission lines, stronger in the P-branch, show a similar distribution to the H$_2$ emission and are likely to originate from hot gas within the outflow cavity. CO and C$_2$H emission lines detected by ALMA trace slower, colder outflow components and cavity walls. The spatial and kinematic stratification between the hot atomic and molecular components and the colder molecular gas is consistent with predictions from MHD disk wind models, although envelope material entrained by a wide-angle wind or jet may also contribute. Our analysis highlights the powerful synergy between JWST and ALMA in advancing the understanding of protostellar jets and outflows across multiple spatial and physical scales."

In this work, we aim to address these questions through a unified spectral perspective. Specifically, we view Muon as the p = 0 endpoint of a family of spectral transformations of the form U \\boldsymbolΣ^{p} V' , and consider additional variants with p = 1/2 , p = 1/4 , and p = 1 . These transformations are applied to both first-moment updates, as in momentum SGD, and to root-mean-square (RMS) normalized gradient updates as in Adam. To enable efficient computation, we develop a coupled Newton iteration that avoids explicit singular value decomposition. Across controlled experiments, we find that RMS-normalized updates yield more stable optimization than first-moment updates. Moreover, while spectral compression provides strong stabilization benefits under first-moment updates, the Muon update (p = 0) does not consistently outperform Adam. These results suggest that Muon is best understood as an effective form of spectral normalization, but not a universally superior optimization method.

    "abstract": "Open-weight language models are increasingly used in production settings, raising new security challenges. One prominent threat in this context is backdoor attacks, in which adversaries embed hidden behaviors in language models that activate under specific conditions. Previous work has assumed that adversaries have access to training pipelines or deployment infrastructure. We propose a novel attack surface requiring neither, which utilizes the chat template. Chat templates are executable Jinja2 programs invoked at every inference call, occupying a privileged position between user input and model processing. We show that an adversary who distributes a model with a maliciously modified template can implant an inference-time backdoor without modifying model weights, poisoning training data, or controlling runtime infrastructure. We evaluated this attack vector by constructing template backdoors targeting two objectives: degrading factual accuracy and inducing emission of attacker-controlled URLs, and applied them across eighteen models spanning seven families and four inference engines. Under triggered conditions, factual accuracy drops from 90% to 15% on average while attacker-controlled URLs are emitted with success rates exceeding 80%; benign inputs show no measurable degradation. Backdoors generalize across inference runtimes and evade all automated security scans applied by the largest open-weight distribution platform. These results establish chat templates as a reliable and currently undefended attack surface in the LLM supply chain."

    "abstract": "The increasingly crowded radio frequency (RF) spectrum forces communication signals to coexist, creating heterogeneous interferers whose structure often departs from Gaussian models. Recovering the interference-contaminated signal of interest in such settings is a central challenge, especially in single-channel RF processing. Existing data-driven methods often assume that the interference type is known, yielding ensembles of specialized models that scale poorly with the number of interferers. We show that detect-then-separate (DTS) strategies admit an analytical justification: within a Gaussian mixture framework, a plug-in maximum a posteriori detector followed by type-conditioned optimal estimation achieves asymptotic minimum mean-square error optimality under a mild temporal-diversity condition. This makes DTS a principled benchmark, but its reliance on multiple type-specific models limits scalability. Motivated by this, we propose a unified joint model (UJM), in which a single deep neural architecture learns to jointly detect and separate when applied directly to the received signal. Using tailored UNet architectures for baseband (complex-valued) RF signals, we compare DTS and UJM on synthetic and recorded interference types, showing that a capacity-matched UJM can match oracle-aided DTS performance across diverse signal-to-interference-and-noise ratios, interference types, and constellation orders, including mismatched training and testing type-uncertainty proportions. These findings highlight UJM as a scalable and practical alternative to DTS, while opening new directions for unified separation under broader regimes."

Most existing approaches rely either on load-estimation techniques (e.g., EMG, IMU) or on vision systems that do not directly inform control. In this work, we present a vision-gated control framework for an active lumbar occupational exoskeleton that leverages egocentric vision with wearable gaze tracking. The proposed system integrates real-time grasp detection from a first-person YOLO-based perception system, a finite-state machine (FSM) for task progression, and a variable admittance controller to adapt torque delivery to both posture and object state. A user study with 15 participants performing stooping load lifting trials under three conditions (no exoskeleton, exoskeleton without vision, exoskeleton with vision) shows that vision-gated assistance significantly reduces perceived physical demand and improves fluency, trust, and comfort. Quantitative analysis reveals earlier and stronger assistance when vision is enabled, while questionnaire results confirm user preference for the vision-gated mode. These findings highlight the potential of egocentric vision to enhance the responsiveness, ergonomics, safety, and acceptance of back-support exoskeletons."

While Joint-Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPA) offer a promising framework for modeling the latent evolution of these systems, their application is hindered by representation collapse and an inability to capture precursor signals across varying temporal scales. To address these limitations, we propose MTS-JEPA, a specialized architecture that integrates a multi-resolution predictive objective with a soft codebook bottleneck. This design explicitly decouples transient shocks from long-term trends, and utilizes the codebook to capture discrete regime transitions. Notably, we find this constraint also acts as an intrinsic regularizer to ensure optimization stability. Empirical evaluations on standard benchmarks confirm that our approach effectively prevents degenerate solutions and achieves state-of-the-art performance under the early-warning protocol."

Estimating the rate of such infection, alongside the rates of introduction of infection from outside the partnership, is a special case of the more general epidemiological challenge of inferring intensities of within- and between-group intensities of transmission. This study presents a stochastic susceptible-infected (SI) pair model for estimating key epidemiological parameters governing HIV transmission within and between couples, which we further extend to account for gender-specific differences in infection dynamics. Using a likelihood-based inference approach, we estimate transmission parameters and associated uncertainty from observed data. These values can be used to inform infection prevention strategies for HIV, and the methodology proposed can be generalised to other epidemiological settings."

However, existing GNN-based methods typically suffer from restricted receptive fields that miss long-range dependencies and a \"single-pass\" inference paradigm that leads to error accumulation. To address these bottlenecks, we propose RIGA-Fold, a framework that synergizes Recurrent Interaction with Geometric Awareness. At the micro-level, we introduce a Geometric Attention Update (GAU) module where edge features explicitly serve as attention keys, ensuring strictly SE(3)-invariant local encoding. At the macro-level, we design an attention-based Global Context Bridge that acts as a soft gating mechanism to dynamically inject global topological information. Furthermore, to bridge the gap between structural and sequence modalities, we introduce an enhanced variant, RIGA-Fold*, which integrates trainable geometric features with frozen evolutionary priors from ESM-2 and ESM-IF via a dual-stream architecture. Finally, a biologically inspired ``predict-recycle-refine'' strategy is implemented to iteratively denoise sequence distributions. Extensive experiments on CATH 4.2, TS50, and TS500 benchmarks demonstrate that our geometric framework is highly competitive, while RIGA-Fold* significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both sequence recovery and structural consistency."

    "abstract": "Robots are finding wider adoption in human environments, increasing the need for natural human-robot interaction. However, understanding a natural language command requires the robot to infer the intended task and how to decompose it into executable actions, and to ground those actions in the robot's knowledge of the environment, including relevant objects, agents, and locations. This challenge can be addressed by combining the capabilities of Large language models (LLMs) to understand natural language with 3D scene graphs (3DSGs) for grounding inferred actions in a semantic representation of the environment. However, many 3DSGs lack explicit spatial relations between objects, even though humans often rely on these relations to describe an environment. This paper investigates whether incorporating open- or closed-vocabulary spatial relations into 3DSGs can improve the ability of LLMs to interpret natural language commands. To address this, we propose an LLM-based pipeline for target object grounding from open-vocabulary language commands and a vision language model (VLM)-based pipeline to add open-vocabulary spatial edges to 3DSGs from images captured while mapping. Finally, two LLMs are evaluated in a study assessing their performance on the downstream task of target object grounding. Our study demonstrates that explicit spatial relations improve the ability of LLMs to ground objects. Moreover, open-vocabulary relation generation with VLMs proves feasible from robot-captured images, but their advantage over closed-vocabulary relations is found to be limited."

Existing multi-agent systems often rely on hand-crafted workflows and turn-taking interactions that fail to parallelize work effectively. To bridge this gap, we propose WideSeek-R1, a lead-agent-subagent framework trained via multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to synergize scalable orchestration and parallel execution. By utilizing a shared LLM with isolated contexts and specialized tools, WideSeek-R1 jointly optimizes the lead agent and parallel subagents on a curated dataset of 20k broad information-seeking tasks.

However, conventional surface irradiation often produces shallow, nonuniform damage, obscuring interfacial behavior. In this study, we perform cross-sectional He irradiation to directly examine the interfacial response and He bubble evolution across Cr monolayer and Cr and CrAlSiN multilayer coatings on Zr substrates. Irradiation was carried out at 500 C and 750 C to doses of 2 and 3 dpa, enabling a direct comparison of temperature-dependent microstructural evolution. In the Cr monolayer, He implantation produced a homogeneous distribution of nanoscale bubbles throughout the damaged region and large cavities at the Cr and Zr interface, indicating severe Kirkendall-type voiding and interfacial decohesion at elevated temperature. In contrast, the Cr/CrAlSiN multilayer exhibited a periodically modulated bubble distribution, with bubble fragmentation and transformation into nanoscale platelets at CrAlSiN interfaces. A N-enriched Zr(N) interlayer formed spontaneously at the CrAlSiN and Zr interface, effectively suppressing bubble accumulation and interdiffusion. The nanochannel interfaces acted as He sinks and diffusion barriers, enhancing interfacial bonding and mitigating swelling. This work demonstrates that cross-sectional ion irradiation is a powerful approach for probing interfacial stability in multilayer systems, offering new insights into He-defect interactions and radiation tolerance engineering at buried interfaces. The findings highlight the potential of Cr and CrAlSiN multilayers as advanced coating architectures for high-temperature nuclear environments."

    "abstract": "We study the density modulation of an interacting Fermi gas caused by the uniform motion of an impurity at zero temperature. For strong enough interaction among Fermi atoms, the modulation propagates thanks to the excitation of the collective zero sound mode if the impurity speed is above the zero sound threshold. We are able to assess, via a semi-analytic evaluation, the extent of the zero sound contribution to the density oscillation over and above the incoherent background of particle-hole excitations. Given the strong dependence of the results on the features of the gas interaction potential, we also analyze how they vary depending on its strength, range and shape."

    "abstract": "The design of sustainable materials requires access to materials performance and sustainability data from literature corpus in an organized, structured and automated manner. Natural language processing approaches, particularly large language models (LLMs), have been explored for materials data extraction from the literature, yet often suffer from limited accuracy or narrow scope. In this work, an LLM-based pipeline is developed to accurately extract alloy-related information from both textual descriptions and tabular data across the literature on high-entropy (or multicomponent) alloys (HEA). Specifically two databases with 37,711 and 148,069 entries respectively are retrieved; one from the literature text, consisting of alloy composition, processing conditions, characterization methods, and reported properties, and other from the literature tables, consisting of property names, values, and units. The pipeline enhances materials-domain sensitivity through prompt engineering and retrieval-augmented generation and achieves F1-scores of 0.83 for textual extraction and 0.88 for tabular extraction, surpassing or matching existing approaches. Application of the pipeline to over 10,000 articles yields the largest publicly available multicomponent alloy database and reveals compositional and processing-property trends. The database is further employed for sustainability-aware materials selection in three application domains, i.e., lightweighting, soft magnetic, and corrosion-resistant, identifying multicomponent alloy candidates with more sustainable production while maintaining or exceeding benchmark performance. The pipeline developed can be easily generalized to other class of materials, and assist in development of comprehensive, accurate and usable databases for sustainable materials design."

    "abstract": "We study high-dimensional rank regression when data are distributed across multiple machines and the loss is a non-additive U-statistic, as in convoluted rank regression (CRR). Classical communication-efficient surrogate likelihood (CSL) methods crucially rely on the additivity of the empirical loss and therefore break down for CRR, whose global loss couples all sample pairs across machines. We propose a distributed convoluted rank regression (DCRR) framework that constructs a similar surrogate loss and demonstrate its validity under the non-additive losses. We show that this surrogate shares the same population minimizer as the full-data CRR loss and yields estimators that are statistically equivalent to centralized CRR. Building on this, we develop a two-stage sparse DCRR procedure -- an iterative $\\ell_1$-penalized stage followed by a folded-concave refinement -- and establish non-asymptotic error bounds, a distributed strong oracle property, and a DHBIC-type criterion for consistent model selection. A scaling result shows that the number of machines may diverge as $M = o({N/(s^2\\log p)})$ while achieving centralized oracle rates with only $O(\\log N)$ communication rounds. Simulations and a large-scale real data example demonstrate substantial gains over naive divide-and-conquer, particularly under heavy-tailed errors."

The stable evolution of multipole QDs is thus demonstrated. Comparing different network architectures, including the training time, loss values, and $\\mathbb{L_{2}}$ error, PINNs accurately predict specific dynamical characteristics of QDs.

Specifically, we find the formation of the CDW enhances the amplitude of spectral function as well as the momentum of the Fermi surface. Furthermore, we are concerned with the change of the Fermi surface with the doping parameter as well as the lattice amplitude. Interestingly, we find that the radius of the Fermi surface expands with the increase of the doping parameter and finally may cross the first Brillouin zone. Additionally, the width of band gap becomes larger with the increase of the lattice amplitude as well, which is consistent with the observation in condensed matter experiments."

To address this, ImmuVis introduces marker-adaptive hyperconvolutions that generate convolutional kernels from learned marker embeddings, enabling a single model to operate on arbitrary measured marker subsets without retraining. We pretrain ImmuVis on the largest to-date dataset, IMC17M (28 cohorts, 24,405 images, 265 markers, over 17M patches), using self-supervised masked reconstruction. ImmuVis outperforms SOTA baselines and ablations in virtual staining and downstream classification tasks at substantially lower compute cost than transformer-based alternatives, and is the sole model that provides calibrated uncertainty via a heteroscedastic likelihood objective. These results position ImmuVis as a practical, efficient foundation model for real-world IMC modeling."

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks for visual perception are highly susceptible to domain shift, which poses a critical challenge for real-world deployment under conditions that differ from the training data. To address this domain generalization challenge, we propose a cross-modal framework under the learning using privileged information (LUPI) paradigm for training a robust, single-modality RGB model. We leverage event cameras as a source of privileged information, available only during training. The two modalities exhibit complementary characteristics: the RGB stream is semantically dense but domain-dependent, whereas the event stream is sparse yet more domain-invariant. Direct feature alignment between them is therefore suboptimal, as it forces the RGB encoder to mimic the sparse event representation, thereby losing semantic detail. To overcome this, we introduce Privileged Event-based Predictive Regularization (PEPR), which reframes LUPI as a predictive problem in a shared latent space. Instead of enforcing direct cross-modal alignment, we train the RGB encoder with PEPR to predict event-based latent features, distilling robustness without sacrificing semantic richness. The resulting standalone RGB model consistently improves robustness to day-to-night and other domain shifts, outperforming alignment-based baselines across object detection and semantic segmentation."

Our framework captures several intricacies of such a collaboration, including non-monetary exchanges, asymmetric information, and incentive misalignment. We bring the framework to life through comprehensive, data-driven simulations using real Stack Exchange data and commonly used LLMs. We demonstrate the incentive misalignment empirically, yet show that players can achieve roughly half of the utility in an ideal full-information scenario.

    "abstract": "Predicting upcoming words is a core mechanism of language comprehension and may be quantified using Shannon entropy. There is currently no empirical consensus on how many human responses are required to obtain stable and unbiased entropy estimates at the word level. Moreover, large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as substitutes for human norming data, yet their ability to reproduce stable human entropy remains unclear. Here, we address both issues using two large publicly available cloze datasets in German 1 and English 2. We implemented a bootstrap-based convergence analysis that tracks how entropy estimates stabilize as a function of sample size. Across both languages, more than 97% of sentences reached stable entropy estimates within the available sample sizes. 90% of sentences converged after 111 responses in German and 81 responses in English, while low-entropy sentences (<1) required as few as 20 responses and high-entropy sentences (>2.5) substantially more. These findings provide the first direct empirical validation for common norming practices and demonstrate that convergence critically depends on sentence predictability. We then compared stable human entropy values with entropy estimates derived from several LLMs, including GPT-4o, using both logit-based probability extraction and sampling-based frequency estimation, GPT2-xl/german-GPT-2, RoBERTa Base/GottBERT, and LLaMA 2 7B Chat. GPT-4o showed the highest correspondence with human data, although alignment depended strongly on the extraction method and prompt design. Logit-based estimates minimized absolute error, whereas sampling-based estimates were better in capturing the dispersion of human variability. Together, our results establish practical guidelines for human norming and show that while LLMs can approximate human entropy, they are not interchangeable with stable human-derived distributions."

A theoretical discounting model is first developed to convert costs and benefits occurring at different times into present-value terms using compound interest functions. The model accommodates one-time expenditures, time-proportional costs, and complex cost structures arising during system development and commissioning. To empirically assess how discounted economic performance is influenced by multiple criteria, linear regression serves as the approximation method."

Most methods address this by summing competing loss terms, creating gradient conflicts that are managed with complex and often inefficient strategies such as external memory replay or parameter regularization. We propose a reformulation of the continual learning objective using Douglas-Rachford Splitting (DRS). This reframes the learning process not as a direct trade-off, but as a negotiation between two decoupled objectives: one promoting plasticity for new tasks and the other enforcing stability of old knowledge. By iteratively finding a consensus through their proximal operators, DRS provides a more principled and stable learning dynamic. Our approach achieves an efficient balance between stability and plasticity without the need for auxiliary modules or complex add-ons, providing a simpler yet more powerful paradigm for continual learning systems."

We introduce a formal extension of the principle to such unitarily transformed thermal states. By defining an effective Hamiltonian, we rigorously establish a generalized Landauer inequality, which naturally reduces to the standard case for an ordinary thermal reservoir as a special instance. The framework further yields a consistent definition of entropy production and a proof of its non-negativity. We illustrate its utility by studying an arbitrarily moving Unruh-DeWitt detector coupled to a quantum field initially prepared in the STS. Using perturbation theory, we compute the entropy production explicitly, confirming its positivity. As a result of the symmetry breaking induced by the unitary transformation, it depends on both the proper time interval and the absolute spacetime position. Our work resolves the apparent violation of Landauer's principle with STSs. It also provides a robust tool for analyzing quantum thermodynamics in non-equilibrium and relativistic settings, with potential implications for quantum thermal machines and information protocols."

We focus on learning Canonical Polyadic (CP) decompositions of high-order tensors, and show that this model has several distinct extreme lazy and rich GF regimes such as free evolution, NTK and under- and over-parameterized mean-field. We show that these regimes depend on the parameter scaling, tensor order, and symmetry of the model in a specific and subtle way. Moreover, we propose a general approach to summing the formal loss expansion by reducing it to a PDE; in a wide range of scenarios, it turns out to be 1st order and solvable by the method of characteristics.

Federated Learning (FL) is an important paradigm for the Web because it enables privacy-preserving, collaborative machine learning across diverse user devices, web services and clients without needing to centralize sensitive data. However, its performance degrades severely under non-IID client distributions that is prevalent in real-world web systems. In this work, we propose a new training paradigm - Iterative Federated Adaptation (IFA) - that enhances generalization in heterogeneous federated settings through generation-wise forget and evolve strategy. Specifically, we divide training into multiple generations and, at the end of each, select a fraction of model parameters (a) randomly or (b) from the later layers of the model and reinitialize them. This iterative forget and evolve schedule allows the model to escape local minima and preserve globally relevant representations. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, MIT-Indoors, and Stanford Dogs datasets show that the proposed approach improves global accuracy, especially when the data cross clients are Non-IID. This method can be implemented on top any federated algorithm to improve its generalization performance. We observe an average of 21.5%improvement across datasets. This work advances the vision of scalable, privacy-preserving intelligence for real-world heterogeneous and distributed web systems."

Inspired by recent advances in optical flow, our approach iteratively refines track estimates by warping features from the target frame to the query frame based on the current estimate. Combined with a transformer architecture that performs joint spatiotemporal reasoning across all tracks, our design establishes long-range correspondences without computing feature correlations. Our model is simple and achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard dense point tracking benchmarks, including TAP-Vid-DAVIS, TAP-Vid-Kinetics, and Robo-TAP. Remarkably, the model also excels at optical flow, sometimes outperforming specialized methods on the Sintel, KITTI, and Spring benchmarks.

However, recent empirical results indicate that the state of trained linear attention models often exhibits a low-rank structure, suggesting that these models underexploit their capacity in practice. To illuminate this phenomenon, we provide a theoretical analysis of the role of rank in linear attention, revealing that low effective rank can affect retrieval error by amplifying query noise. In addition to these theoretical insights, we conjecture that the low-rank states can be substantially reduced post-training with only minimal performance degradation, yielding faster and more memory-efficient models. To this end, we propose a novel hardware-aware approach that structurally prunes key and query matrices, reducing the state size while retaining compatibility with existing CUDA kernels. We adapt several existing pruning strategies to fit our framework and, building on our theoretical analysis, propose a novel structured pruning method based on a rank-revealing QR decomposition. Our empirical results, evaluated across models of varying sizes and on various downstream tasks, demonstrate the effectiveness of our state reduction framework. We highlight that our framework enables the removal of 50% of the query and key channels at only a marginal increase in perplexity.

Given an arbitrary pose, PDF-HR predicts its distance to a large corpus of retargeted robot poses, yielding a smooth measure of pose plausibility that is well suited for optimization and control. PDF-HR can be integrated as a reward shaping term, a regularizer, or a standalone plausibility scorer across diverse pipelines. We evaluate PDF-HR on various humanoid tasks, including single-trajectory motion tracking, general motion tracking, style-based motion mimicry, and general motion retargeting. Experiments show that this plug-and-play prior consistently and substantially strengthens strong baselines. Code and models will be released."

    "abstract": "With the advancement of 3D scanning technologies, point clouds have become fundamental for representing 3D spatial data, with applications that span across various scientific and technological fields. Practical analysis of this data depends crucially on available neighborhood descriptors to accurately characterize the local geometries of the point cloud. This paper introduces LitS, a novel neighborhood descriptor for 2D and 3D point clouds. LitS are piecewise constant functions on the unit circle that allow points to keep track of their surroundings. Each element in LitS' domain represents a direction with respect to a local reference system. Once constructed, evaluating LitS at any given direction gives us information about the number of neighbors in a cone-like region centered around that same direction. Thus, LitS conveys a lot of information about the local neighborhood of a point, which can be leveraged to gain global structural understanding by analyzing how LitS changes between close points. In addition, LitS comes in two versions ('regular' and 'cumulative') and has two parameters, allowing them to adapt to various contexts and types of point clouds. Overall, they are a versatile neighborhood descriptor, capable of capturing the nuances of local point arrangements and resilient to common point cloud data issues such as variable density and noise."

    "abstract": "Open-ended self-improving agents can autonomously modify their own structural designs to advance their capabilities and overcome the limits of pre-defined architectures, thus reducing reliance on human intervention. We introduce Group-Evolving Agents (GEA), a new paradigm for open-ended self-improvements, which treats a group of agents as the fundamental evolutionary unit, enabling explicit experience sharing and reuse within the group throughout evolution. Unlike existing open-ended self-evolving paradigms that adopt tree-structured evolution, GEA overcomes the limitation of inefficient utilization of exploratory diversity caused by isolated evolutionary branches. We evaluate GEA on challenging coding benchmarks, where it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art self-evolving methods (71.0% vs. 56.7% on SWE-bench Verified, 88.3% vs. 68.3% on Polyglot) and matches or exceeds top human-designed agent frameworks (71.8% and 52.0% on two benchmarks, respectively). Analysis reveals that GEA more effectively converts early-stage exploratory diversity into sustained, long-term progress, achieving stronger performance under the same number of evolved agents. Furthermore, GEA exhibits consistent transferability across different coding models and greater robustness, fixing framework-level bugs in 1.4 iterations on average, versus 5 for self-evolving methods."

Radiation of such electrons accelerated along the laser field propagation direction appears to have moderate power but can be considerably enhanced by a collision with a relatively weak counter-propagating laser pulse. Using the theory of laser-induced tunneling in atoms and ions and that of nonlinear Thomson scattering, we demonstrate that angular distributions and spectra of emitted photons can serve as a probe of the peak intensity in the focus. The angular distribution of emitted radiation in the plane of polarization and propagation of the ionizing laser beam appears narrow and peaked around an intensity-dependent angle, making this ionization setup a source of collimated XUV radiation."

One of the important unexplained phenomena is why and how, during the process of training with gradient descent, the theoretical capacity of neural networks is reduced to an effective capacity that fits the task. We here investigate the mechanism by which gradient descent achieves this through analyzing the learning dynamics at the level of individual neurons in single hidden layer ReLU networks. We identify three dynamical principles -- mutual alignment, unlocking and racing -- that together explain why we can often successfully reduce capacity after training through the merging of equivalent neurons or the pruning of low norm weights. We specifically explain the mechanism behind the lottery ticket conjecture, or why the specific, beneficial initial conditions of some neurons lead them to obtain higher weight norms."

    "abstract": "We investigate site and bond percolation in triangular and square lattices subjected to linear distortion. In contrast to previously studied distortion schemes that preserve lattice geometry, linear distortion dislocates regular lattice sites along a fixed direction. Nearest-neighbors of a regular lattice need to satisfy a distance-based connection criterion to remain neighbors in the linearly distorted lattice. Using extensive Monte Carlo simulations and finite-size scaling analyses, we examine how site and bond percolation thresholds vary with the distortion parameter and the connection threshold. For triangular lattices, we observe pronounced directional dependence of both site and bond percolation thresholds, as well as of the critical connection threshold. This arises from the distortion-induced anisotropic modification of nearest-neighbor separations. In particular, bond percolation exhibits nontrivial behavior that cannot be explained solely in terms of changes in the average coordination number. In contrast, square lattices remain effectively isotropic under linear distortion, resulting in identical percolation thresholds for distortions applied along different directions. Percolation thresholds in the thermodynamic limit, evaluated for a selected set of values of distortion parameter and connection threshold, confirm that the results for large finite lattices provide reliable estimates of the infinite-system behavior."

In this uncertain environment, we work with contracts, that specify how agents divide the values of the coalitions in the different states of the world. Every agent can have different a priori knowledge on the true state of the world, which is modeled through the Dempster-Shafer theory, while agents' preferences between contracts are modeled by the Choquet integral. We focus on the \"ex-ante\" scenario, when the contract is evaluated before uncertainty is resolved. We investigate the geometrical structure of the ex-ante core when agents have the same a priori knowledge which is a probability distribution. Finally, we define the (pre)nucleolus, the kernel and the bargaining set (a la Mas-Colell) in the ex-ante situation and we study their properties. It is found that the inclusion relations among these solution concepts are the same as in the classical case. Coincidence of the ex-ante core and the ex-ante bargaining set holds for convex Bel coalitional games, at the price of strengthening the definition of bargaining sets."

    "abstract": "Recent years have seen an explosion of interest in autonomous cyber defence agents trained to defend computer networks using deep reinforcement learning. These agents are typically trained in cyber gym environments using dense, highly engineered reward functions which combine many penalties and incentives for a range of (un)desirable states and costly actions. Dense rewards help alleviate the challenge of exploring complex environments but risk biasing agents towards suboptimal and potentially riskier solutions, a critical issue in complex cyber environments. We thoroughly evaluate the impact of reward function structure on learning and policy behavioural characteristics using a variety of sparse and dense reward functions, two well-established cyber gyms, a range of network sizes, and both policy gradient and value-based RL algorithms. Our evaluation is enabled by a novel ground truth evaluation approach which allows directly comparing between different reward functions, illuminating the nuanced inter-relationships between rewards, action space and the risks of suboptimal policies in cyber environments. Our results show that sparse rewards, provided they are goal aligned and can be encountered frequently, uniquely offer both enhanced training reliability and more effective cyber defence agents with lower-risk policies. Surprisingly, sparse rewards can also yield policies that are better aligned with cyber defender goals and make sparing use of costly defensive actions without explicit reward-based numerical penalties."

    "abstract": "The rapid proliferation of generative 3D models has created a critical bottleneck in animation pipelines: rigging. Existing automated methods are fundamentally limited by their approach to skinning, treating it as an ill-posed, high-dimensional regression task that is inefficient to optimize and is typically decoupled from skeleton generation. We posit this is a representation problem and introduce SkinTokens: a learned, compact, and discrete representation for skinning weights. By leveraging an FSQ-CVAE to capture the intrinsic sparsity of skinning, we reframe the task from continuous regression to a more tractable token sequence prediction problem. This representation enables TokenRig, a unified autoregressive framework that models the entire rig as a single sequence of skeletal parameters and SkinTokens, learning the complicated dependencies between skeletons and skin deformations. The unified model is then amenable to a reinforcement learning stage, where tailored geometric and semantic rewards improve generalization to complex, out-of-distribution assets. Quantitatively, the SkinTokens representation leads to a 98%-133% percents improvement in skinning accuracy over state-of-the-art methods, while the full TokenRig framework, refined with RL, enhances bone prediction by 17%-22%. Our work presents a unified, generative approach to rigging that yields higher fidelity and robustness, offering a scalable solution to a long-standing challenge in 3D content creation."

While classical quickest change detection methods provide strong guarantees on detection delay and false-alarm rates, existing approaches for point-process data predominantly focus on temporal changes and do not explicitly infer affected spatial regions. We propose a likelihood-free, score-based detection framework that jointly estimates the change time and the change region in continuous space-time without assuming parametric knowledge of the pre- or post-change dynamics. The method leverages a localized and conditionally weighted Hyvärinen score to quantify event-level deviations from nominal behavior and aggregates these scores using a spatio-temporal CUSUM-type statistic over a prescribed class of spatial regions. Operating sequentially, the procedure outputs both a stopping time and an estimated change region, enabling real-time detection with spatial interpretability. We establish theoretical guarantees on false-alarm control, detection delay, and spatial localization accuracy, and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach through simulations and real-world spatio-temporal event data."

    "abstract": "Unitary Coupled Cluster (UCC) theory is a promising variational method for electronic structure calculations, especially for strongly correlated systems and quantum computers. However, its practical application is limited by the steep scaling of its non-terminating Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff expansion. We introduce an active space UCCSD(4)/MP2 approach that leverages a fourth-order many-body perturbation theory truncation of UCCSD within a selected active space, while treating external excitations at the MP2 level. We explore two variants: a composite method that sums separate internal and external contributions and an interacting method that couples the amplitudes for greater accuracy. We test our approach on the GW100 dataset, a metaphosphate hydrolysis reaction, and the strongly correlated torsion of ethylene. Our results suggest that the interacting method with canonical orbitals is robust for weakly and moderately correlated systems and accurately reproduces the full UCCSD(4) potential energy curves using only 15-25% of the virtual orbitals in its active space. In comparison, the composite formulation exhibits greater sensitivity to the orbital basis and active space size, leading to less systematic behavior across the benchmark set. For ethylene torsion, a system dominated by strong static correlation, both composite and interacting formulations employing canonical orbitals closely track the full UCCSD(4) reference but do not alleviate the unphysical features inherited from the underlying single-reference UCCSD(4) description. This active space framework offers a tractable approach for modeling correlated molecules and reactions on classical computers and provides a viable path for scaling UCC calculations for resource-constrained quantum hardware."

Here, we present a theoretical framework for coupled diffusion models, using coupled Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes as a tractable model. By using the nonequilibrium statistical physics of dynamical phase transitions, we demonstrate that multimodal generation is governed by a spectral hierarchy of interaction timescales rather than simultaneous resolution. A key prediction is the ``synchronization gap'', a temporal window during the reverse generative process where distinct eigenmodes stabilize at different rates, providing a theoretical explanation for common desynchronization artifacts. We derive analytical conditions for speciation and collapse times under both symmetric and anisotropic coupling regimes, establishing strict bounds for coupling strength to avoid unstable symmetry breaking. We show that the coupling strength acts as a spectral filter that enforces a tunable temporal hierarchy on generation. We support these predictions through controlled experiments with diffusion models trained on MNIST datasets and exact score samplers. These results motivate time dependent coupling schedules that target mode specific timescales, offering a potential alternative to ad hoc guidance tuning."

We compare this method with tensorial (dipole) kernel models, as established in our previous work, in which the tensorial structure of the Born effective charge is encoded directly in the kernel and obtained via its derivative. Both approaches are then used for charge partitioning, enabling the separation of monopole and dipole contributions. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework by computing finite-temperature infrared spectra for a range of complex materials."

Raters scored both full-text translations and segment-level instances of culturally nuanced language (idioms, puns, holidays, and culturally embedded concepts) on an ordinal 0-3 quality scale; segment ratings additionally included an NA option for untranslated segments.

    "abstract": "The introduction of large language models ignited great retooling and rethinking of the software development models. The ensuing response of software engineering research yielded a massive body of tools and approaches. In this paper, we join the hassle by introducing agentic AI solutions for two tasks. First, we developed a solution for automatic test scenario generation from a detailed requirements description. This approach relies on specialized worker agents forming a star topology with the supervisor agent in the middle. We demonstrate its capabilities on a real-world example. Second, we developed an agentic AI solution for the document retrieval task in the context of software engineering documents. Our solution enables performing various use cases on a body of documents related to the development of a single software, including search, question answering, tracking changes, and large document summarization. In this case, each use case is handled by a dedicated LLM-based agent, which performs all subtasks related to the corresponding use case. We conclude by hinting at the future perspectives of our line of research."

    "abstract": "The recent observation of self-induced superradiant masing [[W. Kersten et al., Nat. Phys. 22, 158 (2026)]] revealed a collective relaxation timescale significantly slower than predicted by standard coherent transport models. Here, we elucidate the microscopic origin of this ``relaxation bottleneck.'' We show that in the high-density regime relevant to the experiment, diagonal Ising interactions -- often treated as perturbative -- generate profound inhomogeneous broadening that exceeds the intrinsic single-particle dephasing. This intense diagonal disorder suppresses resonant flip-flop exchange, effectively renormalizing the density of states available for spectral diffusion. Our parameter-free analytic theory quantitatively reproduces the experimentally observed microsecond dynamics, identifying Ising-induced broadening as the governing mechanism for energy transport in dense solid-state spin ensembles."

    "abstract": "Quantum computing promises to revolutionize several scientific and technological domains through fundamentally new ways of processing information. Among its most compelling applications is digital quantum simulation, where quantum computers are used to replicate the behavior of other quantum systems. This could enable the study of problems that are otherwise intractable on classical computers, transforming fields such as quantum chemistry, condensed matter physics, and materials science. Despite this potential, realizations of practical quantum advantage for relevant problems are hindered by imperfections of current devices. This also affects quantum hardware based on superconducting circuits which is among the most advanced and scalable platforms. The envisaged long-term solution of fault-tolerant quantum computers that correct their own errors remains out of reach mainly due to the associated qubit number overhead. As a result, the field has developed strategies that combine quantum and classical resources, exploit hardware-native operations, and employ error mitigation techniques to extract meaningful results from noisy data. This doctoral thesis contributes to this broader effort by exploring methods for advancing quantum simulation across the full computational stack, including hardware-level innovations, refined techniques for noise modeling and error mitigation, and algorithmic improvements enabled by efficient measurement processing."

    "abstract": "Multi-horizon time-series forecasting involves simultaneously making predictions for a consecutive sequence of subsequent time steps. This task arises in many application domains, such as healthcare and finance, where mispredictions can have a high cost and reduce trust. The learning with abstention framework tackles these problems by allowing a model to abstain from offering a prediction when it is at an elevated risk of making a misprediction. Unfortunately, existing abstention strategies are ill-suited for the multi-horizon setting: they target problems where a model offers a single prediction for each instance. Hence, they ignore the structured and correlated nature of the predictions offered by a multi-horizon forecaster. We formalize the problem of learning with abstention for multi-horizon forecasting setting and show that its structured nature admits a richer set of abstention problems. Concretely, we propose three natural notions of how a model could abstain for multi-horizon forecasting. We theoretically analyze each problem to derive the optimal abstention strategy and propose an algorithm that implements it. Extensive evaluation on 24 datasets shows that our proposed algorithms significantly outperforms existing baselines."

SAR is a remote sensing method used in defense and security applications to detect and monitor the positions of military vehicles, which may appear indistinguishable in images. Researchers have extensively studied SAR ATR to improve the differentiation and identification of vehicle types, characteristics, and measurements. Test examples can be compared with known vehicle target types to improve recognition tasks. New methods enhance the capabilities of neural networks, transformer attention, and multimodal large language models. An agentic AI method may be developed to utilize a defined set of tools, such as searching through a library of similar examples. Our proposed method, SAR Retrieval-Augmented Generation (SAR-RAG), combines a multimodal large language model (MLLM) with a vector database of semantic embeddings to support contextual search for image exemplars with known qualities. By recovering past image examples with known true target types, our SAR-RAG system can compare similar vehicle categories, achieving improved ATR prediction accuracy. We evaluate this through search and retrieval metrics, categorical classification accuracy, and numeric regression of vehicle dimensions. These metrics all show improvements when SAR-RAG is added to an MLLM baseline method as an attached ATR memory bank."

    "abstract": "Multi-expert systems, where multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) collaborate to solve complex tasks, are increasingly adopted for high-performance reasoning and generation. However, the orchestration policies governing expert interaction and sequencing remain largely opaque. We introduce INFORM, an interpretability analysis that treats orchestration as an explicit, analyzable computation, enabling the decoupling of expert interaction structure, execution order, and causal attribution. We use INFORM to evaluate an orchestrator on GSM8K, HumanEval, and MMLU using a homogeneous consortium of ten instruction-tuned experts drawn from LLaMA-3.1 8B, Qwen-3 8B, and DeepSeek-R1 8B, with controlled decoding-temperature variation, and a secondary heterogeneous consortium spanning 1B-7B parameter models. Across tasks, routing dominance is a poor proxy for functional necessity. We reveal a divergence between relational importance, captured by routing mass and interaction topology, and intrinsic importance, measured via gradient-based causal attribution: frequently selected experts often act as interaction hubs with limited causal influence, while sparsely routed experts can be structurally critical. Orchestration behaviors emerge asynchronously, with expert centralization preceding stable routing confidence and expert ordering remaining non-deterministic. Targeted ablations show that masking intrinsically important experts induces disproportionate collapse in interaction structure compared to masking frequent peers, confirming that INFORM exposes causal and structural dependencies beyond accuracy metrics alone."

First, we use a precision-manufactured random multi-focal lenslet (RML) phase mask to produce improved measurements with reduced multiplexing. Next, we implement a ConvNeXt-based reconstruction architecture, which provides up to 6.68 dB improvement in peak signal-to-noise ratio over state-of-the-art attention-based architectures. Finally, we establish a parallel imaging setup that simultaneously images a scene with RML, diffuser and lens systems, with which we collect datasets with 100,000 measurements for each system, to be used for reconstruction model training and evaluation. Using this standardized system, we quantify the improved measurement quality of the RML compared to a diffuser using the modulation transfer function and mutual information. Our ConvRML system benefits from both the optical and the computational developments presented in this work, and our contributions establish resources to support continued development of high-quality, compact, and compressive lensless imagers."

Annotations themselves are subject to aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty, which is typically ignored during annotation and evaluation. While crowdsourcing enables collecting multiple annotations per image to estimate these uncertainties, this approach is impractical at scale due to the required annotation effort. We introduce a probabilistic label spreading method that provides reliable estimates of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty of labels. Assuming label smoothness over the feature space, we propagate single annotations using a graph-based diffusion method. We prove that label spreading yields consistent probability estimators even when the number of annotations per data point converges to zero. We present and analyze a scalable implementation of our method. Experimental results indicate that, compared to baselines, our approach substantially reduces the annotation budget required to achieve a desired label quality on common image datasets and achieves a new state of the art on the Data-Centric Image Classification benchmark."

In this paper, we extend the control to remain valid with high probability over a cumulatively growing calibration dataset at any time point. We derive such guarantees using quantile-based arguments and illustrate the applicability of the proposed framework to settings involving distribution shift. We further establish a matching lower bound and show that our guarantees are asymptotically tight. Finally, we demonstrate the practical performance of our methods through both simulations and real-world numerical examples."

    "abstract": "We present protein autoregressive modeling (PAR), the first multi-scale autoregressive framework for protein backbone generation via coarse-to-fine next-scale prediction. Using the hierarchical nature of proteins, PAR generates structures that mimic sculpting a statue, forming a coarse topology and refining structural details over scales. To achieve this, PAR consists of three key components: (i) multi-scale downsampling operations that represent protein structures across multiple scales during training; (ii) an autoregressive transformer that encodes multi-scale information and produces conditional embeddings to guide structure generation; (iii) a flow-based backbone decoder that generates backbone atoms conditioned on these embeddings. Moreover, autoregressive models suffer from exposure bias, caused by the training and the generation procedure mismatch, and substantially degrades structure generation quality. We effectively alleviate this issue by adopting noisy context learning and scheduled sampling, enabling robust backbone generation. Notably, PAR exhibits strong zero-shot generalization, supporting flexible human-prompted conditional generation and motif scaffolding without requiring fine-tuning. On the unconditional generation benchmark, PAR effectively learns protein distributions and produces backbones of high design quality, and exhibits favorable scaling behavior. Together, these properties establish PAR as a promising framework for protein structure generation."

We propose Multi-Head LatentMoE and Head Parallel (HP), a new architecture and parallelism achieving $O(1)$ communication cost regardless of $k$, completely balanced traffic, and deterministic communication, all while remaining compatible with EP. To accelerate Multi-Head LatentMoE, we propose IO-aware routing and expert computation.

This is exacerbated by recent experiments that show datasets can transmit signals that are not directly observable from individual datapoints, posing a conceptual challenge for dataset-centric understandings of LLM training and suggesting a missing fundamental account of such phenomena. Towards understanding such effects, inspired by recent work on the linear structure of LLMs, we uncover a general mechanism through which hidden subtexts can arise in generic datasets. We introduce Logit-Linear-Selection (LLS), a method that prescribes how to select subsets of a generic preference dataset to elicit a wide range of hidden effects. We apply LLS to discover subsets of real-world datasets so that models trained on them exhibit behaviors ranging from having specific preferences, to responding to prompts in a different language not present in the dataset, to taking on a different persona. Crucially, the effect persists for the selected subset, across models with varying architectures, supporting its generality and universality."

This design enables precise control over atomic or functional group replacements, atomic connectivity, and stereochemistry without the need to rebuild extensive core molecular frameworks. Through a series of representative case studies, we demonstrate that Estructural enables chemically meaningful geometry manipulation across a wide range of real-world scenarios. These include site-selective functionalization, ligand binding, ligand exchange, stereochemically controlled structure construction, isomer interconversion, fragment-level structural analysis, image-guided generation of structures from schematic reaction mechanisms, and mechanism-driven geometry generation and modification. These examples illustrate how multimodal reasoning, when combined with specialized geometry-aware tools, supports interactive and context-aware molecular modelling beyond structure generation.

We use the radiative transfer code Lightweaver to explore how they form and how they respond to temperature, density and micro-turbulent velocity perturbations in the atmosphere. To simplify the modelling, we investigate lines emitted from levels with principal quantum number $n\\geq10$, which are expected to be in Saha-Boltzmann equilibrium with the ground state of the singly-charged ion. Optical depth effects are apparent in the lines and their response to atmospheric perturbations suggest that they will be useful in reconstructions of the atmosphere using inversions.

    "abstract": "The rapid growth of large language models (LLMs) has outpaced the evolution of single-GPU hardware, making model scale increasingly constrained by memory capacity rather than computation. While modern training systems extend GPU memory through distributed parallelism and offloading across CPU and storage tiers, they fundamentally retain a GPU-centric execution paradigm in which GPUs host persistent model replicas and full autograd graphs. As a result, scaling large models remains tightly coupled to multi-GPU clusters, complex distributed runtimes, and unpredictable host memory consumption, creating substantial barriers for node-scale post-training workloads such as instruction tuning, alignment, and domain adaptation. We present Horizon-LM, a memory-centric training system that redefines the roles of CPU and GPU for large-model optimization. Horizon-LM treats host memory as the authoritative parameter store and uses GPUs solely as transient compute engines through a CPU-master, GPU-template execution model. By eliminating persistent GPU-resident modules and autograd graphs, employing explicit recomputation with manual gradient propagation, and introducing a pipelined double-buffered execution engine, Horizon-LM decouples model scale from GPU count and bounds memory usage to the theoretical parameter footprint. On a single H200 GPU with 1.5\\,TB host RAM, Horizon-LM reliably trains models up to 120B parameters. On a standard single A100 machine, Horizon-LM achieves up to 12.2$\\times$ higher training throughput than DeepSpeed ZeRO-3 with CPU offloading while preserving numerical correctness. Across platforms and scales, Horizon-LM sustains high device utilization and predictable memory growth, demonstrating that host memory, not GPU memory, defines the true feasibility boundary for node-scale large-model training."

This is implemented by ensuring that the fifth generation (5G) quality of service identifier (5QI)-requirements of user equipments (UEs) are maintained. The key challenge is the fact that while deactivating a given SC gNB reduces its own consumption, it may increase the load on neighboring gNBs and the macro gNB (coverage cell), impacting the overall energy efficiency. This phenomenon is accurately characterized by modeling the dynamic cell load that jointly takes into account the location of the UEs, their relative locations to all the SCs, and their data demands. We experimentally show that the proposed combinatorial upper confidence bound (CUCB) followed by the load balancer outperforms not only the naive strategies like arbitrarily keeping all the SCs on, but also other state-of-the-art reinforcement learning solutions. The proposed algorithm can be implemented as open-radio access network (O-RAN) near-real-time (NRT) RAN intelligent controller (RIC) xApps."

    "abstract": "Omni-modal Large Language Models (Omni-LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in audio-video understanding tasks. However, their reliance on long multimodal token sequences leads to substantial computational overhead. Despite this challenge, token compression methods designed for Omni-LLMs remain limited. To bridge this gap, we propose OmniSIFT (Omni-modal Spatio-temporal Informed Fine-grained Token compression), a modality-asymmetric token compression framework tailored for Omni-LLMs. Specifically, OmniSIFT adopts a two-stage compression strategy: (i) a spatio-temporal video pruning module that removes video redundancy arising from both intra-frame structure and inter-frame overlap, and (ii) a vision-guided audio selection module that filters audio tokens. The entire framework is optimized end-to-end via a differentiable straight-through estimator. Extensive experiments on five representative benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy and robustness of OmniSIFT. Notably, for Qwen2.5-Omni-7B, OmniSIFT introduces only 4.85M parameters while maintaining lower latency than training-free baselines such as OmniZip. With merely 25% of the original token context, OmniSIFT consistently outperforms all compression baselines and even surpasses the performance of the full-token model on several tasks."

    "abstract": "Multi-Agent Aerial Load Transport Systems (MAATS) offer greater payload capacity and fault tolerance than single-drone solutions. However, they have an underdetermined tension allocation problem that leads to uneven energy distribution, cable slack, or collisions between drones and cables. This paper presents a real-time optimization layer that improves a hierarchical load-position-attitude controller by incorporating a Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) algorithm. The SQP formulation minimizes the sum of squared cable tensions while imposing a cable-alignment penalty that discourages small inter-cable angles, thereby preventing tether convergence without altering the reference trajectory. We tested the method under nominal conditions by running numerical simulations of four quadrotors. Computational experiments based on numerical simulations demonstrate that the SQP routine runs in a few milliseconds on standard hardware, indicating feasibility for real-time use. A sensitivity analysis confirms that the gain of the cable-alignment penalty can be tuned online, enabling a controllable trade-off between safety margin and energy consumption with no measurable degradation of tracking performance in simulation. This framework provides a scalable path to safe and energy-balanced cooperative load transport in practical deployments."

We present LALM-as-a-Judge, the first controlled benchmark and systematic study of large audio-language models (LALMs) as safety judges for multi-turn spoken dialogues. We generate 24,000 unsafe and synthetic spoken dialogues in English that consist of 3-10 turns, by having a single dialogue turn including content with one of 8 harmful categories (e.g., violence) and on one of 5 grades, from very mild to severe. On 160 dialogues, 5 human raters confirmed reliable unsafe detection and a meaningful severity scale. We benchmark three open-source LALMs: Qwen2-Audio, Audio Flamingo 3, and MERaLiON as zero-shot judges that output a scalar safety score in [0,1] across audio-only, transcription-only, or multimodal inputs, along with a transcription-only LLaMA baseline. We measure the judges' sensitivity to detecting unsafe content, the specificity in ordering severity levels, and the stability of the score in dialogue turns. Results reveal architecture- and modality-dependent trade-offs: the most sensitive judge is also the least stable across turns, while stable configurations sacrifice detection of mild harmful content. Transcription quality is a key bottleneck: Whisper-Large may significantly reduce sensitivity for transcription-only modes, while largely preserving severity ordering. Audio becomes crucial when paralinguistic cues or transcription fidelity are category-critical. We summarize all findings and provide actionable guidance for practitioners."

    "abstract": "Setting the learning rate for a deep learning model is a critical part of successful training, yet choosing this hyperparameter is often done empirically with trial and error. In this work, we explore a solvable model of optimal learning rate schedules for a powerlaw random feature model trained with stochastic gradient descent (SGD). We consider the optimal schedule $η_T^\\star(t)$ where $t$ is the current iterate and $T$ is the total training horizon. This schedule is computed both numerically and analytically (when possible) using optimal control methods. Our analysis reveals two regimes which we term the easy phase and hard phase. In the easy phase the optimal schedule is a polynomial decay $η_T^\\star(t) \\simeq T^{-ξ} (1-t/T)^δ$ where $ξ$ and $δ$ depend on the properties of the features and task. In the hard phase, the optimal schedule resembles warmup-stable-decay with constant (in $T$) initial learning rate and annealing performed over a vanishing (in $T$) fraction of training steps. We investigate joint optimization of learning rate and batch size, identifying a degenerate optimality condition. Our model also predicts the compute-optimal scaling laws (where model size and training steps are chosen optimally) in both easy and hard regimes. Going beyond SGD, we consider optimal schedules for the momentum $β(t)$, where speedups in the hard phase are possible. We compare our optimal schedule to various benchmarks in our task including (1) optimal constant learning rates $η_T(t) \\sim T^{-ξ}$ (2) optimal power laws $η_T(t) \\sim T^{-ξ} t^{-χ}$, finding that our schedule achieves better rates than either of these. Our theory suggests that learning rate transfer across training horizon depends on the structure of the model and task. We explore these ideas in simple experimental pretraining setups."

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) rarely admit uncertainty, often producing fluent but misleading answers, rather than abstaining (i.e., refusing to answer). This weakness is even evident in temporal question answering, where models frequently ignore time-sensitive evidence and conflate facts across different time-periods. In this paper, we present the first empirical study of training LLMs with an abstention ability while reasoning about temporal QA. Existing approaches such as calibration might be unreliable in capturing uncertainty in complex reasoning. We instead frame abstention as a teachable skill and introduce a pipeline that couples Chain-of-Thought (CoT) supervision with Reinforcement Learning (RL) guided by abstention-aware rewards. Our goal is to systematically analyze how different information types and training techniques affect temporal reasoning with abstention behavior in LLMs. Through extensive experiments studying various methods, we find that RL yields strong empirical gains on reasoning: a model initialized by Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct surpasses GPT-4o by $3.46\\%$ and $5.80\\%$ in Exact Match on TimeQA-Easy and Hard, respectively. Moreover, it improves the True Positive rate on unanswerable questions by $20\\%$ over a pure supervised fine-tuned (SFT) variant. Beyond performance, our analysis shows that SFT induces overconfidence and harms reliability, while RL improves prediction accuracy but exhibits similar risks. Finally, by comparing implicit reasoning cues (e.g., original context, temporal sub-context, knowledge graphs) with explicit CoT supervision, we find that implicit information provides limited benefit for reasoning with abstention. Our study provides new insights into how abstention and reasoning can be jointly optimized, providing a foundation for building more reliable LLMs."

An important subclass of such systems consists of active particles that can remodel the network in which they move. Here, we introduce a minimal yet versatile model of active particles moving on an adjustable network. In this model, particles undergo discrete run-and-tumble motion along the links of a triangular lattice and leave behind a trail of temporarily blocked links. These closed links cannot be traversed by other particles and reopen only after a characteristic healing time. The resulting trail-mediated blocking mechanism is fundamentally distinct from more familiar interactions such as excluded-volume effects. In the high-persistence limit, we find a qualitative contrast between the two mechanisms: while steric blocking leads to reduced diffusivity with increasing persistence, trail-induced blocking causes diffusivity to increase monotonically. We characterize this fundamental difference and the associated, unexpected transport properties, and discuss potential applications of our findings."

A shared per-receiver encoder learns time-frequency structure within each received grid, and a token-wise cross-attention module fuses the receivers to produce soft log-likelihood ratios for a standard channel decoder, without requiring explicit per-receiver channel estimates. Trained with a bit-metric objective, the model adapts its fusion to per-receiver reliability, tolerates missing or degraded links, and remains robust when pilots are sparse. Across realistic Wi-Fi channels, it consistently outperforms classical pipelines and strong convolutional baselines, frequently matching (and in some cases surpassing) a powerful baseline that assumes perfect channel knowledge per access point. Despite its expressiveness, the architecture is compact, has low computational cost (low GFLOPs), and achieves low latency on GPUs, making it a practical building block for next-generation Wi-Fi receivers."

The maneuverable jamming UAV emits artificial noise to assist the source UAV in detecting multiple ground targets while interfering with an eavesdropper. The effects of residual interference caused by imperfect successive interference cancellation on the received signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio are considered, which degrades the system performance. To maximize the average secrecy rate (ASR) under transmit power budget, UAV maneuvering constraints, and sensing requirements, the dual-UAV trajectory and beamforming are jointly optimized. Given that secure communication and sensing fundamentally conflict in terms of resource allocation, making it difficult to achieve optimal performance for both simultaneously, we adopt a two-phase design to address this challenge. By dividing the mission into the secure communication (SC) phase and the SCS phase, the A2G-ISAC system can focus on optimizing distinct objectives separately. In the SC phase, a block coordinate descent algorithm employing the trust-region successive convex approximation and semidefinite relaxation iteratively optimizes dual-UAV trajectory and beamforming. For the SCS phase, a weighted distance minimization problem determines the suitable dual-UAV sensing positions by a greedy algorithm, followed by the joint optimization of source beamforming and jamming beamforming. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves the highest ASR among benchmarks while maintaining robust sensing performance, and confirm the impact of the SIC residual interference on both secure communication and sensing."

Experiments on three real-world Taiwanese criminal homicide cases show that baseline methods collapse below 40% completeness, while Soft-FSM consistently achieves over 97% with near-zero redundancy.

Attributing to helpful-harmless trade-off from LLM alignment, agents typically also inherit the flaw of \"over-refusal\", which is a passive failure mode. However, the proactive planning and action capabilities of agents introduce another crucial danger on the other side of the trade-off. This phenomenon we term \"Toxic Proactivity'': an active failure mode in which an agent, driven by the optimization for Machiavellian helpfulness, disregards ethical constraints to maximize utility. Unlike over-refusal, Toxic Proactivity manifests as the agent taking excessive or manipulative measures to ensure its \"usefulness'' is maintained. Existing research pays little attention to identifying this behavior, as it often lacks the subtle context required for such strategies to unfold. To reveal this risk, we introduce a novel evaluation framework based on dilemma-driven interactions between dual models, enabling the simulation and analysis of agent behavior over multi-step behavioral trajectories. Through extensive experiments with mainstream LLMs, we demonstrate that Toxic Proactivity is a widespread behavioral phenomenon and reveal two major tendencies. We further present a systematic benchmark for evaluating Toxic Proactive behavior across contextual settings."

Among various approaches, database parameter tuning has proven to be a highly effective means of enhancing performance. Recent studies have shown that machine learning techniques can successfully optimize database parameters, leading to significant performance improvements. However, existing methods still face several limitations. First, they require substantial time to generate large training datasets. Second, to cope with the challenges of highdimensional optimization, they typically optimize only a subset of parameters rather than the full configuration space. Third, they often rely on information from similar workloads instead of directly leveraging information from the target workload. To address these limitations, we propose LatentTune, a novel approach that differs fundamentally from traditional methods. To reduce the time required for data generation, LatentTune incorporates a data augmentation strategy. Furthermore, it constructs a latent space that compresses information from all database parameters, enabling the optimization of the full configuration space. In addition, LatentTune integrates external metric information into the latent space, allowing for precise tuning tailored to the actual target workload. Experimental results demonstrate that LatentTune outperforms baseline models across four workloads on MySQL and RocksDB, achieving up to 1332% improvement for RocksDB and 11.82% throughput gain with 46.01% latency reduction for MySQL."

To address this challenge, this paper proposes an SOH estimation method that integrates deep learning with electrochemical mechanisms and adopts a sequential training strategy. First, we construct a hybrid-driven surrogate model to learn internal electrochemical dynamics by fusing high-fidelity simulation data with physical constraints. This model subsequently serves as an accurate and differentiable physical kernel for voltage reconstruction. Then, we develop a self-supervised framework to train a parameter identification network by minimizing the voltage reconstruction error. The resulting model enables the non-iterative identification of aging parameters from external measurements. Finally, utilizing the identified parameters as physicochemical health indicators, we establish a high-precision SOH estimation network that leverages data-driven residual correction to compensate for identification deviations. Crucially, a sequential training strategy is applied across these modules to effectively mitigate convergence issues and improve the accuracy of each module. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves an average voltage reconstruction root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.0198 V and an SOH estimation RMSE of 0.0014."

Time-domain measurements reveal delayed and broadened terahertz waveforms with increasing Ru thickness, consistent with long-range orbital transport. In Co/Pt/Ru trilayers, the terahertz emission is further enhanced through constructive interference between the inverse spin Hall effect (ISHE) in Pt and inverse orbital Hall effect (IOHE) in Ru, while reversed stack structures show suppressed output. Ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) measurements reveal a strong correlation between damping and THz amplitude, highlighting efficient angular momentum conversion. These results position Co/Ru as a promising orbitronic platform for tunable ultrafast THz emission. Our results not only strengthen the physical mechanism of condensed matter physics but also pave the way for designing promising spin-orbitronic devices and terahertz emitters."

However, existing methods typically suffer from (i) the computational redundancy of dense voxel representations, (ii) structural redundancy inherent in multi-branch architectures, and (iii) the under-utilization of spectral information in capturing global motion patterns. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient EAR framework named HoloEv-Net. First, to simultaneously tackle representation and structural redundancies, we introduce a Compact Holographic Spatiotemporal Representation (CHSR). Departing from computationally expensive voxel grids, CHSR implicitly embeds horizontal spatial cues into the Time-Height (T-H) view, effectively preserving 3D spatiotemporal contexts within a 2D representation. Second, to exploit the neglected spectral cues, we design a Global Spectral Gating (GSG) module. By leveraging the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) for global token mixing in the frequency domain, GSG enhances the representation capability with negligible parameter overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate the scalability and effectiveness of our framework. Specifically, HoloEv-Net-Base achieves state-of-the-art performance on THU-EACT-50-CHL, HARDVS and DailyDVS-200, outperforming existing methods by 10.29%, 1.71% and 6.25%, respectively. Furthermore, our lightweight variant, HoloEv-Net-Small, delivers highly competitive accuracy while offering extreme efficiency, reducing parameters by 5.4 times, FLOPs by 300times, and latency by 2.4times compared to heavy baselines, demonstrating its potential for edge deployment."

    "abstract": "Low-level database operators often admit multiple physical implementations (\"kernels\") that are semantically equivalent but have vastly different performance characteristics depending on the input data distribution. Existing database systems typically rely on static heuristics or worst-case optimal defaults to select these kernels, often missing significant performance opportunities. In this work, we propose CAKE (Counterfactual Adaptive Kernel Execution), a system that learns to select the optimal kernel for each data \"morsel\" using a microsecond-scale contextual multi-armed bandit. CAKE circumvents the high latency of traditional reinforcement learning by exploiting the cheapness of counterfactuals -- selectively running multiple kernels to obtain full feedback -- and compiling policies into low-latency regret trees. Experimentally, we show that CAKE can reduce end-to-end workload latency by up to 2x compared to state-of-the-art static heuristics."

Using ODE asymptotic analysis, we classify all local positive solutions near $z=+\\infty$. Exponential decay solutions always exist; non-exponential decay solutions exist if and only if $\\mathrm{e}^{-\\frac{1}{c}\\int_{z_0}^z a(s)ds}\\in L^1$ (or equivalently, when $a(z)$ decays slower than a critical algebraic rate). We establish a complete existence, multiplicity and spatial decay theory for forced waves. For each $c\\in(0,2\\sqrtα)$, there exists a unique exponentially decaying forced wave. This wave is either the unique forced wave or the minimal forced wave, depending on the integrability condition. In the super-critical case $\\mathrm{e}^{-\\frac{1}{c}\\int_{z_0}^z a(s)ds}\\in L^1$, for any $c>0$ there exist infinitely many non-exponentially decaying forced waves. The maximal wave is not in $L^1$, and for nearly all such $a(z)$ we establish the existence, multiplicity and precise decay of these waves.

We consider a population of single stellar mass black holes (BHs) in the inner $0.1$~pc of a NSC surrounding a $4 \\times 10^6$~M$_\\odot$ supermassive black hole (SMBH). Using a semianalytic model, we account for direct collisions between BHs and stars and GW capture between BHs. We explore the effect of the initial BH mass and spin distributions on their final properties and the production of GW sources. Specifically, we consider upper and lower limits for the BH initial mass distribution, and we account for the possibility that a subset of our initial population are the merger products of primordial BH binaries. We find that $\\sim 500$ M$_{\\odot}$ intermediate mass black holes (IMBHs) can form for our upper limit mass distribution, while our lower limit mass distribution forms none. Most IMBHs $\\gtrsim 200$~M$_\\odot$ eventually sink towards the center of the cluster and merge with the SMBH. We also find that BH-star collisions create a more uniform spin distribution. Our results have implications for LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA sources. We find that the overall merger rate depends primarily on the upper limits of the initial BH mass distribution, ranging from $\\sim10^{-10}$ to $\\sim10^{-9}$~yr$^{-1}$ per galaxy. However, primordial binaries increase the number of second and higher generation mergers by an order of magnitude."

    "abstract": "This paper introduces Point2Insert, a sparse-point-based framework for flexible and user-friendly object insertion in videos, motivated by the growing popularity of accurate, low-effort object placement. Existing approaches face two major challenges: mask-based insertion methods require labor-intensive mask annotations, while instruction-based methods struggle to place objects at precise locations. Point2Insert addresses these issues by requiring only a small number of sparse points instead of dense masks, eliminating the need for tedious mask drawing. Specifically, it supports both positive and negative points to indicate regions that are suitable or unsuitable for insertion, enabling fine-grained spatial control over object locations. The training of Point2Insert consists of two stages. In Stage 1, we train an insertion model that generates objects in given regions conditioned on either sparse-point prompts or a binary mask. In Stage 2, we further train the model on paired videos synthesized by an object removal model, adapting it to video insertion. Moreover, motivated by the higher insertion success rate of mask-guided editing, we leverage a mask-guided insertion model as a teacher to distill reliable insertion behavior into the point-guided model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Point2Insert consistently outperforms strong baselines and even surpasses models with $\\times$10 more parameters."

    "abstract": "This study aims to explore the dynamics of driver attention to various zones, including the road, the central mirror, the embedded Human-Machine Interface (HMI), and the speedometer, across different driving modes in AVs. The integration of autonomous vehicles (AVs) into transportation systems has introduced critical safety concerns, particularly regarding driver re-engagement during mode transitions. Past accidents underscore the risks of overreliance on automation and highlight the need to understand dynamic attention allocation to support safety in autonomous driving. A high-fidelity driving simulation was conducted. Eye-tracking technology was used to measure fixation duration, fixation count, and time to first fixation across distinct driving modes (automated, manual, and transition), which were then used to assess how drivers allocated attention to various areas of interest (AOIs). Findings show that drivers' attention varies significantly across driving modes. In manual mode, attention consistently focuses on the road, while in automated mode, prolonged fixation on the embedded HMI was observed. During the handover and takeover phases, attention shifts dynamically between environmental and technological elements. The study reveals that driver attention allocation is mode-dependent. These findings inform the design of adaptive HMIs in AVs that align with drivers' attention patterns. By presenting relevant information according to the driving context, such systems can enhance driver-vehicle interaction, support effective transitions, and improve overall safety. Systematic analysis of visual attention dynamics across driving modes is gaining prominence, as it informs adaptive HMI designs and driver readiness interventions. The GLMM findings can be directly applied to the design of adaptive HMIs or driver training programs to enhance attention and improve safety."

For smooth Kähler families whose central fiber is projective with a big adjoint class, we show that its volume remains locally constant. Finally, using the (relative) minimal model program for Kähler threefolds, we verify the deformation invariance of volumes of adjoint classes and plurigenera for smooth families of Kähler threefolds, thereby confirming Siu's invariance of plurigenera conjecture in dimension three."

The framework also provides deployment feedback via out-of-distribution detection and counterfactual explanations that reveal which microstructural features drive predictions. Together, the architecture guidance, reliability signals, and interpretability tools address a practical gap in materials characterization, where researchers lack tools to select architectures for their specific imaging setup or assess when models can be trusted on new samples."

The measured fragment-ion momentum distributions show discernible differences between the three isomers and provide signatures of specific carbon and hydrogen sites in the molecule. In contrast to previous work, we demonstrate that distinct 'marker atoms' are not strictly required for constructing a meaningful molecular frame of reference for the interpretation of the momentum-space data.

We introduce KGLAMP, a knowledge-graph-guided LLM planning framework for heterogeneous multi-robot teams. The framework maintains a structured knowledge graph encoding object relations, spatial reachability, and robot capabilities, which guides the LLM in generating accurate PDDL problem specifications. The knowledge graph serves as a persistent, dynamically updated memory that incorporates new observations and triggers replanning upon detecting inconsistencies, enabling symbolic plans to adapt to evolving world states.

We prove that, in the presence of symmetry, the convex hull of the feasible region associated with each set of aggregated variables can be exactly characterized. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed reformulation and establish new theoretical foundations for achieving tightness in variable aggregation-based mixed-integer programming formulations."

    "abstract": "Superdirective (supergain) antennas aim to produce a narrow main beam from radiators that are electrically small compared with the wavelength. Instead of enlarging the physical aperture, they rely on strongly coupled currents, near-field energy storage, and controlled modal interference so that a compact structure radiates with enhanced directivity. This review emphasizes link-relevant evaluation and reporting: realized gain referenced to a stated impedance plane, clearly stated bandwidth definitions (impedance and performance), and robustness to fabrication spread and platform/environmental loading. Two practical implementation routes are surveyed. The first uses resonant, tightly coupled arrays, including fully driven arrays and single-chain designs based on parasitic or reactively loaded elements. The second uses single-body radiators that enforce a targeted mixture of multipoles or resonant/characteristic modes with one or a few feeds, including symmetry-broken dielectric resonators and mixed electric--magnetic designs. Across RF, microwave, and optical regimes, the same penalties recur as superdirectivity is pushed: reduced radiation resistance, rapid impedance variation, narrow usable bandwidth, and strong sensitivity to small perturbations. Beyond geometric synthesis and multi-resonant stacking, the review highlights emerging levers that can shift these trade-offs in specific system contexts: low-loss materials and cryogenic operation to improve efficiency and frequency stability, and time-varying loading and matching (Floquet/parametric approaches) that can relax linear time-invariant bandwidth constraints, at the cost of added control complexity and spectral conversion."

    "abstract": "Perplexity is a widely adopted metric for assessing the predictive quality of large language models (LLMs) and often serves as a reference metric for downstream evaluations. However, recent evidence shows that perplexity can be unreliable, especially when irrelevant long inputs are used, raising concerns for both benchmarking and system deployment. While prior efforts have employed selective input filtering and curated datasets, the impact of input length on perplexity has not been systematically studied from a systems perspective and input length has rarely been treated as a first-class system variable affecting both fairness and efficiency. In this work, we close this gap by introducing LengthBenchmark, a system-conscious evaluation framework that explicitly integrates input length, evaluation protocol design, and system-level costs, evaluating representative LLMs under two scoring protocols (direct accumulation and fixed window sliding) across varying context lengths. Unlike prior work that focuses solely on accuracy-oriented metrics, LengthBenchmark additionally measures latency, memory footprint, and evaluation cost, thereby linking predictive metrics to deployment realities. We further incorporate quantized variants not as a main contribution, but as robustness checks, showing that length-induced biases persist across both full-precision and compressed models. This design disentangles the effects of evaluation logic, quantization, and input length, and demonstrates that length bias is a general phenomenon that undermines fair cross-model comparison. Our analysis yields two key observations: (i) sliding window evaluation consistently inflates performance on short inputs, and (ii) both full-precision and quantized models appear to realise gains as the evaluated segment length grows."

    "abstract": "Long-form video understanding remains challenging for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) due to the inherent tension between computational constraints and the need to capture information distributed across thousands of frames. Existing approaches either sample frames uniformly (risking information loss) or select keyframes in a single pass (with no recovery from poor choices). We propose VideoBrain, an end-to-end framework that enables VLMs to adaptively acquire visual information through learned sampling policies. Our approach features dual complementary agents: a CLIP-based agent for semantic retrieval across the video and a Uniform agent for dense temporal sampling within intervals. Unlike prior agent-based methods that rely on text-only LLMs orchestrating visual tools, our VLM directly perceives frames and reasons about information sufficiency. To prevent models from invoking agents indiscriminately to maximize rewards, we introduce a behavior-aware reward function coupled with a data classification pipeline that teaches the model when agent invocation is genuinely beneficial. Experiments on four long video benchmarks demonstrate that VideoBrain achieves +3.5% to +9.0% improvement over the baseline while using 30-40% fewer frames, with strong cross-dataset generalization to short video benchmarks."

    "abstract": "Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) language models introduce unique challenges for safety alignment due to their sparse routing mechanisms, which can enable degenerate optimization behaviors under standard full-parameter fine-tuning. In our preliminary experiments, we observe that naively applying full-parameter safety fine-tuning to MoE models can reduce attack success rates through routing or expert dominance effects, rather than by directly repairing Safety-Critical Experts. To address this challenge, we propose RASA, a routing-aware expert-level alignment framework that explicitly repairs Safety-Critical Experts while preventing routing-based bypasses. RASA identifies experts disproportionately activated by successful jailbreaks, selectively fine-tunes only these experts under fixed routing, and subsequently enforces routing consistency with safety-aligned contexts. Across two representative MoE architectures and a diverse set of jailbreak attacks, RASA achieves near-perfect robustness, strong cross-attack generalization, and substantially reduced over-refusal, while preserving general capabilities on benchmarks such as MMLU, GSM8K, and TruthfulQA. Our results suggest that robust MoE safety alignment benefits from targeted expert repair rather than global parameter updates, offering a practical and architecture-preserving alternative to prior approaches."

However, these monolithic networks tend to collapse into mode-averaged behavior, where stylistic boundaries are blurred, and rare but effective strategies are suppressed. To counteract homogenization, we introduce Mixture-of-Masters (MoM), the first chess mixture-of-experts model with small-sized GPT experts emulating world-class grandmasters. Each expert is trained with a combination of self-supervised learning and reinforcement learning guided by chess-specific rewards. For each move, a post-hoc learnable gating network selects the most appropriate persona to channel depending on the game state, allowing MoM to switch its style dynamically$--$e.g., Tal's offensive vocation or Petrosian's defensive solidity. When evaluated against Stockfish on unseen standard games, MoM outperforms both dense individual expert networks and popular GPT baselines trained on aggregated data, while ensuring generation variety, control, and interpretability."

    "abstract": "Unmanned underwater vehicles are increasingly employed for maintenance and surveying tasks at sea, but their operation in shallow waters is often hindered by hydrodynamic disturbances such as waves, currents, and turbulence. These unsteady flows can induce rapid changes in direction and speed, compromising vehicle stability and manoeuvrability. Marine organisms contend with such conditions by combining proprioceptive feedback with flexible fins and tails to reject disturbances. Inspired by this strategy, we propose soft morphing wings endowed with proprioceptive sensing to mitigate environmental perturbations. The wing's continuous deformation provides a natural means to infer dynamic disturbances: sudden changes in camber directly reflect variations in the oncoming flow. By interpreting this proprioceptive signal, a disturbance observer can reconstruct flow parameters in real time. To enable this, we develop and experimentally validate a dynamic model of a hydraulically actuated soft wing with controllable camber. We then show that curvature-based sensing allows accurate estimation of disturbances in the angle of attack. Finally, we demonstrate that a controller leveraging these proprioceptive estimates can reject disturbances in the lift response of the soft wing. By combining proprioceptive sensing with a disturbance observer, this technique mirrors biological strategies and provides a pathway for soft underwater vehicles to maintain stability in hazardous environments."

In this work, we study the automated design of agentic systems that remain safe even when a subset of agents is compromised. We formalize this challenge as a Stackelberg security game between a system designer (the Meta-Agent) and a best-responding Meta-Adversary that selects and compromises a subset of agents to minimize safety. We propose Meta-Adversary-Meta-Agent (MaMa), a novel algorithm for approximately solving this game and automatically designing safe agentic systems. Our approach uses LLM-based adversarial search, where the Meta-Agent iteratively proposes system designs and receives feedback based on the strongest attacks discovered by the Meta-Adversary. Empirical evaluations across diverse environments show that systems designed with MaMa consistently defend against worst-case attacks while maintaining performance comparable to systems optimized solely for task success. Moreover, the resulting systems generalize to stronger adversaries, as well as ones with different attack objectives or underlying LLMs, demonstrating robust safety beyond the training setting."

    "abstract": "The modulation of galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) by interplanetary disturbances, manifested as Forbush decreases (FDs), has long been recognized as a signature of coronal mass ejection (CME) passages through the heliosphere. While individual FD events have been extensively studied, systematic investigations of how GCR inter-station correlation variations relate to geomagnetic storm (GS) intensity have not been established. Here we analyze the relationship between GCR characteristics (from a global NM network) and GSs, aiming to understand the physical mechanisms of heliospheric disturbances and to develop complementary predictive capabilities beyond existing L1 solar wind monitoring. By applying a newly introduced anisotropy characteristic method alongside correlation analysis to 25 years of hourly NM data (1995-2020, seven stations), we demonstrate significant correlations between GCR parameters and geomagnetic activity. Inter-station relative differences and anisotropy enhancements show distinct precursor signatures depending on storm intensity, with extreme events displaying detectable signals 48-96 hours in advance. Based on these intensity-dependent response patterns, we propose a \"two-stage multi-level\" early warning framework: mid-term identification (48-96 hr) triggered by sustained anisotropy increases, followed by short-term grading (0-48 hr) based on inter-station relative difference variations and high-latitude flux changes. Validated on the extreme November 2003 and severe August 2018 geomagnetic storms, our approach successfully identifies precursor signals, providing a potential means to extend GS prediction windows."

    "abstract": "Photodetectors (PDs) are essential in imaging, communication, and sensing technologies. However, their reliance on external power makes them energy-consuming. This creates a strong need for self-powered PDs as a sustainable alternative. ZnO is a promising semiconductor material due to its pyroelectric properties, stemming from non-centrosymmetric wurtzite crystal structure, enabling the pyro-phototronic effect that enhances response speed. Properties of ZnO can be tailored via alloying and doping. Thus, this work explores thin layers of ZnCdO:Eu random alloys grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) on silicon substrates, with varying Cd content. The study shows that doping with Eu notably affects growth kinetics, promoting strong [0001] orientation preference. Moreover, photoluminescence measurements confirm the successful incorporation of Eu3+ ions into the structure. Electrical measurements show that the introduction of Cd eliminates the problem of Schottky barrier formation on the ZnO/Si interface. The n-ZnCdO:Eu/p-Si junctions exhibit rectifying behavior and generate photocurrent across 380-1150 nm wavelength range without external electrical bias. Utilizing the pyro-phototronic effect, these devices achieved ultrafast response times: rise time below 10 us and decay time below 5 us for 405 nm and 650 nm illumination - placing them among the fastest self-powered oxide-based detectors that do not rely on additional performance-enhancing layers."

By strategically placing an optical parametric amplifier (OPA) inside the Sagnac loop, light is automatically squeezed in both forward and backward directions of the loop, which enhances the detectability of a small phase. For measuring the squeezed quadrature, we explore two approaches: Direct detection of the output intensity, which is simple, but requires a high-efficiency photo-detector; and parametric homodyne with an additional OPA, which accepts practical detectors with no efficiency limitation, but is technically more complex. Our analysis demonstrates super-classical sensitivity under most realistic conditions of loss and detector inefficiency, thereby leveraging the resources of squeezing and the principles of SU(1,1) interference, while maintaining compatibility with standard Sagnac configurations."

However, these systems are trained on large text corpora that encode existing biases, including sex disparities in diagnosis and treatment, raising concerns that such patterns may be reproduced or amplified. We systematically examined whether contemporary LLMs exhibit sex-specific biases in clinical reasoning and how model configuration influences these behaviours. We conducted three experiments using 50 clinician-authored vignettes spanning 44 specialties in which sex was non-informative to the initial diagnostic pathway. Four general-purpose LLMs (ChatGPT (gpt-4o-mini), Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Gemini 2.0 Flash and DeepSeekchat). All models demonstrated significant sex-assignment skew, with predicted sex differing by model. At temperature 0.5, ChatGPT assigned female sex in 70% of cases (95% CI 0.66-0.75), DeepSeek in 61% (0.57-0.65) and Claude in 59% (0.55-0.63), whereas Gemini showed a male skew, assigning a female sex in 36% of cases (0.32-0.41). Contemporary LLMs exhibit stable, model-specific sex biases in clinical reasoning. Permitting abstention reduces explicit labelling but does not eliminate downstream diagnostic differences. Safe clinical integration requires conservative and documented configuration, specialty-level clinical data auditing, and continued human oversight when deploying general-purpose models in healthcare settings."

Colored interlacing triangles depend on two key parameters: the number of colors $n$ and the depth of the triangle $N$. Recent work of Gaetz-Gao (2025) connects these objects to Schubert calculus and resolves the enumeration for $n=3$ and arbitrary depth $N$. However, the enumerative behavior for general $n$ has remained open. In this paper, we analyze the complementary regime: fixed depth $N=2$ and arbitrary number of colors $n$. We prove that in this setting, colored interlacing triangles are in bijection with Dumont derangements, identifying their enumeration with the Genocchi medians. This connects the probabilistic model to a rich hierarchy of classical combinatorial objects. Furthermore, we introduce a $q$-deformation of this enumeration arising naturally from the LLT transition energy. This yields new $q$-analogs of the Genocchi medians. Finally, we present computational results and sampling algorithms for colored interlacing triangles with higher $N$ or $n$, which suggests the limits of combinatorial tractability in the $(N,n)$ parameter space."

UltraSeg-108K (0.108 M parameters) is optimized for single-center data, while UltraSeg-130K (0.13 M parameters) generalizes to multi-center, multi-modal images. By jointly optimizing encoder-decoder widths, incorporating constrained dilated convolutions to enlarge receptive fields, and integrating a cross-layer lightweight fusion module, the models achieve 90 FPS on a single CPU core without sacrificing accuracy. Evaluated on seven public datasets, UltraSeg retains >94% of the Dice score of a 31 M-parameter U-Net while utilizing only 0.4% of its parameters, establishing a strong, clinically viable baseline for the extreme-compression domain and offering an immediately deployable solution for resource-constrained settings.

    "abstract": "Reliable classification of Earth Observation data depends on consistent, up-to-date reference labels. However, collecting new labelled data at each time step remains expensive and logistically difficult, especially in dynamic or remote ecological systems. As a response to this challenge, we demonstrate that a model with access to reference data solely from time step t0 can perform competitively on both t0 and a future time step t1, outperforming models trained separately on time-specific reference data (the gold standard). This finding suggests that effective temporal generalization can be achieved without requiring manual updates to reference labels beyond the initial time step t0. Drawing on concepts from change detection and semi-supervised learning (SSL), the most performant approach, \"Common Ground\", uses a semi-supervised framework that leverages temporally stable regions-areas with little to no change in spectral or semantic characteristics between time steps-as a source of implicit supervision for dynamic regions. We evaluate this strategy across multiple classifiers, sensors (Landsat-8, Sentinel-2 satellite multispectral and airborne imaging spectroscopy), and ecological use cases. For invasive tree species mapping, we observed a 21-40% improvement in classification accuracy using Common Ground compared to naive temporal transfer, where models trained at a single time step are directly applied to a future time step. We also observe a 10 -16% higher accuracy for the introduced approach compared to a gold-standard approach. In contrast, when broad land cover categories were mapped across Europe, we observed a more modest 2% increase in accuracy compared to both the naive and gold-standard approaches. These results underscore the effectiveness of combining stable reference screening with SSL for scalable and label-efficient multi-temporal remote sensing classification."

We compare our results for the form factors at both the maximum and minimum recoil points with previous theoretical studies, finding good agreement. We observe that the form factors depend on the transferred momentum $q^2$ and their magnitude gradually increases with increasing $q^2$. The dominant form factors are $f_1$ and $g_1$ and they also exhibit similar $q^2$ dependencies.

We evaluate Qwen2.5 and Qwen2.5-VL on a controlled spatial n-back task presented as matched text-rendered or image-rendered grids. Across conditions, models show reliably higher accuracy and d' with text than with vision. To interpret these differences at the process level, we use trial-wise log-probability evidence and find that nominal 2/3-back often fails to reflect the instructed lag and instead aligns with a recency-locked comparison.

While the discrete solver's accuracy is controllable, the rate of convergence of the discretization error is governed by the intrinsic dimension of our data. Therefore, the true bottleneck is the knowledge and control of the sampling error. In this work, we tackle this issue by introducing novel estimators for both sampling error and intrinsic dimension. The key finding is a simple, tuning-free estimator of $\\text{OT}_c(ρ, \\hatρ)$ that utilizes the semi-dual OT functional and, remarkably, requires no OT solver. Furthermore, we derive a fast intrinsic dimension estimator from the multi-scale decay of our sampling error estimator. This framework unlocks significant computational and statistical advantages in practice, enabling us to (i) quantify the convergence rate of the discretization error, (ii) calibrate the entropic regularization of Sinkhorn divergences to the data's intrinsic geometry, and (iii) introduce a novel, intrinsic-dimension-based Richardson extrapolation estimator that strongly debiases Wasserstein distance estimation. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our geometry-aware pipeline effectively mitigates the discretization error bottleneck while maintaining computational efficiency."

    "abstract": "Embodied agents operating in multi-agent, partially observable, and decentralized environments must plan and act despite pervasive uncertainty about hidden objects and collaborators' intentions. Recent advances in applying Large Language Models (LLMs) to embodied agents have addressed many long-standing challenges, such as high-level goal decomposition and online adaptation. Yet, uncertainty is still primarily mitigated through frequent inter-agent communication. This incurs substantial token and time costs, and can disrupt established workflows, when human partners are involved. We introduce PCE, a Planner-Composer-Evaluator framework that converts the fragmented assumptions latent in LLM reasoning traces into a structured decision tree. Internal nodes encode environment assumptions and leaves map to actions; each path is then scored by scenario likelihood, goal-directed gain, and execution cost to guide rational action selection without heavy communication. Across two challenging multi-agent benchmarks (C-WAH and TDW-MAT) and three diverse LLM backbones, PCE consistently outperforms communication-centric baselines in success rate and task efficiency while showing comparable token usage. Ablation results indicate that the performance gains obtained by scaling model capacity or reasoning depth persist even when PCE is applied, while PCE consistently raises the baseline across both capacity and reasoning-depth scales, confirming that structured uncertainty handling complements both forms of scaling. A user study further demonstrates that PCE produces communication patterns that human partners perceive as more efficient and trustworthy. Together, these results establish a principled route for turning latent LLM assumptions into reliable strategies for uncertainty-aware planning."

From the collection of valid segments, we propose a coherent aggregation procedure that constructs a global segmentation which is the exact solution of an optimization problem. Our main contribution is the use of a lexicographic order for the optimization problem that prioritizes parsimony. We analyze the computational complexity of the resulting procedure, which ranges from linear to cubic time depending on the chosen cost and validity functions, the data regime and the number of detected changes. Finally, we assess the quality of SVP through comparisons with standard optimal partitioning algorithms, showing that SVP yields competitive segmentations while explicitly enforcing segment validity. The flexibility of SVP makes it applicable to a broad class of problems; as an illustration, we demonstrate robust change-point detection by encoding robustness in the validity criterion."

Splatting (3DGS) advances demonstrate impressive rendering quality and real-time performance, they critically depend on precise camera calibration and pose annotations, limiting their applicability in real-world settings. We present JOintGS, a unified framework that jointly optimizes camera extrinsics, human poses, and 3D Gaussian representations from coarse initialization through a synergistic refinement mechanism. Our key insight is that explicit foreground-background disentanglement enables mutual reinforcement: static background Gaussians anchor camera estimation via multi-view consistency; refined cameras improve human body alignment through accurate temporal correspondence; optimized human poses enhance scene reconstruction by removing dynamic artifacts from static constraints. We further introduce a temporal dynamics module to capture fine-grained pose-dependent deformations and a residual color field to model illumination variations. Extensive experiments on NeuMan and EMDB datasets demonstrate that JOintGS achieves superior reconstruction quality, with 2.1~dB PSNR improvement over state-of-the-art methods on NeuMan dataset, while maintaining real-time rendering. Notably, our method shows significantly enhanced robustness to noisy initialization compared to the baseline.Our source code is available at https://github.com/MiliLab/JOintGS."

    "abstract": "Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have advanced rapidly by aligning visual patches with the text embedding space, but a fixed visual-token budget forces images to be resized to a uniform pretraining resolution, often erasing fine-grained details and causing hallucinations via over-reliance on language priors. Recent attention-guided enhancement (e.g., cropping or region-focused attention allocation) alleviates this, yet it commonly hinges on a static \"magic layer\" empirically chosen on simple recognition benchmarks and thus may not transfer to complex reasoning tasks. In contrast to this static assumption, we propose a dynamic perspective on visual grounding. Through a layer-wise sensitivity analysis, we demonstrate that visual grounding is a dynamic process: while simple object recognition tasks rely on middle layers, complex visual search and reasoning tasks require visual information to be reactivated at deeper layers. Based on this observation, we introduce Visual Activation by Query (VAQ), a metric that identifies the layer whose attention map is most relevant to query-specific visual grounding by measuring attention sensitivity to the input query. Building on VAQ, we further propose LASER (Layer-adaptive Attention-guided Selective visual and decoding Enhancement for Reasoning), a training-free inference procedure that adaptively selects task-appropriate layers for visual localization and question answering. Experiments across diverse VQA benchmarks show that LASER significantly improves VQA accuracy across tasks with varying levels of complexity."

However, prevailing paradigms typically rely on solitary rollout strategies where the model works alone. This lack of intermediate oversight renders the reasoning process susceptible to error propagation, where early logical deviations cascade into irreversible failures, resulting in noisy optimization signals. In this paper, we propose the \\textbf{Guided Verifier} framework to address these structural limitations. Moving beyond passive terminal rewards, we introduce a dynamic verifier that actively co-solves tasks alongside the policy. During the rollout phase, this verifier interacts with the policy model in real-time, detecting inconsistencies and providing directional signals to steer the model toward valid trajectories. To facilitate this, we develop a specialized data synthesis pipeline targeting multimodal hallucinations, constructing \\textbf{CoRe} dataset of process-level negatives and \\textbf{Co}rrect-guide \\textbf{Re}asoning trajectories to train the guided verifier. Extensive experiments on MathVista, MathVerse and MMMU indicate that by allocating compute to collaborative inference and dynamic verification, an 8B-parameter model can achieve strong performance."

    "abstract": "Modern language models are trained almost exclusively on token sequences produced by a fixed tokenizer, an external lossless compressor often over UTF-8 byte sequences, thereby coupling the model to that compressor. This work introduces proxy compression, an alternative training scheme that preserves the efficiency benefits of compressed inputs while providing an end-to-end, raw-byte interface at inference time. During training, one language model is jointly trained on raw byte sequences and compressed views generated by external compressors; through the process, the model learns to internally align compressed sequences and raw bytes. This alignment enables strong transfer between the two formats, even when training predominantly on compressed inputs which are discarded at inference. Extensive experiments on code language modeling demonstrate that proxy compression substantially improves training efficiency and significantly outperforms pure byte-level baselines given fixed compute budgets. As model scale increases, these gains become more pronounced, and proxy-trained models eventually match or rival tokenizer approaches, all while operating solely on raw bytes and retaining the inherent robustness of byte-level modeling."

To this end, we first conduct quantitative investigations into how thought and observation affect agent effectiveness and efficiency. Based on our findings, we propose Agent-Omit, a unified training framework that empowers LLM agents to adaptively omit redundant thoughts and observations. Specifically, we first synthesize a small amount of cold-start data, including both single-turn and multi-turn omission scenarios, to fine-tune the agent for omission behaviors. Furthermore, we introduce an omit-aware agentic reinforcement learning approach, incorporating a dual sampling mechanism and a tailored omission reward to incentivize the agent's adaptive omission capability. Theoretically, we prove that the deviation of our omission policy is upper-bounded by KL-divergence. Experimental results on five agent benchmarks show that our constructed Agent-Omit-8B could obtain performance comparable to seven frontier LLM agent, and achieve the best effectiveness-efficiency trade-off than seven efficient LLM agents methods.

We employ two independent methods to derive the limb shift curve: a spectral-averaging method (Method 1) and a velocity-averaging method (Method 2). By comparing synthetic and observed data, we determine the convective blueshift, which is not accounted for in the CHASE observations. The simulations reproduce the observed trends for both methods at the instrument's spatial resolution of 1.2 arcsec. However, at resolutions below 1 arcsec, Method 2 produces limb-shift curves that depart significantly from both Method 1 results and traditional limb-shift profiles, whereas Method 1 remains in agreement with classical behavior. Further analysis finds that the results from Method 1 comprise two distinct components: a contrast contribution caused by the correlation between velocity and line depth, and a Dopplergram contribution caused by density inhomogeneities and corrugation effects."

This paper formulates the optimisation of the IW-ELBO in Bures-Wasserstein space, a manifold of Gaussian distributions equipped with the 2-Wasserstein metric. We derive the Wasserstein gradient of the IW-ELBO and project it onto the Bures-Wasserstein space to yield a tractable algorithm for Gaussian VI. A pivotal contribution of our analysis concerns the stability of the gradient estimator. While the SNR of the standard Euclidean gradient estimator is known to vanish as the number of importance samples $K$ increases, we prove that the SNR of the Wasserstein gradient scales favourably as $Ω(\\sqrt{K})$, ensuring optimisation efficiency even for large $K$. We further extend this geometric analysis to the Variational Rényi Importance-Weighted Autoencoder bound, establishing analogous stability guarantees. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves superior approximation performance compared to other baselines."

We show that this problem admits an equivalent belief Markov decision process (MDP) formulation, which provides a simplified representation of the optimal policy. To efficiently characterize information-theoretic privacy leakage in continuous state and action spaces, we propose a particle-belief MDP formulation that tracks the parameter posterior via sequential Monte Carlo, yielding a tractable belief-state approximation that converges asymptotically as the number of particles increases. We further derive a tractable closed-form upper bound on particle-based MI via Gaussian mixture approximations, which enables efficient optimization of the particle-belief MDP. Experiments on a mixed-autonomy platoon show that the learned continuous policy substantially impedes inference attacks on human-driving behavior parameters while maintaining data usability and system performance."

Most existing VLA frameworks rely on standard supervised objectives, typically cross-entropy for discrete actions and mean squared error (MSE) for continuous action regression, which impose strong pointwise constraints on individual predictions. In this work, we focus on continuous-action VLA models and move beyond conventional MSE-based regression by reshaping action error distributions during training. Drawing on information-theoretic principles, we introduce Minimum Error Entropy (MEE) into modern VLA architectures and propose a trajectory-level MEE objective, together with two weighted variants, combined with MSE for continuous-action VLA training. We evaluate our approaches across standard, few-shot, and noisy settings on multiple representative VLA architectures, using simulation benchmarks such as LIBERO and SimplerEnv as well as real-world robotic manipulation tasks. Experimental results demonstrate consistent improvements in success rates and robustness across these settings. Under imbalanced data regimes, the gains persist within a well-characterized operating range, while incurring negligible additional training cost and no impact on inference efficiency.

    "abstract": "Accurate segmentation of MRI brain images is essential for image analysis, diagnosis of neuro-logical disorders and medical image computing. In the deep learning approach, the convolutional neural networks (CNNs), especially UNet, are widely applied in medical image segmentation. However, it is difficult to deal with uncertainty due to the partial volume effect in brain images. To overcome this limitation, we propose an enhanced framework, named UNet with intuitionistic fuzzy logic (IF-UNet), which incorporates intuitionistic fuzzy logic into UNet. The model processes input data in terms of membership, nonmembership, and hesitation degrees, allowing it to better address tissue ambiguity resulting from partial volume effects and boundary uncertainties. The proposed architecture is evaluated on the Internet Brain Segmentation Repository (IBSR) dataset, and its performance is computed using accuracy, Dice coefficient, and intersection over union (IoU). Experimental results confirm that IF-UNet improves segmentation quality with handling uncertainty in brain images."

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely applied across multiple domains for their broad knowledge and strong reasoning capabilities. However, applying them to recommendation systems is challenging since it is hard for LLMs to extract user preferences from large, sparse user-item logs, and real-time per-user ranking over the full catalog is too time-consuming to be practical. Moreover, many existing recommender systems focus solely on ranking items while overlooking explanations, which could help improve predictive accuracy and make recommendations more convincing to users. Inspired by recent works that achieve strong recommendation performance by forecasting near-term item popularity, we propose TRAIL (TRend and explAnation Integrated Learner). TRAIL is a fine-tuned LLM that jointly predicts short-term item popularity and generates faithful natural-language explanations. It employs contrastive learning with positive and negative pairs to align its scores and explanations with structured trend signals, yielding accurate and explainable popularity predictions. Extensive experiments show that TRAIL outperforms strong baselines and produces coherent, well-grounded explanations."

We investigate nearly Gorenstein property of $R$ using $a(R)$ and $b(R)$ and $m(R)$, the initial degree of $R$. If $b(R)<0$, (and if $R$ is $\\mathbb Q$-Gorenstein), then we believe that $R$ is log-terminal -- this is proved if $\\dim R=2$ or $R$ is F-pure (or $F$-pure type).

Beginning with the explicit equations of motion of a massive particle in the regular spacetime, we achieve the equation of the particle sphere and thus the radius of the unstable timelike circular orbit. It is interesting to find that the particle sphere equation can reduce to the well-known photon sphere equation, when the particle's initial velocity is equal to the speed of light. We adopt the strong field limit approach to calculate the black-bounce-Schwarzschild deflection angle of the particle subsequently, and obtain the strong-deflection lensing observables of the relativistic images of a pointlike particle source. The observables mainly include the apparent angular particle sphere radius, the angular separation between the outermost relativistic image and the other ones which are packed together, and the ratio between the particle-flux magnification of the outermost image and that of the packed ones (or equivalently, their resulted magnitudelike difference). The velocity effects induced by the deviation of the initial velocity of the particle from light speed on the corresponding strong-field lensing observables of the images of a pointlike light source in the regular geometry, along with these on the strong deflection limit coefficients and the critical impact parameter of the lightlike case, are then formulated. Serving as an application of the results, we finally concentrate on evaluating the astronomical detectability of the velocity effects on the lensing observables and analyzing their dependence on the parameters, by modeling the Galactic supermassive black hole (i.e., Sgr A$^{\\ast}$) as the lens."

However, this task is extremely challenging due to the need to interact with diverse objects and efficiently rearrange multiple objects in complex environments while ensuring collision-free loco-manipulation. In this work, we present ALORE, an autonomous large-object rearrangement system for a legged manipulator that can rearrange various large objects across diverse scenarios. The proposed system is characterized by three main features: (i) a hierarchical reinforcement learning training pipeline for multi-object environment learning, where a high-level object velocity controller is trained on top of a low-level whole-body controller to achieve efficient and stable joint learning across multiple objects; (ii) two key modules, a unified interaction configuration representation and an object velocity estimator, that allow a single policy to regulate planar velocity of diverse objects accurately; and (iii) a task-and-motion planning framework that jointly optimizes object visitation order and object-to-target assignment, improving task efficiency while enabling online replanning. Comparisons against strong baselines show consistent superiority in policy generalization, object-velocity tracking accuracy, and multi-object rearrangement efficiency. Key modules are systematically evaluated, and extensive simulations and real-world experiments are conducted to validate the robustness and effectiveness of the entire system, which successfully completes 8 continuous loops to rearrange 32 chairs over nearly 40 minutes without a single failure, and executes long-distance autonomous rearrangement over an approximately 40 m route.

    "abstract": "Though large language models (LLMs) have enabled great success across a wide variety of tasks, they still appear to fall short of one of the loftier goals of artificial intelligence research: creating an artificial system that can adapt its behavior to radically new contexts upon deployment. One important step towards this goal is to create systems that can induce rich representations of data that are seen in-context, and then flexibly deploy these representations to accomplish goals. Recently, Park et al. (2024) demonstrated that current LLMs are indeed capable of inducing such representation from context (i.e., in-context representation learning). The present study investigates whether LLMs can use these representations to complete simple downstream tasks. We first assess whether open-weights LLMs can use in-context representations for next-token prediction, and then probe models using a novel task, adaptive world modeling. In both tasks, we find evidence that open-weights LLMs struggle to deploy representations of novel semantics that are defined in-context, even if they encode these semantics in their latent representations. Furthermore, we assess closed-source, state-of-the-art reasoning models on the adaptive world modeling task, demonstrating that even the most performant LLMs cannot reliably leverage novel patterns presented in-context. Overall, this work seeks to inspire novel methods for encouraging models to not only encode information presented in-context, but to do so in a manner that supports flexible deployment of this information."

In the function field setting, Drinfeld modules and Anderson modules serve as analogues of elliptic curves and abelian varieties, and Goss $L$-series play the role of Hasse-Weil $L$-functions. This paper introduces a motivic framework for studying twisted Goss $L$-series via Anderson motives associated to Drinfeld modules and Artin representations. For a Drinfeld module and an Artin representation on the absolute Galois group, we present a construction of Anderson motives associated to them and we show that it comes from a uniformizable abelian Anderson module. We also study their associated $L$-series, which recover the norm of the twisted Goss $L$-values. These results provide an interpretation of twisted Goss $L$-values in terms of regulators of Anderson modules with the help of Taelman's class number formula."

It presents a critical challenge in scalable oversight: enabling humans to responsibly steer AI systems on tasks that surpass their own ability to specify or verify. To tackle this, we propose Scalable Interactive Oversight, a framework that decomposes complex intent into a recursive tree of manageable decisions to amplify human supervision. Rather than relying on open-ended prompting, our system elicits low-burden feedback at each node and recursively aggregates these signals into precise global guidance. Validated in web development task, our framework enables non-experts to produce expert-level Product Requirement Documents, achieving a 54\\% improvement in alignment. Crucially, we demonstrate that this framework can be optimized via Reinforcement Learning using only online user feedback, offering a practical pathway for maintaining human control as AI scales."

    "abstract": "Channel charting (CC) has become a key technology for RF-based localization, enabling unsupervised radio fingerprinting, even in non line of sight scenarios, with a minimum of reference position labels. However, most CC models assume fixed-size inputs, such as a constant number of antennas or channel measurements. In practical systems, antennas may fail, signals may be blocked, or antenna sets may change during handovers, making fixed-input architectures fragile. Existing radio-fingerprinting approaches address this by training separate models for each antenna configuration, but the resulting training effort scales prohibitively with the array size. We propose Adaptive Positioning (AdaPos), a CC architecture that natively handles variable numbers of channel measurements. AdaPos combines convolutional feature extraction with a transformer-based encoder using learnable antenna identifiers and self-attention to fuse arbitrary subsets of CSI inputs. Experiments on two public real-world datasets (SISO and MIMO) show that AdaPos maintains state-of-the-art accuracy under missing-antenna conditions and replaces roughly 57 configuration-specific models with a single unified model. With AdaPos and our novel training strategies, we provide resilience to both individual antenna failures and full-array outages."

This formulation has the advantage that it facilitates the analysis of the $L_1$ spectral norm of the algorithm output. This advantage is based on the fact that a high $L_1$ spectral norm of the output of a quantum decision tree is a necessary condition to outperform its classical counterpart. We propose heuristics for maximizing the $L_{1}$ spectral norm, show how to combine weighted graphs to generate sequences with strictly increasing norm, and present functions exhibiting exponential quantum advantage.

However, existing RMOT models rely solely on 2D RGB data, making it challenging to accurately detect and associate targets characterized by complex spatial semantics (e.g., ``the person closest to the camera'') and to maintain reliable identities under severe occlusion, due to the absence of explicit 3D spatial information. In this work, we propose a novel task, RGBD Referring Multi-Object Tracking (DRMOT), which explicitly requires models to fuse RGB, Depth (D), and Language (L) modalities to achieve 3D-aware tracking. To advance research on the DRMOT task, we construct a tailored RGBD referring multi-object tracking dataset, named DRSet, designed to evaluate models' spatial-semantic grounding and tracking capabilities. Specifically, DRSet contains RGB images and depth maps from 187 scenes, along with 240 language descriptions, among which 56 descriptions incorporate depth-related information. Furthermore, we propose DRTrack, a MLLM-guided depth-referring tracking framework. DRTrack performs depth-aware target grounding from joint RGB-D-L inputs and enforces robust trajectory association by incorporating depth cues. Extensive experiments on the DRSet dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework."

To this end, we make the following two contributions. First, we propose ReasoningCodec, a discrete audio codec that factorizes audio into (i) reasoning tokens, which encode text-aligned, high-level analysis and planning representations for audio understanding and hierarchical generation, and (ii) reconstruction tokens, which encode semantic-rich acoustic cues for high-fidelity waveform reconstruction. This design achieves understanding performance comparable to strong continuous representations while improving generation quality and reconstruction fidelity over prior discrete tokenizers. Second, we introduce a unified autoregressive architecture for text and audio, together with multi-stage training and multi-task data construction. Using this framework, we train UniAudio 2.0 on 100B text tokens and 60B audio tokens. Across a wide range of speech, sound, and music tasks, UniAudio 2.0 performs competitively on in-domain evaluations and demonstrates strong few-shot and zero-shot generalization to unseen tasks.

Traditional point prediction methods often fail to capture the inherent uncertainty in time series data, while existing probabilistic approaches struggle to balance computational efficiency with interpretability. We propose a novel Multi-Expert Learning Distributional Labels (LDL) framework that addresses these challenges through mixture-of-experts architectures with distributional learning capabilities. Our approach introduces two complementary methods: (1) Multi-Expert LDL, which employs multiple experts with different learned parameters to capture diverse temporal patterns, and (2) Pattern-Aware LDL-MoE, which explicitly decomposes time series into interpretable components (trend, seasonality, changepoints, volatility) through specialized sub-experts. Both frameworks extend traditional point prediction to distributional learning, enabling rich uncertainty quantification through Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD). We evaluate our methods on aggregated sales data derived from the M5 dataset, demonstrating superior performance compared to baseline approaches. The continuous Multi-Expert LDL achieves the best overall performance, while the Pattern-Aware LDL-MoE provides enhanced interpretability through component-wise analysis. Our frameworks successfully balance predictive accuracy with interpretability, making them suitable for real-world forecasting applications where both performance and actionable insights are crucial."

In practice, teacher predictions are often noisy or overconfident, and existing correction-based approaches rely on ad-hoc heuristics and extensive hyper-parameter tuning, which hinders generalization. We introduce REDistill (Robust Estimator Distillation), a simple yet principled framework grounded in robust statistics. REDistill replaces the standard KD objective with a power divergence loss, a generalization of KL divergence that adaptively downweights unreliable teacher output while preserving informative logit relationships. This formulation provides a unified and interpretable treatment of teacher noise, requires only logits, integrates seamlessly into existing KD pipelines, and incurs negligible computational overhead. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1k demonstrate that REDistill consistently improves student accuracy in diverse teacher-student architectures. Remarkably, it achieves these gains without model-specific hyper-parameter tuning, underscoring its robustness and strong generalization to unseen teacher-student pairs."

To address these issues, we introduce Generalized Schrödinger Bridge on Graphs (GSBoG), a novel scalable data-driven framework for learning executable controlled continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) policies on arbitrary graphs under state cost augmented dynamics. Notably, GSBoG learns trajectory-level policies, avoiding dense global solvers and thereby enhancing scalability. This is achieved via a likelihood optimization approach, satisfying the endpoint marginals, while simultaneously optimizing intermediate behavior under state-dependent running costs. Extensive experimentation on challenging real-world graph topologies shows that GSBoG reliably learns accurate, topology-respecting policies while optimizing application-specific intermediate state costs, highlighting its broad applicability and paving new avenues for cost-aware dynamical transport on general graphs."

Particularly, we discuss two truncation approaches to handle the infinite dependency graphs present in time-dependent systems. While one leaves the causal mechanisms intact, the other approximates the mechanisms at the start nodes. The effectiveness of the different approaches is benchmarked using a challenging data generation process inspired by a problem in factory energy management: the avoidance of peaks in the power consumption.

To mitigate this gap, we introduce a hybrid signal that combines rationale consistency with outcome accuracy for GenRM training.

It is debated if all massive stars undergo an LBV-like phase during their evolution, or instead LBVs are exotic phenomena. We aim to quantify the incidence of LBV-like variability in the blue supergiant (BSgs) population of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) using the OGLE survey. Here, we extend previous work in the Small Magellanic Cloud to the LMC, where we examine the light curves of 87 B Supergiants (BSgs) (out of 254 known BSgs) spanning timescales of twenty years, and 37 objects across a three year timescale for aperiodic variations resembling known S Dor variables. One blue supergiant, [ST92] 4-13 shows S Dor type photometric variations. New spectra of this object reveals a potential change in spectral type compared to the literature classification. However, based on its spectral characteristics and low luminosity and mass, we do not currently classify it as an LBV. Our study highlights the need to classify bona fide LBVs as stars undergoing both photometric and spectroscopic variations. Based on currently known stellar population of S Dor variables in the LMC, the lifetime of the S Dor phase is at most $\\sim$10$^3$ yrs, in agreement with our duty cycle study based on OGLE data in the SMC. This is orders of magnitude shorter than assumed in literature. Our discovery of LBV-like variability at low luminosities may suggest that S Dor variations could arise from Eddington limit related physics over a wide range of stellar masses, rather than being linked to a unique evolutionary stage."

Using Bayesian inference with the state-of-the-art eccentric, spin-aligned, higher-mode effective-one-body model SEOBNRv5EHM, we reanalyze six previously suggested eccentric gravitational-wave events--GW190521, GW190620, GW190701, GW191109, GW200129, and GW200208\\_222617. Comparing results with its dominant-mode-only counterpart SEOBNRv5E, we find no statistically significant HOM-induced bias in eccentricity for any of these events, including GW190521, whose eccentricity has been debated in the literature. To identify parameter regimes vulnerable to HOM omission, we perform a broad zero-noise injection campaign varying detector-frame total mass, mass ratio, eccentricity, inclination, and network SNR. We find that significant systematic biases ($Δ_e/σ> 1$) arise predominantly in systems with high total mass ($M^{\\rm det}\\gtrsim120M_\\odot$), highly asymmetric mass ratios ($q \\gtrsim 4$), near edge-on orientations ($θ_\\textrm{JN} \\gtrsim 30^\\circ$), and high SNRs ($ρ^N_\\textrm{mf}\\approx50$). Notably, for quasi-circular BBHs with $M^{\\rm det}\\gtrsim140M_\\odot$, neglecting HOMs may lead to strong false-positive evidence for nonzero eccentricity. By contrast, for lower-mass systems ($M^{\\rm det}\\sim100 M_\\odot$), HOM exclusion produces negligible eccentricity biases. Our results demonstrate that although current eccentric candidates are not impacted by HOM omission, future eccentricity measurements--particularly for massive, asymmetric, or edge-on systems--require HOM-inclusive waveforms to avoid substantial systematic errors."

    "abstract": "Software Engineering (SE) agents have shown promising abilities in supporting various SE tasks. Current SE agents remain fundamentally reactive, making decisions mainly based on conversation history and the most recent response. However, this reactive design provides no explicit structure or persistent state within the agent's memory, making long-horizon reasoning challenging. As a result, SE agents struggle to maintain a coherent understanding across reasoning steps, adapt their hypotheses as new evidence emerges, or incorporate execution feedback into the mental reasoning model of the system state. In this position paper, we argue that, to further advance SE agents, we need to move beyond reactive behavior toward a structured, state-aware, and execution-grounded reasoning. We outline how explicit structure, persistent and evolving state, and the integration of execution-grounded feedback can help SE agents perform more coherent and reliable reasoning in long-horizon tasks. We also provide an initial roadmap for developing next-generation SE agents that can more effectively perform real-world tasks."

    "abstract": "Reduced shoulder mobility limits upper-limb function and the performance of activities of daily living across a wide range of conditions. Wearable exosuits have shown promise in assisting arm elevation, reducing muscle effort, and supporting functional movements; however, comfort is rarely prioritized as an explicit design objective, despite it strongly affects real-life, long-term usage. This study presents a redesigned soft shoulder exosuit (Soft Shoulder v2) developed to address comfort-related limitations identified in our previous version, while preserving assistive performance. In parallel, assistance was also improved, shifting from the coronal plane to the sagittal plane to better support functionally relevant hand positioning. A controlled comparison between the previous (v1) and redesigned (v2) modules was conducted in eight healthy participants, who performed static holding, dynamic lifting, and a functional pick and place task. Muscle activity, kinematics, and user-reported outcomes were assessed. Both versions increased endurance time, reduced deltoid activation, and preserved transparency during unpowered shoulder elevation. However, the difference between them emerged most clearly during functional tasks and comfort evaluation. The redesigned module facilitated forward arm positioning and increased transverse plane mobility by up to 30 deg, without increasing muscular demand. User-reported outcomes further indicated a substantial improvement in wearability, with markedly lower perceived pressure and higher ratings in effectiveness, ease of use, and comfort compared to the previous design. Taken together, these findings show that targeted, user-centered design refinements can improve comfort and functional interaction without compromising assistive performance, advancing the development of soft exosuits suitable for prolonged and daily use."

We propose Query-Adaptive Trust-Region policy Optimization (QUATRO), which directly enforces trust-region constraints through a principled optimization. This yields a clear and interpretable objective that enables explicit control over policy updates and stable, entropy-controlled optimization, with a stabilizer terms arising intrinsically from the exact trust-region formulation. Empirically verified on diverse mathematical reasoning benchmarks, QUATRO shows stable training under increased policy staleness and aggressive learning rates, maintaining well-controlled entropy throughout training."

Training on unrolled trajectories is known to limit these divergences but quickly becomes too expensive due to the need for computing gradients over an iterative process. In this paper, we demonstrate that regularizing the Jacobian of the NDE model via its directional derivatives during training stabilizes long-term integration in the challenging context of short training rollouts. We design two regularizations, one for the case of known dynamics where we can directly derive the directional derivatives of the dynamic and one for the case of unknown dynamics where they are approximated using finite differences. Both methods, while having a far lower cost compared to long rollouts during training, are successful in improving the stability of long-term simulations for several ordinary and partial differential equations, opening up the door to training NDE methods for long-term integration of large scale systems."

In educational contexts, teachers and learners require interpretable, trait-level feedback that aligns with instructional goals and established rubrics. In this paper, we study trait-based Automatic Argumentative Essay Scoring using two complementary modeling paradigms designed for realistic educational deployment: (1) structured in-context learning with small open-source LLMs, and (2) a supervised, encoder-based BigBird model with a CORAL-style ordinal regression formulation, optimized for long-sequence understanding. We conduct a systematic evaluation on the ASAP++ dataset, which includes essay scores across five quality traits, offering strong coverage of core argumentation dimensions. LLMs are prompted with designed, rubric-aligned in-context examples, along with feedback and confidence requests, while we explicitly model ordinality in scores with the BigBird model via the rank-consistent CORAL framework. Our results show that explicitly modeling score ordinality substantially improves agreement with human raters across all traits, outperforming LLMs and nominal classification and regression-based baselines. This finding reinforces the importance of aligning model objectives with rubric semantics for educational assessment. At the same time, small open-source LLMs achieve a competitive performance without task-specific fine-tuning, particularly for reasoning-oriented traits, while enabling transparent, privacy-preserving, and locally deployable assessment scenarios. Our findings provide methodological, modeling, and practical insights for the design of AI-based educational systems that aim to deliver interpretable, rubric-aligned feedback for argumentative writing."

Unlike conventional rule-based or purely data-driven policies, the proposed DMWM combines short-horizon predictive planning with symbolic model-based rollout, enabling the scheduler to anticipate future network states and adjust transmission decisions accordingly. We implement the framework in a configurable simulation testbed and benchmark its performance against traditional heuristics and reinforcement learning baselines under varied traffic conditions. Our results show that DMWM achieves superior performance in bursty, interference-limited, and deadline-sensitive environments, while maintaining interpretability and sample efficiency. The proposed design bridges the gap between network-level reasoning and low-overhead learning, marking a step toward scalable and adaptive NDT-based network optimization."

We consider an idealized setup where one such particle is subject to a harmonic confining potential, and an external agent can vary in time the tumbling rate and the strength of the trap. We search for time-dependent control protocols steering the system between assigned end states, in a prescribed time interval. To this aim, we propose a description of the dynamics, alternative to the usual ones, in the form of an infinite set of ordinary differential equations. Solutions based on a suitable closure of such hierarchy, which we expect to hold true in the limit of long protocol duration, are discussed and compared with numerical simulations. We also look for the protocol completing the task with the minimal work, on average: the problem can be tackled analytically, again in the regime of slow (but not quasi-static) transformations. The solution provides insightful intuition on the optimal strategies for the control of active matter systems."

We demonstrate that the simulated SS data provide complementary sensitivity to the modified gravitational wave propagation friction term, thereby enhancing the discriminating power between $f(R)$ gravity and the $Λ$CDM model. However, we note that standard sirens do not offer a viable resolution to the Hubble tension in this analysis, as the inferred constraints are predominantly driven by the fiducial cosmologies adopted in the simulations. Regarding the specific models, we find that for the Hu-Sawicki scenario, several data combinations favor $F_{RR0}<0$, implying potential theoretical instabilities. And, for the Starobinsky model, while EM-only constraints are nearly symmetric between the two parameter branches ($b<0$ and $b>0$), the inclusion of SS constraints introduces mild asymmetries, revealing the sensitivity of SS observables to the curvature dependence of the theory. Future truly independent standard siren observations would be crucial for a definitive assessment of $f(R)$ gravity as an alternative to $Λ$CDM."

In this work, we investigate the fundamental limits of \\emph{locally-gentle} quantum state certification, where the learning algorithm is constrained to perturb the state by at most $α$ in trace norm, thereby allowing for the reuse of samples. We analyze the hypothesis testing problem of distinguishing whether an unknown state $ρ$ is equal to a reference $ρ_0$ or $ε$-far from it. We derive the minimax sample complexity for this problem, quantifying the information-theoretic price of non-destructive measurements. Specifically, by constructing explicit measurement operators, we show that the constraint of $α$-gentleness imposes a sample size penalty of $\\frac{d}{α^2}$, yielding a total sample complexity of $n = Θ(\\frac{d^3}{ε^2 α^2})$. Our results clarify the trade-off between information extraction and state disturbance, and highlight deep connections between physical measurement constraints and privacy mechanisms in quantum learning. Crucially, we find that the sample size penalty incurred by enforcing $α$-gentleness scales linearly with the Hilbert-space dimension $d$ rather than the number of parameters $d^2-1$ typical for high-dimensional private estimation."

    "abstract": "The proliferation of long-context large language models (LLMs) exposes a key bottleneck: the rapidly expanding key-value cache during decoding, which imposes heavy memory and latency costs. While recent approaches attempt to alleviate this by sharing a single set of crucial tokens across layers, such coarse-grained sharing undermines model performance by neglecting the functional diversity of attention heads. To address this, we propose LycheeDecode, an efficient decoding method centered on a fine-grained hybrid-head attention mechanism that employs a hardware-efficient top-k selection strategy. Specifically, the novel HardKuma-based mechanism partitions attention heads into a small subset of retrieval heads that dynamically identify crucial tokens and a majority of sparse heads that reuse them for efficient computation. Through extensive experiments on leading models like Llama3 and Qwen3 across diverse benchmarks for long-context understanding (e.g., LongBench, RULER) and complex reasoning (e.g., AIME24, OlympiadBench), we demonstrate that LycheeDecode achieves generative quality comparable to, and at times surpassing even the full-attention baseline. Crucially, this is accomplished with up to a 2.7x speedup at a 128K context length. By preserving the functional diversity of attention heads, our fine-grained strategy overcomes the performance bottlenecks of existing methods, providing a powerful and validated pathway to both efficient and high-quality long-context LLM inference."

HoliAntiSpoof reformulates spoofing analysis as a unified text generation task, enabling joint reasoning over spoofing methods, affected speech attributes, and their semantic impacts. To support semantic-level analysis, we introduce DailyTalkEdit, a new anti-spoofing benchmark that simulates realistic conversational manipulations and provides annotations of semantic influence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HoliAntiSpoof outperforms conventional baselines across multiple settings, while preliminary results show that in-context learning further improves out-of-domain generalization.

In this work, we consider instead the expansion history in the context of the symmetry of scale-invariant vacuum (SIV model). We first perform two major cosmological tests: the Hubble diagram for type-Ia supernovae and the fundamental relation between $H_0$, the age of the Universe, and the total density of matter, $Ω_m$. This allows us to constrain $Ω_m$ in SIV, with both tests giving the best agreement for $Ω_m \\simeq 0.20$. We then study the physical connections of the dynamical and thermal states of the Universe at recombination with the present Hubble constant, $H_0$, and the present temperature, $T$, in the $Λ$CDM and SIV contexts. We find that, in SIV, the properties at recombination may be conveyed to the present ones ($T=2.726$ and $H_0$ at $z=0$) without any tension, indicating $H_0=74$ km/s/mpc in spite of the anchoring on the CMB. This is due to the slightly different expansion and temperature histories of the two cosmological models. Importantly, this happens to occur for $Ω_m \\simeq 0.20$, as constrained in SIV with supernovae and cosmic age. This suggests that the Hubble tension currently found between $H_0$ values in the early and late Universe may simply be the result of $ΛCDM$ ignoring the small but still measurable effects of scale invariance."

We address this by introducing a benchmark dataset for Lahore, constructed from scratch, along with companion datasets for Karachi and Mumbai, which were derived from verified administrative boundaries, totaling 1,869 $\\text{km}^2$ of area. To evaluate the global robustness of our framework, we extend our experiments to five additional established benchmarks, encompassing eight cities across three continents, and provide comprehensive data quality assessments of all datasets. We also propose a new semi-supervised segmentation framework designed to mitigate the class imbalance and feature degradation inherent in standard semi-supervised learning pipelines. Our method integrates a Class-Aware Adaptive Thresholding mechanism that dynamically adjusts confidence thresholds to prevent minority class suppression and a Prototype Bank System that enforces semantic consistency by anchoring predictions to historically learned high-fidelity feature representations. Extensive experiments across a total of eight cities spanning three continents demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised baselines. Most notably, our method demonstrates superior domain transfer capability whereby a model trained on only 10% of source labels reaches a 0.461 mIoU on unseen geographies and outperforms the zero-shot generalization of fully supervised models."

When the network is fully known, the shortest path problem can be solved precisely and in polynomial time. If, however, the network of interest is only partially observable, the shortest path problem is no longer straightforward. Inspired by the shortest path problem in partially observable networks, we investigate the geometric properties of shortest paths in {\\it Euclidean} Soft Random Geometric Graphs (SRGGs). We find that shortest paths are aligned along geodesic curves connecting shortest path endpoints. The strength of the shortest path alignment, as quantified by the average distance to geodesic from shortest path nodes and the average path stretch, is higher for larger SRGGs with short-range connections. In addition, we find that the strength of the shortest path alignment is non-monotonic with respect to the average degree of the SRGG. Based on these observations, we establish the conditions under which the alignment of shortest paths may be sufficiently strong to allow the identification of shortest path nodes based on their proximity to geodesic curves. We show that in partially observable networks with uncertain node positions, our geometric approach can outperform network-based shortest-path algorithms. In practical settings, our findings may have applications to navigation, wireless routing, and flow characterization in infrastructure networks."

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are being integrated into socially assistive robots (SARs) and other conversational agents providing mental health and well-being support. These agents are often designed to sound empathic and supportive in order to maximize user's engagement, yet it remains unclear how increasing the level of supportive framing in system prompts influences safety relevant behavior. We evaluated 6 LLMs across 3 system prompts with varying levels of supportiveness on 80 synthetic queries spanning 4 well-being domains (1440 responses). An LLM judge framework, validated against human ratings, assessed safety and care quality. Moderately supportive prompts improved empathy and constructive support while maintaining safety. In contrast, strongly validating prompts significantly degraded safety and, in some cases, care across all domains, with substantial variation across models. We discuss implications for prompt design, model selection, and domain specific safeguards in SARs deployment."

    "abstract": "Grounded Multimodal Named Entity Recognition (GMNER) aims to extract text-based entities, assign them semantic categories, and ground them to corresponding visual regions. In this work, we explore the potential of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to perform GMNER in an end-to-end manner, moving beyond their typical role as auxiliary tools within cascaded pipelines. Crucially, our investigation reveals a fundamental challenge: MLLMs exhibit $\\textbf{modality bias}$, including visual bias and textual bias, which stems from their tendency to take unimodal shortcuts rather than rigorous cross-modal verification. To address this, we propose Modality-aware Consistency Reasoning ($\\textbf{MCR}$), which enforces structured cross-modal reasoning through Multi-style Reasoning Schema Injection (MRSI) and Constraint-guided Verifiable Optimization (CVO). MRSI transforms abstract constraints into executable reasoning chains, while CVO empowers the model to dynamically align its reasoning trajectories with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Experiments on GMNER and visual grounding tasks demonstrate that MCR effectively mitigates modality bias and achieves superior performance compared to existing baselines."

    "abstract": "The velocity correlation functions directly measured from the peculiar velocity field of dark matter in numerical simulations are known to have an amplitude lower than that predicted by theoretical models at large scales. The trend persists for dark-matter halos or galaxies that are more closely related to the observables. We investigate the impact of the finite simulation box sizes on the measured velocity correlation functions of halos, utilizing N-body simulations with different box sizes. We measure the halo velocity correlations from N-body simulations with side lengths of $1{\\rm Gpc}/h$ and $2{\\rm Gpc}/h$, confirming the former is more suppressed compared to the linear theory prediction on large scales due to the lack of large-scale modes beyond the box size. In contrast, even though we subdivide the larger-box simulations into those with side lengths of $1{\\rm Gpc}/h$, the amount of the suppression is the same as that from the original boxes, as the large-scale modes are already imprinted. Introducing the lower limit of the integral in the Hankel transform, $k_{\\rm min}$, as a free parameter and marginalizing it over, we find that the constrained growth rate parameter, $f(z)σ_8(z)$, returns the correct value assumed in the simulations. However, when we ignore the effect and set $k_{\\rm min}=0$, the constraint on $fσ_8$ is significantly biased if the correlation between different separation bins is also ignored. Furthermore, we find that the suppression of the velocity correlation amplitude on large scales depends on halo mass, with more massive halos exhibiting a systematically stronger suppression. These results highlight the importance of accounting for missing long-wavelength modes when developing simulation-based modeling of velocity statistics, such as emulators."

    "abstract": "The dynamics of herd immunity depend crucially on the interaction between collective social behavior and disease transmission, but the role of heterogeneity in this context frequently remains unclear. Here, we dissect this co-evolutionary feedback by coupling a public goods game with an epidemic model on complex networks, including multiplex and real-world networks. Our results reveals a dichotomy in how heterogeneity shapes outcomes. We demonstrate that structural heterogeneity in social networks acts as a powerful catalyst for cooperation and disease suppression. This emergent effect is driven by highly connected hubs who, facing amplified personal risk, adopt protective strategies out of self-interest. In contrast, heterogeneity in individual infection costs proves detrimental, undermining cooperation and amplifying the epidemic. This creates a ``weakest link'' problem, where individuals with low perceived risk act as persistent free-riders and disease reservoirs, degrading the collective response. Our findings establish that heterogeneity is a double-edged sword: its impact is determined by whether it creates an asymmetry of influence (leverage points) or an asymmetry of motivation (weakest links), recommending disease intervention policies that facilitate cooperative transition in hubs (strengthening the leverage point) and homogenize incentives to weakest links."

However, integrating these discounted sales into future demand forecasts presents a significant challenge. This study investigates the effectiveness of incorporating a fixed share of these sales as \\textit{regular} demand into the forecast, as commonly applied in practice. We employ a two-step regression approach on data from a major European grocery retailer, covering over 1,700 products across 676 stores. We reveal that forecasts underestimate actual demand for most SKUs when discounted sales occur. This residual uplift effect is significantly influenced by the number of sales at reduced prices. Our findings underscore the necessity for more precise approaches to integrate discounted sales into demand forecasts, thereby preventing excess inventory and the associated economic and environmental impacts of spoilage in the grocery sector."

    "abstract": "We study the structure and evolution of the very early protostellar disk (``protodisk'') just after protostar formation, where disk self-gravity dominates and the stellar contribution is dynamically minor. The disk redistributes angular momentum outward through outflows and gravitational torques, thereby helping to resolve the angular momentum problem of star formation. We develop a self-similar model and carry out a parameter study that examines disk stability as a function of the key drivers of early evolution, notably the infall rate from the envelope and the strength of the gravitational torques. The mass infall rate onto the disk is estimated to be that from the collapse of a Bonnor-Ebert sphere. Our results indicate that protostellar disks that form from more unstable initial cores are more likely to be Toomre-unstable. We also find that the specific angular momentum of young protostellar disks lie in the range $10^{19}\\text{--}10^{20}\\,{\\rm cm^2\\,s^{-1}}$. We find distinct power-law profiles of physical quantities in the protodisk stage, including a rotation velocity profile that is shallower than the Keplerian profile that would be established at a later stage. As a rough validity window, our assumptions are most secure during the first $\\lesssim 2\\times 10^{3}$\\,yr after protostar formation and may plausibly extend to $\\sim(0.5\\text{--}1)\\times 10^{4}$\\,yr under weak magnetic braking and strong infall."

PerpetualWonder solves this by introducing the first true closed-loop system. It features a novel unified representation that creates a bidirectional link between the physical state and visual primitives, allowing generative refinements to correct both the dynamics and appearance. It also introduces a robust update mechanism that gathers supervision from multiple viewpoints to resolve optimization ambiguity. Experiments demonstrate that from a single image, PerpetualWonder can successfully simulate complex, multi-step interactions from long-horizon actions, maintaining physical plausibility and visual consistency."

To verify their reliability and adaptability, researchers and practitioners have proposed a variety of tools and methods for tasks such as NN code verification, refactoring, and migration. These tools play a crucial role in guaranteeing both the correctness and maintainability of neural network architectures, helping to prevent implementation errors, simplify model updates, and ensure that complex networks can be reliably extended and reused. Yet, assessing their effectiveness remains challenging due to the lack of publicly diverse datasets of neural networks that would allow systematic evaluation. To address this gap, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to automatically generate a dataset of neural networks that can serve as a benchmark for validation. The dataset is designed to cover diverse architectural components and to handle multiple input data types and tasks. In total, 608 samples are generated, each conforming to a set of precise design choices. To further ensure their consistency, we validate the correctness of the generated networks using static analysis and symbolic tracing. We make the dataset publicly available to support the community in advancing research on neural network reliability and adaptability."

For example, a trial in a neuroscience study may be linked to a value from category (a): task difficulty, and category (b): animal choice. A critical challenge in time-series analysis is to understand how these labels are encoded within the multi-trial observations, and disentangle the distinct effect of each label entry across categories. Here, we present MILCCI, a novel data-driven method that i) identifies the interpretable components underlying the data, ii) captures cross-trial variability, and iii) integrates label information to understand each category's representation within the data. MILCCI extends a sparse per-trial decomposition that leverages label similarities within each category to enable subtle, label-driven cross-trial adjustments in component compositions and to distinguish the contribution of each category. MILCCI also learns each component's corresponding temporal trace, which evolves over time within each trial and varies flexibly across trials. We demonstrate MILCCI's performance through both synthetic and real-world examples, including voting patterns, online page view trends, and neuronal recordings."

The best-known homogeneity structures are those associated with linearity on a vector bundle. The aim is to show that, for a homogeneous form of given degree, there are `Darboux coordinates' which are homogeneous. As a consequence, we obtain Darboux-type normal pictures for homogeneous forms, recovering the classical Darboux theorems, as well as their contact and presymplectic counterparts as special cases. To obtain an analog of Darboux's classification in the supergeometric context, we define a class of a differential form $α$ by the rank of the characteristic distribution $χ(α)$, being the intersection of kernels of $α$ and $dα$. We show that, under suitable regularity and constant-rank assumptions, this distribution completely controls the local equivalence problem for homogeneous Pfaffian forms. Our results hold as well for ordinary (purely even) manifolds."

Given a graph $G$ and an integer $k$, we consider the problem of deciding whether $G$ can be transformed into an interval graph using at most $k$ vertex splits. We prove that this problem is NP-hard, even when the input is restricted to subcubic planar bipartite graphs. We further observe that vertex splitting differs fundamentally from vertex and edge deletions as graph modification operations when the objective is to obtain a chordal graph, even for graphs with maximum independent set size at most two. On the positive side, we give a polynomial-time algorithm for transforming, via a minimum number of vertex splits, a given graph into a disjoint union of paths, and that splitting triangle free graphs into unit interval graphs is also solvable in polynomial time."

The optical superlattice, with odd or even number of unit cells, can exhibit either a trivial or a non-trivial underlying topology, characterized by the corresponding Zak phase. We focus on a distinct localization mechanism in the intermediate harmonic trapping frequency regime. Specifically, the four lowest-lying eigenstates in this regime form an effective four-level system in the topologically non-trivial configuration. Larger trapping frequency values drive the system into a harmonic trap dominated regime, featuring classical pairing and localization of all states of the lower band, as in a usual optical lattice. For the lower trapping frequency regime, the fate of topological edge states is discussed. Our results are based on exact diagonalization and on a tight-binding approximation that maps the continuous to a discrete system. We address several aspects relevant to the experimental implementation of optical superlattices and provide a brief illustration of the dynamics, highlighting direct ways to observe and distinguish between the different localization mechanisms."

By formulating imaginary-time evolution directly in these operator bases and evolving from the maximally mixed state, we access a continuum of temperatures where the state remains efficiently representable. We provide analytic guarantees for small-coefficient truncation and Pauli-weight (Majorana-length) truncation strategies by quantifying the error growth and the impact of backflow. Large-scale numerics on the 1D J1-J2 model (energies) and the triangular-lattice Hubbard model (static correlations) validate efficiency at high temperatures."

In this paper, we harness the flexibility of digitized computers to derive a digitized adiabatic algorithm able to reduce the gate-demanding costs of implementing factorization. To this end, we propose a new approach for adiabatic factorization by encoding the solution of the problem in the kernel subspace of the problem Hamiltonian, instead of using ground-state encoding considered in the standard adiabatic factorization proposed by Peng $et$ $al$. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 101, 220405 (2008)]. Our encoding enables the design of adiabatic factorization algorithms belonging to the class of Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) methods, instead the Polinomial Unconstrained Binary Optimization (PUBO) used by standard adiabatic factorization. We illustrate the performance of our QUBO algorithm by implementing the factorization of integers $N$ up to 8 bits. The results demonstrate a substantial improvement over the PUBO formulation, both in terms of reduced circuit complexity and increased fidelity in identifying the correct solution."

However, when the true Koopman eigenfunctions cannot be identified from finite data, multi-step predictions may suffer from structural inaccuracies and systematic bias. To address this issue, we analyse the first and second moments of the multi-step prediction residual. By decomposing the residual into contributions from the one-step approximation error and the propagation of accumulated inaccuracies, we derive a closed-form expression characterising these effects. This analysis enables the development of a novel and computationally efficient algorithm that enforces unbiasedness and reduces variance in the resulting predictor. The proposed method is validated in numerical simulations, showing improved uncertainty properties compared to standard EDMD. These results lay the foundation for uncertainty-aware and unbiased Koopman-based prediction frameworks that can be extended to controlled and stochastic systems."

This yields survival-weighted objectives that remain replay-compatible for off-policy actor-critic learning. We propose two violation semantics, absorbing and virtual termination, that share the same survival-weighted return but result in distinct optimization structures that lead to SAC/MPO-style policy improvement. Experiments demonstrate improved sample efficiency and favorable return-violation trade-offs on standard benchmarks. Moreover, MPO with virtual termination (VT-MPO) scales effectively to our high-dimensional musculoskeletal Hyfydy setup."

    "abstract": "In this report, we introduce ERNIE 5.0, a natively autoregressive foundation model desinged for unified multimodal understanding and generation across text, image, video, and audio. All modalities are trained from scratch under a unified next-group-of-tokens prediction objective, based on an ultra-sparse mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture with modality-agnostic expert routing. To address practical challenges in large-scale deployment under diverse resource constraints, ERNIE 5.0 adopts a novel elastic training paradigm. Within a single pre-training run, the model learns a family of sub-models with varying depths, expert capacities, and routing sparsity, enabling flexible trade-offs among performance, model size, and inference latency in memory- or time-constrained scenarios. Moreover, we systematically address the challenges of scaling reinforcement learning to unified foundation models, thereby guaranteeing efficient and stable post-training under ultra-sparse MoE architectures and diverse multimodal settings. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ERNIE 5.0 achieves strong and balanced performance across multiple modalities. To the best of our knowledge, among publicly disclosed models, ERNIE 5.0 represents the first production-scale realization of a trillion-parameter unified autoregressive model that supports both multimodal understanding and generation. To facilitate further research, we present detailed visualizations of modality-agnostic expert routing in the unified model, alongside comprehensive empirical analysis of elastic training, aiming to offer profound insights to the community."

    "abstract": "Vision Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in open-world zero-shot visual recognition. However, their potential in space-related applications remains largely unexplored. In the space domain, accurate manual annotation is particularly challenging due to factors such as low visibility, illumination variations, and object blending with planetary backgrounds. Developing methods that can detect and segment spacecraft and orbital targets without requiring extensive manual labeling is therefore of critical importance. In this work, we propose an annotation-free detection and segmentation pipeline for space targets using VLMs. Our approach begins by automatically generating pseudo-labels for a small subset of unlabeled real data with a pre-trained VLM. These pseudo-labels are then leveraged in a teacher-student label distillation framework to train lightweight models. Despite the inherent noise in the pseudo-labels, the distillation process leads to substantial performance gains over direct zero-shot VLM inference. Experimental evaluations on the SPARK-2024, SPEED+, and TANGO datasets on segmentation tasks demonstrate consistent improvements in average precision (AP) by up to 10 points.

Conventional encoders slowly search the embedding space for task-relevant structure, whereas ACE-Mol immediately aligns its representations with the task. ACE-Mol achieves state-of-the-art performance across molecular property prediction benchmarks with interpretable, chemically meaningful representations."

    "abstract": "Network data are increasingly common in the social sciences and infectious disease epidemiology. Analyses often link network structure to node-level covariates, but existing methods falter with sparse networks and high-dimensional node features. We propose a joint latent space modeling framework for sparse networks with high-dimensional binary node covariates that performs covariate selection while accounting for uncertainty in estimated latent positions. Building on joint latent space models that couple edges and node variables through shared latent positions, we introduce a group lasso screening step and incorporate a measurement-error-aware stabilization term to mitigate bias from using estimated latent positions as predictors. We establish prediction error rates for the covariate component both when latent positions are treated as observed and when they are estimated with bounded error; under uniform control across $q$ covariates and $n$ nodes, the rate is of order $O(\\log q / n)$ up to an additional term due to latent position estimation error. Our method addresses three challenges: (1) incorporating information from isolated nodes, which are common in sparse networks but often ignored; (2) selecting relevant covariates from high-dimensional spaces; and (3) accounting for uncertainty in estimated latent positions. Simulations show predictive performance remains stable as covariate sparsity grows, while naive approaches degrade. We illustrate how the method can support efficient study design using household social networks from 75 Indian villages, where an emulated pilot study screens a large covariate battery and substantially reduces required subsequent data collection without sacrificing network predictive accuracy."

We introduce two designs, T2A-ControlNet and T2A-Adapter, and show that the T2A-Adapter model offers a more efficient structure with strong control ability. With only 38M additional parameters, T2A-Adapter achieves state-of-the-art performance on the AudioSet-Strong in both event-level and segment-level F1 scores. We further extend this framework to audio editing, proposing T2A-Editor for removing and inserting audio events at time locations specified by instructions. Models, code, dataset pipelines, and benchmarks will be released to support future research on controllable audio generation and editing."

By studying the regularity properties of this application and using lattice discretisations, we prove that chronologically adding the loops from a Brownian loop soup encountered by an independent radial SLE$_2$ path produces a continuous path which has the law of a planar Brownian motion. This resolves a conjecture of Lawler and Werner. This construction produces a coupling between SLE$_2$ and Brownian motion, and we further show that this joint law is the scaling limit of the loop-erased random walk and the random walk itself. The arguments are robust and can be applied for instance in the off-critical setup, where the scaling limit of loop-erased random walk is Makarov and Smirnov's massive SLE$_2$."

    "abstract": "Reconstructing dynamic hand-object interactions from monocular videos is critical for dexterous manipulation data collection and creating realistic digital twins for robotics and VR. However, current methods face two prohibitive barriers: (1) reliance on neural rendering often yields fragmented, non-simulation-ready geometries under heavy occlusion, and (2) dependence on brittle Structure-from-Motion (SfM) initialization leads to frequent failures on in-the-wild footage. To overcome these limitations, we introduce AGILE, a robust framework that shifts the paradigm from reconstruction to agentic generation for interaction learning. First, we employ an agentic pipeline where a Vision-Language Model (VLM) guides a generative model to synthesize a complete, watertight object mesh with high-fidelity texture, independent of video occlusions. Second, bypassing fragile SfM entirely, we propose a robust anchor-and-track strategy. We initialize the object pose at a single interaction onset frame using a foundation model and propagate it temporally by leveraging the strong visual similarity between our generated asset and video observations. Finally, a contact-aware optimization integrates semantic, geometric, and interaction stability constraints to enforce physical plausibility. Extensive experiments on HO3D, DexYCB, and in-the-wild videos reveal that AGILE outperforms baselines in global geometric accuracy while demonstrating exceptional robustness on challenging sequences where prior art frequently collapses. By prioritizing physical validity, our method produces simulation-ready assets validated via real-to-sim retargeting for robotic applications."

This construction can be interpreted as a ($\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$-graded) theory in the Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism whenever $n$ is odd. After developing the procedure of reduction and extension of scalars, we show how twisted backgrounds in type I supergravity naturally lead to Courant algebroids over the Dolbeault complex. Specialising to the case of a Calabi-Yau fivefold, we show that the Courant contact model for that Courant algebroid is equivalent to a central extension of minimal type I BCOV theory. Inspired by this, we extend the conjecture of Costello and Li and place it within the setting of generalized geometry, conjecturing a description of the BV formulation of type I supergravity in general twisted backgrounds."

Many open and proprietary stacks still execute LDPC on general-purpose CPUs, raising concerns about missed-slot events and limited scalability as bandwidths, modulation orders, and user multiplexing increase. This paper empirically quantifies the benefit of offloading 5G-style LDPC5G decoding from a Grace CPU to the integrated Blackwell GB10 GPU on an NVIDIA DGX~Spark platform. Using NVIDIA Sionna PHY/SYS on TensorFlow, we construct an NR-like link-level chain with an LDPC5G encoder/decoder, 16-QAM modulation, and AWGN, and sweep both the number of codewords decoded in parallel and the number of belief-propagation iterations, timing only the decoding phase while logging CPU and GPU utilization and power. Across the sweep we observe an average GPU/CPU throughput speedup of approximately $6\\times$, with per-codeword CPU latency reaching $\\approx 0.71$\\,ms at 20 iterations (exceeding the 0.5\\,ms slot), while the GB10 GPU remains within 6--24\\% of the slot for the same workloads. Resource-usage measurements show that CPU-based LDPC decoding often consumes around ten Grace cores, whereas GPU-based decoding adds only $\\approx10-15$\\,W over GPU idle while leaving most CPU capacity available for higher-layer tasks. Because our implementation relies on high-level Sionna layers rather than hand-tuned CUDA, these results represent conservative lower bounds on achievable accelerator performance and provide a reusable, scriptable methodology for evaluating LDPC and other physical-layer kernels on future Grace/Blackwell and Aerial/ACAR/AODT platforms."

    "abstract": "An all-path reachability (APR, for short) predicate is a pair of a source set and a target set, which are subsets of an object set. APR predicates have been defined for abstract reduction systems (ARSs, for short) and then extended to logically constrained term rewrite systems (LCTRSs, for short) as pairs of constrained terms that represent sets of terms modeling configurations, states, etc. An APR predicate is said to be partially (or demonically) valid w.r.t. a rewrite system if every finite maximal reduction sequence of the system starting from any element in the source set includes an element in the target set. Partial validity of APR predicates w.r.t. ARSs is defined by means of two inference rules, which can be considered a proof system to construct (possibly infinite) derivation trees for partial validity. On the other hand, a proof system for LCTRSs consists of four inference rules, and thus there is a gap between the inference rules for partial validity w.r.t. ARSs and LCTRSs. In this paper, we revisit the framework for APR analysis and adapt it to verification of not only safety but also liveness properties. To this end, we first reformulate an abstract framework for partial validity w.r.t. ARSs so that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the inference rules for ARSs and LCTRSs. Secondly, we show how to apply APR analysis to safety verification. Thirdly, to apply APR analysis to liveness verification, we introduce a novel stronger validity of APR predicates, called total validity, which requires not only finite but also infinite execution paths to reach target sets. Finally, for a partially valid APR predicate with a cyclic-proof tree, we show a necessary and sufficient condition for the tree to ensure total validity, showing how to apply APR analysis to liveness verification."

For the latter task we chose a complex three-dimensional chaotic Lorenz-63 time series. By applying three temporal voltage waveforms individually across the device and training the readout layer with electrical current signals from a three-output physical reservoir, we achieved satisfactory prediction and reconstruction accuracy in comparison to the case of no reservoir.

Two DHM prototypes were developed; an initial lens-based system serving as the foundation for algorithm development, and experimental validation of the approach, achieving 89.6% classification accuracy on a 3-part differential, and a subsequent lensless system for simplified design and increased field-of-view (FoV).

With the lensless system, the derivation of the monocyte distribution width (MDW), a biomarker for sepsis, was also demonstrated.

Although large vision language models (LVLM) improve report fluency and accuracy, they exhibit hallucinations, generating plausible yet image-ungrounded pathological details. Existing methods primarily rely on external knowledge guidance to facilitate the alignment between generated text and visual information. However, these approaches often ignore the inherent decoding priors and vision-language alignment biases in pretrained models and lack robustness due to reliance on constructed guidance. In this paper, we propose Layer-wise Expert-aligned Decoding (LEAD), a novel method to inherently modify the LVLM decoding trajectory. A multiple experts module is designed for extracting distinct pathological features which are integrated into each decoder layer via a gating mechanism. This layer-wise architecture enables the LLM to consult expert features at every inference step via a learned gating function, thereby dynamically rectifying decoding biases and steering the generation toward factual consistency. Experiments conducted on multiple public datasets demonstrate that the LEAD method yields effective improvements in clinical accuracy metrics and mitigates hallucinations while preserving high generation quality."

We decompose MT into two subtasks: producing text in the target language (i.e. target language identification) and preserving the input sentence's meaning (i.e. sentence equivalence). Across three families of open-source models and 20 translation directions, we find that distinct, sparse sets of attention heads specialize in each subtask. Based on this insight, we construct subtask-specific steering vectors and show that modifying just 1% of the relevant heads enables instruction-free MT performance comparable to instruction-based prompting, while ablating these heads selectively disrupts their corresponding translation functions."

The wall therefore undergoes alternating episodes of acceleration and deceleration and approaches a quasi-stationary propagation regime with a smaller time-averaged speed than in the decoupled limit. We further identify three familiar propagation profiles -- deflagration, detonation, and hybrid -- distinguished by where the dynamical $s$-sector energy density is concentrated relative to the wall.

    "abstract": "Saliency estimation has received growing attention in recent years due to its importance in a wide range of applications. In the context of 360-degree video, it has been particularly valuable for tasks such as viewport prediction and immersive content optimization. In this paper, we propose SalFormer360, a novel saliency estimation model for 360-degree videos built on a transformer-based architecture. Our approach is based on the combination of an existing encoder architecture, SegFormer, and a custom decoder. The SegFormer model was originally developed for 2D segmentation tasks, and it has been fine-tuned to adapt it to 360-degree content. To further enhance prediction accuracy in our model, we incorporated Viewing Center Bias to reflect user attention in 360-degree environments. Extensive experiments on the three largest benchmark datasets for saliency estimation demonstrate that SalFormer360 outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. In terms of Pearson Correlation Coefficient, our model achieves 8.4% higher performance on Sport360, 2.5% on PVS-HM, and 18.6% on VR-EyeTracking compared to previous state-of-the-art."

    "abstract": "Current approaches to LLM safety fundamentally rely on a brittle cat-and-mouse game of identifying and blocking known threats via guardrails. We argue for a fresh approach: robust safety comes not from enumerating what is harmful, but from deeply understanding what is safe. We introduce Trust The Typical (T3), a framework that operationalizes this principle by treating safety as an out-of-distribution (OOD) detection problem. T3 learns the distribution of acceptable prompts in a semantic space and flags any significant deviation as a potential threat. Unlike prior methods, it requires no training on harmful examples, yet achieves state-of-the-art performance across 18 benchmarks spanning toxicity, hate speech, jailbreaking, multilingual harms, and over-refusal, reducing false positive rates by up to 40x relative to specialized safety models. A single model trained only on safe English text transfers effectively to diverse domains and over 14 languages without retraining. Finally, we demonstrate production readiness by integrating a GPU-optimized version into vLLM, enabling continuous guardrailing during token generation with less than 6% overhead even under dense evaluation intervals on large-scale workloads."

    "abstract": "The widespread adoption of photovoltaic (PV), electric vehicles (EVs), and stationary energy storage systems (ESS) in households increases system complexity while simultaneously offering new opportunities for energy regulation. However, effectively coordinating these resources under uncertainties remains challenging. This paper proposes a novel home energy management framework based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) that can jointly minimise energy expenditure and battery degradation while guaranteeing occupant comfort and EV charging requirements. Distinct from existing studies, we explicitly account for the heterogeneous degradation characteristics of stationary and EV batteries in the optimisation, alongside stochastic user behaviour regarding arrival time, departure time, and driving distance. The energy scheduling problem is formulated as a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP) and solved using a Lagrangian soft actor-critic (SAC) algorithm. This approach enables the agent to learn optimal control policies that enforce physical constraints, including indoor temperature bounds and target EV state of charge upon departure, despite stochastic uncertainties. Numerical simulations over a one-year horizon demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in satisfying physical constraints while eliminating thermal oscillations and achieving significant economic benefits. Specifically, the method reduces the cumulative operating cost substantially compared to two standard rule-based baselines while simultaneously decreasing battery degradation costs by 8.44%."

    "abstract": "Large language models present challenges for principled uncertainty quantification, in part due to their complexity and the diversity of their outputs. Semantic dispersion, or the variance in the meaning of sampled answers, has been proposed as a useful proxy for model uncertainty, but the associated computational cost prohibits its use in latency-critical applications. We show that sampled semantic distributions can be distilled into lightweight student models which estimate a prompt-conditioned uncertainty before the language model generates an answer token. The student model predicts a semantic distribution over possible answers; the entropy of this distribution provides an effective uncertainty signal for hallucination prediction, and the probability density allows candidate answers to be evaluated for reliability. On TriviaQA, our student models match or outperform finite-sample semantic dispersion for hallucination prediction and provide a strong signal for out-of-domain answer detection. We term this technique Semantic Self-Distillation (SSD), which we suggest provides a general framework for distilling predictive uncertainty in complex output spaces beyond language."

    "abstract": "For the past decade, the trajectory of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has been dominated by a model-centric paradigm driven by scaling laws. Despite significant leaps in visual fidelity, this approach has encountered a ``usability ceiling'' manifested as the Intent-Execution Gap (i.e., the fundamental disparity between a creator's high-level intent and the stochastic, black-box nature of current single-shot models). In this paper, inspired by the Vibe Coding, we introduce the \\textbf{Vibe AIGC}, a new paradigm for content generation via agentic orchestration, which represents the autonomous synthesis of hierarchical multi-agent workflows. Under this paradigm, the user's role transcends traditional prompt engineering, evolving into a Commander who provides a Vibe, a high-level representation encompassing aesthetic preferences, functional logic, and etc. A centralized Meta-Planner then functions as a system architect, deconstructing this ``Vibe'' into executable, verifiable, and adaptive agentic pipelines. By transitioning from stochastic inference to logical orchestration, Vibe AIGC bridges the gap between human imagination and machine execution. We contend that this shift will redefine the human-AI collaborative economy, transforming AI from a fragile inference engine into a robust system-level engineering partner that democratizes the creation of complex, long-horizon digital assets."

While recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at qualitative description, they often fall short in understanding the parametric physics underlying image degradations. In this work, we redefine degradation understanding as a hierarchical structured prediction task, necessitating the concurrent estimation of degradation types, parameter keys, and their continuous physical values. Although these sub-tasks operate in disparate spaces, we prove that they can be unified under one autoregressive next-token prediction paradigm, whose error is bounded by the value-space quantization grid. Building on this insight, we introduce DU-VLM, a multimodal chain-of-thought model trained with supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning using structured rewards. Furthermore, we show that DU-VLM can serve as a zero-shot controller for pre-trained diffusion models, enabling high-fidelity image restoration without fine-tuning the generative backbone. We also introduce \\textbf{DU-110k}, a large-scale dataset comprising 110,000 clean-degraded pairs with grounded physical annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms generalist baselines in both accuracy and robustness, exhibiting generalization to unseen distributions."

Starting from the streamwise momentum equation, we derive exact integral equations that relate the square plane-average and the square fluctuating WSS to wall-normal integrals of terms combining shear with acceleration, shear with pressure-radient, and shear with viscous diffusion. The square plane-average WSS can be well approximated by the product of plane-average shear and plane-average acceleration integrated over the buffer layer with corrections from the mean pressure gradient which diminish as the reciprocal of the Reynolds number. The square fluctuating WSS is similarly well approximated by the shear-acceleration and shear-pressure-gradient covariances integrated over the buffer layer, but the latter increases in magnitude with Reynolds number and is therefore not negligible. The acceleration fluctuations around the plane-average acceleration consist of a local Eulerian fluctuating acceleration, an advective acceleration and a term which gives rise a turbulence production contribution to the shear-acceleration covariance. By Taylor's frozen turbulence hypothesis the Eulerian acceleration and the streamwise mean advection part of the advective acceleration cancel each other. The shear-acceleration covariance is characterised by a near-wall peak which results from turbulence production and, more specifically, sweeps."

    "abstract": "Weight tying is widely used in compact language models to reduce parameters by sharing the token table between the input embedding and the output projection. However, weight sharing does not guarantee a stable token interface: during training, the correspondence between encoding tokens into hidden states and decoding hidden states into logits can drift, worsening optimization sensitivity and making post-training interventions such as editing, patching, and lightweight adaptation less predictable. We propose Pseudo-Inverse Tying (PIT), which synchronizes embedding and unembedding as coupled projections of a shared latent token memory, guaranteeing a pseudo-inverse-consistent interface throughout training. PIT maintains an orthonormal shared memory, obtained by thin polar decomposition for teacher initialization or random orthonormal initialization from scratch, and introduces a fully learned symmetric positive definite hidden-space transform parameterized via a Cholesky factor. The output head applies this transform to hidden states before the vocabulary projection, while the embedding applies the inverse transform to token vectors using stable triangular solves, avoiding explicit pseudo-inverse recomputation and any vocabulary-sized auxiliary parameters. We evaluate PIT on on-device models spanning 256M-1.3B parameters across pretraining and adaptation, and consistently observe improved training stability, stronger layerwise semantic consistency, and substantially reduced side effects."

In this paper, we introduce the R package mmcmcBayes, which implements a multistage Markov chain Monte Carlo procedure for region-level detection of differentially methylated regions. The method models sample-wise regional methylation summaries using the alpha-skew generalized normal distribution and evaluates evidence for differential methylation between groups through Bayes factors. We use a multistage region-splitting strategy to refine candidate regions based on statistical evidence. We describe the underlying methodology and software implementation, and illustrate its performance through simulation studies and applications to Illumina 450K methylation data. The mmcmcBayes package provides a practical region-level alternative to existing CpG-based differentially methylated regions detection methods and includes supporting functions for summarizing, comparing, and visualizing detected regions."

I develop a driven-equation formulation where the source term is confined to the real axis, avoiding the need to analytically continue nuclear potentials into the complex plane. The method is validated on nucleon-nucleus scattering (n+$^{40}$Ca at $E_{\\text{lab}}=20$~MeV) with 21 partial waves, achieving phase shift accuracy of $Δδ< 0.1^\\circ$ for most channels when compared to conventional solvers. I further demonstrate the approach on heavy-ion scattering ($^6$Li+$^{208}$Pb at 40~MeV) with 41 partial waves and strong Coulomb effects. This work establishes the foundation for extending PINNs to inverse problems where end-to-end differentiability enables direct fitting of optical potential parameters, coupled-channel reactions, and few-body scattering where traditional grid methods face exponential scaling."

We structure these updates so that the main work at each BnB node reduces to batched matrix-vector operations with a shared data matrix, enabling fine-grained parallelism across coordinates and coarse-grained parallelism across many BnB nodes on a single GPU. Feasible solutions (upper bounds) are generated by a projected gradient method on the active support, implemented in a batched fashion so that many candidate supports are updated in parallel on the GPU. We discuss practical design choices such as memory layout, batching strategies, and load balancing across nodes that are crucial for obtaining good utilization on modern GPUs. On synthetic and real high-dimensional datasets, our GPU-based approach achieves clear runtime improvements over a CPU implementation of our method, an existing specialized BnB method, and commercial MIP solvers."

    "abstract": "Conspiracy theories can threaten society by spreading misinformation, deepening polarization, and eroding trust in democratic institutions. Social media often fuels the spread of conspiracies, primarily driven by two key actors: Superspreaders -- influential individuals disseminating conspiracy content at disproportionately high rates, and Bots -- automated accounts designed to amplify conspiracies strategically. To counter the spread of conspiracy theories, it is critical to both identify these actors and to better understand their behavior. However, a systematic analysis of these actors as well as real-world-applicable identification methods are still lacking. In this study, we leverage over seven million tweets from the COVID-19 pandemic to analyze key differences between Human Superspreaders and Bots across dimensions such as linguistic complexity, toxicity, and hashtag usage. Our analysis reveals distinct communication strategies: Superspreaders tend to use more complex language and substantive content while relying less on structural elements like hashtags and emojis, likely to enhance credibility and authority. By contrast, Bots favor simpler language and strategic cross-usage of hashtags, likely to increase accessibility, facilitate infiltration into trending discussions, and amplify reach. To counter both Human Superspreaders and Bots, we propose and evaluate 27 novel metrics for quantifying the severity of conspiracy theory spread. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of an adapted H-Index for computationally feasible identification of Human Superspreaders. By identifying behavioral patterns unique to Human Superspreaders and Bots as well as providing suitable identification methods, this study provides a foundation for mitigation strategies, including platform moderation policies, temporary and permanent account suspensions, and public awareness campaigns."

This approach provides a computationally efficient path to modeling complex transport problems. We apply this framework to the canonical problem of test particle drag in a uniform plasma. The GLE formalism is shown to naturally capture non-Markovian phenomena through the moments of the kernel, including an effective mass renormalization and oscillatory relaxation. We demonstrate that the standard Chandrasekhar stopping power formula arises naturally as the Markovian limit of this equilibrium memory kernel. These theoretical predictions are quantitatively validated by direct Particle-in-Cell simulations, which confirm the predicted oscillatory structure of the memory kernel. This work thus establishes a practical method for predicting non-equilibrium transport properties from first-principles equilibrium simulations."

We consider ensembles of initial system states including pure and mixed Haar-random states, ensembles with fixed average energy or fixed mixedness, and varying initial photon numbers in the environment. In all cases, we observe a positive correlation between the initial entanglement and the entropy growth, although the fractional contribution of the initial entanglement varies. Our results emphasize the role of intrasystem correlations as a factor contributing to entropy growth in quantum informational processes."

Bayesian optimization is employed to adaptively construct accurate Gaussian process surrogate models using a minimal number of high-fidelity model evaluations, strategically focusing sampling in regions of high predictive uncertainty. The trained surrogate model is then leveraged within a Bayesian inversion scheme to infer optimal parameter values by combining prior knowledge with observed quantities of interest, resulting in posterior distributions that rigorously characterize epistemic uncertainty. The framework is theoretically grounded, computationally efficient, and particularly suited for engineering applications in which high-fidelity models -- whether arising from numerical simulations or physical experiments -- are computationally expensive, analytically intractable, or difficult to replicate, and data availability is limited. Furthermore, the combined use of Bayesian optimization and inversion outperforms their separate application, highlighting the synergistic benefits of unifying the two approaches. The performance of the proposed Bayesian framework is demonstrated on a suite of one- and two-dimensional analytical benchmarks, including the Mixed Gaussian-Periodic, Lévy, Griewank, Forrester, and Rosenbrock functions, which provide a controlled setting to assess surrogate modeling accuracy, parameter inference robustness, and uncertainty quantification. The results demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in efficiently solving inverse problems while providing informative uncertainty quantification and supporting reliable engineering decision-making at reduced computational cost."

The defect nature of these line defects significantly affects the properties of the network, but they have not been fully characterized to date. Here, we use scanning transmission electron microscopy combined with atomistic computer simulations to investigate a triple junction at the atomic scale in an Al thin film with {111} texture. Using sampling methods, we were able to construct the same junction structure as in the experiment within a computer model. We present a technique to calculate the Burgers vector of the triple junction. This allows us to connect the junction's dislocation character to the microscopic degrees of freedom of the joining grain boundaries. The junction line energy in the computer model can then be calculated using an embedded atom method potential. It follows the same laws as a bulk dislocation. Finally, we discovered a range of possible triple junctions for the observed grain boundaries, which vary in the magnitude of their Burgers vector. Interestingly, the experimentally observed junction is not the one with the smallest possible Burgers vector and energy. This suggests that the kinetics of transforming the junction line are likely too slow to be driven by the small energy contribution of the triple junction."

Since this preference is in general not unique, there is no safeguard against it misaligning with that of a decision maker. What enables the verification of such AI alignment is interpretations satisfying double monotonicity. Indeed, double monotonicity ensures full identifiability and internal consistency. But, an additional idempotence property is required to guarantee that recommendations are fully rational and remain grounded within the original feasible set."

Random access to such strings in strongly sublogarithmic time is impossible in the worst case, but previous authors have shown how to support faster access to specific characters and their neighbourhoods. In this paper we explore whether, since better compression can impede access, we can support faster access to relatively incompressible substrings of highly compressed strings. We first show how, given a run-length compressed straight-line program (RLSLP) of size $g_{rl}$ or a block tree of size $L$, we can build an $O (g_{rl})$-space or an $O (L)$-space data structure, respectively, that supports access to any character in time logarithmic in the length of the longest repeated substring containing that character. That is, the more incongruous a character is with respect to the characters around it in a certain sense, the faster we can support access to it. We then prove a similar but more powerful and sophisticated result for parsings in which phrases' sources do not overlap much larger phrases, with the query time depending also on the number of phrases we must copy from their sources to obtain the queried character."

    "abstract": "Robotic manipulation in unstructured environments requires planners to reason jointly about free-space motion and sustained, frictional contact with the environment. Existing (local) planning and simulation frameworks typically separate these regimes or rely on simplified contact representations, particularly when modeling non-convex or distributed contact patches. Such approximations limit the fidelity of contact-mode transitions and hinder the robust execution of contact-rich behaviors in real time. This paper presents a unified discrete-time modeling framework for robotic manipulation that consistently captures both free motion and frictional contact within a single mathematical formalism (Unicomp). Building on complementarity-based rigid-body dynamics, we formulate free-space motion and contact interactions as coupled linear and nonlinear complementarity problems, enabling principled transitions between contact modes without enforcing fixed-contact assumptions. For planar patch contact, we derive a frictional contact model from the maximum power dissipation principle in which the set of admissible contact wrenches is represented by an ellipsoidal limit surface. This representation captures coupled force-moment effects, including torsional friction, while remaining agnostic to the underlying pressure distribution across the contact patch. The resulting formulation yields a discrete-time predictive model that relates generalized velocities and contact wrenches through quadratic constraints and is suitable for real-time optimization-based planning. Experimental results show that the proposed approach enables stable, physically consistent behavior at interactive speeds across tasks, from planar pushing to contact-rich whole-body maneuvers."

In this paper, we introduce OSCAgent, a multi-agent framework for OSC molecular discovery that unifies retrieval-augmented design, molecular generation, and systematic evaluation into a continuously improving pipeline, without requiring additional human intervention. OSCAgent comprises three collaborative agents. The Planner retrieves knowledge from literature-curated molecules and prior candidates to guide design directions. The Generator proposes new OSC acceptors aligned with these plans. The Experimenter performs comprehensive evaluation of candidate molecules and provides feedback for refinement. Experiments show that OSCAgent produces chemically valid, synthetically accessible OSC molecules and achieves superior predicted performance compared to both traditional and large language model (LLM)-only baselines. Representative results demonstrate that some candidates achieve predicted efficiencies approaching 18\\%. The code will be publicly available."

    "abstract": "The tunability of anomalous Hall and Nernst conductivities is investigated in the compensated ferrimagnet Mn$_3$Al under isotropic strain ($η$) and chemical potential variation using first-principles calculations. At a chemical potential of $μ= -0.3$ eV, three distinct topological features -- Weyl points, nodal lines, and gapped nodal lines -- are simultaneously realized along high-symmetry directions of the Brillouin zone in the framework of magnetic space group. The anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) is found to be predominantly governed by the Berry curvature in the $k_y k_z$ plane and can be enhanced significantly under tensile strain, reaching $-1200$ $(Ω~\\mathrm{cm})^{-1}$. On the other hand, the anomalous Nernst conductivity (ANC) shows a sign change near the Fermi level and whose magnitude increases at $μ= -0.3$ eV with quasi-quadratic strain dependence. Regardless of strain, the underlying bands and Fermi surface structures remain robust, while the distribution and magnitude of Berry curvature evolve substantially. These results underscore the potential of Mn$_3$Al, a compensated ferrimagnet, as a platform for Berry curvature engineering via strain and doping."

The setup excites the sample with a laser and acquires a spectrum at each spatial coordinate in a raster scan pattern. A double-acquisition method is used to remove cosmic ray artifacts by comparing subsequent measurements at the same spatial coordinate. Once identified, the emitter is further characterized via a HBT setup, thereby measuring lifetime as well as second-order autocorrelation g(2) measurements to confirm singlephoton emission. The system integrates Python-based hardware control for motorized stages, spectrometer acquisition, and post-processing, with a migration to a galvo-mirror scanning approach for using it along with a cryostat for low temperature measurements. Our results demonstrate spatially resolved PL maps and temperature-dependent spectra, highlighting the capability of the setup to efficiently benchmark SPE performance. We further went on to perform automation of other experiments such as a Non-Linear Interferometry setup for Quantum Imaging with Undetected Light and a Fourier Transform Imaging Spectroscopy using a common path birefringence Interferometer to obtain hyperspectral images of our samples."

The magnetic easy axis of FePt layer undergoes a transition from in-plane to perpendicular direction upon ferroelectric polarization reversal, a process sensitively controlled by epitaxial strain with threshold strain strain($η$) $η\\approx\\%$. At this phenomena, a large interfacial magnetoelectric coupling ($α_I = 3.6 \\times 10^{-10}$ G$\\cdot$cm$^2$/V) is responsible, stemming from the orbital reconstruction. In particular, the redistribution of Pt-$d$ orbital occupancy alters spin-orbit coupling, thereby tuning the competition between magnetic anisotropy ($K_i$) and magnetoelastic energy ($b_1$). Our work clarifies the fundamental physics of strain-engineered magnetoelectricity and suggests a concrete pathway for designing ultra-low-power voltage-controlled magnetic memory."

Rather than following a fixed pipeline, ReThinker dynamically allocates computation based on model confidence, enabling adaptive tool invocation, guided multi-dimensional reflection, and robust confidence-weighted selection. To support scalable training without human annotation, we further propose a reverse data synthesis pipeline and an adaptive trajectory recycling strategy that transform successful reasoning traces into high-quality supervision.

This paper addresses this gap through content analysis of 4352 messages exchanged longitudinally between 38 university students and an LLM-based wellbeing coach. Our results provide a fine-grained view into how users naturally shape, steer, and sometimes struggle within supportive human-AI dialogue, revealing patterns of user-led direction, guidance-seeking, and emotional expression.

These observations offer important insights into the equation of state of dense nuclear matter. Recently, Fornal and Grinstein, in order to overcame the discrepancy between the neutron lifetime measured in beam and bottle experiments, proposed the existence of neutron dark decay. In the present work, an effort is made to connect the interpretation of the above exotic compact objects with the possible existence of dark particles, assumed to be products of neutron dark decay. Our hypothesis offers an advantage over comparable proposals, as the coexistence of dark matter and hadronic matter within neutron stars emerges from an intrinsic mechanism, thereby obviating the need to invoke external merger-related processes. It is still unclear to what extent the proposed dark decay of the neutron is affected by the extreme environment within neutron stars. Within this framework, we examined the case in which a mechanism suppressing the dark neutron decay becomes operative at densities few times above nuclear saturation density. We found that the proposed alternative explanation accommodates the simultaneous existence of neutron dark decay while consistently predicting both the two solar mass limit and the presence of compact objects with subsolar masses."

It reached the maximum light at about 27~d after the explosion and the light curve shows a broad, luminous peak with an absolute $r$-band magnitude of $M_{r} = -18.48 \\pm 0.16$~mag. At about 50~d after maximum light, SN~2017ati exhibits a decline rate close to that expected from the $^{56}$Co $\\rightarrow$ $^{56}$Fe radioactive decay, at 0.98 mag per 100 days, as usually observed in SNe IIb. However, it remains systematically brighter at late times by about 1--2~mag, exceeding the usual upper luminosity range of this class. As a result, modelling the light curve of SN~2017ati with a standard $^{56}$Ni decay scenario requires a large nickel mass of up to $\\sim0.37\\,M_{\\odot}$ and still fails to reproduce the early-time light curve adequately. In contrast, incorporating additional energy input from a magnetar yields a significantly improved fit to the light curve of SN~2017ati, which would reduce the nickel mass to $\\sim0.21\\,M_{\\odot}$, still close to the upper end of the range typically inferred for SNe~IIb. Comparing the fitted results of SN~2017ati with the known sample of SNe~IIb indicates that its luminosity evolution is best explained by a combination of neutron star spin-down energy and radioactive nickel deposition. From late-time nebular spectra of SN~2017ati, the luminosity of the [\\Oi]~$λ\\lambda6300,6364$ doublet implies an oxygen mass of $\\sim1.82-3.34\\,M_{\\odot}$, and the combination of a [\\Caii]/[\\Oi] flux ratio of $\\sim0.5$ with nebular spectral model comparisons favours a progenitor zero-age main-sequence mass of $\\geq17\\,M_{\\odot}$."

These results establish a universality principle for spiked tensor models, demonstrating that their high-dimensional spectral behavior and statistical limits are robust to non-Gaussian noise. Our analysis relies on resolvent methods from random matrix theory, cumulant expansions valid under finite moment assumptions, and variance bounds based on Efron-Stein-type arguments. A key challenge in the proof is how to handle the statistical dependence between the signal term and the noise term."

Continuing with the unified implementation of non-relativistic and relativistic wave functions methods within the MetaWave platform (J. Phys. Chem. A. 2025, 129, 5170), we present here a unified MPI parallelization of the methods by abstracting ever computational step of a method as a dynamically-scheduled loop via ghost process, followed by a global reduction of local results from each node. The algorithmic abstraction enables the use of a single MPI template in various steps of different methods. Taking iCIPT2 [J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2021, 17, 949] as a showcase, the parallel efficiencies achieve 94% and 89% on 16 nodes (1024 cores) for the perturbation and whole calculations, respectively. Further combined with an improved algorithm for the matrix-vector product in the matrix diagonalization and an orbital-configuration-based semi-stochastic estimator for the perturbation correction, this renders large active space calculations possible, so as to obtain benchmarks for the automerization of cyclobutadiene, ground state energy of benzene and potential energy profile of ozone. It is also shown that the error of iCIPT2 follows a power law with respect to the number of configuration state functions."

Here we investigate the electronic and magnetic properties induced by 60° dislocations in Ge. Using large-scale DFT calculations, we determine the band structure for both the shuffle and glide sets in their lowest-energy configurations. We also perform charged-defect calculations to aid in the interpretation of complex photoluminescence spectra observed in epitaxial Ge layers. The band structure for the shuffle set reveals defect-induced dispersive bands localized within the band gap near the Γ point, whereas for the glide set, we observe strong overlap with the conduction band. Defect-induced band splitting evident away from Γ reveals Rashba-Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling, an effect previously reported only for screw dislocations. Remarkably, we find evidence that specific dislocation arrangements can stabilize antiferromagnetic ordering with sizable local magnetic moments and considerable exchange splitting between opposite spin states. These results uncover rich physics in Ge dislocations through the combination of spin-orbit coupling and magnetic ordering, potentially enabling novel defect-based functionalities in Ge devices."

They not only incorporate open-world knowledge from large language models (LLMs) but also compress the semantic space to reduce generation difficulty. However, existing methods suffer from two major limitations: (1) the lack of contextual awareness in generation tasks leads to a gap between the Semantic ID codebook space and the generation space, resulting in suboptimal recommendations; and (2) suboptimal quantization methods exacerbate semantic loss in LLMs. To address these issues, we propose Dual-Flow Orthogonal Semantic IDs (DOS) method. Specifically, DOS employs a user-item dual flow-framework that leverages collaborative signals to align the Semantic ID codebook space with the generation space. Furthermore, we introduce an orthogonal residual quantization scheme that rotates the semantic space to an appropriate orientation, thereby maximizing semantic preservation. Extensive offline experiments and online A/B testing demonstrate the effectiveness of DOS.

We aim to characterize how LLMs navigate value trade-offs across different advice-seeking contexts. First, we examine the value trade-off structure underlying advice seeking using a curated dataset from four advice-oriented subreddits. Using a bottom-up approach, we inductively construct a hierarchical value framework by aggregating fine-grained values extracted from individual advice options into higher-level value categories. We construct value co-occurrence networks to characterize how values co-occur within dilemmas and find substantial heterogeneity in value trade-off structures across advice-seeking contexts: a women-focused subreddit exhibits the highest network density, indicating more complex value conflicts; women's, men's, and friendship-related subreddits exhibit highly correlated value-conflict patterns centered on security-related tensions (security vs. respect/connection/commitment); by contrast, career advice forms a distinct structure where security frequently clashes with self-actualization and growth. We then evaluate LLM value preferences against these dilemmas and find that, across models and contexts, LLMs consistently prioritize values related to Exploration & Growth over Benevolence & Connection. This systemically skewed value orientation highlights a potential risk of value homogenization in AI-mediated advice, raising concerns about how such systems may shape decision-making and normative outcomes at scale."

While recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have endowed segmentation systems with reasoning capabilities, these efforts remain confined by the frozen internal knowledge of MLLMs, which limits their potential for real-world scenarios that involve up-to-date information or domain-specific concepts. In this work, we propose \\textbf{Seg-ReSearch}, a novel segmentation paradigm that overcomes the knowledge bottleneck of existing approaches. By enabling interleaved reasoning and external search, Seg-ReSearch empowers segmentation systems to handle dynamic, open-world queries that extend beyond the frozen knowledge of MLLMs. To effectively train this capability, we introduce a hierarchical reward design that harmonizes initial guidance with progressive incentives, mitigating the dilemma between sparse outcome signals and rigid step-wise supervision. For evaluation, we construct OK-VOS, a challenging benchmark that explicitly requires outside knowledge for video object segmentation. Experiments on OK-VOS and two existing reasoning segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that our Seg-ReSearch improves state-of-the-art approaches by a substantial margin.

    "abstract": "Structured light offers a promising solution for the increasing data demands of modern optical networks, opening up new degrees of freedom that can be leveraged for greater channel capacity and more bits per photon. However, its implementation is hindered by real-world distortions, for example, atmospheric turbulence in free-space, with severe and rapidly evolving phase perturbations that alter the amplitude, phase and vectorial polarization structure of the beam. Here, we demonstrate that optical topologies in the form of skyrmions are highly resilient to the effects of real-world atmospheric turbulence. We create and transmit these particle-like topologies of light through a 270~m free-space optical link, revealing their robustness across a wide variety of conditions and turbulence strengths. While we observe severe distortion in the states' underlying degrees of freedom, we show that the topological numbers are preserved in all cases. We account for fast changes to the medium, where the channel produces statistically averaged outcomes, by probing the state's decoherence, showing that while the degree of polarisation consequently decays, the topology remains intact. Using topology, we show information can be transmitted through the channel with almost perfect fidelity (>98%) in most cases, only decreasing to 86% in the most severe conditions tested. Our work is the first to demonstrate the potential for optical topologies as reliable and robust information carriers in a real-world environment and points to the potential for other complex channels too, offering attractive features for classical and quantum communication alike."

    "abstract": "We study how changes in population size and fluctuating environmental conditions influence the establishment of seed banks in plants. Our model is a modification of the Wright-Fisher model with seed bank, introduced by Kaj, Krone and Lascoux. We distinguish between wild type individuals, producing only nondormant seeds, and mutants, producing seeds with dormancy. To understand how changing population size shapes the establishment of seed banks, we analyse the process under a diffusive scaling. The results support the biological insight that seed banks are favoured in a declining population, and disfavoured if population size is constant or increasing. The surprise is that this is true even when population sizes are changing very slowly -- over evolutionary timescales. We also investigate the influence of short-term fluctuations, such as annual variations in rainfall or temperature. Mathematically, our analysis reduces to a stochastic dynamical system forced onto a manifold by a large drift, which converges under scaling to a diffusion on the manifold. Inspired by the Lyapunov--Schmidt reduction, we derive an explicit formula for the limiting diffusion coefficients by projecting the system onto its linear counterpart.

    "abstract": "Accurate monitoring of the hydrogen concentration is critical for optimizing fuel cell performance, minimizing purge losses, and reducing long-term degradation. Conventional hydrogen sensors often rely on catalytic materials and face limitations such as the need of oxygen purging when operated in fuel cell environments. Here, we report the discovery of a novel hydrogen-sensing mechanism based on organic molecules, without the use of catalytic metals. The sensor is based on a typical vertical stack geometry, containing $\\mathrm{Alq_3}$ as active organic material. Upon exposure to hydrogen, the device shows an increase in resistivity, yielding a reliable sensor signal that varies linearly with hydrogen concentration, temperature, and humidity, and exhibits a relative response of up to 3.5 % at 100 %vol hydrogen. By exposing the sensor to an external magnetic field, the rise and fall times of the sensor response were found to be tunable. This novel organic sensor demonstrates sensitivity across a wide range of hydrogen concentrations under fuel cell-relevant conditions and beyond. This new class of hydrogen sensors with high miniaturization potential and cost efficiency paves the way for real-time hydrogen monitoring and advanced control strategies in fuel cells, the chemical industry, or energy storage applications."

    "abstract": "Negative orientable sequences, i.e. periodic sequences with elements from a finite alphabet of size at least three in which an n-tuple or the negative of its reverse appears at most once in a period of the sequence, were introduced by Alhakim et al. in 2024. The main goal in defining them was as a means of generating orientable sequences, which have automatic position location applications, although they are potentially of interest in their own right. In this paper we develop new upper bounds on the period of negative orientable sequences, which are significantly sharper then the previous known bound for n>2. The approach used to develop the new bounds involves examining the nodes in the subgraph of the de Bruijn graph corresponding to a negative orientable sequence, and to consider the implications of the fact that the in-degree of every vertex in this subgraph must equal the out-degree. However, despite improving the bounds, a gap remains between the largest known period for a negative orientable sequence and the corresponding bounds for every n>2."

Two complementary approaches (i) taking the extremal limit of non-extremal solutions and (ii) working directly in the extremal background, yield consistent results. We find that, contrary to naive extrapolation of the Maldacena-Shenker-Stanford (MSS) chaos bound, the Lyapunov exponent remains positive even at zero temperature. For Reissner-Nordström black holes, chaos diminishes but persists at extremality, while for Kerr black holes it strengthens with increasing spin. These results demonstrate that extremal black holes exhibit residual chaotic dynamics that violate the MSS bound, establishing them as qualitatively distinct dynamical phases of gravity."

    "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning (RL) has enabled Large Language Models (LLMs) to acquire increasingly complex reasoning and agentic behaviors. In this work, we propose two simple techniques to improve policy gradient algorithms for LLMs. First, we replace the fixed anchor policy during RL with an Exponential Moving Average (EMA), similar to a target network in deep Q-learning. Second, we introduce Top-k KL estimator, which allows for flexible interpolation between exact KL and sampled KL. We derive the stability conditions for using EMA anchor; moreover, we show that our Top-k KL estimator yields both unbiased KL values and unbiased gradients at any k, while bringing the benefits of exact KL. When combined with GRPO, the two techniques (EMA-PG) lead to a significant performance boost. On math reasoning, it allows R1-distilled Qwen-1.5B to reach 53.9% on OlympiadBench compared to 50.8% by GRPO. On agentic RL domains, with Qwen-3B base, EMA-PG improves GRPO by an average of 33.3% across 7 datasets of Q&A with search engines, including 29.7% $\\rightarrow$ 44.1% on HotpotQA, 27.4% $\\rightarrow$ 40.1% on 2WikiMultiHopQA.

Second, we perform online distillation to transfer the teacher's robust control capabilities into a transformer-based student policy that operates on sparse root-relative 3D joint keypoint trajectories. By combining history-conditioned adaptation with online distillation, HoRD enables a single policy to adapt zero-shot to unseen domains without per-domain retraining. Extensive experiments show HoRD outperforms strong baselines in robustness and transfer, especially under unseen domains and external perturbations.

This has been performed for two gluon-sensitive observables: the gluon Green's function and the strong running coupling constant. In this contribution, we propose to study a fermionic observable, the pion electromagnetic form factor, for which instanton liquid model predictions have been discussed in Phys.Rev.D 109, 074029. We use the Wilson flow to single out the dominant contribution from the instantons out of a lattice QCD configuration ensemble.

Through an information-theoretic lens, we prove a characterization of the utility-separation Pareto frontier, establish its concavity, and thereby prove the increasing marginal cost of separation in terms of utility. In addition, we characterize the conditions under which this trade-off becomes strict, providing a guide for trade-off selection in practice. Based on the theoretical characterization, we develop an empirical regularizer based on conditional mutual information (CMI) between predictions and sensitive attributes given the true outcome. The CMI regularizer is compatible with any deep model trained via gradient-based optimization and serves as a scalar monitor of residual separation violations, offering tractable guarantees during training. Finally, numerical experiments support our theoretical findings: across COMPAS, UCI Adult, UCI Bank, and CelebA, the proposed method substantially reduces separation violations while matching or exceeding the utility of established baseline methods. This study thus offers a provable, stable, and flexible approach to enforcing separation in deep learning."

Recent diffusion-based restoration methods commonly adapt pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models, where the variational autoencoder (VAE) can significantly bottleneck restoration fidelity. We propose LCUDiff, a stable one-step framework that upgrades a pre-trained latent diffusion model from the 4-channel latent space to the 16-channel latent space. For VAE fine-tuning, channel splitting distillation (CSD) is used to keep the first four channels aligned with pre-trained priors while allocating the additional channels to effectively encode high-frequency details. We further design prior-preserving adaptation (PPA) to smoothly bridge the mismatch between 4-channel diffusion backbones and the higher-dimensional 16-channel latent. In addition, we propose a decoder router (DeR) for per-sample decoder routing using restoration-quality score annotations, which improves visual quality across diverse conditions. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show competitive results with higher fidelity and fewer artifacts under mild degradations, while preserving one-step efficiency.

Recently, some MMIF methods incorporate frequency domain information to enhance spatial features. However, these methods typically rely on simple serial or parallel spatial-frequency fusion without interaction. In this paper, we propose a novel Interactive Spatial-Frequency Fusion Mamba (ISFM) framework for MMIF. Specifically, we begin with a Modality-Specific Extractor (MSE) to extract features from different modalities. It models long-range dependencies across the image with linear computational complexity. To effectively leverage frequency information, we then propose a Multi-scale Frequency Fusion (MFF). It adaptively integrates low-frequency and high-frequency components across multiple scales, enabling robust representations of frequency features. More importantly, we further propose an Interactive Spatial-Frequency Fusion (ISF). It incorporates frequency features to guide spatial features across modalities, enhancing complementary representations. Extensive experiments are conducted on six MMIF datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our ISFM can achieve better performances than other state-of-the-art methods. The source code is available at https://github.com/Namn23/ISFM."

This bound is optimal. Our result strictly extends the result of Karthick and Maffary \\cite{KM19} on even-hole-free graphs without induced 6-vertex paths, and implies that even-hole-free graphs without induced 7-vertex paths satisfy Reed's Conjecture. Our proof relies on a heavy structural analysis on a maximal substructure called a nice blowup of a five-cycle and can be viewed for graphs in which all holes are of length five (graphs with all holes having the same length gain increasing interest in recent years \\cite{COOK202496}). Our result gives a partial answer to a conjecture of Wang and Wu \\cite{WW25} on graphs in which all holes are of length 5.

Inspired by the entropy reduction hypothesis (ERH), we recognize that constituent boundaries offer greater opportunities for uncertainty reduction, which motivates us to employ entropy analysis for identifying constituent boundaries. Therefore, we propose Swordsman, an entropy-driven adaptive block-wise decoding framework for DLMs. Swordsman adaptively partitions blocks by identifying entropy shifts between adjacent tokens to better align with semantic or syntactic constituent boundaries. In addition, Swordsman dynamically adjusts unmasking thresholds conditioned on the real-time unmasking status within a block, further improving both efficiency and stability. As a training-free framework, supported by KV Cache, Swordsman demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across extensive evaluations."

To address these challenges, we propose a framework for detecting stereotype-inducing words and attributing neuron-level bias in LLMs, without the need for fine-tuning or prompt modification. Our framework first identifies stereotype-inducing adjectives and nouns via comparative analysis across demographic groups. We then attribute biased behavior to specific neurons using two attribution strategies based on integrated gradients. Finally, we mitigate bias by directly intervening on their activations at the projection layer. Experiments on three widely used LLMs demonstrate that our method effectively reduces bias while preserving overall model performance.

Guided by these constructions, we develop an analytical proof establishing the lower bound."

    "abstract": "Visual AutoRegressive (VAR) modeling has garnered significant attention for its innovative next-scale prediction paradigm. However, mainstream VAR paradigms attend to all tokens across historical scales at each autoregressive step. As the next scale resolution grows, the computational complexity of attention increases quartically with resolution, causing substantial latency. Prior accelerations often skip high-resolution scales, which speeds up inference but discards high-frequency details and harms image quality. To address these problems, we present SparVAR, a training-free acceleration framework that exploits three properties of VAR attention: (i) strong attention sinks, (ii) cross-scale activation similarity, and (iii) pronounced locality. Specifically, we dynamically predict the sparse attention pattern of later high-resolution scales from a sparse decision scale, and construct scale self-similar sparse attention via an efficient index-mapping mechanism, enabling high-efficiency sparse attention computation at large scales. Furthermore, we propose cross-scale local sparse attention and implement an efficient block-wise sparse kernel, which achieves $\\mathbf{> 5\\times}$ faster forward speed than FlashAttention. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed SparseVAR can reduce the generation time of an 8B model producing $1024\\times1024$ high-resolution images to the 1s, without skipping the last scales. Compared with the VAR baseline accelerated by FlashAttention, our method achieves a $\\mathbf{1.57\\times}$ speed-up while preserving almost all high-frequency details.

Here we implement a method based on the population dynamics algorithm for studying large deviations of time-integrated local currents in the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP), which is a pragmatic model in the 1D KPZ class. Carrying out simulations for the three representative initial conditions, namely step, flat, and stationary ones, we not only confirm theoretical predictions available for the step case, but also characterize large deviations for the flat and stationary cases which have not been investigated before. We reveal in particular an unexpected robustness of the deeply negative large deviation regime with respect to different initial conditions. We attribute this robustness to the spontaneous formation of a wedge shape in interface profile. Our population dynamics approach may serve as a versatile method for studying large deviations in the KPZ class numerically and, potentially, even experimentally."

To address these limitations, we propose \\textbf{VecSet-Edit}, the first pipeline that leverages the high-fidelity VecSet Large Reconstruction Model (LRM) as a backbone for mesh editing. Our approach is grounded on a analysis of the spatial properties in VecSet tokens, revealing that token subsets govern distinct geometric regions.

Also, considering the difference between VecSet diffusion process versus voxel we design a Drift-aware Token Pruning to reject geometric outliers during the denoising process.

In such instances, analyzing the interaction of these different sources of inexactness can give insight into how the precisions of various computations should be chosen in order to ``balance'' the errors, potentially improving performance without a noticeable decrease in accuracy.

    "abstract": "We present Neural Memory Object (NeMO), a novel object-centric representation that can be used to detect, segment and estimate the 6DoF pose of objects unseen during training using RGB images. Our method consists of an encoder that requires only a few RGB template views depicting an object to generate a sparse object-like point cloud using a learned UDF containing semantic and geometric information. Next, a decoder takes the object encoding together with a query image to generate a variety of dense predictions. Through extensive experiments, we show that our method can be used for few-shot object perception without requiring any camera-specific parameters or retraining on target data. Our proposed concept of outsourcing object information in a NeMO and using a single network for multiple perception tasks enhances interaction with novel objects, improving scalability and efficiency by enabling quick object onboarding without retraining or extensive pre-processing. We report competitive and state-of-the-art results on various datasets and perception tasks of the BOP benchmark, demonstrating the versatility of our approach. https://github.com/DLR-RM/nemo"

    "abstract": "This experience report presents a model-driven approach to legacy system modernization that inserts an enriched, technology-agnostic intermediate model between the legacy codebase and the modern target platform, and reports on its application and evaluation. The four-stage process of analysis, enrichment, synthesis, and transition systematically extracts, abstracts, and transforms system artifacts. We apply our approach to a large industrial application built on legacy versions of the .NET Framework and ASP.NET MVC and show that core user interface components and page structures can be migrated semi-automatically to a modern web stack while preserving functional behavior and essential non-functional qualities. By consolidating architectural knowledge into explicit model representations, the resulting codebase exhibits higher maintainability and extensibility, thereby improving developer experience. Although automation is effective for standard patterns, migration of bespoke layout composites remains challenging and requires targeted manual adaptation. Our contributions are: (i) an end-to-end model-driven process, (ii) an enriched intermediate model that captures structure, dependencies, and semantic metadata, (iii) transformation rules that preserve functional behavior and essential non-functional qualities, and (iv) application and evaluation of the approach in an industrial setting. Overall, model-based abstractions reduce risk and effort while supporting scalable, traceable modernization of legacy applications. Our approach generalizes to comparable modernization contexts and promotes reuse of migration patterns."

    "abstract": "Rao's spacing test is a widely used nonparametric method for assessing uniformity on the circle. However, its broader applicability in practical settings has been limited because the null distribution is not easily calculated. As a result, practitioners have traditionally depended on pre-tabulated critical values computed for a limited set of sample sizes, which restricts the flexibility and generality of the method. In this paper, we address this limitation by recursively computing higher-order moments of the Rao's spacing test statistic and employing the Gram-Charlier expansion to derive an accurate approximation to its null distribution. This approach allows for the efficient and direct computation of p-values for arbitrary sample sizes, thereby eliminating the dependency on existing critical value tables. Moreover, we confirm that our method remains accurate and effective even for large sample sizes that are not represented in current tables, thus overcoming a significant practical limitation. Comparative evaluations with published critical values and saddlepoint approximations demonstrate that our method achieves a high degree of accuracy across a wide range of sample sizes. These findings greatly improve the practicality and usability of Rao's spacing test in both theoretical investigations and applied statistical analyses."

    "abstract": "Large foundation models have shown strong open-world generalization to complex problems in vision and language, but similar levels of generalization have yet to be achieved in robotics. One fundamental challenge is that the models exhibit limited zero-shot capability, which hampers their ability to generalize effectively to unseen scenarios. In this work, we propose GeneralVLA (Generalizable Vision-Language-Action Models with Knowledge-Guided Trajectory Planning), a hierarchical vision-language-action (VLA) model that can be more effective in utilizing the generalization of foundation models, enabling zero-shot manipulation and automatically generating data for robotics. In particular, we study a class of hierarchical VLA model where the high-level ASM (Affordance Segmentation Module) is finetuned to perceive image keypoint affordances of the scene; the mid-level 3DAgent carries out task understanding, skill knowledge, and trajectory planning to produce a 3D path indicating the desired robot end-effector trajectory. The intermediate 3D path prediction is then served as guidance to the low-level, 3D-aware control policy capable of precise manipulation. Compared to alternative approaches, our method requires no real-world robotic data collection or human demonstration, making it much more scalable to diverse tasks and viewpoints. Empirically, GeneralVLA successfully generates trajectories for 14 tasks, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods such as VoxPoser. The generated demonstrations can train more robust behavior cloning policies than training with human demonstrations or from data generated by VoxPoser, Scaling-up, and Code-As-Policies. We believe GeneralVLA can be the scalable method for both generating data for robotics and solving novel tasks in a zero-shot setting. Code: https://github.com/AIGeeksGroup/GeneralVLA.

In phenomenological side, all possible couplings of interpolating current to hadronic states are considered, and the Dirac structure dependence on the form factors is systematically eliminated. In QCD side, our calculation incorporates both the perturbative part and the contributions from vacuum condensates up to dimension 8. This systematic inclusion of higher-dimensional terms accounts for a broader set of Feynman diagrams, thereby enhancing the comprehensiveness and reliability of the operator product expansion. Using the obtained form factors, we study the partial widths of semileptonic decays $Σ_b\\toΣ_cl\\barν_l$, $Ξ'_b\\toΞ'_cl\\barν_l$ and $Ω_b\\toΩ_cl\\barν_l$ ($l=e$, $μ$ and $τ$).

Unlike the switched LQR problem, where both inputs and mode sequences are optimized, we consider the case where switching is exogenous. For such systems, the number of possible mode sequences grows exponentially with time, making the exact computation of the value function intractable. This motivates the development of tractable bounds that approximate it. We propose a novel framework, based on path-complete graphs, for constructing computable upper bounds on the value function. In this framework, multiple quadratic functions are combined through a directed graph that encodes dynamic programming inequalities, yielding convex and sound formulations. For example, for switched linear systems with quadratic cost, we derive tractable LMI-based formulations and provide computational complexity bounds. We further establish approximation guarantees for the upper bounds and show asymptotic non-conservativeness using concepts from graph theory. Finally, we extend the approach to controller synthesis for systems with affine control inputs and demonstrate its effectiveness on numerical examples."

In this study, we report the spin-pumping experiments on a 2DEG formed on the (001)KTO surface via Ar$^+$ irradiation. We observed a significant increase in magnetic damping in the Ar$^+$-KTO/Py bilayer compared to a non-irradiated KTO/Py control sample, confirming spin pumping into the 2DEG. We demonstrate that the spin-mixing conductance ($g_{\\uparrow\\downarrow}^r$) can be substantially enhanced by controlling the Ar$^+$ irradiation time. The enhancement is attributed to increased 2DEG conductance, which results from a higher concentration of oxygen vacancies with longer irradiation times. This work provides crucial guidance for optimizing spin-to-charge conversion in KTO-based systems, highlighting the potential of Ar$^+$-irradiated KTO 2DEGs for future oxide spintronics."

However, systematic investigations of REE in two-dimensional (2D) materials remain scarce. To address this gap, we perform a comprehensive symmetry analysis based on the 80 crystallographic layer groups, elucidating the relationship between materials' symmetries and the geometric characteristics of the REE response tensor. Our analysis identifies 13 distinct symmetry classes for the tensor and reveals all potential material candidates. Considering the requirement of strong spin-orbit coupling for a large REE response, we screen the C2DB database and identify 54 promising 2D materials. First-principles calculations demonstrate that the largest REE response coefficients in these materials exceed those reported for other 2D systems by an order of magnitude, indicating exceptionally high CSC efficiency. Focusing on three representative materials, including HgI2, AgTlP2Se6 and BrGaTe, we show that their large response coefficients can be well explained by effective kp models and the characteristic spin textures around high-symmetry points in momentum space. This work provides a systematic framework and identifies high-performance candidates, paving the way for future exploration of REE-driven CSC in 2D materials."

    "abstract": "We take a more detailed look at the recently proposed magnetogenesis mechanism triggered by ultralight dark matter coupled to electromagnetism. The proposed mechanism made use of a tachyonic resonance channel which leads to the exponential amplification of infrared modes. Here, we first investigate a possible narrow band parametric resonance channel which can produce photons at higher frequencies. Secondly, we estimate the effects of back-reaction on terminating the resonance. We find that there is indeed a narrow resonance channel. It is characterized by a Floquet exponent which is slightly smaller than the corresponding exponent for the tachyonic resonance. However, there is a region of parameter space (corresponding to a very small coupling constant) for which the tachyonic resonance is ineffective. In this case, the narrow resonance will dominate, and it will still be sufficiently strong to generate the observed magnetic fields on cosmological scales. Our analytical treatment of the back-reaction effects considered here indicates that a fraction of order one of the initial dark matter density can flow into the gauge fields. Hence, our magnetogenesis scenario appears to be robust to back-reaction effects."

Machine learning models like KRR for stiffness and XGBoost for durability and vibration achieved strong predictive accuracy, reducing the reliance on computationally intensive FEM simulations. Optimization using Particle Swarm Optimization and Bayesian Optimization further enabled extensive performance refinement. The resulting designs demonstrate 53% stiffness tunability, up to 50% durability improvement, and 43% reduction in vibration compared to the baseline. PSO provided fast, targeted convergence, while Bayesian Optimization effectively explored multi objective tradeoffs.

Although existing MER approaches have achieved promising results, they still struggle with inherent multimodal heterogeneities and varying contributions from different modalities. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework, Decoupled Hierarchical Multimodal Distillation (DHMD). DHMD decouples each modality's features into modality-irrelevant (homogeneous) and modality-exclusive (heterogeneous) components using a self-regression mechanism. The framework employs a two-stage knowledge distillation (KD) strategy: (1) coarse-grained KD via a Graph Distillation Unit (GD-Unit) in each decoupled feature space, where a dynamic graph facilitates adaptive distillation among modalities, and (2) fine-grained KD through a cross-modal dictionary matching mechanism, which aligns semantic granularities across modalities to produce more discriminative MER representations. This hierarchical distillation approach enables flexible knowledge transfer and effectively improves cross-modal feature alignment. Experimental results demonstrate that DHMD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art MER methods, achieving 1.3\\%/2.4\\% (ACC$_7$), 1.3\\%/1.9\\% (ACC$_2$) and 1.9\\%/1.8\\% (F1) relative improvement on CMU-MOSI/CMU-MOSEI dataset, respectively.

However, existing VLM-based approaches still face challenges, including suboptimal lane perception, language understanding biases, and difficulties in handling corner cases. To address these issues, we propose AppleVLM, an advanced perception and planning-enhanced VLM model for robust end-to-end driving. AppleVLM introduces a novel vision encoder and a planning strategy encoder to improve perception and decision-making. Firstly, the vision encoder fuses spatial-temporal information from multi-view images across multiple timesteps using a deformable transformer mechanism, enhancing robustness to camera variations and facilitating scalable deployment across different vehicle platforms. Secondly, unlike traditional VLM-based approaches, AppleVLM introduces a dedicated planning modality that encodes explicit Bird's-Eye-View spatial information, mitigating language biases in navigation instructions. Finally, a VLM decoder fine-tuned by a hierarchical Chain-of-Thought integrates vision, language, and planning features to output robust driving waypoints. We evaluate AppleVLM in closed-loop experiments on two CARLA benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art driving performance.

To address this limitation, we propose Agentic Verifier, an execution-based agent that actively reasons about program behaviors and searches for highly discriminative test inputs that expose behavioral discrepancies among candidate solutions. Through multi-turn interaction with code execution environments, the verifier iteratively refines the candidate input generator and produces targeted counterexamples rather than blindly sampling inputs. We train the verifier to acquire this discriminative input generation capability via a scalable pipeline combining large-scale data synthesis, rejection fine-tuning, and agentic reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments across five competitive programming benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements over strong execution-based baselines, achieving up to +10-15% absolute gains in Best@K accuracy. Further analysis reveals clear test-time scaling behavior and highlights the verifier's broader potential beyond reranking."

    "abstract": "Continual learning (or class incremental learning) is a realistic learning scenario for computer vision systems, where deep neural networks are trained on episodic data, and the data from previous episodes are generally inaccessible to the model. Existing research in this domain has primarily focused on avoiding catastrophic forgetting, which occurs due to the continuously changing class distributions in each episode and the inaccessibility of the data from previous episodes. However, these methods assume that all the training samples in every episode are annotated; this not only incurs a huge annotation cost, but also results in a wastage of annotation effort, since most of the samples in a given episode will not be accessible to the model in subsequent episodes. Active learning algorithms identify the salient and informative samples from large amounts of unlabeled data and are instrumental in reducing the human annotation effort in inducing a deep neural network. In this paper, we propose ACIL, a novel active learning framework for class incremental learning settings. We exploit a criterion based on uncertainty and diversity to identify the exemplar samples that need to be annotated in each episode, and will be appended to the data in the next episode. Such a framework can drastically reduce annotation cost and can also avoid catastrophic forgetting. Our extensive empirical analyses on several vision datasets corroborate the promise and potential of our framework against relevant baselines."

Here we demonstrate piezomagnetic control of electronic transport in nano-devices of the vdW antiferromagnets CoNb$_3$S$_6$ and CoTa$_3$S$_6$, archetypal vdW metals with BTRS that exhibit a spontaneous Hall effect. Applying uniaxial strain linearly modulates both the antiferromagnetic transition temperature and coercive field, consistent with strain-driven tuning of exchange coupling, key signatures of the piezomagnetic effect. Moreover, spontaneous Hall effect is controllable via strain, evidencing piezomagnetic tuning of Berry curvature and its associated geometric transport. These findings establish piezomagnetism as a powerful route to manipulate antiferromagnetic transport, opening avenues for straintronic and spintronic applications in vdW magnetic systems."

    "abstract": "Achieving highly accurate and real-time 3D occupancy prediction from cameras is a critical requirement for the safe and practical deployment of autonomous vehicles. While this shift to sparse 3D representations solves the encoding bottleneck, it creates a new challenge for the decoder: how to efficiently aggregate information from a sparse, non-uniformly distributed set of voxel features without resorting to computationally prohibitive dense attention. In this paper, we propose a novel Prototype-based Sparse Transformer Decoder that replaces this costly interaction with an efficient, two-stage process of guided feature selection and focused aggregation. Our core idea is to make the decoder's attention prototype-guided. We achieve this through a sparse prototype selection mechanism, where each query adaptively identifies a compact set of the most salient voxel features, termed prototypes, for focused feature aggregation. To ensure this dynamic selection is stable and effective, we introduce a complementary denoising paradigm. This approach leverages ground-truth masks to provide explicit guidance, guaranteeing a consistent query-prototype association across decoder layers. Our model, dubbed SPOT-Occ, outperforms previous methods with a significant margin in speed while also improving accuracy. Source code is released at https://github.com/chensuzeyu/SpotOcc."

    "abstract": "We propose a new approach to perform the boosted difference of convex functions algorithm (BDCA) on non-smooth and non-convex problems involving the difference of convex (DC) functions. The recently proposed BDCA uses an extrapolation step from the point computed by the classical DC algorithm (DCA) via a line search procedure in a descent direction to get an additional decrease of the objective function and accelerate the convergence of DCA. However, when the first function in DC decomposition is non-smooth, the direction computed by BDCA can be ascent and a monotone line search cannot be performed. In this work, we proposed a monotone improved boosted difference of convex functions algorithm (IBDCA) for certain types of non-smooth DC programs, namely those that can be formulated as the difference of a possibly non-smooth function and a smooth one. We show that any cluster point of the sequence generated by IBDCA is a critical point of the problem under consideration and that the corresponding objective value is monotonically decreasing and convergent. We also present the global convergence and the convergent rate under the Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz property. The applications of IBDCA in image recovery show the effectiveness of our proposed method. The corresponding numerical experiments demonstrate that our IBDCA outperforms DCA and other state-of-the-art DC methods in both computational time and number of iterations."

    "abstract": "Certifying neural network robustness against adversarial examples is challenging, as formal guarantees often require solving non-convex problems. Hence, incomplete verifiers are widely used because they scale efficiently and substantially reduce the cost of robustness verification compared to complete methods. However, relying on a single verifier can underestimate robustness because of loose approximations or misalignment with training methods. In this work, we propose Cascading Robustness Verification (CRV), which goes beyond an engineering improvement by exposing fundamental limitations of existing robustness metric and introducing a framework that enhances both reliability and efficiency. CRV is a model-agnostic verifier, meaning that its robustness guarantees are independent of the model's training process. The key insight behind the CRV framework is that, when using multiple verification methods, an input is certifiably robust if at least one method certifies it as robust. Rather than relying solely on a single verifier with a fixed constraint set, CRV progressively applies multiple verifiers to balance the tightness of the bound and computational cost. Starting with the least expensive method, CRV halts as soon as an input is certified as robust; otherwise, it proceeds to more expensive methods. For computationally expensive methods, we introduce a Stepwise Relaxation Algorithm (SR) that incrementally adds constraints and checks for certification at each step, thereby avoiding unnecessary computation. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that CRV achieves equal or higher verified accuracy compared to powerful but computationally expensive incomplete verifiers in the cascade, while significantly reducing verification overhead. Empirical results confirm that CRV certifies at least as many inputs as benchmark approaches, while improving runtime efficiency by up to ~90%."

    "abstract": "Agentic coding -- software development workflows in which autonomous coding agents plan, implement, and submit code changes with minimal human involvement -- is rapidly gaining traction. Prior work has shown that Pull Requests (PRs) produced using coding agents (Agentic-PRs) are accepted less often than PRs that are not labeled as agentic (Human-PRs). The rejection reasons for a single agent (Claude Code) have been explored, but a comparison of how rejection reasons differ between Agentic-PRs generated by different agents has not yet been performed. This comparison is important since different coding agents are often used for different purposes, which can lead to agent-specific failure patterns. In this paper, we inspect 654 rejected PRs from the AIDev dataset covering five coding agents, as well as a human baseline. Our results show that seven rejection modes occur only in Agentic-PRs, including distrust of AI-generated code. We also observe agent-specific patterns (e.g., automated withdrawal of inactive PRs by Devin), reflecting differences in how agents are configured and used in practice. Notably, a large proportion of rejected PRs (67.9%) lack explicit reviewer feedback, making their rejection reasons difficult to determine. To mitigate this issue, we propose a set of heuristics that reduce the proportion of such cases, offering a practical preprocessing step for future studies of PR rejection in agentic coding."

In particular, while algorithms are designed to guide them to deliberately refuse harmful prompts with safe reasoning, this process often fails to generalize against diverse and complex jailbreak attacks. In this work, we attribute these failures to the generalization of the safe reasoning process, particularly their insufficiency against complex attack prompts. We provide both theoretical and empirical evidence to show the necessity of a more sufficient safe reasoning process to defend against advanced attack prompts. Building on this insight, we propose a Risk-Aware Preference Optimization (RAPO) framework that enables LRM to adaptively identify and address the safety risks with appropriate granularity in its thinking content. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RAPO successfully generalizes multiple LRMs' safe reasoning adaptively across diverse attack prompts whilst preserving general utility, contributing a robust alignment technique for LRM safety.

    "abstract": "Recent video generation models largely rely on video autoencoders that compress pixel-space videos into latent representations. However, existing video autoencoders suffer from three major limitations: (1) fixed-rate compression that wastes tokens on simple videos, (2) inflexible CNN architectures that prevent variable-length latent modeling, and (3) deterministic decoders that struggle to recover appropriate details from compressed latents. To address these issues, we propose One-Dimensional Diffusion Video Autoencoder (One-DVA), a transformer-based framework for adaptive 1D encoding and diffusion-based decoding. The encoder employs query-based vision transformers to extract spatiotemporal features and produce latent representations, while a variable-length dropout mechanism dynamically adjusts the latent length. The decoder is a pixel-space diffusion transformer that reconstructs videos with the latents as input conditions. With a two-stage training strategy, One-DVA achieves performance comparable to 3D-CNN VAEs on reconstruction metrics at identical compression ratios. More importantly, it supports adaptive compression and thus can achieve higher compression ratios. To better support downstream latent generation, we further regularize the One-DVA latent distribution for generative modeling and fine-tune its decoder to mitigate artifacts caused by the generation process."

Although protocol-compliant and nonmalicious, these events introduce transient forwarding disruptions of approximately 2-4 seconds duration that degrade realtime streaming (voice and video) services while remaining largely undetected by conventional security monitoring.

To lower the barrier of teaching AI agents, we propose Interactive Policy Restructuring and Training (InterPReT), which takes user instructions to continually update the policy structure and optimize its parameters to fit user demonstrations. This enables end-users to interactively give instructions and demonstrations, monitor the agent's performance, and review the agent's decision-making strategies. A user study (N=34) on teaching an AI agent to drive in a racing game confirms that our approach yields more robust policies without impairing system usability, compared to a generic imitation learning baseline, when a layperson is responsible for both giving demonstrations and determining when to stop. This shows that our method is more suitable for end-users without much technical background in machine learning to train a dependable policy"

We prove that there does not exist any pure bubble type II blow up solutions. In other words, the free wave part is never zero in the soliton resolution of type II blow-up solutions, regardless of the bubble number."

We show that scan order critically affects performance by altering spatial adjacency, fracturing object continuity, and amplifying degradation under geometric transformations such as rotation. We present Partial RIng Scan Mamba (PRISMamba), a rotation-robust traversal that partitions an image into concentric rings, performs order-agnostic aggregation within each ring, and propagates context across rings through a set of short radial SSMs. Efficiency is further improved via partial channel filtering, which routes only the most informative channels through the recurrent ring pathway while keeping the rest on a lightweight residual branch. On ImageNet-1K, PRISMamba achieves 84.5% Top-1 with 3.9G FLOPs and 3,054 img/s on A100, outperforming VMamba in both accuracy and throughput while requiring fewer FLOPs. It also maintains performance under rotation, whereas fixed-path scans drop by 1~2%.

However, the response of radial flow, including its $p_T$-differential structure $v_0(p_T)$ and longitudinal fluctuations $v_0(η)$, to intrinsic nuclear deformation remains unexplored. Using realistic $(3+1)$-dimensional viscous hydrodynamic calculations with Trento-3D initial conditions, we investigate how nuclear deformation affects the differential radial flow. We observe a clear, positive correlation between quadrupole deformation $β_2$ and radial flow: both magnitudes of $v_0$ and $v_0(p_T)$ are enhanced in central collisions when $β_2$ is increased. In contrast, the Pearson coefficient $ρ(n(p_T), [p_T])$ exhibits a universal step-like behavior across all collision systems and centralities. Further analysis of longitudinal decorrelation of radial flow reveals a rich structure: in central collisions, large $β_2$ tends to suppress the decorrelation, whereas hexadecapole deformation $β_4$ tends to enhance it. Such decorrelation effect increases toward peripheral collisions. Our results demonstrate that precise measurements of radial flow, spanning transverse momentum and longitudinal dependences, can provide powerful, complementary constraints on nuclear deformation in high-energy nucleus-nucleus collisions."

Across stochastic PDE operator learning benchmarks, DLL improves generalization and uncertainty-aware prediction.

In the literature, it is well-known that the discounting function plays a major role in characterizing time preferences of an agent, which an exponential discount factor cannot fully capture. Building on this insight, we propose a novel framework that supports flexible discounting of future rewards and optimization of risk measures in distributional RL. We provide a technical analysis of the optimality of our algorithms, show that our multi-horizon extension fixes issues raised with existing methodologies, and validate the robustness of our methods through extensive experiments. Our results highlight that discounting is a cornerstone in decision-making problems for capturing more expressive temporal and risk preferences profiles, with potential implications for real-world safety-critical applications."

    "abstract": "Semi-dual neural optimal transport learns a transport map via a max-min objective, yet training can converge to incorrect or degenerate maps. We fully characterize these spurious solutions in the common regime where data concentrate on low-dimensional manifold: the objective is underconstrained off the data manifold, while the on-manifold transport signal remains identifiable. Following Choi, Choi, and Kwon (2025), we study additive-noise smoothing as a remedy and prove new map recovery guarantees as the noise vanishes. Our main practical contribution is a computable terminal noise level $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{stat}}(N)$ that attains the optimal statistical rate, with scaling governed by the intrinsic dimension $m$ of the data. The formula arises from a theoretical unified analysis of (i) quantitative stability of optimal plans, (ii) smoothing-induced bias, and (iii) finite-sample error, yielding rates that depend on $m$ rather than the ambient dimension. Finally, we show that the reduced semi-dual objective becomes increasingly ill-conditioned as $\\varepsilon \\downarrow 0$. This provides a principled stopping rule: annealing below $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{stat}}(N)$ can $\\textit{worsen}$ optimization conditioning without improving statistical accuracy."

In our approach, the sampling of training data formally corresponds to an encoding process, and the model construction to a decoding process. By leveraging finite blocklength analysis, we derive lower bounds on sample complexity and generalization error for a fixed randomized learning algorithm and its associated optimal sampling strategy. Our bounds explicitly characterize the degree of overfitting of the learning algorithm and the mismatch between its inductive bias and the task as distinct terms. This separation provides a significant advantage over existing frameworks. Additionally, we decompose the overfitting term to show its theoretical connection to existing metrics found in information-theoretic bounds and stability theory, unifying these perspectives under our proposed framework."

Existing deep learning methods either fail to capture long-range spectral dependencies (e.g., convolutional neural networks) or suffer from high computational cost (e.g., Transformers). To address these challenges, we propose DMS2F-HAD, a novel dual-branch Mamba-based model. Our architecture utilizes Mamba's linear-time modeling to efficiently learn distinct spatial and spectral features in specialized branches, which are then integrated by a dynamic gated fusion mechanism to enhance anomaly localization. Across fourteen benchmark HSI datasets, our proposed DMS2F-HAD not only achieves a state-of-the-art average AUC of 98.78%, but also demonstrates superior efficiency with an inference speed 4.6 times faster than comparable deep learning methods. The results highlight DMS2FHAD's strong generalization and scalability, positioning it as a strong candidate for practical HAD applications."

    "abstract": "Standard decoding in Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs) is hindered by context rigidity: tokens are retained based on transient high confidence, often ignoring that early predictions lack full context. This creates cascade effects where initial inconsistencies misguide the remaining generation. Existing revision strategies attempt to mitigate this by relying on static confidence scores, but these signals are inherently myopic; inconsistent tokens can appear confident to the model itself. We propose Context-Robust Remasking (CoRe), a training-free framework for inference-time revision. Rather than trusting static token probabilities, CoRe identifies context-brittle tokens by probing their sensitivity to targeted masked-context perturbations. We formalize revision as a robust optimization objective over context shifts and efficiently approximate this objective to prioritize unstable tokens for revision. On LLaDA-8B-Base, CoRe delivers consistent improvements across reasoning and code benchmarks, outperforming compute-matched baselines and improving MBPP by up to 9.2 percentage points."

However, concept annotations are expensive to obtain and rarely available at scale within a single data source. Federated learning (FL) could alleviate this limitation by enabling cross-institutional training that leverages concept annotations distributed across multiple data owners. Yet, FL lacks interpretable modeling paradigms. Integrating CMs with FL is non-trivial: CMs assume a fixed concept space and a predefined model architecture, whereas real-world FL is heterogeneous and non-stationary, with institutions joining over time and bringing new supervision. In this work, we propose Federated Concept-based Models (F-CMs), a new methodology for deploying CMs in evolving FL settings. F-CMs aggregate concept-level information across institutions and efficiently adapt the model architecture in response to changes in the available concept supervision, while preserving institutional privacy. Empirically, F-CMs preserve the accuracy and intervention effectiveness of training settings with full concept supervision, while outperforming non-adaptive federated baselines. Notably, F-CMs enable interpretable inference on concepts not available to a given institution, a key novelty with respect to existing approaches."

Existing proxy metrics focus on the representation's capacity to capture narrow aspects of the visual world, like object shape, limiting generalization across environments. In this paper, we take an analytical perspective: we probe pretrained visual encoders by measuring how well they support decoding of environment state -- including geometry, object structure, and physical attributes -- from images. Leveraging simulation environments with access to ground-truth state, we show that this probing accuracy strongly correlates with downstream policy performance across diverse environments and learning settings, significantly outperforming prior metrics and enabling efficient representation selection. More broadly, our study provides insight into the representational properties that support generalizable manipulation, suggesting that learning to encode the latent physical state of the environment is a promising objective for control."

However, existing results focus exclusively on unimodal data; in contrast, the theoretical underpinnings of in-context learning for multi-modal data remain poorly understood. We introduce a mathematically tractable framework for studying multi-modal learning and explore when transformer-like architectures can recover Bayes-optimal performance in-context. To model multi-modal problems, we assume the observed data arises from a latent factor model. Our first result comprises a negative take on expressibility: we prove that single-layer, linear self-attention fails to recover the Bayes-optimal predictor uniformly over the task distribution. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel, linearized cross-attention mechanism, which we study in the regime where both the number of cross-attention layers and the context length are large. We show that this cross-attention mechanism is provably Bayes optimal when optimized using gradient flow. Our results underscore the benefits of depth for in-context learning and establish the provable utility of cross-attention for multi-modal distributions."

Using Scopus article, the study analyses Relative Intensity of Collaboration (RIC) among EU member state, candidate countries and China, Latin America, the UK, the USA and Russia. Findings indicate increasing integration within European groups and with global partners, yet persistent hierarchical structures remain. EU-14 countries form the core of the network, exhibiting stable and cohesive collaboration, including with the UK despite Brexit. EU-13 countries occupy an intermediate position, showing moderate collaboration with EU-14 but stronger collaboration within their own group, with EU candidate countries and Russia. EU candidate countries demonstrate even weaker integration with EU-14, focusing on intra-group ties and links with EU-13 and Russia. RIC peaks in 2012 and 2018 for EU-13 and EU candidate countries correspond to Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe cycles, highlighting the role of EU Framework Programmes. Collaboration with Russia increased following 2014 and only marginally declined after 2022. For EU-14, it exceeds collaboration with the USA. Collaboration with China remains limited due to network and cultural constraints, with similar intensity across all three groups. Overall, funding and policy initiatives are critical for stable international collaboration."

Specifically, we identify the minimal improvements required beyond the state-of-the-art to achieve an end-to-end expected teleportation fidelity of $2/3$, which represents the classical limit. To this end, we formulate the hardware requirements computation as optimisation problems, where the hardware parameters representing the underlying device capabilities serve as decision variables. Assuming a simplified noise model, we derive closed-form analytical expressions for the teleportation fidelity and rate when the network is realised using heterogeneous quantum hardware, including a quantum repeater chain with a memory cut-off. Our derivations are based on events defined by the order statistics of link generation durations in both the metropolitan networks and the backbone, and the resulting expressions are validated through simulations on the NetSquid platform. The analytical expressions facilitate efficient exploration of the optimisation parameter space without resorting to computationally intensive simulations. We then apply this framework to a representative realisation in which the metropolitan nodes are based on trapped-ion processors and the backbone is composed of ensemble-based quantum memories. Our results suggest that teleportation across metropolitan distances is already achievable with state-of-the-art hardware when the data qubit is prepared after end-to-end entanglement has already been established, whereas extending teleportation to intercity scales requires additional, though plausibly achievable, improvements in hardware performance."

In this work, we introduce a novel benchmark suite for CRL based on realistically simulated robots in the Gazebo simulator. Our Continual Robotic Simulation Suite (CRoSS) benchmarks rely on two robotic platforms: a two-wheeled differential-drive robot with lidar, camera and bumper sensor, and a robotic arm with seven joints. The former represent an agent in line-following and object-pushing scenarios, where variation of visual and structural parameters yields a large number of distinct tasks, whereas the latter is used in two goal-reaching scenarios with high-level cartesian hand position control (modeled after the Continual World benchmark), and low-level control based on joint angles. For the robotic arm benchmarks, we provide additional kinematics-only variants that bypass the need for physical simulation (as long as no sensor readings are required), and which can be run two orders of magnitude faster. CRoSS is designed to be easily extensible and enables controlled studies of continual reinforcement learning in robotic settings with high physical realism, and in particular allow the use of almost arbitrary simulated sensors. To ensure reproducibility and ease of use, we provide a containerized setup (Apptainer) that runs out-of-the-box, and report performances of standard RL algorithms, including Deep Q-Networks (DQN) and policy gradient methods. This highlights the suitability as a scalable and reproducible benchmark for CRL research."

Our main result states robust mathematical statements resembling the classical Kupka-Smale Theorem in the sense that we establish the openness and density of a large class of PSVFs presenting generic and quasi-generic singularities.

This study provides a comprehensive real- and momentum-space analysis of topological phases in two-dimensional d-wave altermagnets. By employing a tight-binding Hamiltonian, we characterize the topological phase transition occurring at a critical intra-sublattice hopping strength ($t_a^C$). We examine the emergence of Dirac nodal points and the resulting Berry curvature singularities, supported by a visual analysis of pseudospin texture winding. Crucially, we analize spin splitting, effective altermagnetic strength, and investigate the transport implications of these phases, uncovering giant conductivity anisotropy and spin-dependent \"steering\" effects driven by group velocity distribution across the Fermi surface. Beyond bulk properties, we analyze the edge state topology in ribbon geometries through the lens of information-theoretic markers like fidelity-susceptibility and inverse participation ratio, offering an alternative to traditional Chern number calculations. Our results demonstrate that the hybridization of edge states in ultra-narrow nanoribbons opens a controllable energy gap, a feature we exploit to propose a novel topological altermagnetic field-effect transistor design where ballistic and spatially spin-polarized transport can be electrostatically gated. This work establishes a theoretical and information-theoretic framework for \"edgetronics\" in altermagnetic materials, paving the way for next-generation, high-speed spintronic and \"spin-splitter\" logic devices and architectures."

On Mystery Blocksworld - a semantically obfuscated planning domain - we find that QwQ-32B gradually improves its internal representation of actions and concepts during reasoning. The model develops abstract encodings that focus on structure rather than specific action names. Through steering experiments, we establish causal evidence that these adaptations improve problem solving: injecting refined representations from successful traces boosts accuracy, while symbolic representations can replace many obfuscated encodings with minimal performance loss.

This paper presents a machine learning-based model for automated classification of nail diseases based on a publicly available dataset, which contains 3,835 images scaling six categories.

Among these, InceptionV3 outperformed the others with an accuracy of 95.57%, while DenseNet201 came next with 94.79%. To make the model stronger and less likely to make mistakes on tricky or noisy images, we used adversarial training.

In this paper we examine the orbital elements of particles in the restricted three-body problem prior to and post scattering onto hyperbolic trajectories by massive perturbers. Building on previous work, we calculate closed-form -- but approximate -- analytic criteria that map pre- to post-encounter orbital elements. An application of these equations demonstrates that ejection occurs most efficiently when the orbital eccentricity of the massless test particle exceeds a minimum threshold, $e\\gtrsim0.4$. The primary driver of the final eccentricity is the component of the perturber-centric velocity projected along the direction of motion of the perturber. These analytic criteria are then benchmarked and validated against numerical simulations which demonstrate that they provide a reasonably good zeroth-order approximation for ejection behavior. However, system-specific cases will generally require numerical simulations in addition to this analytic construction. The methodology is applied to (i) the solar system and exoplanetary systems (ii) $β$ Pictoris and (iii) HR 8799 to evaluate the pre-scattering orbits of ejected particles. This method provides a transparent and computationally efficient tool for identifying orbits within a given system from which interstellar objects are efficiently ejected via a single scattering event from a massive perturber."

Our results show that DUNE achieves a $5σ$ determination of the neutrino mass ordering for a supernova at distances of $\\sim 20$~kpc for the $ν_e$ charged current channel and $\\sim 2$~kpc for the $\\barν_e$ channel, with the reach depending on the entanglement scenario considered. These results demonstrate that entanglement based observables provide a complementary and robust framework for probing supernova neutrino oscillations and the neutrino mass ordering."

    "abstract": "A controller -- a software module managing hardware behavior -- is a key component of a typical robot system. While control theory gives safety guarantees for standard controller designs, the practical implementation of controllers in software introduces complexities that are often overlooked. Controllers are often designed in continuous space, while the software is executed in discrete space, undermining some of the theoretical guarantees. Despite extensive research on control theory and control modeling, little attention has been paid to the implementations of controllers and how their theoretical guarantees are ensured in real-world software systems. We investigate 184 real-world controller implementations in open-source robot software. We examine their application context, the implementation characteristics, and the testing methods employed to ensure correctness. We find that the implementations often handle discretization in an ad hoc manner, leading to potential issues with real-time reliability. Challenges such as timing inconsistencies, lack of proper error handling, and inadequate consideration of real-time constraints further complicate matters. Testing practices are superficial, no systematic verification of theoretical guarantees is used, leaving possible inconsistencies between expected and actual behavior. Our findings highlight the need for improved implementation guidelines and rigorous verification techniques to ensure the reliability and safety of robotic controllers in practice."

    "abstract": "Neutron-skin thicknesses provide a sensitive probe of the isovector sector of the nuclear equation of state and its density dependence, commonly characterized by the symmetry-energy slope parameter L. A wide variety of experimental and observational methods have been used to extract neutron skins, ranging from hadronic and electromagnetic probes of finite nuclei to inferences from neutron-star observations. Each approach carries distinct theoretical and systematic uncertainties, complicating global interpretations and obscuring genuine physical trends. In this work we present a hierarchical Bayesian framework for the statistically consistent synthesis of heterogeneous neutron-skin constraints. The neutron-skin thickness is modeled as a smooth latent function of isospin asymmetry and nuclear size, while method-dependent bias parameters and intrinsic nuisance widths are introduced to account for unmodeled experimental and theoretical systematics. Focusing on the tin isotopes, we infer probabilistic neutron-skin trends from 100Sn to 140Sn, finding minimal uncertainties near stability and increasing uncertainties toward the proton-rich and neutron-rich extremes. We assess the consistency of nuclear energy-density functionals and obtain conditional constraints on the symmetry-energy parameters. The resulting posterior exhibits a pronounced compression of the symmetry-energy slope parameter L, reflecting the dominant sensitivity of neutron skins to sub-saturation symmetry pressure. We demonstrate that our hierarchical Bayesian framework provides robust and transparent constraints on the sub-saturation isovector sector of the nuclear equation of state."

While existing sparse attention solutions have shown promise on bidirectional models, we identify that applying these solutions to AR models leads to considerable performance degradation for two reasons: isolated consideration of chunk generation and insufficient utilization of past informative context. Motivated by these observations, we propose \\textsc{Light Forcing}, the \\textit{first} sparse attention solution tailored for AR video generation models. It incorporates a \\textit{Chunk-Aware Growth} mechanism to quantitatively estimate the contribution of each chunk, which determines their sparsity allocation. This progressive sparsity increase strategy enables the current chunk to inherit prior knowledge in earlier chunks during generation. Additionally, we introduce a \\textit{Hierarchical Sparse Attention} to capture informative historical and local context in a coarse-to-fine manner. Such two-level mask selection strategy (\\ie, frame and block level) can adaptively handle diverse attention patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing sparse attention in quality (\\eg, 84.5 on VBench) and efficiency (\\eg, $1.2{\\sim}1.3\\times$ end-to-end speedup). Combined with FP8 quantization and LightVAE, \\textsc{Light Forcing} further achieves a $2.3\\times$ speedup and 19.7\\,FPS on an RTX~5090 GPU.

Limited by the scarcity of observations, tabular datasets often exhibit critical deficiencies, such as class imbalance, selection bias, and low fidelity. To address these challenges, building on recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), this paper introduces Team-then-Trim (T$^2$), a framework that synthesizes high-quality tabular data through a collaborative team of LLMs, followed by a rigorous three-stage plug-in data quality control (QC) pipeline. In T$^2$, tabular data generation is conceptualized as a manufacturing process: specialized LLMs, guided by domain knowledge, are tasked with generating different data components sequentially, and the resulting products, i.e., the synthetic data, are systematically evaluated across multiple dimensions of QC. Empirical results on both simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate that T$^2$ outperforms state-of-the-art methods in producing high-quality tabular data, highlighting its potential to support downstream models when direct data collection is practically infeasible."

    "abstract": "Automatic speech recognition (ASR) for conversational speech remains challenging due to the limited availability of large-scale, well-annotated multi-speaker dialogue data and the complex temporal dynamics of natural interactions. Speaker-aware simulated conversations (SASC) offer an effective data augmentation strategy by transforming single-speaker recordings into realistic multi-speaker dialogues. However, prior work has primarily focused on English data, leaving questions about the applicability to lower-resource languages. In this paper, we adapt and implement the SASC framework for Hungarian conversational ASR. We further propose C-SASC, an extended variant that incorporates pause modeling conditioned on utterance duration, enabling a more faithful representation of local temporal dependencies observed in human conversation while retaining the simplicity and efficiency of the original approach. We generate synthetic Hungarian dialogues from the BEA-Large corpus and combine them with real conversational data for ASR training. Both SASC and C-SASC are evaluated extensively under a wide range of simulation configurations, using conversational statistics derived from CallHome, BEA-Dialogue, and GRASS corpora. Experimental results show that speaker-aware conversational simulation consistently improves recognition performance over naive concatenation-based augmentation. While the additional duration conditioning in C-SASC yields modest but systematic gains--most notably in character-level error rates--its effectiveness depends on the match between source conversational statistics and the target domain. Overall, our findings confirm the robustness of speaker-aware conversational simulation for Hungarian ASR and highlight the benefits and limitations of increasingly detailed temporal modeling in synthetic dialogue generation."

We introduce a drifting field that governs the sample movement and achieves equilibrium when the distributions match. This leads to a training objective that allows the neural network optimizer to evolve the distribution. In experiments, our one-step generator achieves state-of-the-art results on ImageNet at 256 x 256 resolution, with an FID of 1.54 in latent space and 1.61 in pixel space.

The resulting classification of multipartite states captures their experimental cost: creating a k-partite entangled state requires at least k-1 two-particle entangling gates. Further, we analytically calculate the newly defined k-partite entanglement of formation, which generalizes an important bipartite entanglement measure, in several classes of states, including the W states of any dimension."

A single simulation can generate tremendous data volumes, often forcing researchers to discard valuable information. A prime example of this is plasma turbulence described by the gyrokinetic equations: nonlinear, multiscale, and 5D in phase space. It constitutes one of the most computationally demanding frontiers of modern science, with runs taking weeks and yielding tens of terabytes of data dumps.The increasing storage demands underscore the importance of compression. However, reconstructed snapshots do not necessarily preserve essential physical quantities. We present a spatiotemporal evaluation pipeline, accounting for structural phenomena and multi-scale transient fluctuations to assess the degree of physical fidelity. Indeed, we find that various compression techniques lack preservation of both spatial mode structure and temporal turbulence characteristics. Therefore, we explore Physics-Informed Neural Compression (PINC), which incorporates physics-informed losses tailored to gyrokinetics and enables extreme compressions ratios of over 70,000x. Entropy coding on top of PINC further pushes it to 120,000x. This direction provides a viable and scalable solution to the prohibitive storage demands of gyrokinetics, enabling post-hoc analyses that were previously infeasible."

    "abstract": "Multi-source precipitation products (MSPs) from satellite retrievals and reanalysis are widely used for hydroclimatic monitoring, yet spatially heterogeneous biases and limited skill for extremes still constrain their hydrologic utility. Here we develop a dual-stage TransUNet-based multi-source precipitation merging framework (DDL-MSPMF) that integrates six MSPs with four ERA5 near-surface physical predictors. A first-stage classifier estimates daily precipitation occurrence probability, and a second-stage regressor fuses the classifier outputs together with all predictors to estimate daily precipitation amount at 0.25 degree resolution over China for 2001-2020. Benchmarking against multiple deep learning and hybrid baselines shows that the TransUNet - TransUNet configuration yields the best seasonal performance (R = 0.75; RMSE = 2.70 mm/day) and improves robustness relative to a single-regressor setting. For heavy precipitation (>25 mm/day), DDL-MSPMF increases equitable threat scores across most regions of eastern China and better reproduces the spatial pattern of the July 2021 Zhengzhou rainstorm, indicating enhanced extreme-event detection beyond seasonal-mean corrections. Independent evaluation over the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau using TPHiPr further supports its applicability in data-scarce regions. SHAP analysis highlights the importance of precipitation occurrence probabilities and surface pressure, providing physically interpretable diagnostics. The proposed framework offers a scalable and explainable approach for precipitation fusion and extreme-event assessment."

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a suite of rationality measures and associated theory for reinforcement learning agents, a property increasingly critical yet rarely explored. We define an action in deployment to be perfectly rational if it maximises the hidden true value function in the steepest direction. The expected value discrepancy of a policy's actions against their rational counterparts, culminating over the trajectory in deployment, is defined to be expected rational risk; an empirical average version in training is also defined. Their difference, termed as rational risk gap, is decomposed into (1) an extrinsic component caused by environment shifts between training and deployment, and (2) an intrinsic one due to the algorithm's generalisability in a dynamic environment. They are upper bounded by, respectively, (1) the $1$-Wasserstein distance between transition kernels and initial state distributions in training and deployment, and (2) the empirical Rademacher complexity of the value function class. Our theory suggests hypotheses on the benefits from regularisers (including layer normalisation, $\\ell_2$ regularisation, and weight normalisation) and domain randomisation, as well as the harm from environment shifts. Experiments are in full agreement with these hypotheses. The code is available at https://github.com/EVIEHub/Rationality."

Despite rapid progress, existing PPG-based blood pressure estimation models have not consistently achieved the established clinical numerical limits such as AAMI/ISO 81060-2, and prior evaluations often lack the rigorous experimental controls necessary for valid clinical assessment. Moreover, the publicly available datasets commonly used are heterogeneous and lack physiologically controlled conditions for fair benchmarking. To enable fair benchmarking under physiologically controlled conditions, we created a standardized benchmarking subset NBPDB comprising 101,453 high-quality PPG segments from 1,103 healthy adults, derived from MIMIC-III and VitalDB. Using this dataset, we systematically benchmarked several state-of-the-art PPG-based models. The results showed that none of the evaluated models met the AAMI/ISO 81060-2 accuracy requirements (mean error $<$ 5 mmHg and standard deviation $<$ 8 mmHg). To improve model accuracy, we modified these models and added patient demographic data such as age, sex, and body mass index as additional inputs. Our modifications consistently improved performance across all models. In particular, the MInception model reduced error by 23\\% after adding the demographic data and yielded mean absolute errors of 4.75 mmHg (SBP) and 2.90 mmHg (DBP), achieves accuracy comparable to the numerical limits defined by AAMI/ISO accuracy standards.

By proposing a refined analysis on the non-consecutive gradient variation, a fundamental quantity in gradient variation with bandits, we improve the dimension dependence for both convex and strongly convex functions compared with the best known results (Chiang et al., 2013). Our improved analysis for the non-consecutive gradient variation also implies other favorable problem-dependent guarantees, such as gradient-variance and small-loss regrets. Beyond the two-point setup, we demonstrate the versatility of our technique by achieving the first gradient-variation bound for one-point bandit linear optimization over hyper-rectangular domains.

In this work, we combine the angular diameter distance measurements from recent Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) observations with luminosity distances reconstructed from Cosmic Chronometers data of Hubble parameter $H(z)$ using a non-parametric technique, Gaussian Process. A key part of our analysis is the systematic comparison of different BAO measurements (2D BAO, 3D BAO, and 3D DESI BAO) to determine whether any potential tension between angular and anisotropic BAO data affects constraints on the distance duality parameter $η(z)$ and $Ω_{k0}$. We adopt four representative parameterizations of $η(z)$ to examine the correlation between $η(z)$ and $Ω_{k0}$. Our results show no evidence for violation of the CDDR, with $η(z)$ consistent with unity at the 99\\% confidence level for all BAO datasets and parameterizations. In all scenarios, the best-fit values of $Ω_{k0}$ mildly favor a non-flat universe, although a spatially flat universe remains compatible at the 95\\% confidence level. The constraints on $η_1$ and $Ω_{k0}$ indicate slight variations across different BAO datasets, but the discrepancies between the 2D and 3D BAO measurements do not introduce any significant bias, and no statistically meaningful tension is observed.

We leverage broad supervision over egocentric RGB-only data from real-world demonstrations, spatial reasoning question-answering, and simulated environment demonstrations, enabling EgoActor to make robust, context-aware decisions and perform fluent action inference (under 1s) with both 8B and 4B parameter models. Extensive evaluations in both simulated and real-world environments demonstrate that EgoActor effectively bridges abstract task planning and concrete motor execution, while generalizing across diverse tasks and unseen environments."

The QTN solver achieves superior precision ($L_2 \\sim 10^{-7}$) with remarkable near-constant runtime scaling, effectively leveraging entanglement compression to capture shock fronts. In contrast, while the Finite-Difference HSE implementation remains robust, the Spectral HSE method suffers catastrophic numerical instability at high resolutions, diverging significantly at $N=128$. PINNs demonstrate flexibility as mesh-free solvers but stall at lower accuracy tiers ($L_2 \\sim 10^{-1}$), limited by spectral bias compared to grid-based methods. Ultimately, while quantum methods offer novel representational advantages for low-resolution fluid dynamics, this study confirms they currently yield no computational advantage over classical solvers without fault tolerance or significant algorithmic breakthroughs in handling non-linear feedback."

Using zeolite-based SWCNTs prepared by alcohol CVD, absorption and photoluminescence spectroscopy, together with two-dimensional excitation-emission fitting was employed to quantify chirality-specific growth efficiency. Two distinct growth regimes were identified. At a relatively low temperature of 600 C, pure Co exhibits the highest catalytic activity, promoting efficient growth of small-diameter (0.7-0.9 nm) SWCNTs. In contrast, at 850 C, the Fe0.75Co0.25 alloy shows a pronounced enhancement in growth efficiency compared with pure Fe, pure Co, and other Fe-Co compositions, also yielding larger diameter tubes (0.9-1.1nm). Similar growth behavior was observed on SiO2 substrates, enabling detailed transmission electron microscopy analysis of catalyst nanoparticles. Electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy reveal that high SWCNT yields correlate with the formation of small, uniform Fe-Co nanoparticles with Co-enriched surfaces, in excellent agreement with MD simulations. Lastly, MD results are summarized in a composition-diameter phase diagram that rationalizes the experimentally observed growth trends. The exceptional performance of the Fe0.75Co0.25 catalyst at high temperature is attributed to the stabilization of small and uniform catalyst clusters, providing mechanistic insight into the synergistic roles of alloy composition and temperature in SWCNT growth."

We clarify the geometric foundations of this structure by studying general pairs of a $1$-form and a $2$-form under mild regularity conditions. We characterize them through their class, analyse the role of distinguished vector fields, such as Reeb or Liouville fields, and study other associated geometrical objects. Precontact structures are then treated as the special case of pairs formed by a nowhere-vanishing $1$-form and its exterior derivative. We also define Hamiltonian dynamics on precontact manifolds. Several examples are presented to illustrate the theory."

    "abstract": "Low Earth Orbit (LEO) constellations are revolutionizing the space sector, with on-board Artificial Intelligence (AI) becoming pivotal for next-generation satellites. AI acceleration is essential for safety-critical functions such as autonomous Guidance, Navigation, and Control (GNC), where errors cannot be tolerated, and performance-critical processing of high-bandwidth sensor data, where occasional errors are tolerable. Consequently, AI accelerators for satellites must combine robust protection against radiation-induced faults with high throughput. This paper presents Safe-NEureka, a Hybrid Modular Redundant Deep Neural Network (DNN) accelerator for heterogeneous RISC-V systems. It operates in two modes: a redundancy mode utilizing Dual Modular Redundancy (DMR) with hardware-based recovery, and a performance mode repurposing redundant datapaths to maximize parallel throughput. Furthermore, its memory interface is protected by Error Correction Codes (ECCs), and the controller by Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR). Implementation in GlobalFoundries 12nm technology shows a 96 reduction in faulty executions in redundancy mode, with a manageable 15 area overhead. In performance mode, the architecture achieves near-baseline speeds on 3x3 dense convolutions with a 5 throughput and 11 efficiency reduction, compared to 48 and 53 in redundancy mode. This flexibility ensures high overheads are limited to critical tasks, establishing Safe-NEureka as a versatile solution for space applications."

    "abstract": "The explicit description and computation of functions defined on Riemann surfaces of various genera depends on the choice of language: while the Jacobi parametrization is widely known and used, the Schottky uniformization has been proven to provide an alternative approach, useful in particular for (but not limited to) numerical calculations. Despite capturing the geometry of the Riemann surface completely, the two languages are subject to rather different sets of auxiliary symmetries. In this article we translate and compare the symplectic transformations inherent in the Jacobi parametrization to the freedom in choosing Möbius transformations generating the Schottky group for the Schottky uniformization. Our results are aimed at transferring functional relations expressed in the Schottky language to the Jacobi language and vice versa. An immediate application would be the efficient numerical evaluation of special functions in a physics context by favorably tuning the Schottky cover leading to quicker convergence."

    "abstract": "A rotating surface can induce a frequency shift in incident light by changing its angular momentum, a phenomenon known as the rotational Doppler effect. This effect provides a means to estimate the angular velocity of the rotating surface. In this work, we develop a continuous-variable quantum protocol for estimating the angular velocity of a rotating surface via the rotational Doppler effect. Our approach exploits squeezed and displaced Laguerre-Gaussian modes as quantum resources, which interact with a rotating metallic disc with surface roughness. The frequency shift induced by the rotational Doppler effect is then measured using a homodyne detection scheme. By analyzing the Fisher information, we demonstrate that the proposed squeezing-enhanced protocol achieves Heisenberg scaling in the ideal noiseless regime. Furthermore, we investigate the influence of noise and consider different surface models to assess their impact on the protocol's performance. While Heisenberg scaling is degraded in the presence of noise, we show that optimizing the energy allocation ratio between displacement and squeezing of the probe ensures that the quantum strategy consistently outperforms its classical counterpart."

Combining the monotonicity relation with the method of localized potentials, we extend the so called monotonicity method to characterize the support of inhomogeneities in the Lamé parameters and the density in terms of the far field operator."

    "abstract": "Decentralized learning (DL) enables collaborative machine learning (ML) without a central server, making it suitable for settings where training data cannot be centrally hosted. We introduce Mosaic Learning, a DL framework that decomposes models into fragments and disseminates them independently across the network. Fragmentation reduces redundant communication across correlated parameters and enables more diverse information propagation without increasing communication cost. We theoretically show that Mosaic Learning (i) shows state-of-the-art worst-case convergence rate, and (ii) leverages parameter correlation in an ML model, improving contraction by reducing the highest eigenvalue of a simplified system. We empirically evaluate Mosaic Learning on four learning tasks and observe up to 12 percentage points higher node-level test accuracy compared to epidemic learning (EL), a state-of-the-art baseline. In summary, Mosaic Learning improves DL performance without sacrificing its utility or efficiency, and positions itself as a new DL standard."
